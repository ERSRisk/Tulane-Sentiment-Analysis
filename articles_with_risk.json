        "Content": "The Louisiana House of Representatives agreed Tuesday to give wide-ranging legal protections to Louisiana\u2019s nursing homes, approving a bill from the Louisiana Senate that would largely shield the industry from lawsuits despite their consistently low performance in quality measures.\nThe vote on Senate Bill 134 from Sen. Thomas Pressley, R-Shreveport, came after an intense lobbying campaign that pitted the state\u2019s powerful nursing home interests against advocates for the elderly and a handful of attorneys who specialize in cases of elder neglect.\nSupporters of the nursing home industry argued that they could go out of business if they continue to face multimillion-dollar verdicts from lawsuits that allege administrative negligence and improper staffing. But opponents said the state\u2019s nursing homes \u2014 ranked by among the nation\u2019s worst by federal quality measures \u2014 deserve to face massive consequences for intentionally understaffing their facilities and mistreating residents to squeeze profits out of them.\nSome lawmakers tied debate over the bill with a broader movement for tort reform this session, as lawmakers have railed against high auto insurance rates and blamed them on lawsuits against insurance companies.\nNursing homes have long been among the most muscular lobbies at the Capitol: the industry donated more than $1 million to candidates running for the Legislature and statewide offices in the run-up to the 2023 election, a Times-Picayune | The Advocate analysis of campaign finance data shows.\nThe donations came from the Louisiana Nursing Home Association, several nursing homes and their affiliated management companies, political action committees that represent nursing homes and individual nursing home owners and executives. Over the past year, those same groups have showered legislators and statewide officeholders with more than $275,000.\nAhead of this session, nursing home lobbyists held meetings around the state and announced their plans to reintroduce the bill, multiple lawmakers said. The LNHA had pushed a similar version last year, which passed out of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, but never made it to the Senate floor.\nRepresentatives from the LNHA did not respond to a message for this story.\nThis year\u2019s iteration quickly gained momentum, despite testimony from family members of nursing home residents about the poor care their relatives received and the lack of consequences that nursing home administrators have faced. AARP described the bill\u2019s success as the Legislature protecting profits over people, and urged Gov. Jeff Landry to veto the bill.\n\u201cVulnerable older adults and individuals with disabilities who live in Louisiana\u2019s nursing homes have lost their ability to seek justice if they\u2019ve been abused or neglected,\u201d AARP spokesman Andrew Muhl said after the vote. \u201cLouisiana\u2019s nursing homes rank dead last in quality and safety. The conversation to improve our nursing homes is long overdue. Yet, legislators chose not to hold them accountable for the care they provide to our loved ones.\u201d\nState Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, emerged as one of the bill\u2019s most vocal opponents, voting against it in committee both times and testifying against it on the Senate floor this year.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a big supporter of nursing homes in my career in the Senate,\u201d Luneau said in an interview. \u201cBut enough is enough. The greed is overwhelming.\u201d\nHe said the nursing home industry has reacted negatively to his opposition.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not happy with me at all,\u201d Luneau said. \u201cThey\u2019re telling people I\u2019m lying to them or I\u2019m not telling the truth to them. That\u2019s incorrect.\u201d\nCritics of the bill say that it would protect bad actors like Bob Dean, the nursing home owner who sent more than 800 elderly and infirm nursing home residents to a tepid warehouse in 2021 during Hurricane Ida. Dozens were injured and coroners determined five deaths were \u201cstorm-related.\u201d Dean pleaded no contest to criminal charges of cruelty to the infirm, Medicaid fraud and obstruction of justice. The management company for Dean\u2019s nursing home reached a $12 million settlement with patients and their families in a class-action lawsuit.\nBut Pressly and the LNHA have disagreed, saying Dean\u2019s actions were intentional and would not be protected under the change to the law.\nThe bill would require lawsuits against nursing home management companies to go through the state\u2019s Medical Malpractice Act, which caps the payout that a company could be on the hook for. The cap is $500,000, but the individual owner or provider would only pay $100,000, while the state\u2019s Patient's Compensation Trust Fund would make up the rest.\n\u201cBob Dean\u2019s actions were intentional, they were criminal, and they would not fall under the Medical Malpractice Act,\u201d said Pressly in an interview.\nPressly also downplayed the role of the nursing home industry\u2019s campaign contributions in the debate.\n\u201cI have more faith in my colleagues than to say, \u2018someone's giving me a campaign contribution, and therefore, then I'm going to vote with them,\u2019\u201d he said.\nBill sailed through committee hearings\nAs the bill moved through the Legislature, one of its co-authors, state Sen. Alan Seabaugh, went to trial in the exact type of case that the bill seeks to end.\nSeabaugh, a Shreveport Republican, defended a nursing home facing administrative negligence claims from the law firm Garcia and Artigliere in late May in a trial in Bossier. Garcia and Artigliere has staunchly opposed the bill and has recently racked up multimillion-dollar verdicts against nursing home management companies in Louisiana.\nIn the Bossier case, Garcia and Artigliere represented two siblings who alleged that their father\u2019s nursing home was negligent and failed to ensure they had proper staffing levels. The father developed serious pressure sores during his time at the Old Brownlee Community Care Center, they said. The nursing home is owned by CommCare, whose CEO is former Louisiana House Speaker Jim Tucker.\nAfter a trial that lasted nearly two weeks, a jury ruled in favor of the nursing home.\nWhile Garcia and Artigliere were trying their case, lobbyist Alton Ashy tried to prevent the bill from gaining steam at the Capitol. Garcia and Artigliere retained Ashy\u2019s Advanced Strategies as their lobbyist, listing his pay category as between $100,000 and $249,999.\nBut the bill passed through the Louisiana Senate on a 26-11 vote. Among those who supported it: Sen. Patrick McMath, who carried the bill last year, but pulled it before it moved to the Senate floor amid backlash about the Dean case. McMath, R-Covington, said he voted for the bill this year because he\u2019s worried about nursing homes going out of business if they\u2019re forced to pay too many legal verdicts.\nDuring testimony in the House Health and Welfare Committee, Ashy saw the writing on the wall.\n\u201cSome days, you\u2019re the bug and some days, you\u2019re the windshield,\u201d Ashy testified. \u201cI have a feeling today that the patients in the nursing home are going to be somewhat of the bug. The nursing home industry does a very good job at the Legislature.\u201d\nAARP and former Louisiana Department of Health Secretary Kathy Kliebert joined the opposition, along with families of nursing home patients.\n\u201cNursing home owners are very aware that if their lack of proper care causes harm or death, it may result in legal action,\u201d said Kliebert, now a volunteer advocate for the elderly. \u201cAnd because of that, they\u2019ve always made at least an effort to provide the bare minimum of care. But if this law passes, that will be gone.\u201d\nState Rep. Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport, pushed back. He said that if lawsuits were effective deterrents at preventing bad care, Louisiana\u2019s nursing homes should have improved performance ratings.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear how a lawsuit makes care any better,\u201d Jackson said.\nNobody on the committee voted against the bill.\n'What's the right thing?'\nThe bill had a false start once it reached the House floor.\nIt went up for debate Monday, carried on the house side by Rep. Michael Melerine, who works at the same law firm as Seabaugh. Melerine, also a Shreveport Republican, told the House that the bill simply sought to clarify existing language from 2003 that lumped management companies under the state\u2019s Medical Malpractice Act.\nBut State Rep. Stephanie Hilferty, a Metairie Republican, quickly introduced an amendment that would only grant lawsuit protections to nursing homes that ranked at least average \u2014 or three stars \u2014 on federal quality measures. The majority of Louisiana\u2019s nursing homes are one-star and two-star facilities.\nAs she and Rep. Tony Bacala, R-Prairieville, discussed consistently poor performance in the state\u2019s nursing homes, House Speaker Phillip DeVillier pulled the bill from the floor.\nThe floor debate resumed Tuesday, while Seabaugh and state Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, roamed the chamber talking to colleagues. Hensgens is a nursing home administrator and partial owner.\nHilferty again sought to amend the bill, saying she had concerns about the bill in totality but that the amendment would help make it better. Bacala asked the chamber to \u201ctake a deep breath and ask ourselves, what\u2019s the right thing?\u201d\nHe said low-performing nursing homes are failing in their contracts to take care of the elderly, but that the state\u2019s moratorium on building new ones prevents competition from doing a better job.\nState Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, described the bill as repulsive.\n\u201cWe are supposed to protect the elderly, not somebody who wants to make more money off the elderly,\u201d she said\nBut other lawmakers questioned the accuracy of federal ratings for nursing home performance, and said nursing homes should not be punished for low staffing ratios, given widespread nursing shortages.\n\u201cThis is not changing law, this is not creating something new,\u201d Melerine said.\nLawmakers voted 39 to 57 to reject Hilferty\u2019s amendment. They voted 58 to 37 to pass the bill.",

        "Content": "Gov. Jeff Landry said Tuesday that the oil industry was engaging in \"hypocrisy\" for claiming that Louisiana\u2019s litigation environment was stifling their business yet, at the same time petitioning state government to help with many new carbon capture projects.\nLandry, a longtime supporter of the oil industry, leveled the criticism in a surprise appearance in the House Natural Resources and Environment Committee, where he threw his political weight behind a bill that would make numerous changes to state laws and regulations.\nSenate Bill 244, sponsored by state Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, began as a bill to reorganize the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, and it had already passed the Senate. But pages of new amendments were added in committee on Tuesday morning, some of which Landry said were written Monday night.\nAmong them was a controversial amendment that Landry said he wrote himself: It would prohibit indemnification, a legal tool that allows companies to pass off the responsibility to clean up old wells when it sells them to another company. The amendment would also retroactively remove those protections from previous deals.\nSome Republican committee members aired concerns about the last-minute nature of the changes. They also raised fears about the indemnification amendment and other proposed changes to legacy oil field cleanup litigation, which they said had already alarmed constituents who are large landowners or work in oil and gas.\nOne representative of a Louisiana landowner trade group, Don Caffery of the Natural Resources Management Association, told the committee the indemnity provision is his group's major concern, claiming the change would be unconstitutional.\nWithout it and the guarantee of protection from legal liability for past actions, it would lock out future oil and gas exploration for Louisiana landowners, he argued.\n\"And so it's wide open. I can't signal to industry that I would like them to come and drill on my property with this type of discussion being had in this body today,\" Caffery said.\nLandry seemed to have little sympathy, saying oil companies are asking for state help with carbon capture and other efforts.\n\"You can't say that litigation is so bad in this state that you will not conduct activity on one side of the equation and yet in the very next moment say, 'Guess what? I need some help from you all to do the same types of activities on this side in the same litigation environment,\" Landry said. \"That is the definition of hypocrisy.\"\nRep. Joseph Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow, shot back: \"No, that's the definition of being forced to work ... to go and play in the playground where the bullies at.\"\nWhile Caffery, the landowner representative, agreed legacy cleanup and indemnification do create problems, including orphan wells, he argued that packing an attempted fix in the DENR reorganization bill was not the answer.\nHis group has been considering, potentially for the next session, a new requirement for baseline testing to protect new drillers from old problems.\n\"We just think that if we're going to do something this bold and extreme, it should be in one instrument, not in an instrument like that,\" Caffery said.\nLouisiana's two major oil and gas trade groups didn't comment during the hearing.\nIn a later statement, Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, agreed with Caffery's assessment that the retroactive anti-indemnification language was unconstitutional. He said his group planned to fight it on the House floor.\n\"The governor was certainly spirited today,\" Moncla said.\nHe added that much of the rest of the language on legacy lawsuits had been in a previous bill, HB694, that his group supported but hadn't made it out of committee.\n\"With very little time remaining in session, there is a whole lot to consider in this 200-page bill,\" Moncla said.\nA longstanding issue\nLandry skipped a planned press conference on the economic impacts of this year's Super Bowl to testify. He emphasized the importance of finding a way to deal with the \"dark cloud\" that he said was being left by the proliferation of legacy lawsuits \u2014 612 at the latest state count.\nThese legacy lawsuits have long been a contentious issue in Louisiana's energy sector.\nOil industry critics argue that indemnification provisions allow companies to pass off old, less productive wells to smaller companies as a way of shirking the responsibility to clean them up. They argue lawsuits are the only way to force companies to take care of the problem.\nBut industry leaders say the lawsuits are simply a boon to lawyers, and they sometimes don't do enough to actually clean up the mess.\nThe abrupt addition of a bill that would end indemnification drew a surge of concern from industry. Orgeron said his phone was blowing up over the language and its last-minute arrival in the bill.\n\"Oh, I'm sure nobody likes that. I'm glad you brought that up, Joe. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about that,\" Landry told Orgeron.\nLandry said the indemnification language has plagued the state and \"the crux of the problem of this entire litigation that has haunted this state is those indemnity agreements.\"\n\"And so, if there is one piece that I will stake myself on, it is those indemnity agreements,\" he said.\nHe argued his language removing the protections would \"set the table\" for the future. The governor urged the oil and gas industry to talk to him about the bill, though he hasn't heard from them yet.\n\"No one has texted me, but I certainly would love the industry to text me,\" Landry said. \"Where y'all at?\"\nThe bill cleared the House committee, with only Orgeron opposed.\nBefore the committee vote, Orgeron warned Landry that he would likely propose a floor amendment to exclude the language on legacy lawsuits and allow the rest of the bill to advance.",

Jeff Landry said Tuesday that \"preparation starts with the individual.\"\nComing up on the August anniversaries of hurricanes Katrina and Andrew, Landry said the two storms have forever changed the mindset of people across the state and nation.\n\"Those storms tested Louisiana in unimaginable ways,\" he said.\nThe lessons from Katrina and subsequent storms and other damaging weather events, he said, \"have taught us that preparation saves lives.\"\nThe governor urged residents along Louisiana's coast to ready evacuation plans and supplies and secure important documents.\nState Climatologist Jay Grymes, who joined Landry at the news conference, acknowledged that \"most of you are aware that the forecast for the upcoming season calls for normal to above-normal activity.\"\nGrymes said that, like hurricane season last year, it \"is very likely going to be another active year in the Gulf of Mexico.\"\nLandry said the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness will be \"consistently\" reviewing emergency preparedness operations as Louisiana enters hurricane season.\n\"We are ready,\" he said.\nFederal agencies under scrutiny\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, have in recent months undergone leadership shake-ups and major layoffs under the Trump Administration.\nWhen asked if he had concerns about cuts at those federal agencies, Landry said he hasn\u2019t heard that cuts were impacting the flow of storm or weather-related information to states, and he is confident in Grymes\u2019 ability to keep Louisiana residents informed in the face of any storms this year.\nGrymes said he handles weather forecasting for storms in the Gulf \"with the cooperation and through the guidance of the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center.\"\nNonetheless, Grymes said, \"I feel confident that our tropical coverage this season will be more than adequate for what we require.\"\nLandry said that, should he learn of any problems related to federal agencies' ability to quickly communicate weather information to the public, \"the first thing I'm gonna do is pick up the phone and call the White House.\"\n\"I've spoken at length with Secretary Noem and those folks over at the White House,\" Landry said, referring to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, a close Landry ally. \"And I do not believe the president or the White House has any intention of revamping FEMA while hurricane season is in play.\"\nPresident Donald Trump is trying to make sure resources are available for states and that states have the authority to act quickly, Landry said.\n\"The bureaucracy inside the federal government has a tendency to tangle things up,\" he said.\nLandry said that, if Louisiana is impacted by a major hurricane, he is \"extremely confident\" Louisiana will receive any resources it needs, owing to communication between state officials and DHS, FEMA and the White House, as well as Louisiana's congressional delegation.",

        "Content": "The state Senate on Sunday shelved proposals to reduce individual income and sales taxes in Louisiana \u2013 to avoid blowing a big hole in the state budget.\nThe House overwhelmingly approved the tax cut bills on May 7, but the measures stalled before the Senate after a Times-Picayune | The Advocate news report publicized an analysis by state budget economists showing the big cost.\nRep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, sponsored the tax cuts along with a proposal that she said would offset the revenue loss by eliminating a state savings account known as the Revenue Stabilization Fund.\nThe problem is that the figures didn\u2019t balance out. The state would have faced a $142 million shortfall in fiscal year 2027 and a $590 million shortfall in fiscal year 2028, according to legislative economists. The Legislature is currently in the process of adopting the fiscal year 2026 budget to take effect on July 1.\nThe Senate Revenue & Fiscal Affairs Committee killed Emerson\u2019s tax cuts with no discussion. The committee amended out the sales tax cut and did not take up the bill that would reduce the individual income tax.\nEmerson, who had been advised beforehand of the committee\u2019s plan, wasn\u2019t in a talkative mood afterward.\n\u201cIt is what it is. They took it out,\u201d she said and walked away.\nSen. Franklin Foil, R-Baton Rouge and the committee chair, said after the hearing that lawmakers need to get a clearer idea of whether the tax overhaul approved by legislators in November leaves the state with more or less revenue \u2013 before they can lower taxes.\nFoil also said the after-effects of a tax cut approved by the Legislature and then-Gov. Bobby Jindal in 2008 played a role in the Senate\u2019s decision to kill Emerson\u2019s tax cuts.\nFoil and Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, were among the 102 House members who unanimously voted for those tax reductions. Economists said the lost revenue contributed to massive deficits that led to big cuts in spending on colleges and universities and public health care.\n\u201cIn hindsight, we moved too quickly in enacting those tax reductions,\u201d Foil said, who has noted that the tax cut in 2008 occurred when the state treasury was flush thanks to the post-Katrina spending boom. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make the same mistake. It\u2019s a lot harder to go back and raise taxes than it is to decrease taxes. I\u2019m all for trying to reduce taxes if we have excess revenue, but we have to do it in a responsible way.\u201d\nJan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, praised the committee for its action.\n\u201cThe math never added up on these tax-cut bills, and it\u2019s good to see the Senate acknowledge that,\u201d Moller said.\nEmerson\u2019s House Bill 578 would have reduced the state sales tax from 5% to 4.75%, and her House Bill 667 would have dropped the individual income tax rate from 3% to 2.75% and double the standard deduction for people over 65.\nEmerson paired the tax cuts with eliminating the Revenue Stabilization Fund, but ending that fund would provide only a fraction of the money needed to offset the revenue loss from enacting the tax cuts, budget analysists said.\nReducing the sales tax by .25% would have cost the state general fund $141 million in 2027 and $265 million in 2028. Reducing the individual income tax by .25% and doubling the standard deduction for seniors would have cost the state general fund $54 million in 2027 and $377 million in 2028.\nEmerson noted that, under legislation approved in November, the state sales tax is already scheduled to drop by the .25% in 2030, so her bill sought to accelerate that action.\nEnding the Revenue Stabilization Fund \u2013 which would require an amendment to the state constitution approved by voters \u2013 would have saved only $53 million in 2027 and $107 million in 2028, according to legislative analysts.\nFoil said he didn\u2019t expect the Senate to eliminate the Revenue Stabilization Fund, which Emerson proposed in House Bill 678 and House Bill 683. Under current law, all corporate tax revenue above $600 million flows into that fund.\nDuring each of the last two years, $1 billion in excess corporate tax collections above the $600 million threshold poured into the Revenue Stabilization Fund.\nEmerson said she expected a continued gusher of corporate tax revenue to be able to pay for her two tax cuts bills.\nBut legislative economists forecast a much smaller number because the Legislature last year eliminated the corporate franchise tax. The economists also said it\u2019s best to err on the low revenue side because corporate income tax can vary greatly from year to year.",

        "Content": "In March, House Speaker Phillip DeVillier said he wanted to explore adding a wing to the Pentagon Barracks to provide more housing for House members there.\nBut DeVillier recently said he has paused that idea to see how it fits with plans to renovate the historic structure that is across from the State Capitol.\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for an architect to come up with some design for us to look at,\u201d said DeVillier, R-Eunice. \u201cOnce we get that, I would expect to start sharing that with members and the public.\u201d\nThe Legislature won\u2019t address the issue before the regular session ends June 12, DeVillier added.\nFor DeVillier, the additional wing would achieve two goals. One is that it would provide lodging for another 30-35 House members. The other is that, once it is built, legislators could move into the new wing while their building was being renovated. The existing buildings have suffered damage from leaks and flooding and have old pipes.\nBy doing this work in sequence, building by building, no lawmaker would be displaced from the Pentagon.\nToday, 28 senators rent space in 22 apartments, and 29 House members rent in 21 apartments, according to legislative records. In all, the Legislature has 144 members.\nLegislators pay only $250 to $500 per month, utilities included, but note that the base legislative pay of $16,800 per year hasn\u2019t been raised since 1980.\nTo build the new structure would cost about $10 million. DeVillier would get that money from a House savings account that has $40 million. It\u2019s not clear whether other House members would have to sign off on that.\nTo renovate the existing buildings would cost $31 million over several years. That money is in the state construction budget.\nThe Pentagon Barracks were built in a Greek Revival style from 1819 to 1822 and were then used as a garrison for troops and a storehouse for munitions for decades. Legislators began living there in 1966.\nA pentagon by definition has five sides, but the Pentagon Barracks for decades has consisted of only four buildings. The fifth structure fell apart a short time after construction and was never replaced.\nWhile plans for the Pentagon remain on hold, the state is moving forward with plans to initiate a 54-month renovation of the State Capitol exterior to make it waterproof. That project is scheduled to begin in about three months, according to the state Division of Administration.",

        "Summary": "Eldorado Resorts is buying Caesar's Entertainment Corp., the owner of Harrah's New Orleans Hotel and Casino, in a $17.3 billion deal that will create the largest gaming operator in the U.S.",
        "Content": "Eldorado Resorts is buying Caesar's Entertainment Corp., the owner of Harrah's New Orleans Hotel and Casino, in a $17.3 billion deal that will create the largest gaming operator in the U.S.\nThe takeover will result in a company that controls 60 casinos and 51,000 hotel rooms spread across 16 states and five countries.\nIn addition to Harrah's New Orleans, the only land-based casino in Louisiana, the new company will control the Harrah's Louisiana Downs in Lake Charles and the Horseshoe Bossier City. Eldorado owns the Belle of Baton Rouge, the Eldorado in Shreveport and the Isle of Capri in Westlake.\nThe takeover comes just a month after the Louisiana state legislature struck a deal to extend Harrah's New Orleans' casino license by 30 years to 2054. The acquisition isn't expected to sidetrack that agreement, according to regulators and company officials.\nMonday's mega-deal will result in the sale of some casino operations before the deal closes next year, Thomas Reeg, Eldorado's CEO, said on a conference call with investors and media. But he didn't specify which of the casinos might have to go.\nIt's not clear whether or not any of the combined company's Louisiana casinos will be sold as part of the acquisition, should Eldorado decide, for instance, to focus on other core properties, or if the Federal Trade Commission decides that Eldorado controls too large a share of the gaming market.\nBut state officials said they don't currently expect any changes at the New Orleans property, despite a complicated sale-and-leaseback arrangement with a third company that is occurring as part of the broader deal.\n\"I don't think it will be affected,\" said Ronnie Jones, chairman of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board. \"Harrah's was identified as one of the top properties in [Caesar's] portfolio, so I'm sure the successor owner will be just as committed.\"\nDan Real, general manager of Harrah's New Orleans said that \"in no way should this transaction have any impact on the transformational plans we have for New Orleans.\"\nLast month, the governor signed a bill that will extend Harrah's New Orleans casino license for 30 years, in return for which Harrah's has agreed to spend $325 million to upgrade the property.\nThe state did not allow Harrah\u2019s to expand its 125,000-square-foot casino floor. Instead, Harrah's agreed to build a new 340-room hotel tower, which will include new restaurants and entertainment space. The construction project is expected to create 600 temporary jobs, and the new hotel complex is slated to employ an additional 500 workers.\nThe deal also committed Harrah's to pay state sales tax, generating about $3.4 million in state revenue a year and $19.5 million for the city over three years.\nThe takeover had been in the works for some time. Caesar's emerged from an $18 billion bankruptcy in 2017 and has been seen as a takeover target at least since activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed in February that he had acquired a large stake.\nTony Rodio, who replaced Mark Frissora as Caesar's CEO in April, had sold Tropicana Entertainment to Eldorado last October, and his appointment further fueled rumors that Harrah's would soon follow.\nEldorado, which is controlled by Gary Carano, the company's executive chairman, and his Reno-based family, several of whom also hold key company positions, has been buying up casinos and related hotel properties since 2014. It now owns three casinos in Reno, Nevada and another two in small Nevada markets, as well as the Tropicana in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which it bought back in October. It has another 19 in smaller markets around the country, including the Louisiana operations.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Caesar's shareholders will get $8.40 in cash plus 0.0899 of Eldorado shares for each Caesar share, valuing Caesar's at $12.75 a share, a premium of 28% over Friday's closing share price.\nThe deal \"is the most complicated I've ever been involved in,\" Reeg said Monday, pointing to a series of real estate transactions that are a key part of financing the deal.\nVICI Properties Inc., which has held mortgages on several Harrah's properties since it came out of bankruptcy two years ago, also had options to buy those properties in the event of a takeover.\nVICI has agreed to buy three of the properties -- Harrah's Resort Atlantic City, Harrah's Laughlin Hotel & Casino, and Harrah's New Orleans Hotel and Casino -- for a total of $1.8 billion and then lease them back to Eldorado. VICI has renegotiated lease terms on these and other Caesar's properties, which Eldorado executives said helped with the financing of the deal.\n\"It creates a set of property proceeds (totaling $3.2 billion) that are going to support and help fund this transaction,\" Reeg explained.\nTom Rodio, the CEO of Caesar's, said the two companies expect about $500 million of \"synergies\" in the first year after they merge, which will mean cutting jobs and other operations where they are duplicated, as well as cost savings from purchasing power and the like.\nCaesar's has 34 casinos, including some of the most high-profile casinos on the Las Vegas strip and along the Gulf Coast, operating under the Harrah's, Caesars and Horseshoe brands.\nThe deal comes at a time when casino revenues have been slipping in Louisiana.\nThe Belle of Baton Rouge, the city's oldest casino, generated only $2.6 million in the year to May, down from $4.9 million in the same period last year. The Baton Rouge casino market has not grown year-over-year revenue since August 2017.\nLikewise, Harrah's Louisiana Downs track revenue was down 2.2% to $57.5 million as of May.\nRevenue at Harrah's casino in New Orleans was down nearly 2% at $26.4 million.",

        "Content": "Nevada casino operator Eldorado Resorts, which runs the Belle of Baton Rouge, is buying Caesars Entertainment Corp., which operates the Harrah's land-based casino in New Orleans, but expects to retain the Caesars brand after the deal is done by mid-2020.\nEldorado Resorts, based in Reno, Nevada expects to close on its $17.3 billion acquisition of Las Vegas-based Caesars after routine regulatory review. The move would make the combined companies own 60 casinos across 16 states, including six in Louisiana.\nEldorado also owns Isle of Capri Casino Hotel in Lake Charles and El Dorado Resort and Casino in Shreveport. Caesars' other properties in the state are Harrah's Louisiana Downs in Bossier City and Horseshoe Bossier City.\nThe deal might not have a big impact on the casino market in Baton Rouge, but in Shreveport that could be different considering the combined entity would own multiple casinos in the same market. The Belle of Baton Rouge ownership was in early talks about what it would take to move the casino from the riverboat to land.\n\"This is going to be a moving target for a while. The devil is going to be in the details,\u201d said Ronnie Jones, chairman of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board.\nThere are no state regulations which would impede the sale of existing casino operations, but the Federal Trade Commission may step in to make adjustments, Jones said. In October 2018, Penn National Gaming and Pinnacle Entertainment were forced to divest casino-related assets in St. Louis, Cincinnati and Kansas City, Missouri, as part of Penn National's $2.8 billion deal to acquire Pinnacle.\nThere was no word about how it may impact previously planned investment in New Orleans, though Jones said it wouldn't be impacted considering Harrah's in New Orleans was identified as a top property in the portfolio.\nTwenty-six years ago, the speaker of the Louisiana House engineered the most controversial vote in the state Legislature in decades when he sh\u2026\nThe deal comes at time when revenue generated at casinos across Louisiana were mostly down.\nThe Belle of Baton Rouge, the city's oldest casino, generated only $2.6 million as of May, down from $4.9 million in May 2018. In general, the Baton Rouge casino market has not grown year-over-year revenue since August 2017.\nLikewise, in Shreveport-Bossier City, where Harrah's Louisiana Downs track operates, was down 2.2% to $57.5 million as of May.\nAn agreement to boost hotel taxes to provide more money for New Orleans\u2019 infrastructure is officially a done deal.\nRevenue at Harrah's in New Orleans was down nearly 2% in May and generated $26.4 million, compared to $26.9 million one year ago.\nThe companies expect to save $500 million in the first 12 months after the deal closes as they integrate operations.\nSome plans to reduce expenses include a decentralized management, streamlined marketing expenses, combining software and information technology infrastructure, and lowering insurance premiums and property costs, according to an investor presentation.\nVICI Properties, a real estate investment trust for Caesars properties, and Eldorado are expected to sign a deal where VICI will acquire real estate which includes Harrah's New Orleans for $1.8 billion. Then the Harrah's operations will pay a total of $154 million in annual rent to VICI.\nThe combined entities will have more than 65 million rewards customers and will control more than 40,000 hotel rooms across the country.\nEldorado Resorts declined further comment about its plans in Louisiana and is expected to offer more information to investors Tuesday in a conference call.\nLess than three months after the new owners of the Belle of Baton Rouge said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d the downtown riverboat would move onto l\u2026\nEldorado is anticipated to pay $8.40 per share in cash and 0.0899 shares of Eldorado stock for each Caesars share, or $12.75 per share. The transaction values Caesars at about $8.6 billion, and Eldorado would pick up about $8.8 billion of the casino's debt.\nWinnings by Baton Rouge\u2019s three riverboat casinos continued year-to-year declines in May, bringing in 14% less than the year before.\nAcadiana Business Today: Louisiana's GDP grew faster than the national average during July-September 2019; Burger King to be built at corner of Johnston Street, Broadmoor Boulevard\nLouisiana posted growth of 2.9% during third quarter in 2019, compared to the previous quarter, slightly higher than the national average of 2\u2026\nConstruction has begun on a Burger King in front of the Time Plaza shopping center that will open in May.\nUncle Luck's Express Cafe, originally located at 116 E.

        "Content": "Baton Rouge-based Investar Holding Corp.'s financial services arm, Investar Bank, had its application to convert to a national bank charter approved by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions.\nInvestar Bank holds a state bank charter and is slated to be converted on July 1. The bank has plans to hopes to expand further outside of Louisiana and become a regional financial institution. It has been testing the waters for an expansion in other states. A national charter gives it a bit more flexibility in some ways, but also exposes it to federal regulators as opposed to state regulators, which in some cases means more red tape.\nJohn D'Angelo is the CEO of Investar Bank. D'Angelo sees opportunity in New Orleans, especially since smaller community banks have been sold in recent years. Investar expects to build two new branches in New Orleans over the next 12 months \u2014 one on St. Charles Avenue under renovation and the other on Metairie Road. The bank also is building a new branch in downtown Lafayette. It has been hiring new employees in recent years and poached a commercial lending group from another bank in St. Charles. It also is installing an interactive teller machine in St. Charles in addition to a new branch location. In that case, the automated ATM was installed first as a pilot for the branch investment afterwards.\nIn Baton Rouge, it is wrapping up a $400,000 renovation of a branch along Highland Road, just south of LSU. In total, over a two-year period, the bank expects to invest $6 million in the new and renovated branches across Louisiana.\nThe bank's leadership sees brick and mortar as a way to leverage its brand after it has established relationships with businesses in each market.\n\"Our strategy is to lead with technology and build small and less brick and mortar,\" according to a statement from the bank. \"Customers still want brick and mortar, just do not need as many locations.\"\nInvestar Bank is a mostly commercial lending institution, reporting net income of $3.9 million during the first quarter this year, up from $2.4 million during first-quarter 2018. It acquired Mainland Bank in Texas City, Texas, in a nearly $20 million deal that closed in recent months. Future market expansions in Texas may be among larger metros such as Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and Houston, according to the bank.\n\"We plan on building out a Texas franchise over time,\" a bank representative said in a statement.\nInvestar Bank had total assets of nearly $2 billion as of March 31, records show. It had 255 employees as of Dec. 31 and has grown significantly since it was founded in June 2006 with an initial capitalization of $10.1 million from local investors.

        "Content": "A week after Mandeville and the owners of the proposed Port Marigny development came to an agreement that ended a federal lawsuit, a group of residents has filed new litigation, this time aimed at throwing out a city ordinance that was key to the settlement.\nThe plaintiffs, who sued in 22nd Judicial District Court on April 9, allege that the ordinance was illegally adopted by the Mandeville City Council in November because it did not go before the city's Planning and Zoning Commission.\nThe ordinance rezoned the 76-acre abandoned industrial site on the Mandeville lakefront so that it can be developed into a mixed-use community that includes homes and apartments, commercial space and a 117-slip marina.\nBut it sets some limits on what can be built, most notably a 350-unit cap on residences, a response to complaints about density.\nThe ordinance is central to the consent judgment reached in federal court, the end result of a lawsuit brought by owners Marcus and Michael Pittman, who claimed that the city's rejection of its previous plan for the land amounted to an unconstitutional taking of the property.\nBut in the new lawsuit, 24 plaintiffs, led by Jules and Deborah Sachs, maintain that the ordinance itself must be scrapped because the city didn't follow the law in adopting it.\nMandeville's Comprehensive Land Use Regulations Ordinance says rezoning must be done by ordinance, but it sets out a process that includes review by the Planning and Zoning Commission, a public hearing before that body and a recommendation to the City Council for a final vote.\nThe City Council adopted the ordinance without first sending it through Planning and Zoning.\nThe plaintiffs say that the council unilaterally granted the owners a conditional use permit by passage of the ordinance. The suit says doing so was \"an unlawful exercise of legislative power that is not permitted under the CLURO.\u201d\nKaren Champagne, a spokesman for the group of plaintiffs, said that the suit is not being for or against the development.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about holding elected officials accountable,\" she said. \"The law must apply equally to all citizens.\"\nChampagne referred to the fact that the Pittmans had not filed a new application for rezoning prior to the council's action.\n\"If one citizen has to file an application and pay a fee, then all citizens should have to file the application and pay the fee,\u201d she said.\nThe plaintiffs also pointed out, in a news release, that a number of people had objected to the process at the Nov. 29 meeting, asking the City Council to defer the vote to give people more time to review it.\n\"The council ignored their pleas,\" Champagne said, quoting from a section of the law that says \"interested citizens and parties shall have had an opportunity to be fully heard\u2019 before any zoning amendment is passed.\u201d\nIt's unclear what affect the lawsuit might have on the consent judgement, which calls for continued \"supervision\" of the federal court until both parties agree that is no longer needed.\nThe agreement says that any conflicts \"concerning the interpretation, stipulation and process for the procedures\" for the development of Port Marigny, shall be submitted to the federal court for \"summary disposition.\"\nBut the plaintiffs in the new lawuit say that a favorable ruling will expose negotiations that were held behind closed doors.\n\"That\u2019s the way it should have been to begin with,\u201d Champagne said.",

Michelet bought her home in 2009 so that she could be close to her daughter and grandchildren.\nShe watches her grandchildren on a regular basis and said she is worried about her safety if a business is built next door.\n\"I come home sometimes one, two o\u2019clock in the morning from babysitting. I feel safe when I come home,\" Michelet said. \"I just prefer to have a residence next to me and not commercial.\"\nMichelet added that Lafitte Street near the back of Younger's property is already zoned as a business district and said that rezoning the property isn't the only way for Younger to have a business office.\n\"I am for progress. My daughter is a small-business owner here in Mandeville. Progress is great but not next door to me in a residential area,\" Michelet said.\nJulie Bolyard, another resident of Carroll Street, said that Younger owns another property down Carroll Street and Bolyard is concerned that Younger is looking to flip the property.\n\"We are the last residentials on the street,\" Bolyard said. \"She is retiring; she is only working part time. So you flip the property and it\u2019s now B-3, What business is going to go there next? We are going to have to live with it.\"\nThe council referred the ordinance to the Planning and Zoning Committee for recommendation and encouraged community members to voice their opinions to the committee as well.\nDuring the meeting, the council also created plans for the organization of the council for the upcoming year.\nCouncilman-at-Large Clay Madden and Councilman John Keller were appointed to serve on the Financial Oversight Committee from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020.\nCouncilwoman-at-Large Laure Sica will take over as coundil chairwoman for the next term.\nThe council is also awaiting discussions of the budget for the 2019-2020 fiscal year.

        "Content": "11:42\nrepublished\nTrump-backed giant tax and spending bill bloats deficit by $2.4T, nonpartisan audit finds\nThe U.S. Capitol on Oct. 9, 2024. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released detailed analysis Wednesday showing Republicans\u2019 \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion during the next decade.\nCBO projects that if enacted as written, the legislation would result in 10.9 million people losing access to health insurance by 2034, a number that includes \u201c1.4 million people without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status who would no longer be covered in state-only funded programs in 2034.\u201d\nThe score is the most up-to-date analysis by Congress\u2019 official scorekeeper on how the sweeping tax and spending cuts package the House approved last month will impact the federal budget in the years ahead.\nRepublicans have been highly critical of the CBO\u2019s assessment of the legislation\u2019s real-world impacts, arguing that keeping tax rates as they are now, instead of letting them rise at the end of the year when the 2017 GOP tax law expires, will boost economic growth.\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., lambasted the CBO during a press conference shortly after the report came out, arguing its economic growth projections haven\u2019t been completely accurate.\n\u201cThis bill will actually reduce the deficit, if you recognize the historical economic growth that has always been there,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cTo say you\u2019re going to get 1.8% growth. At a minimum, we think you can get 2.5 to 4% growth. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, says over 4% economic growth. So I get that we\u2019ve got to play by the rules of the referee, but the referee has been wrong.\u201d\nDuring the last decade, U.S. growth only surpassed 3% during one year, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nGross domestic product growth measured 2.5% in 2014, 2.9% in 2015, 1.8% in 2016, 2.5% in 2017, 3% in 2018, 2.6% in 2019, -2.2% in 2020 during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, 6.1% in 2021, 2.5% in 2022, 2.9% in 2023 and 2.8% in 2024.\nDisagreement over the \u2018big beautiful bill\u2019\nGOP lawmakers have also sought to brush aside criticism from some of their own members, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who both argue the legislation must cut spending more to reduce the federal deficit in the long run.\nBillionaire and former Trump administration staffer Elon Musk has also become increasingly vocal about his opposition to the package, writing on social media this week that the \u201cmassive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.\u201d\nThe House voted mostly along party lines in May to send the sweeping spending and tax cuts package to the Senate, which is expected to debate and amend the legislation in the weeks ahead.\nCBO\u2019s analysis will likely inform some of that conversation, and help senators better understand how the policy changes proposed by their House colleagues would affect state government budgets and the communities they represent.\nThe CBO previously shared analysis of each of the 11 bills that make up the package, but those didn\u2019t reflect several changes GOP House leaders made just hours before the floor vote in that chamber.\nUpdated numbers\nThe updated projections show Republicans\u2019 plan to extend the 2017 tax law and make other tweaks to tax policy would increase the deficit by $3.754 trillion during the next decade. That increase to the deficit caused by the tax changes, which CBO has also found would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners, would be partly offset by spending reductions on certain programs.\nThe Armed Services Committee\u2019s bill would increase deficits by $144 billion. Homeland Security\u2019s provisions would increase deficits by $79 billion. And the Judiciary Committee\u2019s language would increase deficits by $9 billion during the 10-year budget window.\nThe section of the package drafted by the Energy and Commerce Committee, which would make substantial changes to Medicaid and several other programs within the panel\u2019s jurisdiction, would decrease spending by $1.086 trillion during the 10-year budget window.\nThe panel\u2019s bill has four subcategories: energy, environment, communications and health. The health provisions, which include substantial changes to Medicaid, would reduce federal spending by $902 billion between 2025 and 2034.\nLanguage barring Medicaid from covering gender transition procedures for anyone in the state-federal health program would reduce federal spending by $2.6 billion during the next decade.\nRequiring some people on Medicaid to work, participate in community service or attend educational programs for at least 80 hours a month would reduce federal spending by $344 billion during the next 10 years.\nBlocking any Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood would cut federal costs by $261 million during the 10-year budget window. Federal law already bars health care programs like Medicaid from covering abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or it endangers the life of the woman.\nDemocratic criticism\nEnergy and Commerce Committee ranking member Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, wrote in a statement that it\u2019s \u201cshocking House Republicans rushed to vote on this bill without an accounting from CBO on the millions of people who will lose their health care or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national (deficit).\n\u201cThe truth is Republican leaders raced to pass this bill under cover of night because they didn\u2019t want the American people or even their own members to know about its catastrophic consequences.\u201d\nThe Agriculture Committee\u2019s provisions, including pushing off some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to states, would reduce federal spending by $238 billion during the next decade.\nThe Education and Workforce Committee\u2019s language would decrease federal spending by $349 billion. The Financial Services section of the package would reduce federal spending by $5 billion. Natural Resources would lower spending by $18 billion. Oversight and Government Reform would decrease spending by $12 billion. And Transportation and Infrastructure would reduce spending by nearly $37 billion.\nAriana Figueroa contributed to this report.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Environmental groups like the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper and Sierra Club worry a new bill will make it easier to develop in isolated wetland areas. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)\nIn a stretch of wild land in Iberville Parish, a small dirt dam built across an out-of-the-way bayou is at the center of a lawsuit. Environmental advocates fear cases like this could become more common if a Louisiana proposal to redefine its wetlands becomes law.\nOpponents say this proposed change doesn\u2019t just open doors for mixed legal interpretations; it could also make it easier to erase valuable wetland habitat and build in flood-prone areas.\nThe lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana in Baton Rouge two years ago by the environmental group Atchafalaya Basinkeeper and the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West. They allege Benjamin Miller of Miller Hunting Club in Eunice illegally dammed Pat\u2019s Throat Bayou in 2021 to access hunting grounds on the other bank.\nThe hunting club didn\u2019t get a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before Miller built the dam, according to the lawsuit. Instead, the plaintiffs claim the USACE granted a permit after the dam was illegally built.\nIf the Louisiana Legislature approves a proposed update to its wetlands laws, environmentalists fear property owners and developers will argue that wetlands like these \u2013 illegally dammed off from a navigable body of water \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be protected under state or federal law.\n\u201cThere will be lawsuits,\u201d said Margie Vicknair-Pray, conservation coordinator for the Sierra Club Delta chapter. \u201cThey\u2019re changing the definition, but that doesn\u2019t change reality.\u201d\nMirroring Sackett\nPat\u2019s Throat Bayou is a window into how a national policy shift could affect Louisiana.\nA 2023 Supreme Court decision, Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, narrowed federal protection for wetlands. The case arose from an Idaho family who backfilled their property, which the EPA later determined to be protected wetlands. The Sacketts challenged that determination, arguing successfully their land did not connect to a navigable water body \u2013 known in federal law as Waters of the United States (WOTUS).\nBefore Sackett, developers needed a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge or fill a wetland area protected under the federal Clean Water Act.\nThe Sackett ruling also left uncertainty as to where navigable channels under WOTUS begin and end when it comes to wetlands, according to Mark Davis, director of the Tulane Center for Environmental Law.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t define exactly how that\u2019s going to play out \u2026 and people will agree and disagree where those lines are drawn,\u201d Davis said.\nThis means owners and developers might not need permits from the USACE to build in isolated wetland areas. The grey area has prompted states to step in and try to fill the regulatory gap with their own wetlands laws.\nLouisiana state Sen. \u201cBig Mike\u201d Fesi, R-Houma, has sponsored Senate Bill 94 in response to the Sackett decision. His bill looks to redefine wetlands cut off by levees that break their connection to navigable water bodies as \u201cfastlands,\u201d disqualifying them from federal protection.\nFesi said in an interview his bill is meant to bring Louisiana law in line with the Sackett decision.\n\u201cWe try calling everything wetlands just because it has a little water in it,\u201d Fesi said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten way out of hand.\u201d\nThe Sackett ruling does not affect wetlands connected to navigable bodies of water, such as the Mississippi River, or tidal wetlands along Louisiana\u2019s coast. They would still have federal protection under the Clean Water Act.\nWetlands with levees, either through \u201ccurrent or future lawful construction,\u201d are left more vulnerable in Fesi\u2019s proposal. The senator did not give a conclusive answer when asked what will happen to current wetlands cut off by future levees, saying his bill was intended to invite room for individual interpretation\n\u201cOne size doesn\u2019t fit all,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s exactly the issue wetlands advocates have with Senate Bill 94 \u2013 the room for interperetation it leaves for how wetlands are defined.\nIn the case of Pat\u2019s Throat Bayou, the argument was over whether wetlands connected to the navigable bayou were cut off legally or illegally when Miller built a dam, said Brennan Spoor, a member of Atchafalaya Basinkeepers. The group\u2019s mission is to protect and restore the swamps and waterways of the basin.\n\u201cThe bill applies to all [levees and dams] that are currently existing or future ones that are lawfully constructed,\u201d Spoor said.\n\u201cYou could argue that the dam was lawfully constructed, and therefore the wetlands that they have destroyed since they built the dam were never wetlands at all,\u201d he added, explaining that the bill tries to eliminate the need for a federal permit if the property owners want to dredge or fill the landscape.\nThe exact language of the bill is also concerning to legal experts for the confusion they say it will create in the law.\nFesi\u2019s bill changes the definition of wetlands under the Louisiana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, the program that regulates contamination released into surface waters. But Louisiana still needs to follow federal law for pollutants.\n\u201cThe notion of a continuous surface connection is not really part of the rule for what a pollution discharge covers,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIf anything, it creates deeper confusion rather than clarification.\u201d\nThe Louisiana Senate approved Fesi\u2019s bill Tuesday in a 35-1 vote. It heads next to the governor for his signature.\nFlood concerns\nAs legal arguments mount, environmental advocates say the stakes are high for Louisiana. Building in wetland areas eliminates valuable habitat and increases the risk of flooding in nearby communities, Vicknair-Pray said.\n\u201cPeople just want to build where they want to build, and they don\u2019t want to think of the long-term consequences\u201d like habitat loss and flooding, she said. \u201cThat water has to go somewhere. We need wetlands for that water to back up into.\u201d\nWhen asked about flood concerns, Fesi said he thinks his bill would make it easier to construct and repair levees, aiding with much-needed flood control in some areas and \u201cpromoting individual property rights\u201d for those wanting to build in previously defined wetlands.\n\u201cThose aren\u2019t wetlands,\u201d Fesi said, speaking about wetland areas surrounded by levees or cut off from bodies of water.\nThe 2023 Louisiana Coastal Master Plan, a document outlining various coastal restoration and flood protection projects, recommends a combination of wetland resources and manmade levees for flood control. The same document also warns that overengineering rivers like the Mississippi can \u201cimpact coastal wetlands and undermine their ability to replenish naturally.\u201d\n\u201cThe marsh behind a levee is going to die,\u201d Vicknair-Pray said.\nAside from just diminished natural flood control, she worries wildlife living in isolated wetland areas, including migrating ducks and native reptiles, will be put at risk with development encouraged under Fesi\u2019s legislation.\n\u201cWe used to consider this Sportsman\u2019s Paradise,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say that anymore.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "6:31\nNews Story\nLouisiana political campaigns might get to withhold more donation, spending info\nMatthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator\nLouisiana lawmakers might diminish information available to the public about political donations and election spending through a sprawling rewrite of the state\u2019s campaign finance law.\nGov. Jeff Landry is pushing House Bill 693, sponsored by House Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Wright, R-Covington. It carves out more circumstances under which political contributions and expenditures don\u2019t have to be disclosed on a public campaign finance report.\nThe 101-page proposal is difficult to understand for people who don\u2019t deal with campaign finance regulations frequently. Even staff attorneys for the Louisiana Board of Ethics, which enforces the campaign finance laws, admit the changes are confusing.\n\u201cTo be honest with you, it\u2019s going to take quite a grace period to figure all this out,\u201d Ethics Administrator David Bordelon said when presenting the bill to the state ethics board last month.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nPrivate attorneys Stephen Gel\u00e9 and Charles Spies helped write the bill. They have represented Landry in multiple disputes he has had with the ethics board, including over campaign finance laws and enforcement.\nGel\u00e9 has said the proposal respects constitutional rights, including freedom of speech, while still providing transparency and \u201cpreventing the appearance of corruption.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s preeminent government watchdog group disagrees. The Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR) has come out against the legislation, saying the bill would benefit politicians while offering little for the general public.\n\u201cThere is a very large bill, and I don\u2019t quite understand the problem it is trying to solve,\u201d PAR President Steven Procopio said at a legislative hearing last month.\nThe Louisiana House voted to approve the legislation on a 77-16 vote last month. The Senate will start taking up the bill Wednesday, and both chambers need to pass it by the end of the legislative session on June 12.\nIn more than 20 places in the law, the bill increases the minimum dollar threshold at which a donation or expense has to be included on a public campaign finance report.\nFor example, national political committees that raise most of their money outside Louisiana are required to publicly disclose their spending on a Louisiana election once it reaches $20,000. The proposed bill would hike that disclosure threshold to $50,000.\nThe current law also requires any campaign contributions or expenditures over $200 given within the 20 days before the election to be reported on a public campaign finance report. The proposed law would hike that disclosure threshold to $5,000.\nLouisiana set to spend at least $7 million to bring Saudi-owned LIV Golf to New Orleans\nOver a dozen similar changes are also part of the legislation.\nIndividuals who are not political candidates and groups that are not explicitly political committees could also spend money on an election without disclosing contributions they accepted for the politicking.\nThose who are not a candidate or a designated political committee would only be required to disclose election spending over $1,000 in a political cycle and if it involved:\n- federally-regulated broadcast media;\n- 500 pieces of mail;\n- a phone bank of 500 calls within a 30-day period; or\n- digital or print advertising with a candidate\u2019s image that\u2019s distributed in the area the candidate would represent within 30 days of their primary and 60 days of their general election\nThese changes would apply to large, statewide elections and smaller ones such as those for police juries, town councils and school boards.\nMoney spent to communicate with people in a \u201cmembership organization\u201d \u2013 such as a union, industry association or an athletic club \u2013 as well as employees and stockholders of a business also would not have to be reported as a political expense. This could include communication sent to thousands of people at once.\nIn some cases, current campaign finance law obliges people to report this type of spending that would be shielded under the Wright bill. But supporters of the legislation said these exceptions were mainly carved out with so-called social welfare organizations, which already aren\u2019t required to disclose their donors, in mind.\nThe organizations, which critics call \u201cdark money\u201d political groups, are registered with the IRS as 501(c)(4) nonprofits for tax purposes and can keep their contributors private under federal regulations. It\u2019s unclear to what extent the groups have to disclose their spending on Louisiana elections under current state campaign finance laws.\nLandry has set up at least one of these \u201cdark money\u201d groups, Protect Louisiana Values, to advance his political agenda. It also notably put up the money for Landry to rent a live tiger to attend an LSU football game last year.\nDefying Landry, Louisiana lawmakers reject giving him more control over licensing boards\nFormer Gov. John Bel Edwards also established two of his own \u201cdark money\u201d groups during his eight years in office: Rebuild Louisiana and A Stronger Louisiana.\nWhile limiting disclosure on political spending, Wright\u2019s legislation does open up allowable uses of politician\u2019s campaign funds to a much wider group of expenses, including their home mortgages, country club fees and gym memberships.\nThe legislation is also one of a few bills Landry is pushing to soften ethics laws and regulations this session. Lawmakers in favor of them said they are reacting to overzealous enforcement by the ethics board.\nIn 2007, former Gov. Bobby Jindal and legislators passed dozens of restrictions and public disclosure requirements for elected officials and public employees as part of Jindal\u2019s effort to reach a \u201cgold standard\u201d of ethics for Louisiana that would be a model around the country.\nLawmakers are now saying that effort was overreach that needs to be corrected.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t come across an elected official who has enjoyed working through this process and hasn\u2019t questioned what they did back in the Jindal era,\u201d Wright said of ethics and campaign finance regulations.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "17:45\nNews Story\nLouisiana likely to make it harder to sue nursing homes over wrongful deaths\nLouisiana legislators have sent legislation to shield nursing homes from lawsuit damages to Gov. Jeff Landry\u2019s desk. (Getty Images)\nLouisiana lawmakers gave final approval to legislation Tuesday to limit the amount of money nursing home residents and their families receive from lawsuits over injuries, neglect and wrongful deaths.\nSenate Bill 134 has been one of the most controversial bills of the legislative session. Advocacy organizations for seniors and people who are disabled made it a top priority to defeat the bill, saying it would protect nursing homes owners who keep their residents in dangerous situations.\n\u201cWe are supposed to protect the elderly \u2013 not somebody who is trying to make more money off the elderly,\u201d said Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, who opposed the bill.\nSupporters insisted the proposal was not just about nursing homes and would protect a variety of medical facilities from frivolous lawsuits. But Louisiana\u2019s powerful nursing home owners were the primary backers of the bill and made it the focus of their legislative agenda this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have those health care facilities turning in their keys because they can\u2019t do business in this state anymore\u201d if these lawsuits continue, Wes Hataway, policy director for the Louisiana Nursing Home Association, said at a legislative hearing last month.\nThere are more than 60 lawsuits pending against nursing homes across the state that could be limited by the legislation. They are being brought by residents and families, often alleging a loved one developed bedsores or injuries from repeated falls while living at a facility.\nThe lawsuits allege the nursing homes and their management companies don\u2019t hire enough staff to watch the residents adequately, instead prioritizing lower costs and maximum profits.\nThe bill would limit the damages that can be recovered from such a lawsuit. It would bring many of the lawsuits nursing homes currently face under the state Medical Malpractice Act, which caps awards at $500,000.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nRecently, lawsuits against Chateau St. James Rehab and Retirement in Lutcher and Heritage Manor West in Shreveport over infected bedsores that contributed to residents\u2019 deaths had produced awards worth millions of dollars, far more than the legislation would allow.\nNursing home owners are among the state\u2019s biggest political donors and one of the most influential industries at the Louisiana Capitol, focusing many of their contributions on state lawmakers and governors.\nA handful of legislators also have direct ties to the nursing home industry.\nSenate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, are part of the 10-person ownership group of Acadia St. Landry Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Church Point. Their nursing home currently faces a wrongful death lawsuit.\nThe nursing home industry pushed for this bill particularly hard, employing extra lobbyists and recruiting other influential groups such the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry and the Louisiana Hospital Association to support the proposal.\nThe legislation passed easily, with a 58-37 vote in the House Tuesday and a 26-11 vote in the Senate in April. Gov. Jeff Landry could still attempt to block the legislation from passing into a law with a veto however.\nLegislators opposed to the bill attempted to water down the legislation by adding an amendment that would block a nursing home from being put under the $500,000 medical malpractice cap if it was poorly rated by the federal government.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services give nursing homes ratings of one to five stars based on factors such as facility inspections and staffing. The proposed amendment would have permitted lawsuits carrying greater risk to be brought against those nursing homes receiving one- or two-star ratings.\n\u201cDon\u2019t we want our seniors, our family members, our grandparents \u2026to be in a safe space?\u201d asked Rep. Stephanie Hilferty, R-New Orleans, who sponsored the amendment on the House side.\nBacked by AARP and other advocates for seniors, similar amendments failed in both chambers, with the Senate voting one down 20-16 and the House voting one down 57-39.\nLouisiana has some of the worst-rated nursing homes in the country, with approximately two-thirds of the facilities receiving one- and two-star ratings, according to Hilferty. She said those poorly-rated nursing homes make up 50% of such facilities in Metairie, which she represents in part, and more than 70% of nursing homes in Baton Rouge.\nRep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, defended the nursing home industry on the House floor, saying the facilities might face challenges with keeping residents healthy because of Louisiana\u2019s high rates of obesity and diabetes. He also said the state\u2019s general shortage of nurses contributes to low staffing at the facilities.\n\u201cYou cannot address this without addressing the shortage of registered nurses,\u201d he said.\nMelerine\u2019s law partner, Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, is one of the sponsors of the legislation. Seabaugh is an attorney who was representing a nursing home facing a lawsuit over neglect in Bossier Parish. A jury ruled in favor of Seabaugh and the nursing home after a two-week trial last month.\nCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect that a jury made the decision over a lawsuit about a nursing home in which Sen. Alan Seabaugh represented the home.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Rachel Mipro/Louisiana Illuminator)\nHurricane season descends on Louisiana this year amidst a cloud of federal uncertainty. Despite fears over massive staffing cuts and the threatened dissolution of key agencies that help forecast hurricanes and support storm recovery, Gov. Jeff Landry doubled down Tuesday on his belief that Louisiana is prepared should a natural disaster strike.\nLandry said he had spoken at length with U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and didn\u2019t anticipate any big changes \u2013 at least in the next few months.\n\u201cI do not believe that the president or the White House has any intention of revamping FEMA while hurricane season is in play,\u201d Landry said at a news conference held at the Governor\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.\n\u201cWe are working closely with FEMA,\u201d GOHSEP interim director Brig. Gen. Jason Mahfouz, said, adding that federal assistance \u201chas been validated and pledged to us\u201d in the case of a storm overwhelming the state\u2019s ability to respond.\nUncertainty over FEMA\u2019s ability to stand up a disaster response heightened Monday when the agency\u2019s director, David Hutchinson, reportedly told staffers at a meeting that he was unaware the U.S. had a hurricane season. The White House said Tuesday that Hutchinson was joking.\nIn addition to FEMA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has also been the target of large staffing cuts since President Donald Trump returned to office. The National Weather Service and its National Hurricane Center are part of NOAA, a subagency of the Department of Commerce.\n\u201cI have not heard from anyone that those cuts are impacting the information that would flow up to the states,\u201d Landry said.\nThe turmoil in Washington, D.C., comes as the 2025 hurricane season is \u201cvery likely going to be another active year in the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d state climatologist Jay Grymes said, adding that he was confident \u201cour tropical coverage this season will be more than adequate for what we require.\u201d\nAs the storm season starts, neighboring states Arkansas and Mississippi have experienced delays and denials in getting federal emergency aid declarations from President Trump after being hit by tornadoes in recent months.\nStill, the governor maintained his confidence in federal support should a storm hit, saying he believed the only change might be more \u201cflexibility\u201d with state control of disaster response should the need arise .\n\u201cThe states have always maintained the first responsibility anyhow,\u201d Landry said. \u201cFEMA and the White House and our congressional delegation will ensure that Louisiana receives the resources it needs.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Ximena Arias-Cristobal knows the risks that can come with driving as a person living in the U.S. without legal authorization, where a simple traffic stop could lead to being deported.\nThat fear materialized last month when she was pulled over by local police in Dalton, Georgia, for making an improper turn at a red light, but instead of a traffic ticket, the 19-year-old was detained at Stewart Detention Center for nearly three weeks, she said at a virtual event Tuesday.\n\u201cEven though my time there was short \u2026 the emotional weight is overwhelming,\u201d Arias-Cristobal said during a panel conversation organized by advocacy groups opposing the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown on students without legal authorization and international students.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just an immigration issue, it\u2019s a human rights issue,\u201d Arias-Cristobal said.\nShe and her parents arrived in the United States without legal authorization from Mexico when Arias-Cristobal was 4 years old. Her father was in the car with her last month and was also detained at the Stewart Detention Center, she said. He has since been released.\n\u201cWhat affected me the most was the transfer itself, being shackled at the waist and ankles,\u201d Arias-Cristobal said of being transferred by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to Stewart Detention Center.\nArias-Cristobal is eligible to apply for deportation protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy. DACA allows some people who were brought into the country as children without legal authorization to obtain a drivers license and work permits and remain in the country, under certain conditions.\nBut the agency that issues such protections, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, stopped accepting applications in 2021 as part of a court case from Republican state officials challenging DACA\u2019s legality.\nThe case remains pending and is likely to head to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nArias-Cristobal now faces deportation to Mexico as she tries to complete her higher education at Dalton State College, where she is studying economics and finance.\nImpact on higher education\nGaby Pacheco, president and CEO of advocacy group TheDream.US, said that cases like Arias-Cristobal\u2019s are becoming more common under the second Trump administration and that \u201cDreamers are under attack.\u201d\nPachecos\u2019 group provides scholarships to young immigrants without legal status, including Arias-Cristobal, to pursue higher education.\nShe said that while DACA recipients have not been caught in deportations, \u201cwe have heard of people (being) held and questioned\u201d by ICE agents.\n\u201cThe level of cruelty, inhumanity and lawlessness that we\u2019re seeing from the Department of Homeland Security\u2026 is completely alarming,\u201d Pacheco said.\nThat type of immigration enforcement has impacted higher education, said Miriam Feldblum, the president of the Presidents\u2019 Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, which advocates for international students and students without proper legal authority to attend college.\nThe Department of Homeland Security informed Harvard University last month that it was revoking the Ivy League school\u2019s ability to accept international students. A federal court has temporarily blocked the move while the case is pending.\n\u201cThis will directly harm our enrollment at U.S. institutions,\u201d she said of the Trump administration\u2019s stance on limiting how many international students can attend higher education.\nFeldblum said that because international students pay full tuition, those costs often subsidize scholarships for U.S. students.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)\nThis report has been updated.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration sent its first spending cuts request to Congress on Tuesday, asking lawmakers to swiftly eliminate $9.4 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs.\nThe request for what are called rescissions allows the White House budget office to legally freeze spending on those accounts for 45 days while the Republican-controlled Congress debates whether to approve the recommendation in full or in part, or to ignore it.\nThe proposal calls on lawmakers to eliminate $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. That means NPR and PBS would lose their already approved federal allocations, if the request is approved by Congress.\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order in May seeking to block the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from providing funding for NPR and PBS, leading to two separate lawsuits citing First Amendment concerns.\nIn the rescissions request, Trump wants to cut $8.3 billion from foreign aid programs, including the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, a global initiative to combat HIV/AIDS, and the African Development Foundation.\nThe proposal is the first of several that will seek to codify efforts undertaken by U.S. DOGE Service and billionaire Elon Musk before he left his official role as a special government employee.\nWhite House budget director Russ Vought wrote in a letter accompanying the request that it \u201cemphasizes the need to cut wasteful foreign assistance spending at the Department of State and USAID and through other international assistance programs.\u201d\n\u201cThese rescissions would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests, such as funding the World Health Organization, LGBTQI+ activities, \u2018equity\u2019 programs, radical Green New Deal-type policies, and color revolutions in hostile places around the world,\u201d Vought wrote. \u201cIn addition, Federal spending on CPB subsidizes a public media system that is politically biased and is an unnecessary expense to the taxpayer.\u201d\nGOP leaders in Congress appear likely to hold floor votes on the request, which only needs a simple majority to pass the Senate, avoiding the need for Democratic support to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., wrote in a statement the House \u201cwill act quickly on this request.\u201d\n\u201cThis rescissions package reflects many of DOGE\u2019s findings and is one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cCongress will continue working closely with the White House to codify these recommendations, and the House will bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.\u201d\nBut Republican leaders could run into problems with centrist Republicans in each chamber, especially those on the Appropriations committees, which approved the funding in the first place.\nThe GOP holds especially narrow majorities in Congress, requiring the support of nearly every one of the 220 Republicans in the House and the party\u2019s 53 senators.\nRepublican leaders may need to negotiate what exactly gets written into the rescissions bill if too many moderate Republicans raise objections to cutting off the funding.\nSenate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, wrote in a statement the committee \u201cwill carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations.\u201d\nForeign aid, public media take hits\nThe request calls for lawmakers to make cuts to dozens of foreign aid programs, including $500 million out of $4 billion for certain global health programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\u201cThis proposal would not reduce treatment but would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like \u2018family planning\u2019 and \u2018reproductive health,\u2019 LGBTQI+ activities, and \u2018equity\u2019 programs,\u201d the request states. \u201cThis rescission proposal aligns with the Administration\u2019s efforts to eliminate wasteful USAID foreign assistance programs.\u201d\nThe rescissions request proposes Congress eliminate $400 million of the $6 billion for global health programs that seek to control HIV/AIDS, which OMB writes \u201cwould eliminate only those programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests.\u201d\nThe request asks lawmakers to eliminate $2.5 billion of the $3.9 billion they approved for development assistance, which \u201cis intended to fund programs that work to end extreme poverty and promote resilient, democratic societies, but in practice, many of the DA programs conflict with American values, interfere with the sovereignty of other countries, and bankroll corrupt leaders\u2019 evasion of their responsibilities to their citizens, all while providing no clear benefit to Americans.\u201d\nThe proposal calls on lawmakers to eliminate more than $1 billion in funding across two fiscal years for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which the administration wrote \u201cwould be used to subsidize a public media system that is politically biased and an unnecessary expense to the taxpayer.\u201d\nPresident and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Patricia Harrison wrote in a statement the organization \u201cis firmly committed to ensuring that funding for public media provides local communities with accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news and information, and we take seriously concerns about bias that have been raised.\n\u201cThe path to better public media is achievable only if funding is maintained. Otherwise, a vital lifeline that operates reliable emergency communications, supports early learning, and keeps local communities connected and informed will be cut off with regrettable and lasting consequences.\u201d\nPresident and CEO of PBS Paula Kerger wrote in a separate statement that the \u201cproposed rescissions would have a devastating impact on PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations that rely on federal funding for a larger portion of their budgets.\n\u201cWithout PBS member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis.\u201d\nKerger wrote that PBS would seek to keep its funding by demonstrating \u201cour value to Congress, as we have over the last 50 years, in providing educational, enriching programs and critical services to all Americans every day for free.\u201d\nNPR CEO Katherine Maher wrote that Congress enacting the rescissions \u201cwould irreparably harm communities across America who count on public media for 24/7 news, music, cultural and educational programming, and emergency alerting services.\u201d\n\u201cPublic safety in every community across the nation could also be affected. NPR, as the entity chosen by public radio stations to operate the nationwide Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS), receives Presidential-level emergency alerts and distributes them across the country within minutes,\u201d Maher wrote. \u201cIn the event of a national attack or emergency, communities no longer served by a station would not receive this lifesaving, early warning and civil defense alert.\u201d\nMore details\nA summary of the proposal shared with States Newsroom by the White House budget office ahead of its official release later in the day says the funding cuts would affect programs that sought to reduce xenophobia in Venezuela; support electoral reforms and voter education in Kenya; fund voter identification in Haiti; provide electric buses in Rwanda; broadcast the longtime PBS children\u2019s show \u201cSesame Street\u201d in Iraq; and strengthen the resilience of LGBTQ global movements.\nThe proposal would also cut off funding to Harvard University to conduct research models for peace and to New York University to analyze democracy field experiments in South Sudan, according to the OMB summary.\nPEPFAR would no longer have funding for circumcision, vasectomies, and condoms in Zambia, or for services for \u201ctransgender people, sex workers and their clients and sexual networks\u201d in Nepal, according to the OMB summary.\nLouisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a vocal supporter of PEPFAR, said during a brief interview that he was told \u201cthat PEPFAR had some cuts, but that the basic core mission was continued.\u201d\nCassidy \u2014 chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 said his staff was carefully reviewing the request and knows he cares \u201cabout this deeply.\u201d\nThe rescissions request, which asks lawmakers to claw back already approved funding, is different from the president\u2019s budget request, which proposes spending levels for thousands of federal programs for the upcoming fiscal year.\nBoth are merely proposals, since the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse in Article I, Section 9, Clause 7.\nTiming on Senate floor vote unclear\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Monday that lawmakers in that chamber will begin reviewing the rescissions request this month, but didn\u2019t detail exactly when he\u2019d hold a floor vote.\n\u201cAnother item high on our list to begin work on in June is a rescissions package the White House intends to send Congress this week,\u201d Thune said. \u201cThe administration has identified a number of wasteful uses of taxpayer dollars and we will be taking up this package and eliminating this waste. We\u2019ll make that a priority.\u201d\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Monday that \u201cTrump is looking to go after PBS and NPR to settle political scores and muzzle the free press, while undermining foreign assistance programs that push back on China\u2019s malign influence, save lives, and address other bipartisan priorities.\u201d\n\u201cIf Republicans choose to go along with this rescission package, they will follow Trump at their peril,\u201d Schumer and Murray wrote. \u201cThe power of the purse is one of Congress\u2019s most fundamental Constitutional responsibilities. Democrats will not allow Republicans to play games with the budget.\u201d\nLouisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy said during a brief interview Tuesday that he plans to \u201ccarefully\u201d evaluate the rescissions request.\nWest Virginia GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said Tuesday that she would go over the proposals once it officially arrives from the White House to determine whether she can support moving it across the floor.\n\u201cIt could be a fight. It could not be a fight,\u201d Capito said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a group of far-right members led by Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, posted Monday its members hope the administration sends additional rescissions requests as quickly as possible.\n\u201cPassing this rescissions package will be an important demonstration of Congress\u2019s willingness to deliver on DOGE and the Trump agenda,\u201d the Freedom Caucus statement said. \u201cWhile the Swamp will inevitably attempt to slow and kill these cuts, there is no excuse for a Republican House not to advance the first DOGE rescissions package the same week it is presented to Congress then quickly send it for passage in the Republican Senate so President Trump can sign it into law.\u201d\nLast updated 4:54 p.m., Jun. 3, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "5:00\nNews Story\nRed Alert: Public reported problems at Atalco refinery long before inspectors found levee breaches\nSome residents link health problems to Cancer Alley facilities like Atalco\nEastbound drivers on Jefferson Highway near the Atalco refinery are welcomed to St. James Parish with an anti-littering sign barely legible beneath a layer of chemical residue emitted by Atalco. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)\nGRAMERCY \u2014 There\u2019s a small area along the Mississippi River\u2019s east bank where the land, buildings and roadways are rust-colored and where the air is frequently filled with the same mineral that covers the surface of Mars.\nThat spot, about 45 miles west-northwest of New Orleans, is near the entrance of the Atlantic Alumina plant, also known as Atalco, the only bauxite refinery in the United States. Bauxite is a rock composed of aluminum oxides and other heavy metals such as iron oxide \u2014 the same compound that gives Mars its famous rusty hue.\nPeriodically, the rust-colored bauxite dust travels across the river and blankets the small, historically-Black community of Wallace or travels west to Gramercy or east to Garyville. In other instances, Atalco has discharged large plumes of white-colored dust from the refined alumina as far as 4 miles from the facility. The plant occupies roughly 3 square miles of land that straddles the border of St. James Parish and St. John the Baptist Parish.\nWallace resident Jo Banner is well known for her work as a watchdog of industrial pollution and expansion in the River Parishes. She and her twin sister, Joy, run the Descendants Project, a nonprofit that advocates for protecting the land and lives of Black residents whose ancestors were enslaved on the many antebellum plantations that lined the Mississippi River during the Confederacy.\n\u201cOur families have suffered from pollution and the dangerous conditions of this plant for generations,\u201d Jo Banner said of the Atalco facility. \u201cOur homes, our cars, and even our pets are covered in red dust, and that\u2019s just what we can see. What we can\u2019t see is even more dangerous, especially to our health.\u201d\nFor Shamell Lavigne, the red remnants from Atalco are one of the many industry-caused hazards of living in St. James Parish. She is an organizer with Rise St. James, another local activist group that focuses on environmental justice.\n\u201cAny given day you can pass by over there and, if the wind is blowing a certain way, it\u2019s blowing that red dust,\u201d Lavigne said.\nFor years, Lavigne said, rumors have circled in the community that the dust particles from Atalco might contain mercury or arsenic. Both toxic metals have been found in the chemical slurry that spilled from recent levee breaks around Atalco\u2019s manmade \u201cred mud\u201d lakes.\nThe series of levee breaches dating back to last year are detailed in thousands of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration.\nThe toxic waste has repeatedly escaped from containment areas and contaminated a public drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp. Lab testing of the soil and water from the impacted public areas found poisonous heavy metal elements \u2014 some at concentrations far beyond the legal and safe limits, according to government records.\nWhen asked for comment, an LDEQ spokesman only confirmed that an investigation into Atalco was ongoing. For Atalco\u2019s part, a company official acknowledged but refused to respond to multiple interview requests from the Illuminator.\nGramercy resident Gail LeBoeuf, 72, has lived roughly half a mile from the Atalco facility since 1999 and believes it could be a source of some of her health problems.\nShe was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2022, adding to the prevalence of cases along the Mississippi River corridor that go back decades. It has given rise to the label \u201cCancer Alley\u201d to describe the area between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, where the population has one of the highest concentrations of cancer diagnoses in the nation, according to data from the EPA\u2019s air toxin mapping tool.\nStudies have linked the cancer to the area\u2019s high levels of pollution, especially in predominantly Black fenceline communities next to industrial facilities. Nearly 70% of Gramercy residents are Black, according to U.S. Census figures. This includes LeBoeuf, who also has bronchitis that she believes could be the result of Atalco\u2019s particulate matter discharges.\nResidents, some as far as 5 miles from the plant, periodically find their property and vehicles covered in a layer of red bauxite dust or white powder from the making of alumina.\nElevated levels of arsenic are present in the waste product of alumina refining. Recent medical studies have found that even low levels of arsenic exposure through drinking water can cause bronchitis and certain other respiratory diseases, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think it\u2019s not environmentally related,\u201d LeBoeuf said of her illnesses, though she added that her doctors can\u2019t say for certain how much the industrial pollution is to blame.\nPollution by air, land and water\nNeighbors of the Atalco alumina refinery face exposure to dust and waste throughout the process, according to a review of regulatory documents. Plus, the facility has repeatedly poured toxic waste into the Mississippi River \u2014 and skirted the blame.\nFrom its dock on the river, the Atalco facility receives constant shipments of crushed bauxite ore from its mining operation in Jamaica, where it is extracted near communities that \u2014 just like in Louisiana \u2014 are routinely caked in a layer of red dust.\nWhen the ships arrive at Atalco, the dock has a system that unloads the bauxite powder from the ship and into a hopper connected to a conveyor belt that carries it into the refinery. Unloading the bauxite from the ship into the hopper is one of the more environmentally risky points in the process because it is prone to spills and wind exposure that carries the red dust into the atmosphere. The company recently installed a fogging system on the conveyor in an effort to minimize the wind-blown dust, though records show it has broken down at times.\nThe fogger also does nothing to minimize airborne dust from the dried chemical residues in Atalco\u2019s red mud lakes.\nAlthough Atalco was formally notified of the levee breaches surrounding its lakes in August, there were many earlier signs of trouble at the facility.\nLDEQ\u2019s file on the company contains multiple reports about the facility\u2019s pollution leaving chemical residues on homes, vehicles, plants and waterways.\nAtalco has an interior system of containment ditches designed to catch chemical spills, stormwater runoff and the wastewater used to process the bauxite. The system is separate from the public drainage ditches that run along the highways outside of the facility. One of Atalco\u2019s ditch systems has an outfall pipe that drains into the Mississippi River, so LDEQ requires the company to treat its process wastewater \u2014 which is water used for industrial processes \u2014 to keep it relatively free from hazardous contaminants and monitor it with basic water quality testing such as \u201cpotential for hydrogen\u201d or pH levels.\nClean water has a neutral pH of around 7.0 on a 14-point scale. Values below 7 are considered acidic, while values above it are considered alkaline. Any extremes at either end of the scale, below 4 and above 10, often indicate the presence of dissolved chemicals that can be hazardous or even fatal to humans, animals and plant life.\nUnder the provisions of its river outfall permit, Atalco is prohibited from discharging wastewater with a pH over 10.0 for more than 446 minutes, or just over 7 hours per month, an EPA standard. Most fish cannot survive in water with a pH level over 9.5. Atalco\u2019s outfall monitor consistently detected amounts far greater in the months leading up to the discovery of the red mud lake levee breaches in August 2024.\nOne of the highest readings occurred in February 2024, when the facility discharged waste with a pH of 13.2 for a total of over 19,000 minutes \u2014 nearly two weeks. That discharge was 43 times greater than what the EPA allows. Records show Atalco exceeded that permit limit almost every month \u2014 discharging highly caustic chemicals into the Mississippi River \u2014 going as far back as July 2023.\nIn nearly every occurrence, the company blamed either the weather or some other third party, telling LDEQ the discharges could not have been prevented. For the discharge in February 2024, Atalco blamed it on a power outage and a lack of steady suppliers for the chemicals needed to neutralize high pH discharge, records show. The state has not penalized the company for those incidents.\nHotline complaint\nOn April 10, 2024, authorities received a more specific warning sign. Someone filed an anonymous complaint with the National Response Center regarding a \u201crelease of an unknown red and orange material onto the ground and into the roadside ditches\u201d surrounding the Atalco plant, according to LDEQ records.\n\u201cCaller states that nothing has been done for clean up and the vegetation is dead in that area,\u201d the complaint noted.\nThe National Response Center is a federal communications center that manages a 24-hour hotline for the reporting of chemical spills, train derailments and port security incidents throughout the country. Most complaints reported come from government officials or workers in the industrial and transportation sectors.\nU.S. Coast Guard Coast personnel who staff the hotline are trained to screen complaints and, if necessary, forward them to the agencies most appropriate to respond. For this complaint, the Coast Guard wrote an incident report and immediately notified LDEQ.\nThe state agency initiated an investigation but did not visit the facility until 10 days later. During that site visit, the state inspector drove along the highways surrounding the Atalco plant but did not see anything suspicious in the ditches.\nThe LDEQ inspector then called Atalco on April 22, 2024 \u2014 12 days after the complaint \u2014 to ask about the allegation. Atalco\u2019s environmental manager, Charlotte Hooker, told LDEQ that heavy rainfall brought a lot of surface water to the facility. She acknowledged the plant saw a spike in discharges into the Mississippi River but denied that Atalco was polluting the public ditches outside of the facility.\nDuring the company\u2019s discussion with LDEQ, someone noted that the anonymous caller may have simply witnessed run-off from nearby farmland with red-orange colored soil, according to the inspector\u2019s report.\nLDEQ accepted Atalco\u2019s explanation and closed the investigation, according to state records.\nIf the investigation had continued, Lavigne said LDEQ might have discovered the levee breaches sooner but doubts if it would have made much of a difference. She said the agency doesn\u2019t do much to compel companies to prevent accidents or clean them up when they happen. She and other residents said authorities are reluctant to enforce regulations because of Atalco\u2019s status as the only remaining alumina plant in the country.\n\u201cI do think that they\u2019re protected in that sense,\u201d Lavigne said.\nAtalco became the only remaining domestic source of alumina in the United States after the only other bauxite refinery, L\u2019Alumina, located in Ascension Parish, closed in 2020.\nThey\u2019re the only alumina plant in the country, so they ride that horse every time they get in trouble.\n\u2013 Craig Calcagano, Gramercy town alderman\nPrevious infractions\nFollowing a 2017 compliance inspection, LDEQ cited Atalco for 78 state Environmental Quality Act violations, mostly related to the company\u2019s air pollution permit. In 2020, the state negotiated a fine of $75,000 and allowed Atalco to deny any wrongdoing.\nAt the federal level, the Mine Safety and Health Administration has cited Atalco for 370 violations since 2021 mostly for caustic material spills, according to an Advocate report. The company paid over a half-million dollars in fines related to those violations.\nThe residents of St. James and St. John parishes have long been aware of Atalco\u2019s incidents and say the threat of fines has done little to curb the company\u2019s pollution practices.\nKristy Cambre, a long-time resident of one of the Gramercy neighborhoods closest to Atalco, noticed a layer of white dust covering her vehicle the morning of May 23.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t just wash off quickly or normally,\u201d Cambre said. \u201cSome spots kind of bubbled almost like I was rinsing off a soap.\u201d\nThe red dustings used to appear more frequently, but Cambre and other residents are now seeing more of the white substance.\nThe red dust comes from the raw bauxite ore or the dried residue from the red mud lakes, while the white dust is the refined alumina. Mounds of the refined alumina piled on the ground can be seen from the roadways when driving by the facility, and clouds of both white and red dust can be seen coming from Atalco\u2019s shipping dock and its conveyor belts on a daily basis.\nOccasionally, something goes wrong at the facility that causes much larger air pollution events that can be seen from afar such as the incident Jo Banner captured on video last week.\nCambre said she never reports the more frequent dustings to authorities, but some of her neighbors have. LDEQ\u2019s file on the company is filled with incident reports prompted by citizen complaints, mostly about the chemical dust and about rust-colored water filling the public ditches.\nIn most of those cases, LDEQ records show inspectors would not substantiate the complaints, writing that they have no way of knowing whether the red dust came from Atalco or some nearby farms.\nFarms surrounding Atalco grow sugarcane, and the Illuminator could not find any with finely powdered rust-colored soil.\nIn most cases, the inspectors reported in their records that they spoke with Atalco executives but never that they spoke with any of the farmers who purportedly have rust-colored soil.\n\u201cThey\u2019re turning a blind eye to it,\u201d LeBoeuf said.\nCraig Calcagano, alderman-at-large for the town of Gramercy, agreed with LeBoeuf\u2019s assessment. He said he first noticed Atalco\u2019s lakes leaking waste in early 2024 and reported it to both the company and LDEQ, but nothing was ever done about them, he said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the only alumina plant in the country, so they ride that horse every time they get in trouble,\u201d Calcagano said.\nThe company has occasionally paid some fines over the years, but nothing has really changed because the pollution continues, Calcagano said. Atalco\u2019s chemicals cover his property on an almost daily basis, he said. The public drainage ditches run red when it rains, and the Blind River Swamp across from the facility is dying, according to the alderman.\n\u201cWhen it starts destroying everything you got, which you work all your life for like everybody around here, what can you do?\u201d Calcagano asked. \u201cWhen we complain, we complain on deaf ears because they don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d\nAtalco\u2019s pollution also affects people who don\u2019t live near the plant such as Teresa Williams, who works at a facility down the road from Atalco and said her car gets splattered with rust-colored residue every time she drives to and from her job.\nGary Watson, a Wallace native who still owns property there but now lives in New Orleans, said the pollution is one of the reasons he left.\n\u201cThere should be outrage,\u201d Watson said after he was told of the levee breaches.\nLavigne, the community activist, said she is concerned about the people who work at Atalco who might be exposed to the toxic chemicals.\nOne of the more notable incidents occurred July 5, 1999, when an explosion at the plant injured 29 people and dispersed caustic waste. A federal Mine Safety and Health Administration investigation found that a power outage led to a buildup of pressure in the four giant tanks used to heat the caustic slurry.\nLDEQ records indicate the facility has seen numerous other incidents in recent years, including seven incidents since May 2022, resulting in chemical and diesel spills, severe burns to workers that required hospitalization and one death when 45-year-old Curtis Diggs fell into a pit of sodium hydroxide because a grate used to cover the area was missing. (Read more below)\nIn previous incidents, Atalco has always claimed its red dust is non-hazardous, which is also a position the EPA still holds. However, recent studies have linked bauxite dust exposure to certain diseases.\nThis additional research has prompted the EPA to issue warnings about bauxite\u2019s potential to contain toxic metals and trace radioactive elements, though the toxicity is generally more concentrated in the red mud byproduct.\nOne of the dangers with Atalco\u2019s red mud lakes, aside from levee breaches, is the potential for the toxic metal to leach into the groundwater, LSU environmental scientist Slawomir Lomnicki said.\nAnother risk is that the red mud in the lakes can dry out and turn into airborne dust that can be carried off by the wind, according to Ganga Hettiarachchi, a professor of soil and environmental chemistry at Kansas State University.\nIt\u2019s unclear what, if any, consequences Atalco will face in connection with its many permit violations. So far, LDEQ has issued a warning letter for 23 violations in connection with the levee breaches, providing little solace to some of the residents in St. James Parish.\n\u201cIt looks like, you know, they\u2019re gonna be protected,\u201d Lavigne said. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely one of the plants that\u2019s been on our list of really dirty plants.\u201d\n\u2022 May 3, 2022 \u2014 A large semi-trailer generator caught fire at the facility, spilling about 250 gallons of diesel into a storm drain.\n\u2022 June 9, 2022 \u2014 An Atalco employee was hospitalized with severe chemical burns from a spillage of sodium hydroxide, which the report defined as an \u201cextremely hazardous\u201d caustic liquid.\n\u2022 Nov. 7, 2022 \u2014 An Atalco employee suffered chemical burns to his neck, chest and arm from a spillage of caustic liquid.\n\u2022 Feb. 6, 2023 \u2014 Two Atalco workers were hospitalized with severe chemical burns and a third suffered minor injuries after a tank of caustic liquid overflowed and spilled onto them.\n\u2022 Jan. 7, 2024 \u2014 Four Atalco workers were hospitalized with severe chemical burns after a valve failed, spraying them with what records described as an \u201cextremely hazardous\u201d caustic liquid. The company blamed the workers.\n\u2022 May 4, 2024 \u2014 A white crystalline substance blanketed cars, homes, plants and other outdoor surfaces in Gramercy, Lutcher and Paulina. Parish and state authorities figured out it was aluminum oxide coming from Atalco, and the company admitted it was the result of a broken dust valve. Still, Atalco deflected blame, telling LDEQ the failure of the valve could not be anticipated. A later root cause analysis determined the company should have performed more frequent inspections of the equipment.\n\u2022 Aug. 4, 2024 \u2014 A contract worker, 45-year-old Curtis Diggs of Baton Rouge, fell into a sump of sodium hydroxide because part of the grate that covered the pit was missing. He was airlifted to a New Orleans hospital with severe chemical burns and died about a month later. A MSHA investigation faulted the company for \u201caggravated conduct\u201d that involved an extraordinary pattern of negligence.\nCorrection: Shamell Lavigne lives in St. James Parish but not in the Wallace community as a previous version of this article mistakenly reported. We sincerely apologize for the mistake and are grateful to the reader who pointed it out.\nUpdate: This article was updated with a quote from Jo Banner, who gave the Illuminator the video footage of the red dust release at Atalco.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "Clouds pass over Tiger Stadium on Monday, March 20, 2023, on LSU\u2019s campus in Baton Rouge, La. (Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)\nOne of Gov. Jeff Landry\u2019s appointees to the LSU Board of Supervisors flew into a rage at LSU Health Shreveport when its staff would not perform a house call for her husband, threatening to fire multiple employees, according to a whistleblower complaint. She\u2019s also the subject of other complaints that allege she harassed several employees and meddled in the day-to-day operations of the medical school.\nEsperanza Moran, who openly rallied for the dismissal of former LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick, is the subject of an anonymous whistleblower complaint, at least one Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint filed by top LSU Health Shreveport employees and a separate complaint filed to Landry by a top administrator.\nThe Illuminator obtained documents cited in this report through a series of public records requests to LSU and the governor\u2019s office.\nAccording to an anonymous whistleblower complaint filed with LSU, Moran went to LSU Health Shreveport just days after being appointed to the board and \u201c[caused] a public scene in outrage\u201d that an employee was not permitted to treat her husband at Moran\u2019s private residence.\n\u201cThis incident has caused significant distress within the LSU Health Shreveport community, affecting the staff\u2019s health, morale and productivity,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cWhile causing the disturbance, Ms. Moran threatened to terminate staff and said she was the new chancellor and in charge of LSU Health Shreveport.\u201d\nThe complaint goes on to say that Moran threatened to have Guzick, Sammy Wyatt, LSU Health Shreveport\u2019s chief compliance and investigation officer, and Sharon Dunn, vice chancellor for academic administration, fired from the university.\nGuzick resigned from his position in April after Moran\u2019s months-long pressure campaign and has since accepted a position with the LSU System office. Dunn and Wyatt are still employed at LSU Health Shreveport.\nWyatt asked the governor to intervene, adding Moran\u2019s alleged actions are damaging to his personal and professional reputation, disrupting his ability to do his job as well as damaging LSU Health Shreveport\u2019s public trust.\n\u201cI am writing to request your assistance in resolving an ongoing issue with Ms. Esperanza Moran,\u201d Wyatt wrote to Landry in December. \u201cShe has been consciously, intentionally, and maliciously defaming, harassing, targeting, and retaliating against me, utilizing Power-Based Violence and creating a hostile working environment.\u201d\nPower-based violence is a term found in a 2021 Louisiana law approved in the wake of a Title IX scandal at LSU. It is defined as \u201cany form of interpersonal violence intended to control or intimidate another person through the assertion of power over the person.\u201d\nWhen a reporter asked her about the complaints after her Senate confirmation hearing at the State Capitol last week, Moran requested questions be sent to her via email. She has not responded to the emailed questions.\nLandry spokeswoman Kate Kelly and LSU spokesman Todd Woodward have not responded to requests for comment.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nIn its public records request to the governor\u2019s office, the Illuminator asked for any documents containing Landry\u2019s response to Wyatt\u2019s letter. No documents were provided.\nMoran has not yet received state Senate confirmation. Senators typically vote to confirm governor\u2019s appointees in batches and are expected to endorse Moran by the time the legislative session adjourns June 12.\nSen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, who represents Moran\u2019s district, said he would support Moran despite the complaints, noting that she has Landry\u2019s support.\nEsperanza Moran lives in Shreveport and is married to wealthy businessman Scott Moran. The couple own several businesses, including Moran Oil Co., and give generously to Republican political campaigns, including Landry\u2019s.\nThe Morans also donate significant sums to LSU athletics, culminating in a plaza outside Tiger Stadium being named after Scott Moran when he gave money toward the 2012 remodel of the facility.\nWyatt referred questions about his complaint to his attorney, Steve Soileau, adding that he is considering suing over Moran\u2019s conduct.\n\u201cDue to the status of the investigations and referred investigations and possibilities of litigation, we do not feel it would be appropriate to comment on specific items at this time,\u201d Soileau said in response to questions about Wyatt\u2019s letter to Landry. \u201cMr. Wyatt\u2019s letter speaks for itself and he stands by it. His EEOC complaint is still pending.\u201d\nThe \u201creferred investigations\u201d involve Wyatt\u2019s work as the medical school\u2019s chief investigation officer. According to Wyatt\u2019s letter to the governor, some of these probes have been into Moran\u2019s personal friends, and one has been referred to the FBI, which Wyatt said in his complaint is looking into the incident along with state law enforcement.\nIt\u2019s unusual for a university board member to be the subject of an EEOC complaint, according to several longtime higher education observers. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a federal entity responsible for investigating workplace discrimination.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of supervisors come and go over the years, but I have never encountered anything quite like that,\u201d said Kevin Cope, an LSU professor that has been involved in faculty governance at LSU for multiple decades. He was contacted for reaction to Moran\u2019s alleged actions. \u201cIn fact, although the supervisors and I have disagreed, I will say the supervisors usually behave themselves pretty well. So this I will characterize as highly unusual, not only for LSU, but indeed for the nation and for higher education.\u201d\nPolitically appointed board members are not meant to be involved in the day-to-day running of a university, as it could threaten a school\u2019s accreditation. But the complaints allege Moran did just that.\nLSU closed its investigation into the anonymous complaint just days after it was filed, according to the case file the Illuminator obtained. A reporter reached out to every individual named in the complaint as possibly involved. Some did not respond, but others confirmed they were not contacted for the investigation. Woodward did not respond when asked why not all of the people named were contacted.\nDuring her Senate confirmation hearing, Moran was asked about the leadership of LSU Health Shreveport.\n\u201cThere still needs to be some things cleared up,\u201d Moran said. \u201cWhen you get the leadership working right, then everything trickles down, so I\u2019m still working on that. I still have a little bit of work left to do.\u201d\nBoard members do not have sole authority to decide who staffs administrative positions in a university. Though sometimes they are involved in search committees to hire a top administrator, their influence is weighted by faculty, staff, students and community members.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by John McDonnell/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is personally working to facilitate the return of a man wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, at the request of the Department of Homeland Security, the Trump administration said on Monday in court documents.\nIf successful, the man, identified in documents in federal court in Maryland only by the pseudonym of \u201cCristian,\u201d would be the first deported person returned from the brutal Salvadoran Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.\nBringing him back to the United States would also contradict the Trump administration\u2019s long-running argument in the courts and to the public that El Salvador has custody over hundreds of men sent there in March, not the U.S.\nThe Trump-appointed judge in Cristian\u2019s case on Friday had blasted the administration for not detailing to her its actions to return him.\nThe Trump administration has made the same argument in the case of another wrongly deported man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland, despite a U.S. Supreme Court order to facilitate his return.\nTrump and other top U.S. officials have alleged Abrego Garcia is a gang member, though there is no evidence of that. President Donald Trump has also acknowledged he could bring Abrego Garcia back if he wanted to do so.\n\u2018Prompt and diligent efforts on behalf of the United States\u2019\nThe court document in Cristian\u2019s case filed Monday by U.S. Department of Homeland Security official Mellissa B. Harper says that Rubio \u201chas a personal relationship\u201d with El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele and Salvadoran government officials that dates back over a decade to the Florida Republican\u2019s time on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.\nThe case is being heard in Baltimore, in the District of Maryland.\n\u201cBased on this deep experience with El Salvador and the Secretary\u2019s familiarity with political and diplomatic sensitivities in that country, he is personally handling the discussions with the government of El Salvador regarding persons subject to the Court\u2019s order detained in El Salvador,\u201d according to the document.\n\u201cSecretary Rubio has read and understands this Court\u2019s order, and wants to assure this Court that he is committed to making prompt and diligent efforts on behalf of the United States to comply with that order,\u201d the document continues.\nThe document notes that DHS has asked the State Department for \u201cassistance in complying with the Court\u2019s order, including by entering into negotiations to facilitate Cristian\u2019s return.\u201d\nHarper, who submitted the declaration, works at Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations division as the acting deputy executive associate director.\nJudge harshly criticized administration\nThe document was filed after U.S. District Judge for the District of Maryland Stephanie Gallagher Friday slammed the Trump administration for its \u201cblatant lack of effort to comply\u201d with her order earlier this month to report steps taken to bring back Cristian, who in court documents is said to be 20 years old.\nOn May 6, she affirmed her decision that the Trump administration must facilitate Cristian\u2019s return.\nGallagher, whom Trump appointed in 2018, gave the Department of Justice until Monday to comply with her order.\nCristian was among roughly 300 men sent to the Salvadoran mega-prison CECOT. About 200 of those men were removed under an 18th-century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and the rest, such as Abrego Garcia, were removed under other immigration laws.\nCristian arrived in the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor and was part of a class action that barred removal from the U.S. while his asylum case was pending in immigration court.\nLike the Abrego Garcia case, the administration said earlier it was powerless to compel the Salvadoran government to release Cristian, an argument Gallagher expressed frustration with Friday.\n\u201cDefendants simply reiterated their well-worn talking points on their reasons for removing Cristian and failed to provide any of the information the Court required,\u201d Gallagher wrote in her order.\nThe Trump administration is paying El Salvador up to $15 million to detain removed immigrants from the U.S.\n\u201cAs a Venezuelan native, he is in El Salvador only because the United States sent him there pursuant to an agreement apparently reached with the government of El Salvador,\u201d Gallagher wrote.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from invalidating work permits and other documents that granted legal status to 5,000 Venezuelans, a subset class of the nearly 350,000 whose temporary legal protections the U.S. Supreme Court last month allowed to be terminated.\nThe Saturday order from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen will, for now, allow the work permits and deportation protections for that subgroup to last until October 2026, or until the entire case, which challenges the end of temporary protected status for Venezuelans and Haitians, is decided.\nThose 5,000 Venezuelans were granted extended protections by immigration officials before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision on May 19 that allowed the Trump administration to move forward with revoking protections.\nDuring a hearing last week, Chen said he was considering an order to preserve work permits for that small group of 5,000 Venezuelans. All 350,000 previously held temporary protected status, or TPS, which allows immigrants to live in the United States for a set period because their home country is deemed too dangerous for return.\nChen, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama to a seat in the Northern District of California, acknowledged that last month\u2019s Supreme Court decision created a small group of Venezuelans who had gotten work permits approved until October 2026 \u2014 before the high court\u2019s order moved up the date their TPS status expired, which was April 7.\nChen in March blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary protections for the group of all 350,000 Venezuelans. Last month\u2019s Supreme Court order means that those Venezuelans will be able to continue to challenge in court the end of their work permits and the possibility of removal, but they no longer have protections from deportation.\nThe case is also before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which will hear oral arguments in July.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "14:56\nNews Story\nEfforts to unplug Louisiana\u2019s speed trap cameras create small-town discontent\nGetty Images\nIt looked for a moment that automated speed enforcement cameras in Louisiana might go the way of the Oldsmobile. But what was once an all-out ban on the devices now has an exception that threatens to force the proposal down a dead end.\nFor the past two years, state lawmakers have tried to drastically scale back the use of technology that captures lead-footed drivers and red-light runners in the act and sends them tickets in the mail. While their boosters consider traffic enforcement cameras a force multiplier for manpower-strapped police departments, detractors see them as a money grab for local governments.\nCritics also pan the heavy burden placed on motorists who want to challenge their citations. The companies that provide speeding cameras to local police often handle fine collections and contested tickets, leaving no local avenue for appeals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s taxation by citation,\u201d Rep. Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine, said May 28 during a Louisiana House floor debate over a bill that would do away with speeding cameras everywhere but school zones.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nThe debate has created bipartisan fractures at the State Capitol. One side believes local jurisdictions should be able to govern themselves \u2013 and that includes the use of traffic enforcement cameras as they see fit. The other viewpoint says speeding \u201cscameras\u201d make it next to impossible for drivers to challenge their tickets.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got preachers\u2019 mommas calling me, telling me they\u2019re getting tickets. They didn\u2019t even know they were speeding,\u201d Rep. Mike Johnson, R-Pineville said last week before the House approved Senate Bill 99, by Sen. Stewart Cathey, R-Monroe.\nCathey brought his new proposal after authoring a law last year that established requirements for using speeding enforcement cameras in Louisiana. They include signage to let motorists know they are being monitored. Plus, cities and towns must provide a local administrative process for motorists to appeal their tickets.\nBut because a handful of municipalities still won\u2019t follow the rules, Cathey came back this year with what he\u2019s called \u201ca bill with teeth.\u201d If approved, police chiefs and municipal leaders who continue to ignore the requirements can be charged with malfeasance in office. The penalty for that crime can be up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.\nWhen Cathey\u2019s bill went before the Senate in April, Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, amended it to ban the use of the cameras everywhere but school zones.\nLouisiana set to spend at least $7 million to bring Saudi-owned LIV Golf to New Orleans\nIn its current form, the legislation would not apply to red light cameras. But every other speeding enforcement camera in Louisiana would be shut down \u2013 with one notable exception.\nAn amendment placed on the bill in the House would exclude the city of Opelousas, where sponsor Rep. Dustin Miller, a Democrat, said speed enforcement cameras allow his hometown police department to commit more officers to combatting violent crime.\nThat exception doesn\u2019t sit well with Cathey, who\u2019s been highly critical of small-town leaders who he says refuse to follow the existing law. He\u2019s declined to name them publicly, but he hasn\u2019t held back his opinion on Opelousas\u2019 leadership.\n\u201cYou know, I may just buy a billboard outside of Opelousas to let everybody know that it\u2019s the speed trap capital of Louisiana,\u201d Cathey said in an interview Friday.\nMiller\u2019s amendment passed by the slimmest margin in a 47-46 vote, with the updated bill gaining approval in a 72-23 vote. In an interview after the House adjourned, Miller said his city shouldn\u2019t be penalized for the wrongful actions of other municipalities.\n\u201cThey\u2019re claiming that there\u2019s, like, seven towns that\u2019s doing illegal stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, as far as my knowledge, Opelousas is doing it correctly. So I\u2019m just like, allow them to still do it where they\u2019re doing it.\u201d\nIn an interview last week, Cathey said he lacks confidence in Opelousas Police Chief Graig LeBlanc to manage the city\u2019s speeding enforcement cameras. The senator noted LeBlanc is currently under criminal indictment for a shooting that allegedly stemmed from a love triangle. The state attorney general is prosecuting the case, in which the chief has been charged with obstruction of justice and malfeasance in office. LeBlanc and his wife, St. Landry Parish Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Crystal LeBlanc, were injured in the shooting.\nCalls to the police chief seeking comment were directed to the department\u2019s public information officer, Joe Anderson, who submitted a statement on LeBlanc\u2019s behalf:\n\u201cOur mission at the Opelousas Police Department is \u2014 and always will be \u2014 to serve and protect the people of Opelousas. Every tool we use, including photo speed enforcement, is about one thing: saving lives and making our streets safer for families, children, and all members of our community,\u201d the statement said.\nAccording to LeBlanc\u2019s statement, speeding violations, traffic accidents and injury-related crashes are down, though the department did not provide supporting data. The chief noted that the cameras \u201conly activate when someone is breaking the law.\u201d Citations are issued when a vehicle is driving 12 mph over the posted speed limit\n\u201cIf that makes a few people uncomfortable, maybe the discomfort should lie with the behavior, not the enforcement,\u201d LeBlanc said.\n\u201cAs for Senator Cathey\u2019s comments \u2014 we respect the legislative process, but we\u2019re focused on people, not politics,\u201d the chief continued. \u201cThe senator may have his opinions, but those opinions don\u2019t reflect the everyday reality of the people who live, work, and drive in Opelousas. Our priority is the safety and well-being of this community \u2014 not political point-scoring.\u201d\nOpelousas Mayor Julius Alsandor has not responded to calls and emails.\nLouisiana senators trim private education vouchers, expand Medicaid budget\nLeBlanc and other local police leaders have appeared at the Capitol to oppose Cathey\u2019s bill, as have small town mayors who argued the legislature should respect their autonomy. Shreveport Mayor Tom Arceneaux also testified against the Cathey bill.\nReggie Skains has been the volunteer, unpaid mayor of Downsville for 39 years. The town at the border of Lincoln and Union parishes has a population of less than 150 residents, yet it sees far more traffic because it\u2019s at the nexus of two state highways in north Louisiana.\nIn the first six days Downsville deployed speeding enforcement cameras, it issued 419 tickets, the mayor said.\n\u201cThis is not driving safely,\u201d Skains told a legislative committee, stressing the cameras meet a need in his community.\nRoosevelt Porter is the police chief of Epps, a village of less than 400 just minutes away from the Poverty Point World Heritage Site. He said although Epps is within Cathey\u2019s Senate district, he had not heard from the senator about his bill.\nSpeeding enforcement cameras in his village issued 3,500 tickets in their first month, but the number fell to 1,500 in the second month, Porter said.\n\u201cI could care less if this thing makes money,\u201d the police chief told a House committee in April. \u201cIf it slows people down, that is what\u2019s important to me.\u201d\nPorter grew more emotional as he continued his testimony, shouting and coming close to tears at his conclusion.\n\u201cMy town is at your mercy, but I know how this stuff works,\u201d he said. \u201cLet that be your family member that comes through there and gets killed. What are you going to do then?\u201d\nWhen Cathey\u2019s bill went before a Senate committee, Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen, said the measure would have prevented the scandal that unfolded within his district last year when a West Baton Rouge Parish constable issued more than 4,000 school zone speeding tickets over a two-week period. The infractions each came with a $150 fine, but Attorney General Liz Murrill determined the constable had no authority to enforce traffic laws and had to refund what was collected.\nCathey said last week he was unsure about the outlook for his bill now that an exception has been added to it. He predicted other towns and cities would seek similar exemptions.\n\u201cCurrently, Opelousas is the speed camera capital of Louisiana,\u201d the senator said. \u201cAnd if the people of Opelousas don\u2019t like it, they need to reach out to their local legislators and let them know.\u201d\nThis report was updated to include a response from Opelousas Police Chief Graig LeBlanc.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

It\u2019s unclear when it was removed, but internet archives show Saturday as the last time the list was still active.\nIn a statement, DHS did not answer questions as to why the list was removed.\n\u201cAs we have previously stated, the list is being constantly reviewed and can be changed at any time and will be updated regularly,\u201d according to a DHS spokesperson. \u201cDesignation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens.\u201d\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Fox News Sunday did not acknowledge that the list was taken down, but said some localities had \u201cpushed back.\u201d\n\u201cThey think because they don\u2019t have one law or another on the books that they don\u2019t qualify, but they do qualify,\u201d Noem said. \u201cThey are giving sanctuary to criminals.\u201d\nList followed Trump executive order\nLocal law enforcement aids in immigration enforcement by holding immigrants in local jails until federal immigration officials can arrive.\nThe creation of the list stems from Donald Trump\u2019s executive order in April that required DHS to produce a list of cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration officials in enforcement matters, in order to strip federal funding from those local governments.\nThose jurisdictions are often dubbed \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d but immigration enforcement still occurs in the city \u2014 there\u2019s just no coordination between the local government and the federal government.\nThe jurisdictions are often a target for the Trump administration and Republicans, who support the President Donald Trump campaign promise of mass deportations of people without permanent legal status.\nCongressional Republicans in March grilled mayors from Boston, Chicago and Denver, on their cities\u2019 immigration policies during a six-hour hearing before the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\u2018Strong objection\u2019\nLocal officials were puzzled by the list.\nOne law enforcement association in North Dakota questioned why several counties \u2014 Billings, Golden Valley, Grant, Morton, Ramsey, Sioux, and Slope \u2014 were listed as sanctuary jurisdictions because those areas cooperate with federal immigration officials.\nIn a statement, the North Dakota Sheriff\u2019s and Deputies Association said the \u201cmethodology and criteria used to compile this list is unknown,\u201d and there has been no communication from DHS \u201con how to rectify this finding.\u201d\n\u201cThe elected Sheriffs of these counties take strong objection with language in this release characterizing them as \u2018deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities,\u2019\u201d according to NDSDA.\n\u201cThe North Dakota Sheriff\u2019s and Deputies Association is working to gather more information regarding the lack of transparency and reasoning as to why the Department of Homeland Security did not fact check prior to incorrectly naming these North Dakota counties.\u201d\nLocal advocacy groups also noted the problems with the DHS list.\n\u201cI assume they\u2019ve removed (the list) because they were bombarded with complaints about inaccuracy and how and why these various jurisdictions got on the list,\u201d Steven Brown, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, said in an interview Monday.\nAccording to the Internet Archive website Wayback Machine, the states, as well as the District of Columbia, that were on the list included Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and Wisconsin.\nChristopher Shea and Amy Dalrymple contributed to this story.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Louisiana is likely to spend at least $7 million in public funding to attract a Saudi-owned LIV Golf tournament to New Orleans. (Photo by Chris Trotman/LIV Golf)\nThe Louisiana Legislature looks likely to spend at least $7 million in public money to bring the controversial LIV Golf League tour, owned by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to New Orleans next summer.\nThe Louisiana Senate Finance Committee inserted the golf tournament spending into the proposed $49 billion state operating budget Sunday. Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said the Louisiana Economic Development agency, overseen by Gov. Jeff Landry, requested the money.\nOf the money Louisiana is putting up for the LIV Golf event, at least $2 million would be spent to upgrade the Bayou Oaks golf course at New Orleans City Park, where the tournament would be held. Another $5 million would be given directly to LIV Golf as a hosting fee, Henry said in an interview with reporters Sunday night.\nHenry said the money is going to help \u201cget the course up and running for a LIV quality event.\u201d\nIn exchange for the money, Henry said the LIV Golf event is expected to generate about $60 million in spending for New Orleans. The tournament would be held in June or July 2026, at a time of year when city tourism is down and the hospitality industry is typically struggling.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll drive significant economic activity at a time when the city is usually pretty slow,\u201d he said.\nNews of a LIV Golf tournament coming to New Orleans was first reported by WDSU-TV in March.\nLIV\u2019s owner, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world with nearly $1 trillion in assets. Saudi Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman controls the money and the fund started LIV Golf in 2021 to compete with the PGA Tour, the preeminent professional league based in the U.S.\nThe new tour has been seen as an effort by Saudi Arabia to \u201cwhitewash\u201d the country\u2019s record on human rights.\nAfter becoming the de facto Saudi leader eight years ago, the crown prince enacted more liberal policies for women \u2013 they gained the privilege of driving in 2018 \u2013 but has engaged in a wirdespread crackdown on dissidents and critics of the Saudi government, according to a Human Rights Watch report.\nPrince Mohammed\u2019s personal reputation was also damaged in 2018 when Saudi officials killed U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi while he was visiting a Saudi consulate in Turkey to get documents for his upcoming marriage.\nKhashoggi had been critical of Prince Mohammed in his monthly columns for The Washington Post, and U.S. intelligence officials concluded the crown prince was involved in Khashoggi\u2019s death, according to the Associated Press.\nLIV Golf\u2019s debut upended the golf world in 2022. With its vast resources, Saudi Arabia\u2019s leadership offered pro golfers far larger sums of money than the PGA tour could afford, including multimillion-dollar signing bonuses that led some of the sport\u2019s biggest stars to leave the PGA Tour.\nYet for all of its assets, LIV has not succeeded in making much of a dent with the PGA Tour audience of late. Its television ratings have been a fraction of what the PGA has garnered this year, according to Golf.com. Talks of merging the LIV Golf League and the PGA Tour have stalled in spite of President Donald Trump personally encouraging the deal.\nLouisiana is trying to sign a multi-year contract with LIV for the City Park tournament, but the state\u2019s $7 million allocation would be devoted mostly to the first year of expenses in 2026, Henry said.\nSome of the Landry administration\u2019s enthusiasm for LIV Golf League might be related to Trump, who considers Prince Mohammed a personal friend and who the Louisiana governor is eager to please.\nTrump\u2019s private golf resort in Doral, Florida, was the site of LIV Golf League tournament the president personally attended earlier this year. One of the president\u2019s first trips abroad since returning to office was to Saudi Arabia for meetings with Prince Mohammed last month. Trump made a similar trip early in his first term.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nThe $7 million Louisiana is putting toward the LIV golf tournament comes from the state\u2019s major events incentive fund, which provides public funding for large tourist attractions. In the past, it has been used to lure the Super Bowl, Essence Festival and NCAA Final Four for men\u2019s basketball to Louisiana.\nOther events getting money from the fund in the proposed state budget for the year that starts July 1 include the U.S. Bowling Congress Tournament ($5 million), an Ultimate Fighting Championship event ($1.5 million), the 2026 Southeastern Conference Gymnastics Championship ($750,000), the U.S. Gymnastics National Championships in New Orleans this August ($750,000), the Barksdale Defenders of Liberty Air Show ($500,000) and the State Fair of Louisiana in Shreveport ($100,000).\nAnother $250,000 in public funding from a Jefferson Parish tourism promotion account is also going to the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, a decades-old PGA Tour event held each spring at the TPC Louisiana golf course in Avondale.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

The nonprofit, which serves 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa, is concerned about the impacts of potential cuts to federal food assistance, particularly in rural areas. (Photo courtesy of Food Bank for the Heartland)\nPeople in Marsha Keene\u2019s community are already struggling to cover the basics.\nMost of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.\nThe center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center\u2019s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see communities just being able to absorb that need,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it\u2019s going to be good.\u201d\nBillions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it\u2019s now before the Senate.\nCuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.\nThe legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.\nTogether, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\nThe legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation\u2019s 27 Republican governors.\nA greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.\nThe SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.\n\u2013 Marsha Keene, CEO, Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center\nIn her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County \u2014 almost double the state and national averages.\nShe recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. \u201cAnd I have a pretty good job,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.\u201d\n\u2018I\u2019d probably close the doors\u2019\nThe National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.\n\u201cCutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,\u201d the association said in a May statement.\nFacing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.\nBut deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.\nFor Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.\n\u201cI\u2019d probably close the doors,\u201d she said.\nThat\u2019s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won\u2019t last much longer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be made on the grocery side,\u201d she said.\nSeveral grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.\nTasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay\u2019s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store\u2019s sales last year.\nWhile she believes cuts to the federal program are \u201ca terrible idea\u201d broadly, she said it won\u2019t make a huge difference for her store.\n\u201cI think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they\u2019re spending the dollars elsewhere,\u201d she said.\nProfit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,\u201d said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.\nThe center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state\u2019s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.\nThat figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.\nOne component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.\nA Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.\n\u201cEvery single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,\u201d Jonas said.\nIn Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.\n\u201cThis is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn\u2019t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,\u201d Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.\n\u201cWe are not cutting SNAP,\u201d he said May 25 on CBS News\u2019 political show \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.\u201d\nA PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson\u2019s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.\n\u2018It\u2019s time to sound the alarm\u2019\nFood insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.\nEven in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,\u201d said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.\nWilliams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it\u2019s difficult to get to grocery stores \u2014 if they exist at all.\n\u201cThere are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there\u2019s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.\u201d\nThe federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.\n\u201cIt will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can\u2019t sustain because they\u2019re already seeing too many people,\u201d he said.\nSusie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it\u2019s time to expand food assistance \u2014 not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced \u201cstaggering increases\u201d in need over the past three years.\nFor every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.\n\u201cAny additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,\u201d Boelter said. \u201cFood banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it\u2019s time to sound the alarm.\u201d\nStateline reporter Kevin Hardy can be reached at [email protected].\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis report was originally published by Stateline, part of the States Newsroom nonprofit news network.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)\nGRAMERCY \u2014 For several months, a River Parishes refinery unlawfully discharged industrial toxic waste containing arsenic, cadmium, chromium and other toxic heavy metals into public areas and waterways, state records show.\nThe company, Atlantic Alumina, also known as Atalco, has so far racked up 23 violation notices from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality after inspectors first discovered the pollution in August. It involves a slurry of industrial \u201cred mud\u201d byproduct that has eroded through the giant levees surrounding the facility\u2019s waste containment lakes and spilled onto public property. The toxic sludge has killed vegetation and contaminated the land along its path to a local drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas, according to a 606-page LDEQ inspection report finalized in March.\nThe incident marks the first known case of red mud levee breaches at an American bauxite refinery. When asked for details, LDEQ spokesman Gregory Langley had little information to share about the prolonged discharge other than to say it is currently under investigation with the agency\u2019s enforcement division. The only enforcement action taken as of May 29 is a warning letter LDEQ sent to Atalco.\nA review of thousands of pages of state and federal documents and interviews with scientists and area residents indicate that Atalco polluted public land and state waterways with the most toxic non-radioactive elements on the planet and allowed that pollution to continue for months \u2014 never notifying the outside community.\nAtalco\u2019s refinery occupies roughly 3 square miles of land where St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes meet on the Mississippi River\u2019s east bank. The site specializes in refining bauxite, a rust-colored powder of raw metals and minerals, into aluminum oxide or \u201calumina\u201d in the form of an ultra-fine white powder. Atalco sells the alumina to metal smelters that need it to make finished aluminum. Opened in 1958 as Kaiser Aluminum, the Gramercy facility is the only remaining bauxite refinery in the United States and therefore the nation\u2019s only domestic source of a critical metal feedstock.\nAtalco produced 669,261 metric tons of aluminum oxide last year, state records show. For every ton of aluminum produced from Atalco\u2019s work, bauxite refining generates an estimated 2.5 tons of waste byproduct, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nOne of the main problems in refining bauxite is there are not many good options for what to do with all that waste, most of which takes the form of a thick red mud.\nThe waste comes from a part of the process in which bauxite is heated in a pressurized vessel with sodium hydroxide, a highly caustic chemical. The alumina compounds are then filtered out and separated, while the toxic byproduct is stored in the facility\u2019s six red mud lakes. The lakes are open-air ponds, each roughly 150-200 acres in size surrounded by large earthen levees, some as high as 50 feet, meant to contain the thick liquid waste.\nFour of the lakes, including a \u201csurge\u201d or overflow basin, were constructed in the early 1970s without any liners that would help prevent the heavy metals and chemicals from seeping into the soil below.\n\u201cIt is very dangerous,\u201d said Slawomir Lomnicki, an environmental scientist at LSU. \u201cThere can be a lot of toxic metals leaching out of it and getting into the groundwater.\u201d\nGroundwater contamination from leaching is a constant risk that exists when Atalco\u2019s systems are operating normally. The public drinking water system in St. James Parish regularly monitors for that kind of contamination, according to Parish President Peter Dufresne. Officials with the St. John Parish water system did not answer multiple phone calls last week.\nA greater risk to the community from bauxite refineries in general is the rare case of a levee breach at a red mud lake, which can cause toxic waste to directly contaminate public waters and soils, scientists said.\nUntil this reporting, the last known breach at a bauxite refinery occurred in Hungary in 2010. The failure of a red mud reservoir sent 35 million cubic feet of waste into nearby villages, killing 10 people and injuring 150 others.\nIn the wake of that incident, industry officials told the American public that a levee breach at Louisiana\u2019s bauxite refinery would be unlikely because the levees are \u201cperiodically checked by state and federal regulators,\u201d according to a news report from that time.\nThat unlikely event has happened at Atalco. With a caustic level higher than drain cleaner and elevated concentrations of heavy metals, Atalco\u2019s waste slurry eroded through levees in multiple locations at multiple lakes, forming canyons as deep as 10 feet that allowed the toxic waste to escape, records show.\nA water sample LDEQ had tested from a public ditch outside the plant detected arsenic at a concentration nearly 1,400% higher than the level considered safe by state groundwater and EPA drinking water limits. The sample also contained cadmium at levels above those same limits.\nA soil sample taken from the same ditch contained mercury, beryllium, cadmium and chromium \u2014 all at concentrations above the average background levels found in U.S. soils. The cadmium was nearly 400% higher, and the chromium was 900% higher than LDEQ\u2019s standard limits for soil. In its hexavalent form, which is created through industrial processes, chromium is the most toxic non-radioactive element on earth and is about three times more poisonous than arsenic, according to EPA toxicity factors.\nHistoric water quality data for the Blind River, recorded from 1979-99, show heavy metal concentrations nowhere near those levels.\nWhen the levees broke\n\u201cWith this kind of facility, the worst major accident that can happen is a breach of the lake [levees],\u201d said Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works with the environmental watchdog Louisiana Bucket Brigade. The group has monitored incidents at the alumina refinery for years.\nIt is unknown when the mud lake levees first began to erode, but state and federal records show the pollution lasted for months and continued even after Atalco became aware of the problem.\nThe company has not responded to the Illuminator\u2019s multiple requests for an interview.\nFederal inspectors with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) documented several hazards at Atalco\u2019s levees last summer and voiced concerns about the risks they posed to the workers at the plant.\n\u201cThere were several mud lakes at the facility that was (sic) not being maintained,\u201d MSHA inspector Brandon Olivier wrote in a citation dated June 25, 2024.\nTrees and shrubs obscured sections of the levees, making thorough inspections impossible, Olivier added.\nA few weeks later, on Aug. 14, the MSHA issued Atalco another citation after inspectors discovered caustic waste \u201cseeping through various locations on the east and west side of Mud Lake #4\u201d and flowing downhill \u201cinto the roadway and ditches.\u201d\nLDEQ later noted the Aug. 14 citation was the first formal written notice Atalco received about the levees having a breach with dangerous toxic waste escaping from its facility.\nOther dangers present at the Atalco plant had already drawn regulators\u2019 attention at that time.\nJust days prior, on Aug. 4, the public was reminded just how dangerous the chemicals at Atalco could be when 45-year-old Curtis Diggs, a contract worker from Waste-Pro USA, fell into a pit of sodium hydroxide at the plant because a grate that covered the pit was missing and the entire floor was flooded with several inches of the caustic cloudy liquid. The chemical, the same that is stored in the red mud lakes, left Diggs with severe burns from which he did not recover, according to LDEQ records. He died in a New Orleans hospital on Sept 2.\nMSHA investigated the fatality and learned that Atalco personnel had removed the grate on July 30, 2024, to try to pump out the flooded area and failed to put anything in its place or even a warning marker, creating a dangerous pitfall left open for five days and virtually invisible. MSHA charged Atalco with three regulatory violations and charged Waste-Pro USA with two, faulting both companies for \u201caggravated conduct\u201d that involved an extraordinary pattern of negligence, though it\u2019s unclear if any fines or penalties have been issued as of May 30, according to federal records.\nAtalco uses sodium hydroxide to refine bauxite into alumina. After the refinement process, it stores the used sodium hydroxide in the lakes with the other waste.\nDespite the heightened scrutiny from state and federal regulators at the time, by mid-September Atalco still had not repaired the levee breaches to Red Mud Lake 4 that federal inspectors cited the month before. Nor did the company thoroughly inspect its other lakes to look for similar breaches because, as the records indicate, similar breaches were there \u2014 if only the company had looked.\nOn Sept. 17, MSHA inspectors found a breach in the levee around another lake, Red Mud Lake 1 East, with a stream of hazardous waste flowing freely across the roadway.\n\u201cThe caustic was observed seeping through the side of the levee for approximately 50 yards across the roadway and to the ditch,\u201d the citation states. \u201cThe mud lake is access[ed] by the plant operators daily and contractors for service, and this condition exposes them to injuries if there is a dam failure due to the seepage.\u201d\nBased on further inspections that same day, MSHA cited Atalco for a third levee break \u2014 at Red Mud Lake 2.\nOn that single day, three of Atalco\u2019s six waste lakes had confirmed breaches with streams of poisonous chemicals flowing freely to areas they weren\u2019t permitted to go, including the Blind River Swamp \u2014 a popular recreational fishing spot in the Lake Maurepas backwaters.\nLDEQ officials first arrived at the plant Sept. 20 to initiate a routine compliance inspection. Agency records show state officials met with Atalco managers, conducted an interview and toured parts of the facility. However, they were unable to inspect some of the lakes and levees because the plant manager told them the access roads were too wet to travel on.\nLDEQ first documented the levee breaches five days later when they were contacted by the federal inspectors, according to state records. Atalco had still not officially notified LDEQ of the levee breaches \u2014 something the company should have done immediately upon learning of them in accordance with Atalco\u2019s permit requirements as well as state and federal laws.\nLocal officials have also been kept in the dark. When asked about the events during an impromptu meeting with a reporter Thursday at the State Capitol, St. James Parish President Peter Dufresne said he was unaware of Atalco\u2019s levee breaks that contaminated neighboring land and drainage with toxic waste. Dufresne declined an interview but asked the Illuminator for copies of LDEQ\u2019s inspection reports.\nIn October, the records show, state inspectors discovered erosion channels in the levee of a fourth lake, Red Mud Lake 3. They also saw for themselves the levee breaches that federal inspectors documented two months before. The erosion channels were still there, and the caustic waste was still escaping from those lakes.\nSo much waste had escaped that it also overwhelmed the facility\u2019s secondary containment system, which is a network of interior ditches just outside of the levees used to catch any chemical spills or leaks from the lakes. The backup ditch at one location had overflowed, sending the toxic slurry across the highway just north of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.\nAtalco was also, as a matter of protocol, unlawfully using a stormwater ditch as a backup containment ditch. Three company officials, apparently unaware that they weren\u2019t permitted to use the ditch for toxic waste disposal, told LDEQ inspectors that they routinely used it for containment, according to the inspection files.\nIn other areas, LDEQ inspectors saw that the waste slurry had accumulated to \u201cnearly the height of the levee\u201d in some of the lakes, the agency\u2019s files note. The waste level in the lakes should never be allowed to rise higher than two feet from the top of the levee.\nUltimately, in site visits over the next three months, LDEQ inspectors viewed and documented levee breaches at four of Atalco\u2019s six lakes, prompting the state agency to cite Atalco multiple times for failing to inspect and failing to repair the levees.\nErosion of the levees was a very real possibility that Atalco had long known about. In its 2010 permit renewal applications with the state, the company had addressed the topic at length, promising to prevent erosion by conducting daily inspections of the levees and keeping written logs of those inspections. The state included those as specific ongoing requirements in the final permit issued to Atalco. At that time, the company was in the process of raising its levees from 30 feet to 50 feet high, according to the permit application.\nBy the time state and federal officials began prodding the company last August, Atalco had not consistently inspected its lakes and levees in over three years and was missing hundreds of daily inspection records from July 30, 2021, to Dec. 18, 2024, according to LDEQ\u2019s summary of violations.\nOn Oct. 23, state officials noted the company was constructing a new berm to contain the breach at Red Mud Lake 4, which Atalco had known about since at least Aug. 14.\nThe breach at Red Mud Lake 3 continued until at least Dec. 4, according to the LDEQ file. On that day, Atalco managers accompanied state inspectors into the field when they noticed multiple streams emerging near an access road and traced it back to \u201cone erosion channel with an estimated depth of at least 10 feet.\u201d\nThe chemistry of Atalco\u2019s toxic waste\nDuring their site visits in October, the state inspectors took pH readings from various pools of standing waste that had escaped from the lakes\nThe pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with water having a neutral pH of around 7. Lower values indicate acidity, while higher values indicate alkalinity. Substances at the extreme ends of the scale in either direction can eat through solid materials such as steel and concrete and are very dangerous to most life forms.\nThe LDEQ detected high pH at every location, with one puddle logged at a high of 12.49 \u2014 the same alkalinity as most caustic drain clog removers and ammonia-based cleaners. The inspectors also photographed dead or dying vegetation, petrochemical sheens, and white and yellow chemical residues in many of the locations where the slurry had traveled.\n\u201cJust the pH by itself is concerning \u2026 That is very high,\u201d Gibb, the chemist, said. \u201cYou would definitely get injuries and skin burns from it. The plants and any fish in the area would die from that. You can\u2019t survive that high of a pH.\u201d\nState inspectors had testing done on water and soil samples from off-site locations in the public drainage system and on-site locations near the erosion streams. Simultaneously, Atalco personnel collected their own batch of samples and sent them to a separate lab for independent testing.\nLDEQ\u2019s soil samples contained significantly elevated levels of cadmium, chromium and nickel \u2014 all toxic carcinogens. Atalco\u2019s samples reaffirmed the LDEQ\u2019s lab results and detected even higher levels at one location. The company\u2019s sample taken from public property outside the facility contained cadmium at roughly 1,000% higher than what the state considers safe for people. Additionally, the levels of chromium and nickel measured 1,700% and 300% above their respective state standards, the lab reports show.\nGibb and Lomnicki, the LSU scientist, said these three heavy metals, along with arsenic, are among the most dangerous non-radioactive substances on the planet. Exposure to excessive levels can cause a range of serious health issues, including cancer and blood poisoning.\nGanga Hettiarachchi, a Kansas State University professor of soil and environmental chemistry, said cadmium could pose the greatest long-term risk because it spreads easily and accumulates in living organisms over time. Enough small doses during a given time period can add up to a fatal dose, she said.\nCadmium is highly toxic to humans in short- and long-term exposure settings. Small concentrations ingested or inhaled can cause gastrointestinal or respiratory illness, while higher concentrations can cause cancer, cell death, neurological damage and organ system failure, according to the National Institutes of Health.\nIncreasing the risk from cadmium is that it can be easily spread across far distances and transfer from soil into crops, Hettiarachchi said, posing risks to humans and animals if they eat those crops.\n\u201cIt could easily end up in our food,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has been historically the main pathway for cadmium.\u201d\nIf cadmium gets into surface water or groundwater, it can become an even bigger problem, especially if that water is used for irrigation, she added.\n\u201cThe area of damage can expand further and further over time,\u201d Hettiarachchi said.\nCadmium was present at elevated levels in two of Atalco\u2019s water samples and four of LDEQ\u2019s. The highest concentration was 400% above the level considered safe in a water sample taken from an erosion channel within the perimeter of the facility. It also had high levels of chromium and lead.\nAll seven water samples that LDEQ had tested contained elevated levels of arsenic. One of them taken from outside the levee of a red mud lake detected arsenic at a level 9,000% higher than state and federal safe limits, and it contained high levels of cadmium, nickel and thallium. Six out of the seven samples Atalco personnel collected contained arsenic at levels beyond what is considered safe.\nLDEQ has yet to address the risks Atalco\u2019s red mud runoff could pose to the community. Langley, the agency\u2019s spokesman, said it has yet to determine what the public impact might be.\n\u201cObviously those are things we don\u2019t want going into state waterways,\u201d Langley said.\nPart Two: For some nearby residents, the levee breaches at Atalco are just the latest incident in a familiar pattern. The second story in this series reveals why the incident at Atalco was foreseeable based on the history of the plant and the many accidents and environmental exposures to the nearby communities.\n\u201cThey\u2019re turning a blind eye to it,\u201d said Gail LeBouef, who\u2019s lived near the plant since 1999.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "11:03\nNews Story\nStreet-level violence prevention programs have been decimated by Trump just ahead of summer\nA growing body of research has found a correlation between temperature spikes and violent crime.\nParticipants walk through the Broadway Townhouses in Camden, N.J., as part of a training program to help neighborhoods affected by violence. The Community-Based Public Safety Collective, which offered the training, is one of at least 554 organizations affected by the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s abrupt termination in April of at least 373 public safety grants. (Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)\nCommunity-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.\nIn many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.\nBut the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching \u2014 a season when violence consistently peaks.\nThe grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.\nAt least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.\nAnother new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration\u2019s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants \u2014 known as \u201csubawards\u201d \u2014 passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.\nAbout $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.\nExperts warn the timing couldn\u2019t be worse. The summer months \u2014 historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes \u2014 are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.\n\u201cThese programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they\u2019re most needed,\u201d said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.\nSolomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs \u2014 the Justice Department\u2019s largest grantmaking agency.\nMany of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report \u2014 despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.\n\u2018Wasteful grants\u2019\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut \u201cmillions of dollars in wasteful grants.\u201d She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.\nThe Department of Justice\u2019s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs \u2014 a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.\nFor some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.\nCommunity violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff \u2014 often with experience in the justice system \u2014 mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they\u2019re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.\nAnd research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.\nAfter a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels \u2014 or even lower \u2014 in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\nBut the progress hasn\u2019t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.\nOrganizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative \u2014 the federal government\u2019s primary mechanism for supporting this work.\nSince the program\u2019s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,\u201d Solomon told Stateline. \u201cThis was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.\u201d\nImpact on communities nationwide\nIn late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.\nThe letter said the organization\u2019s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department\u2019s priorities, which include supporting \u201ccertain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.\u201d\nUntil the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups \u2014 including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies \u2014 that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.\nWe're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.\n\u2013 Aqeela Sherrills, Community-Based Public Safety Collective co-founder and CEO\nBut after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.\n\u201cWithout the significant funding \u2026 it destabilizes the organizations. People\u2019s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,\u201d Sherrills said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.\u201d\nThe deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.\nAbout $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.\nSome of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.\nSome of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.\nFor organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.\nThe funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate \u2014 allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.\nSome of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.\nOf the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team\u2019s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.\n\u201cWe just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,\u201d said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.\nThat work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community\u2019s crime rates.\nCity crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline\u2019s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.\nStateline reporter Amanda Hern\u00e1ndez can be reached at [email protected].\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis report was first published by Stateline, part of the States Newsroom nonprofit news network.

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nUsing flawed studies and scientific journal publications, abortion opponents are building a body of research meant to question the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, a key target for the movement.\nThe effort comes as federal officials have expressed a willingness to revisit the drug\u2019s approval \u2014 and potentially impose new restrictions on a medication used in the vast majority of abortions.\nMainstream medical researchers have criticized the studies, highlighting flaws in their methodology and \u2014 in the case of one paper published by the conservative think tank Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) \u2014 lack of transparency about the data used to suggest mifepristone is unsafe. The vast body of research shows that the drugs used in medication abortion, mifepristone and misoprostol, are safe and effective in terminating a pregnancy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a proliferation of anti-abortion propaganda right now. I think it is a coordinated attack on mifepristone,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco who studies medication abortion.\nReleased in April, the EPPC paper suggests that mifepristone results in serious adverse events for 1 in 10 patients \u2014 substantially higher than the widely accepted figure of .3 percent complication rate most research has attributed to the pill. The paper appears to count what other researchers say are non-threatening events, such as requiring follow-up care to complete the abortion, or visiting an emergency room within 45 days of an abortion \u2014 even if the patient did not end up requiring emergency care \u2014 as serious adverse effects. That paper also did not go through peer review, a standard process for scientific research in which other scholars review a study\u2019s findings and methodology before it can be published.\nAnother paper, a commentary piece published this week in the journal BioTech, challenges the commonly cited statistic that mifepristone has a lower complication rate than acetaminophen, or Tylenol, tracing the history of the comparison and arguing that it is mathematically flawed. The paper\u2019s author, Cameron Loutitt, is a biomedical engineer by training and director of life sciences at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a research arm of the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\u201cMy hope is that this paper sparks action in my peers in the research and medical community to more critically evaluate these unfounded claims regarding abortion drug safety,\u201d Loutitt said in a statement.\nDays later, a group of researchers from the institute published another study, this one arguing that emergency rooms are likely to identify medication abortions as miscarriages, which they say increases the risk of needing hospital care.\nA miscarriage and a medication abortion are medically indistinguishable, and patients will sometimes visit an emergency room to ensure the drugs worked, or if they suspect possible complications. In places where abortion is illegal, patients may also tell health care providers they experienced a miscarriage to minimize their legal risk. Studies like the Lozier Institute paper suggest complications from medication abortions are being undercounted.\nThat study was rejected by another journal on April 12 before being published this week, noted Upadhyay, who had served as a peer reviewer in that rejection process. A similar paper written by many of the same researchers behind the Lozier Institute\u2019s was retracted a year ago by the journal that published it, along with two others suggesting mifepristone was unsafe.\n\u201cThey keep trying to publish the same junk science,\u201d Upadhyay said.\nJames Studnicki, the Charlotte Lozier Institute\u2019s director of data analytics, who led the second of its new anti-abortion papers and the study retracted last year, did not respond to a request for comment. But a spokesperson for the institute said the organization is challenging last year\u2019s retraction through an arbitration process. This March, Studnicki said in a statement that the retraction placed \u201cpolitics over publication ethics.\u201d\nThese studies and papers all fall outside the scientific consensus. More than 100 studies over decades of research have found that mifepristone \u2014 and the medication abortion regimen as a whole \u2014 has a low complication rate and is very safe to use for abortions. Papers like these aren\u2019t new, and their scientific accuracy has long been questioned. But the bevy of new reports and analyses comes at a moment when abortion opponents may have more influence in shaping public policy.\nMifepristone restrictions are a top priority for the anti-abortion movement. About two-thirds of all abortions in the United States are now done using medication. Even in states with abortion bans, pregnant people have increasingly turned to abortion medication, which they receive from health providers in states with laws protecting abortion.\nNationwide, about 1 in 5 abortions are now performed using telehealth; almost half of those are for people in states with bans or restrictions. Mifepristone is currently approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before a Senate committee that he has directed the Food and Drug Administration to review the approval of mifepristone, citing the EPPC paper specifically. Jim O\u2019Neill, who is nominated for a deputy secretary role, has also said he is in favor of a \u201csafety review\u201d of the drug \u2014 a move that could result in new restrictions on how it is prescribed.\nMeanwhile, physicians and researchers are highlighting the rigor of the FDA approval process.\n\u201cFDA approval of mifepristone must reflect the rigorous clinical evidence that has proven unequivocally that it is safe and effective for use in medication,\u201d 13 reproductive medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said in a statement after Kennedy indicated the drug may undergo a new FDA review. \u201cMifepristone has been used for decades for abortion and miscarriage management by millions of patients, and complications are exceedingly rare, minor, and most often easily treatable.\u201d\nThe International Institute for Reproductive Loss, an anti-abortion nonprofit, has explicitly prioritized the publication of research that supports restrictions on medication abortion. Presenting at an anti-abortion conference last September, that organization\u2019s science director, Priscilla Coleman, highlighted strategies that she said could help result in the retraction of studies showing mifepristone\u2019s safety, such as finding \u201cagenda-driven, poorly developed and conducted studies published in peer-reviewed journals\u201d and writing to journal editors. Coleman did not respond to a request for comment.\nThough no scientific consensus has changed, anti-abortion lawmakers have rallied around the suggestion that complications are common. In a private Zoom meeting reported on by Politico, abortion opponents cited the EPPC paper as a potential tool to justify further restrictions on mifepristone \u2014 even while acknowledging that the report is \u201cnot a study in the traditional sense\u201d and \u201cnot conclusive proof of anything.\u201d\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, cited the EPPC paper in a letter to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who had only a day before the report\u2019s publication indicated openness to reviewing mifepristone\u2019s approval if new evidence emerged.\n\u201cThe time to act is now. It is time to revisit and restore the FDA\u2019s longstanding safety measures governing mifepristone,\u201d Hawley wrote. His office did not reply to a request for further comment.\n\u201cThey\u2019re producing this terrible \u2018science\u2019 because they don\u2019t have any real science that backs them up. And all they\u2019ve gotten from the administration is, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019ll study it,\u2019\u201d said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who has advised state legislatures on crafting abortion-protetctive laws.\nThrough the courts and Trump administration, abortion opponents have pushed to reverse a 2021 FDA decision allowing mifepristone to be distributed via telehealth. In addition to calling for the in-person requirement to be reinstated, abortion opponents are asking for restrictions such as the dispensation of the drug to require three in-person visits, and for mifepristone to only be approved for use only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Many have also argued the drug should be taken off the market entirely.\nThe Trump administration said on the campaign trail that it would leave abortion policy up to the states. So far, there has been little indication from the federal government that such changes are imminent.\n\u201cPills are kind of just spreading, as we predicted, without almost any restriction and so far the anti-abortion movement hasn\u2019t figured out what to do,\u201d Cohen said.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra of The 19th.

Amid several legal disputes, the Trump administration has continued its controversial deportation policy to El Salvador. (Photo by Alex Pe\u00f1a/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge in Maryland slammed the Trump administration Friday for its \u201cblatant lack of effort to comply\u201d with her order earlier this month to report steps taken to facilitate the return of a second wrongly deported man to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 untimely response is the functional equivalent of, \u2018We haven\u2019t done anything and don\u2019t intend to,\u2019\u201d U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, whom President Donald Trump appointed in 2018, wrote in her order blasting a nonresponse from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cTelling this Court that \u2018[i]t is DHS\u2019s understanding that Cristian is in the custody of El Salvador,\u2019 adds nothing to the underlying record and simply reflects a lack of any effort to obtain or provide information regarding Cristian\u2019s \u2018current physical location and custodial status,\u2019\u201d she wrote.\nFriday\u2019s order from Gallagher is the latest scathing remark from federal judges who have found the Trump administration either violated their preliminary injunctions or restraining orders, or have broadly invoked executive privileges to stonewall information in immigration cases.\nGallagher, like other federal judges who have found themselves in the spotlight for blocking immigration-related policies, raised concerns about the Trump administration skirting due process rights and slow-walking rectifying deportation mistakes as the government continues its aggressive campaign of mass deportations.\nOfficials at the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and President Donald Trump himself have continued to claim broad authority to conduct immigration removals. They have lashed out against the judges, labeling them as \u201cactivists\u201d and accusing them of blocking the Trump administration\u2019s agenda.\n\u201cIts very important that we\u2019re able to get these people out fast,\u201d Trump said during a press availability in the Oval Office Friday. \u201cWe have judges that don\u2019t want that to happen. It\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d\nViolating removal protections\nTwo cases of men whom the administration sent to El Salvador despite court orders blocking their removals stemmed from the first major case of the administration apparently disregarding a judicial order: a temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg not to remove migrants under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.\nDespite the mid-March temporary restraining order from Boasberg, three planes landed in El Salvador hours later and roughly 300 men were sent to the Salvadoran mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.\nMaryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and a 20-year-old referred to in court documents only by the pseudonym Cristian, whose case Gallagher is handling, were among them.\nAbrego Garcia had, since 2019, a court order protecting him from deportation to his home country of El Salvador because an immigration judge was concerned he would face gang violence if returned.\nCristian, who arrived in the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor, was part of a class action that barred removal from the U.S. while his asylum case was pending in immigration court.\nIn both cases, the administration has said it is powerless to compel the Salvadoran government to release them, an argument Gallagher expressed frustration with Friday.\n\u201cDefendants simply reiterated their well-worn talking points on their reasons for removing Cristian and failed to provide any of the information the Court required,\u201d Gallagher wrote.\nThe U.S. is paying El Salvador up to $15 million to detain removed immigrants.\n\u201cAs a Venezuelan native, he is in El Salvador only because the United States sent him there pursuant to an agreement apparently reached with the government of El Salvador,\u201d Gallagher wrote.\nJudges see pattern of defiance\nIn Abrego Garcia\u2019s high-profile case, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, also in Maryland, said \u201cnothing has been done\u201d by the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return. Administration officials have admitted he was mistakenly deported to CECOT.\nXinis recently denied the Department of Justice\u2019s request for an extra 30 days to submit documents on its efforts to return Abrego Garcia.\nHe remains in a lower-level prison in El Salvador, despite a Supreme Court order from April that directed the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.\nA judge in Massachusetts found the Trump administration violated his preliminary injunction barring third-country removals of migrants without due process after eight men were deported to South Sudan and given less than 24 hours to challenge their removal to a county on the cusp of another civil war.\nBoasberg, who sits in a federal court in the District of Columbia, found probable cause to hold Trump officials in contempt for violating his temporary restraining order that ordered deportation planes carrying men removed under the Alien Enemies Act to be returned to the U.S. over concerns they did not receive due process.\nThe Trump administration has challenged all those decisions on an emergency basis to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\u2018A judge in Boston running foreign policy\u2019\nTop administration figures have argued it is the judges who have overstepped, trespassing on the executive branch\u2019s role in setting foreign policy.\nIn the Oval Office Friday, Trump singled out U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy, who is overseeing the case in Massachusetts.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a judge in Boston running foreign policy in places all over the country because he has a liberal bent or he\u2019s a radical left person,\u201d Trump said.\nMurphy was appointed by former President Joe Biden.\nThat case, which centers on removing migrants to a country they are not citizens of, could play an outsized role in the legal battle over the administration\u2019s approach to immigration after Supreme Court decisions this month have allowed the Trump administration to end two temporary legal programs and exposed more than 800,000 immigrants to potential deportation.\nMany of those who lost protections hail from countries that are deemed too dangerous for return.\n\u2018Get them out rapidly\u2019\nThe Trump administration has publicly stated Abrego Garcia will not return and accused him, without producing evidence, that he is a leader of the MS-13 gang.\nThe president has also acknowledged that if he wanted to, he could secure the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador. But Trump said he would not, alleging that Abrego Garcia has gang ties.\nThe president posted pictures on social media of Boasberg, who was pressing Department of Justice attorneys for answers on if his order was deliberately violated. It prompted a rare response from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who stressed the importance of an independent judiciary.\nWhile the Supreme Court eventually lifted Boasberg\u2019s nationwide injunction on the use of the Alien Enemies Act, federal judges in Colorado and parts of New York and Texas have blocked use of the wartime law within their districts, citing concerns about due process.\nTop Trump officials, such as Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, have floated suspending habeas corpus, which allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court.\nHabeas corpus claims are currently the only avenue that Venezuelans subject to the Alien Enemies Act have to challenge their deportation under the wartime law.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep them for years here as they go through trial,\u201d Trump said Friday of swift deportations. \u201cWe have to get them out rapidly.\u201d\nAbrego Garcia and Cristian\nIn an April order, Gallagher wrote that Cristian\u2019s case is similar to Abrego Garcia\u2019s and that \u201clike Judge Xinis in the Abrego Garcia matter, this court will order Defendants to facilitate Cristian\u2019s return to the United States so that he can receive the process he was entitled to under the parties\u2019 binding Settlement Agreement.\u201d\nIn that order, Gallagher said the federal government must show \u201ca good faith request to the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services).\u201d\nOn May 6, she affirmed her decision that the Trump administration must facilitate Cristian\u2019s return, but put her own order on pause to allow for Department of Justice attorneys to appeal to the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\nThe appeals court declined the Trump administration\u2019s request to pause her order.\nGallagher said Friday she would give the Trump administration officials until Monday to \u201cremedy their noncompliance.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration released significantly more detail about its budget request Friday evening, giving Congress the information it needs for lawmakers to draft the annual government funding bills.\nThe 1,224-page document sheds light on where exactly President Donald Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought want lawmakers to cut federal spending during the upcoming fiscal year.\nThe Office of Management and Budget released a \u201cskinny\u201d version of the annual proposal in early May, requesting lawmakers cut domestic spending by $163 billion and keep funding for defense programs flat in the dozen annual appropriations bills.\nWhile the documents in that request provided some insight into how Trump wants to reshape the size and scope of about $1.7 trillion in discretionary funding, which is spending that Congress directs, they didn\u2019t include the level of detail that the Appropriations committees need to begin their work.\nThe appendix document released Friday should aid in that, though it does not represent a full budget request. That type of proposal would include the White House\u2019s goals for mandatory programs, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which make up about two-thirds of federal spending. Such spending is required by law and is not subject to annual appropriations.\nA full budget request also typically includes tax policy proposals, though with Republicans in Congress already working to enact an extension of the 2017 GOP tax law in the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d those sections would likely be of little use to lawmakers at this point.\nWork on spending bills launching\nThe House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to release and debate its 12 government funding bills throughout June, before voting to send those measures to the floor.\nChairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., will likely include funding levels and policy closely aligned with the White House request, since legislation in that chamber can pass a floor vote with a simple majority\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, has a more challenging task, since regular bills in that chamber require bipartisanship to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster. Republicans control the Senate with 53 members.\nIn general, that means the Senate panel\u2019s bills tend to look much more like the final version that becomes law than the House bills, though not always.\nBoth chambers are supposed to reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the dozen bills before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1, but that rarely happens.\nCongress is much more likely to use a stopgap spending bill until mid-December to give members more time to negotiate funding levels and policies on thousands of government programs.\nThe House and Senate were unable to reach agreement for this fiscal year, and instead leaned on a series of three continuing resolutions to keep the government up and running.\nPartial shutdown could loom again\nTensions over the proposed funding cuts in Trump\u2019s first budget request of his second term could reach a boiling point if Cole, Collins, House ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Senate ranking member Patty Murray cannot broker an agreement before their deadline.\nFailure to enact some sort of government funding legislation \u2014 either the dozen full-year bills, or a stopgap spending measure \u2014 would lead to a partial government shutdown.\nMurray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Friday evening that it was \u201ctelling that President Trump has chosen to release his budget on a Friday night with no fanfare whatsoever.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a draconian proposal to hurt working people and our economy, and it is dead on arrival in Congress as long as I have anything to say about it,\u201d Murray wrote. \u201cBut this is just another reminder we need Republicans to join us to reject these reckless cuts, focus on the investments we actually need to make in our communities and security, and to finally force Trump to follow the law and end his devastating funding freeze.\u201d\nDeLauro wrote in a statement that the \u201cgovernment envisioned by President Trump only serves billionaires and the biggest corporations and would do nothing to lower the cost of living.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not a complete budget,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are supposed to start putting together the funding bills for 2026 next week. If, as expected, House Republicans follow what President Trump has proposed so far, it is not a serious effort to deliver for the American people.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court Friday said it will allow the Trump administration to remove deportation protections for more than 500,000 nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who were given permission to temporarily remain and work in the United States by the Biden administration.\nThe move by the high court \u2014 which permits the deportations while a lawsuit continues to work its way through the courts \u2014 came after a district court in Massachusetts in April blocked the Trump administration from ending the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, or CHNV, program for 532,000 people.\nIt\u2019s the second decision by the Supreme Court this month stripping immigrants of some form of temporary legal protections, affecting more than 800,000 people in the country without permanent legal status who are now subject to swift deportation.\nOn May 19, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status for 350,000 Venezuelans who were granted the protection from deportation because their home country was deemed too unstable to return to due to the political regime.\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin welcomed the ruling.\n\u201cEnding the CHNV parole programs, as well as the paroles of those who exploited it, will be a necessary return to common-sense policies, a return to public safety, and a return to America First,\u201d she said in a statement.\nTodd Schulte, the president of the immigration advocacy group FWD.us, said in a statement that the high court\u2019s decision \u201cpenalizes half a million people for complying with our immigration laws.\u201d\n\u201cThis decision will have devastating and immediate consequences, and is part of a broader attempt by the executive branch to justify further immigration enforcement crackdowns against families across the country,\u201d Schulte said. \u201cThe government failed to show any harm remotely comparable to that which will come from a half million people losing their jobs and becoming subject to deportation.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s case is one of several immigration-related emergency requests the Department of Justice has brought to the high court, as the Trump administration aims to carry out mass deportations, wind down temporary legal pathways for immigrants and redefine the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.\nNo judicial review for parole, DOJ argues\nIn the emergency filing to the high court in Friday\u2019s case, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the Immigration Nationality Act bars judicial review of discretionary decisions, such as what is called humanitarian parole, for the CHNV program.\nHe added that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem terminated the program because it does not align with the interests of the Trump administration.\nLiberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.\n\u201cThe Court has plainly botched this assessment today,\u201d Jackson wrote in her dissent. \u201cIt undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending.\u201d\nShe argued that the Trump administration did not prove it would be harmed by the preliminary injunction. An appeals court previously rejected the government\u2019s request to put the lower court\u2019s order on hold.\n\u201cWhile it is apparent that the Government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum predecision damage, court-ordered stays exist to minimize\u2014not maximize\u2014harm to litigating parties,\u201d Jackson wrote.\nPresident Joe Biden created the CHNV program in 2023. It temporarily granted work permits and allowed thousands of nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to remain in the country if they were sponsored by someone in the United States and passed a background check.\nLast updated 1:41 p.m., May. 30, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Greg Miller, R-Norco, backed McMakin\u2019s bill and shared his concerns about the current structure of the boards.\n\u201cThe people who are supposed to be regulated are actually the ones doing the regulating,\u201d Miller said.\nThe bill closely resembles law changes Landry got approved last year that have already consolidated the governor\u2019s power over state appointees.\nState lawmakers gave Landry the ability to appoint the chairs of 150 state boards and commissions directly instead of relying on the boards to pick their own leaders. These boards include the 32 Landry hoped to gain more control over through McMakin\u2019s bill.\nLegislators also made changes in 2024 to the board of the Louisiana Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority to give the governor more say-so on members of that panel. And they permitted the governor more power over appointees to the Louisiana Board of Ethics.\nLandry now gets to pick his ethics board appointees directly instead of having to choose from lists of nominees from Louisiana\u2019s private college and university leaders.\nOn Wednesday, Senate committee members indicated those recent changes made them wary of handing Landry more authority.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think that the way the bill is \u2026 strips away the voice of the particular industry to offer up potential nominees?\u201d asked Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, who voted against McMakin\u2019s legislation. \u201cIt makes it, in a sense, purely political.\u201d\n\u201cThis kind of gives even more power to an already powerful executive branch,\u201d Sen. Gary Carter, D-New Orleans, said. \u201cI have grave concerns about it.\u201d\nMcMakin said safeguards already in place make sure the governor selects qualified board members. The governor\u2019s appointees have to meet certain standards to serve, such as holding an occupational license in the field they would have to regulate.\nThe governor\u2019s appointees also do not make up the majority of any of the licensing boards in his bill, McMakin said.\nSen. Larry Selders, D-Baton Rouge, remained unconvinced that the governor should be given more authority, however.\n\u201cWhere is the protection? Last year, we gave the governor the authority to appoint the chairmen. Now, we are giving the governor the authority to put two or three people \u2013 or various numbers \u2013 on different committees. And so when is it going to change again next year?\u201d Selders said, before voting against the legislation.\nDespite the bill failing, McMakin said the governor\u2019s office could find a way to revive it before the legislature ends its session June 12.\n\u201cThe bill is not dead,\u201d he said in an interview.\nLegislators have shown less tolerance for growing the governor\u2019s authority, however.\nA constitutional amendment aimed at giving the governor two at-large appointees to the five-member Public Service Commission failed to get off the ground earlier this spring. Landry\u2019s push to give him more sway over appointees to a New Orleans-area flood protection agency board has also died this session.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)\nA federal judge in California said Thursday he is considering issuing an order to preserve work permits for a small group of Venezuelans with temporary protected status, which allows migrants to live in the United States for a set period without fear of deportation.\nThey were granted these extended protections by immigration officials before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision that allowed the Trump administration to revoke those protections.\nA hearing before U.S. District Judge Edward Chen was the first in the case since the Supreme Court on May 19 allowed the Trump administration to end temporary protections for a group of 350,000 Venezuelans and vacated Chen\u2019s order blocking the administration\u2019s move.\nChen, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama to a seat in the Northern District of California, acknowledged that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision has left an \u201cisland\u201d of about 5,000 Venezuelans who have gotten work permits approved until October of 2026 \u2014 before the high court\u2019s order moved up the date their TPS status expired.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small exception,\u201d he said.\nAttorneys for those TPS holders filed an emergency motion to protect that subgroup to keep those work and deportation protections through October 2026. They are also pushing for an expedited hearing schedule to challenge the administration\u2019s revocation of protections because the group of Venezuelans lost protections in April, meaning they are subject to deportation.\n\u201cEvery day that there\u2019s not a final decision in this case, our plaintiffs are now subject to deportation, are now losing their jobs, and we need to move urgently towards a final resolution in this case,\u201d Jessica Karp Bansal, who is representing the National TPS Alliance, said at a Thursday hearing.\nBack and forth\nIn March, Chen found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u2019s decision to revoke extended protections for Venezuelans previously granted under the Biden administration until October of 2026 was arbitrary and capricious. His order overturned Noem\u2019s revocation of protections for one group of Venezuelans who were placed on TPS in 2023.\nThe group of Venezuelans given protections in 2023 were initially scheduled to lose that status on April 7, meaning the Supreme Court\u2019s May decision allowed Noem to immediately revoke the extended protections. The second group\u2019s protections will end in September.\nThe groups who brought the suit against Noem represent TPS holders from Venezuela. The immigration groups have amended their complaint to include TPS holders from Haiti, whose protections will expire in August after Noem revoked an extension.\nA federal district court in New York this week held oral arguments on the termination of TPS for more than 300,000 Haitians.\nThe California case is also before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which will hear oral arguments in July.\nNoem cited gang activity as her reason for not extending TPS for the 2023 group of Venezuelans.\nThe attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of the TPS holders, are also pressing for discovery to obtain records and documents to show the decision process for ending TPS for nationals from Venezuela and Haiti.\nChen set a status conference for June 24 at 1 p.m. Pacific Time.\nLast updated 8:25 a.m., May. 30, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

( Eric Shelton/Mississippi Today)\nThree weeks after a medical biller announced it would no longer be working with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi, moms in the state face out-of-pocket costs of over $100 per session for breastfeeding help \u2013 and are calling on lawmakers and the state\u2019s largest private insurer to step up.\nAlthough Blue Cross has always restricted which lactation consultants it considers in-network \u2013 generally only covering services in hospitals provided directly after birth \u2013 moms with Blue Cross insurance previously had a workaround. A third party biller called The Lactation Network (TLN), which contracts with lactation consultants, covered the costs for women with the insurance.\nHowever, on April 30, TLN sent out a letter to consultants saying their organization was not being reimbursed by insurance companies and could not afford to continue fronting the money to cover moms with certain health insurance \u2013 including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama.\nTLN did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Mississippi Today.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting there like: I\u2019ve got to feed my baby, and something\u2019s not right, and I can\u2019t get help,\u201d said Patience Pierini, a Gulfport mom of two. \u201c\u2026 If, more than anything, people need nourishment, why is this not being covered?\u201d\nThe recent development has prompted moms and lactation consultants to ask why Blue Cross never covered these services directly in the first place \u2013 which nurse practitioner and lactation consultant Laken Miller called \u201ceven worse\u201d than dropping the coverage.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know before that the Lactation Network was just bridging the gap, and understandably, it was a cost that they couldn\u2019t continue to absorb,\u201d said Miller, who is an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) \u2013 the highest form of accreditation in lactation care \u2013 in Laurel.\nThe only in-network lactation consultants currently covered by Blue Cross in Mississippi are physicians, who do not generally operate outpatient clinics focused solely on breastfeeding care. But there\u2019s nothing stopping the insurance company from working with non-MD lactation consultants, explained Marsha Walker, president of the National Lactation Consultant Alliance.\nBlue Cross operates independently in each state, and the restrictions on lactation services vary significantly. In Tennessee, they are slightly more lax than Mississippi, with the insurance company working with certified lactation consultants who also have nursing degrees, two consultants told Mississippi Today.\nBlue Cross also did not respond to questions from Mississippi Today about why it does not cover non-physician lactation care in Mississippi or if it has plans to in the future.\nInsurance companies are required by federal law to cover breastfeeding support, counseling and equipment. But they\u2019ve been allowed to meet this requirement while offering limited access to few providers, or only covering virtual consultations, explained Walker, who is also a registered nurse and IBCLC.\n\u201cThe (Affordable Care Act) does say that breastfeeding counseling needs to be covered, but it doesn\u2019t say how \u2013 and that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s general in scope, leaving it up to the insurers to figure out how to adhere to that.\u201d\nThere were 97 IBCLCs in the state in 2023, but the vast majority of those work in hospitals and provide support to mothers during their stay following birth \u2013 which is typically long before mature milk comes in and various breastfeeding problems surface, Miller, the lactation consultant and nurse practitioner, explained.\nMiller said she only knows of four IBCLCs besides herself working outside of hospitals in the state.\nLast week, Miller and her colleagues sent a letter to state lawmakers asking that the Legislature ensure insurance companies are adequately fulfilling their obligation under the ACA to cover lactation care.\n\u201cWe recognize that BCBS supports breastfeeding \u2026 However, the reality is that thousands of mothers in Mississippi will no longer have access to no-cost lactation services from private practice IBCLCs due to no available in-network or out-of-network providers,\u201d the letter read.\nCovering lactation services yields a huge return on investment for insurance companies, explained Walker, if it prevents even one infant\u2019s stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for a condition like necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a severe gastrointestinal condition in premature infants that is made more likely by a diet of formula.\n\u201cIf you do not cover breastfeeding, it comes back to haunt you later on with the increased amount of money they\u2019re going to spend on diseases and conditions that are preventable by breastfeeding,\u201d Walker said.\nOne study estimated each baby who is breastfed for three months saves private insurance companies $750 compared to those who are never breastfed.\nFor new moms, whether they have access to timely care will make or break their decision to breastfeed, explained Erin Mattingly, a Jackson-based IBCLC who also signed the legislative letter.\n\u201cWhen parents run into trouble in that 10-day to two-week period, if they don\u2019t have access to help, the vast majority of them will quit breastfeeding,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s very difficult to push through a situation that feels dire when you are postpartum and recovering from a birth and learning a new baby.\u201d\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis article first appeared on Mississippi Today and is republished here under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Some students were detained by immigration authorities as part of that effort.\nFocus on China\nIn his Wednesday announcement, Rubio said the State Department would also \u201crevise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Hong Kong.\u201d\nAt the department\u2019s Thursday press briefing, spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to get into specifics regarding the number of students who would be impacted or what falls within \u201ccritical fields,\u201d as Rubio\u2019s statement noted.\nBruce said the United States \u201cwill not tolerate the CCP\u2019s exploitation of U.S. universities, or theft of U.S. research, intellectual property or technologies to grow its military power, conduct intelligence collection or repress voices of opposition.\u201d\nMore than 277,000 Chinese students studied in the United States during the 2023-24 academic year \u2014 making up nearly one-quarter of the more than 1,126,000 total international students in that school year, according to a report from the Institute of International Education and the State Department.\nHowever, the total number of students from China declined slightly from the 2022-23 school year, when that figure stood at more than 289,000.\nIn the 2023-24 academic year, Chinese students made up one-quarter or more of the total international student population within California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington state and Wisconsin.\nNew York University, Northeastern University in Massachusetts and Columbia University in New York hosted the highest number of international students during that academic year.\nStudents from South Korea, Canada, Taiwan, Vietnam and Nigeria also comprised large groups of international students in the United States during the 2023-24 school year.\nThe announcement raises myriad logistical questions over how the United States would carry out the effort, as well as how officials would determine who has \u201cconnections to the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the State Department temporarily paused new student visa interviews earlier this week as the administration prepares to expand the screening of applicants\u2019 activity on social media, according to multiple reports.\nLast updated 3:24 p.m., May. 29, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Center for Migration Studies Thursday released a report finding the population of people in the United States without permanent legal status increased to 12.2 million in 2023, using the most recent Census Bureau American Community Survey data.\nIt\u2019s a number that grew by 2 million from 2020 to 2023, according to the study by the nonpartisan New York think tank that studies domestic and international migration.\nSix states that have the largest population of people without permanent legal status also saw some of the biggest increases. They are California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas. Of those states, the fastest-growing were Florida, New York and New Jersey.\nThat population estimate includes not only people in the U.S. without legal authorization, but immigrants in programs that provide temporary legal status. That would include programs like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and Temporary Protected Status, as well as people with pending asylum cases or who received humanitarian parole status since 2021.\nThe study noted that estimating the size of the population without permanent legal status could \u201cbecome even more challenging in the next few years\u201d because the census data collection could be affected by mass firings of federal workers as the Trump administration aims to cull the federal workforce.\nAuthors of the study also took into consideration the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to enact mass deportations and how the population could decline, not due to removals but rather a decrease in the number of immigrants responding to survey data.\n\u201cThe salient questions would be: Did the decline occur because deportations increased, including of populations stripped of temporary legal status, because fear led to an increase in emigration, because fear reduced the response rates in the surveys, or because of a combination of these or other factors?,\u201d according to the study.\nThe annual report from the think tank runs counter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u2019s congressional testimony in May to Senate appropriators that there are more than 20 million people in the country without legal authorization.\nOther think tanks that study migration, such as the Migration Policy Institute, have estimated as of 2021, there were 11.2 million immigrants in the U.S. without legal authorization.\nVenezuelan migrants\nOne major finding in the study by the Center for Migration Studies was that the population of Venezuelan immigrants increased from 55,000 in 2013 to 220,000 in 2020.\nAccording to the study, that population then doubled in 2023 to 445,000, which is around the time the Biden administration granted TPS protections for a second group of Venezuelans after granting TPS for a first group of Venezuelans in 2021. Roughly half a million Venezuelans are under the TPS program and are at risk of losing protections from deportation.\nThat program allows nationals from countries deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, political instability or other unstable conditions to remain in the U.S. for up to 18 months unless their protections are renewed by the Department of Homeland Security Secretary.\nThe Trump administration is moving to end TPS for Venezuelans and invoked an 18th-century wartime law to rapidly deport any Venezuelan national 14 and older who is suspected of gang ties.\nThe Supreme Court has blocked the use of the wartime law over concerns of due process, and has not ruled on the constitutionality of using the law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. But the high court is allowing the Trump administration to continue its efforts to end TPS for Venezuelans who were granted protections in 2023.\nCentral American migrants\nThe study also found the population of Central American immigrants grew by 1.2 million from 2013 to 2023. With the highest levels of migration at the southern border in 20 years, the Biden administration in January 2023 created a program to allow nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela \u2013 nearly all from Central America \u2013 to be sponsored with work visas and have deportation protections.\nRoughly 532,000 people are in that program. The Trump administration has made an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court to end it, potentially opening those immigrants up to rapid deportation.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

In the evenings, tourists make their way across the avenue from the French Quarter, drinks in hand, ready to take in some jazz at the clubs on Frenchman Street.\nThese visitors \u2014 or the current residents, for that matter \u2014 have little reason to give any thought to what once happened here in centuries past. The streetscape then could have included a cortege of enslaved Black people being forced-marched in chains from far away or from ships at the nearby docks or unloaded from wagons, all to be delivered to what amounted to urban prison camps.\nBefore the Civil War, the blocks on and surrounding Esplanade Avenue were home to dozens of slave pens, stockyard-like enclosures of dirt lots surrounded by high brick walls to deter escape and shield public view. Inside were men, women, and children warehoused until they could be sold, either directly from the pens or on the auction blocks somewhere in the prosperous city of New Orleans.\nThe pens were \u201cfoul places, attractive to flies and lice and vermin, hazy with acrid smoke from cheap pork cooked over open flames, and reeking of sweat and urine and feces and garbage,\u201d historian Joshua D. Rothman said in his book \u201cThe Ledger and the Chain: How Domestic Slave Traders Shaped America.\u201d\nIt was the stench and health concerns \u2014 not the inhumanity of the slave trade itself \u2014 that had prompted Quarter residents to push for the pens to be moved away from their fine homes into the neighborhoods along Esplanade.\nThe prisoners, many torn from family and friends and forced to walk or endure ship passage for hundreds of miles from the Upper South to serve new masters, were crowded inside by overseers concerned only with keeping them healthy and fit enough to bring top dollar on the market.\nPassersby \u201cmight hear the cries of small children\u201d or \u201cthe muted anguish of adults who are there, who are suffering what we call today PTSD or some sort of traumatic injury, who are trying to wrap their heads around what\u2019s happening,\u201d Calvin Schermerhorn, history professor at Arizona State University said in an interview.\nAn alert visitor can find a historical marker on the neutral ground near Esplanade Avenue and Chartres Street, marking the city\u2019s connection to the brutal slave trade. Another marker across the intersection toward the river marks the location of the infamous slave pens where Solomon Northup, known for \u201cTwelve Years a Slave,\u201d was sold into slavery.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation, that will not go unpunished forever,\u201d Northup said in his 1853 memoir of his life as a free man sold into slavery. \u201cThere will be reckoning yet \u2026 It may be sooner or it may be later, but it\u2019s a coming as sure as the Lord is just.\u201d\nThat accounting has yet to fully come to a city more associated with letting the good times roll than dealing with past sins.\nOutside of historians, academics and the generational memories of Black New Orleanians, relatively few people understand the enormity of New Orleans\u2019 involvement in the slave trade, which helped build generational wealth for white residents and made the city the most financially powerful and influential in the South.\nGregg Kimball, Senior Consulting Historian for the Shockoe Institute in Richmond, Va., maintains that the slave trade was part of the 19th century U.S. economic boom \u201cthat really made the United States a world power. It basically created American capitalism. That\u2019s a big deal. Right?\u2019\u201d\nFor New Orleans, sugar and slaves were the driving forces for an economy that also thrived from the global cotton trade and its position at the mouth of the Mississippi River.\n\u201cIt\u2019s those three intertwined. It\u2019s New Orleans\u2019s status as not only a port city, but as a place where banking is based and where trading happens in sugar and cotton and slaves,\u201d New Orleans historian Erin Greenwald said.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nSlavery is in the very bones of New Orleans, where the essential protective levees, streets and core buildings were constructed by enslaved workers. Captive Black laborers helped grow and harvest the lucrative sugar and cotton crops, loaded the yield onto the ships for export and even served as collateral for plantation owners\u2019 bank loans to expand their land holdings and buy more enslaved workers.\nFrom the early 1800s until Union Troops occupied the city about a year after the beginning of the Civil War, New Orleans was known as the \u201cslave market of the South.\u201d An estimated 135,000 people were bought and sold in the city and its immediate environs at more than 50 documented places.\nThese are the same places where residents and tourists today celebrate Mardi Gras, sleep in luxury hotels, drink in dive bars, and eat at fine restaurants. In 2025, there is little public acknowledgement of the atrocities of slavery beyond a few mostly low-key historical markers and some local tours designed to go beyond the usual sightseeing fare.\nThe history of how slavery made New Orleans the city it is today rarely intrudes on the daily awareness of most people.\nGreenwald said she values what she gets from reading academic histories.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to penetrate the consciousness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not. It\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s jargony. \u2026 Historians are speaking generally to each other. You have to have a lot of prior knowledge to access a lot of the narrative in academic history.\u201d\nThere is also the city\u2019s reluctance to confront its painful past, focusing instead on tourism-friendly narratives and laissez les bons temps rouler marketing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a powerful impulse to keep slavery in the rearview mirror, to present a story about the United States that is one of progress and improvement,\u201d Rothman, chair of the history department at the University of Alabama, said in an interview. \u201cPeople like to think slavery was terrible, but we fixed it. In fact, we\u2019ve forgotten about it.\u201d\nTo those who know, the city\u2019s slave history is everywhere: former slave quarters operating as apartments and short-term rentals, historic structures built with slave labor and a culture of music and art that wouldn\u2019t exist without the influence and contributions of enslaved residents. But it isn\u2019t easy to track down the markers, read the academic research and all the other things that provide a thorough understanding of what happened.\nIn an upcoming series of articles, Verite News hopes to make the city\u2019s connection to slavery better known and understood by residents who are not familiar with stories and connections held dear by descendants of the enslaved and to the millions who come to visit \u201cthe city that care forgot.\u201d\nThe historical marker for the St. Louis Hotel, the most famous slave auction site in New Orleans, is placed at the back of the luxurious Omni Royal Orleans hotel, next to a loading dock. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people walk past it each day without pausing to read about what took place there.\nThe marker itself seems to downplay the connection to the slave market and its inhumanity. \u201cThe luxurious St. Louis Hotel included a bank, ballroom, shopping arcade, and trading exchange,\u201d the marker boasts. \u201cSix days a week, under the hotel\u2019s domed rotunda, auctioneers sold land and goods,\u201d before what almost seems like an aside of \u201cas well as thousands of enslaved people.\u201d\nSlavery-related markers on The Moonwalk by the Mississippi River, The Merieult House on Royal Street, The Cabildo in Jackson Square, slave pen locations at Esplanade and Chartres, the New Orleans Slave Depot at Common and Baronne streets, and Congo Square are also easy to overlook.\nAnd even for those who do stop and read, the official city guidance and literature provides little context for what it means and what the reader should think or do about it. While other cities around the world have benefited from building museums, permanent exhibits, and other educational structures on painful events, including the Holocaust, race massacres, and the atrocities and injustices of the Jim Crow era, New Orleans has mostly remained on the sidelines.\nThe removal of Confederate monuments from prominent positions in the city sparked a great outcry in 2017 from those who said they saw it as \u201cerasing history,\u201d but the recognition of enslaved people\u2019s contributions to building and molding New Orleans has not received similar support.\n\u201cThere had been this resistance, I think, in New Orleans generally to recognizing darker sides of history that complicate the fun-time celebration, exotic nature tourism of the city,\u201d said Greenwald, who put together \u201cPurchased Lives,\u201d an extensive exhibit on slavery that was on display at The Historic New Orleans Collection in 2015. \u201cNew Orleans is not alone in that, but they might be one of the worst examples of covering up things that aren\u2019t part of their tourism narrative, and that has changed.\u201d\nMany of the slave markers were placed by a city commission appointed to mark the New Orleans Tricentennial in 2018. Freddi Evans, a New Orleans author and educator who was on the commission, said in an interview that the markers have had a positive effect.\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if it has an impact on the people who are coming here as tourists, but it has an impact on the people who are here, the citizens,\u201d she said, including the descendants of enslaved people who have taken it upon themselves to keep their history from being erased. The New Orleans Tricentennial Commission does offer a slave marker tour app that provides \u201can immersive and dramatic self-guided tour of sites that played an important role in the domestic slave trade of New Orleans.\u201d\nEach year, over the July 4th weekend, the New Orleans MAAFA Commemoration takes place. Sponsored by the Ash\u00e9 Cultural Arts Center, participants wearing white begin at Congo Square with stops at the Esplanade site, the Tomb of the Unknown Slave (next to St.Augustine Catholic Church on Governor Nicholls Street), and other locations. Maafa is a Kiswahili word that means \u201cgreat disaster\u201d or \u201cgreat tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cHundreds of people come,\u201d Evans said. It\u2019s one way the city can memorialize those who suffered under slavery.\nHarvard historian Walter Johnson has written that the whole city should be considered a memorial to slavery.\n\u201cThe levee is a slave-built levee. The entire economic development of the city was premised upon slavery. All the buildings were built by enslaved people or free people of color,\u201d Johnson told The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2017.\n\u201cYou could memorialize the city of New Orleans with a million markers of which enslaved people lived there, which enslaved people worked there, which enslaved people built this.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo illustration via Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The massive tax and spending package U.S. House Republicans narrowly advanced last week could hinder accountability for for-profit colleges and weaken student-borrower protections, student advocates say.\nThe bill, now headed to the Senate, calls for sweeping changes to education policy under what GOP lawmakers deem \u201cregulatory relief.\u201d\nThat includes eliminating a rule governing for-profit schools, removing \u201cgainful employment\u201d as a goal for colleges receiving federal funds and hindering consumer protections for borrowers defrauded or facing school closures.\nGOP lawmakers are aiming to slash billions of dollars in federal spending to offset the cost of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, border security and defense spending through the complex budget reconciliation process, which allows Congress to skirt the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold that generally requires bipartisanship. The package, which the House passed 215-214 last week, will likely undergo significant changes in the Senate.\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce\u2019s portion of the reconciliation package also includes significant changes to how student loans are repaid, cuts to federal student aid and new eligibility requirements for the Pell Grant, a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college.\nStudent advocates and congressional Democrats have opposed the bill, emphasizing the impact of the proposed changes on higher education affordability and access as well as the weakening of protections for defrauded borrowers and fewer guardrails to hold for-profit schools accountable.\nKyle Southern, associate vice president for higher education quality at the Institute for College Access & Success, said the bill would \u201cput higher education further out of reach for low-income students, students of color (and) many first-generation students.\u201d\n\u201cIt would also make it a riskier investment, because it \u2026 weakens or rolls back many critical student protections that have been put in place as guardrails to help ensure the quality of post-secondary programs across sectors,\u201d he said.\nThe nonprofit advocacy group aims to advance affordability, accountability and equity in higher education.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the bill\u2019s key education provisions related to institutional accountability and borrower protections:\nRepealing the 90/10 rule\nThe bill repeals the Education Department\u2019s \u201c90/10 rule,\u201d which requires that at least 10% of the money for-profit institutions receive derives from non-federal sources.\nThe regulation initially did not apply to student veteran benefits, creating a loophole that pushed for-profit schools to target veterans in their programs.\nThough Congress did eventually close the loophole in a provision of the massive COVID-19 relief package Congress passed in 2021, the current bill would slash the rule altogether.\nCarrie Wofford, president of Veterans Education Success, said the 90/10 rule \u201cstops federal funds from being used to prop up otherwise failing college companies.\u201d\nWofford said \u201cit\u2019s very shocking and upsetting to all the veterans and military leaders who worked for a decade to get this done and had a bipartisan agreement and had Republican leadership completely signing off,\u201d referencing the efforts to close the earlier loophole.\nVeterans Education Success, a group which advocates for the rights of student veterans, service members and their families, wrote to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions last week urging the panel to not include the repeal of the 90/10 rule in the chamber\u2019s version of the bill.\nGainful employment\nThe bill would also strike the phrase \u201cgainful employment\u201d from several definitions within the Higher Education Act, a law providing financial assistance for students and higher education institutions.\nAs the Institute for College Access & Success notes in a fact sheet, the Gainful Employment rule, an Education Department regulation, helps \u201censure that career education programs receiving federal student aid prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation\u201d and aims to \u201cprotect students from low-value programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debt and poor job prospects.\u201d\nStriking the term from the definitions likely sets the stage for the Education Department to rescind the rule, according to Sarah Austin, a policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.\n\u201cPresumably, what we kind of took (striking the phrase) to mean is that that would lead to them rescinding gainful employment rules because the definitions in statute were what they\u2019ve always kind of used as showing their legal authority to regulate on gainful employment,\u201d Austin said.\n\u201cWithout those definitions in there, not only does that seem to say that they would not have these gainful employment regulations, but also would kind of stop future administrations from having any sort of gainful employment framework because the definitions are not even in the Higher Education Act anymore.\u201d\nBorrower protections\nAs for borrower protections, the bill would also repeal 2022 versions of the Closed School Discharge and Borrower Defense to Repayment rules, reverting to what they looked like before the Biden administration.\nWhile the Closed School Discharge rule provides debt relief to a borrower whose school shuts down, the Borrower Defense to Repayment provision helps forgive debt for students whose institution defrauded them.\nAustin said that \u201cwith the 2022 rules, there was automatic closed school discharge, so if a school closed, a borrower may be entitled to have their loans automatically discharged, not require any action on their behalf, where the prior set of rules, they would actually have to apply for the closed school discharge, so this would be reverting back to that if it was to move forward as law.\u201d\nUnder the bill, the Borrower Defense to Repayment provision would fall back to a 2019 rule that then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos put into place.\nSouthern, of the Institute for College Access & Success, said that 2019 rule \u201cmade the process essentially so onerous and arbitrary that qualifying people would not be able to receive the relief that federal law entitles them to.\u201d\nLast updated 12:32 p.m., May. 29, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "11:53\nNews Story\nTrump admin likely violated Constitution in bid to deport activist held in Louisiana, judge says\nSupporters of Mahmoud Khalil rally outside the federal courthouse in Newark, N.J., on March 28, 2025. (Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)\nA federal judge said Wednesday that attempts to deport a pro-Palestinian Columbia University activist likely violate the Constitution, dealing a potential blow to efforts by the Trump administration to kick political student activists out of the country.\nBut U.S. Judge Michael Farbiarz stopped short of releasing Mahmoud Khalil, a legal resident of the U.S., from the Louisiana jail where he is being held. Farbiarz directed Khalil\u2019s legal team to present more arguments on why he should be released.\nThe judge added that while Khalil may be successful in challenging the government\u2019s \u201cvagueness\u201d regarding his detention, the government may still be justified in detaining him based on their allegation that he lied on his green card application. Khalil contends he is a political prisoner detained in violation of his free speech rights.\n\u201cIf an immigration court holds that the Petitioner did not have to disclose the allegedly omitted information, that could fully dispose of the underlying ground for removal, without any need for a federal court to reach a potentially complex First Amendment question,\u201d Farbiarz wrote in the 106-page decision.\nKhalil was arrested by federal immigration agents in New York City on March 8 and has been held in immigration detention in Louisiana since. He was among the first in a wave of pro-Palestinian legal residents who have been arrested by federal authorities as the Trump administration has ramped up mass deportation and tested the limits of immigration law.\nWhile Khalil hasn\u2019t been charged with a crime, he\u2019s facing removal based on two claims: inaccuracies on his green card application and a determination by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Khail\u2019s presence in the country would have \u201cserious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d and \u201ccompromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\u201d\nKhalil\u2019s legal challenge to his detention is playing out in two courts \u2014 immigration court in Louisiana, where a judge said she had no authority to question the government\u2019s decision to remove Khalil, and in federal court in New Jersey, where Khalil was temporarily held while his attorneys filed a petition for his release.\nFarbiarz\u2019s ruling says Rubio likely overstepped his authority when he invoked a rarely used provision of federal law called section 1227 to target Khalil and other student activists for deportation. The statute allows for the deportation of non-citizens if the secretary of state determines their \u201cpresence or activities \u2026 would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences.\u201d\n\u201cThe petitioner is likely to succeed on the merits of his claim that section 1227 is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him through the SoS\u2019s determination,\u201d Farbiarz wrote.\nRemoval of this kind, he added, would be \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\nThe judge asked for additional briefings on the government\u2019s claims surrounding Kahlil\u2019s green card application. He also said he would soon issue another order with the next steps in the case.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, part of the legal team representing Khalil, said in a statement they vow to keep fighting for his release.\n\u201cWe will work as quickly as possible to provide the court the additional information it requested supporting our effort to free Mahmoud or otherwise return him to his wife and newborn son. Every day Mahmoud spends languishing in an ICE detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, is an affront to justice, and we won\u2019t stop working until he is free,\u201d his legal team said.\nKhalil is protected from being deported immediately under a previous order from Farbiarz that bars the government from removing him while his fight to be released from detention proceeds.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis report was first published by the New Jersey Monitor, part of the States Newsroom nonprofit news network.

        "Content": "5:47\nNews Story\nLouisiana lawmakers put some limits back in place on gifts to public officials\nInvestigation policy changes remain in proposal\nRep. Beau Beaullieu has updated his proposal to change state ethics laws concerning gifts to public officials. (Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)\nLouisiana lawmakers are no longer looking to broadly lift restrictions on gifts to elected officials and public employees while doing their jobs, but they still appear intent on discouraging ethics investigations.\nRep. Beau Beaullieu, R-Iberia, removed language from House Bill 674 that would have allowed public servants to receive $200 worth of gifts annually. This would have applied to all local and state government employees, from a local police officer to the governor.\nInstead, Beaullieu has rewritten the legislation to keep a portion of a current limitation on government worker gifts in place. Now, gifts that aren\u2019t food would be mostly restricted to $200 worth of flowers or a charitable donation to express sympathy for a family death.\nNew allowances for \u201cseasonal\u201d food and beverages remain in the bill, however. Under current law, most public officials are not supposed to receive food and drink as gifts unless it\u2019s at a party or reception.\nUnder existing rules, they have to consume the food in person at the event where it is given. The edible gift can cost no more than $79 per person, a cutoff the Louisiana Board of Ethics adjusts every year based on the Consumer Price Index.\nBeaullieu\u2019s updated proposal would allow elected leaders and public employees to also take seasonal or holiday foods as gifts for a religious or state holiday, even outside of a party or reception. The cap on food gifts would also be $79 per person per holiday or whatever new price the ethics board adopts in future years.\nBesides the gift policy changes, Beaullieu\u2019s bill contains several ethics law modifications that would make it much harder for the state ethics board to investigate and charge people with misconduct.\nThe ethics board oversees enforcement of campaign finance laws and the state ethics code for public employees, elected officials and lobbyists. Anyone from a public school teacher to the governor can be subject of one of its investigations.\nThe adjustments Beaullieu proposes would require more members of the ethics board to vote in favor of pursuing an investigation and give the board far less time to decide whether a person should be charged with ethical wrongdoing. People accused of ethics violations would also have more ability to push back on the allegations under Beaullieu\u2019s bill.\nIf the legislation were to pass, the new standards that would have to be met in order for the ethics board to launch an investigation would be very difficult to achieve. For example, the ethics board would have to be confident that wrongdoing had occurred in order to sign off on any preliminary probe into the alleged misconduct.\nEthics Administrator David Bordelon said earlier this month the process Beaullieu seeks would \u201cskew\u201d the process in favor of the public servant accused of wrongdoing. He also took issue with a new restriction Beaullieu proposed Tuesday on ethical investigations and charges. The state representative added language to his bill prohibiting the ethics board from launching an investigation based on information it received through an advisory opinion request.\nThe board is frequently asked to explain how ethics laws apply in specific situations through advisory opinions. It issues at least a few of these public letters monthly providing feedback.\n\u201cIf someone submits an advisory opinion request that indicates a violation has already occurred, it should be within the board\u2019s prerogative to initiate an investigation of that,\u201d Bordelon told senators at a committee hearing Tuesday.\nBeaullieu said he is trying to overhaul state ethics investigations because many elected officials feel the board has been too aggressive when pursuing allegations.\nBut the state\u2019s preeminent state government watchdog, the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, has come out strongly against the bill.\n\u201cThis is designed to make sure we don\u2019t have ethics investigations,\u201d Steven Procopio, the organization\u2019s president, said of the proposed changes.\nThe legislation is backed by Gov. Jeff Landry, who has had several personal conflicts with the ethics board over his nine years in statewide office.\nIn 2023, the board charged Landry in 2023 with the ethics violation of failing to disclose flights he took on a political donor\u2019s private plane to Hawaii for an attorneys general conference. That dispute is ongoing because the governor and board members have not reached an agreement on what Landry\u2019s punishment for the violation should be.\nStephen Gel\u00e9, the attorney representing Landry in this ethics dispute, also helped write Beaullieu\u2019s legislation to overhaul the state\u2019s ethics laws.\nThe Louisiana Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee approved the bill Tuesday with no objections. An earlier version of the proposal also passed the Louisiana House unanimously, but both the Senate and the House will have to approve the amended version before it can become law.\nIt must pass by the Louisiana Legislature\u2019s session adjournment June 12.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "5:00\nNews Story\nMississippi River loses most of its sediment \u2013 and land building ability \u2013 before reaching the Gulf\nNew research shows that typically, less than 10% of land-building alluvium reaches the Bird\u2019s Foot Delta region, the southernmost reach of the river, where it meets the Gulf.\nA cargo ship traverses the Mississippi River in lower Plaquemines Parish on June 7, 2024. (La\u2019Shance Perry/The Lens. Aerial support provided by SouthWings)\nNEW ORLEANS \u2013 Mississippi River ships and barges carry over 500 million tons of cargo through the Southwest Pass shipping channel at the river\u2019s end to reach major ports that handle 18% of U.S. waterborne commerce. For almost 100 years, levees and other human-made flood control structures have lined the banks of the river, obstructing its land-building silt, sand and clay from naturally rebuilding land along coastal Louisiana.\nThat sediment is essential to rebuilding \u2013 or at this point, maintaining \u2013 the fragile coastline that has been receding for decades. Without it, the small towns that dot the lower part of the Louisiana Gulf Coast are left exposed, with no protection against storm surges and hurricane-strength winds. But to reverse coastal erosion, scientists found that they first had to understand where sediment that could be used to rebuild settles instead.\nMost of the year, less than 10% of the river\u2019s sediment reaches the critical Bird\u2019s Foot Delta, according to scientists from the Mississippi River Delta Transition Initiative, known as MissDelta. The bird\u2019s foot\u2014at the southernmost reach of the river system that juts into the Gulf of Mexico\u2014plays a vital role in coastal protection, navigation, fisheries and energy infrastructure.\nIn 2023, MissDelta launched a $22 million, five-year research project spearheaded by Tulane University and Louisiana State University, and funded by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The study aims to evaluate the Delta and Southwest Pass, the critical navigation channel, with hopes of finding management approaches that will benefit both the delicate ecosystem and the people who live and work in the delta region, including fisherpeople, charter-boat operators, offshore workers, shipyard builders, mechanics and petrochemical-facility operators.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nDuring the first year-and-a-half of the study, researchers measured discharge by plunging a 200-pound sampler into the river at various depths. By tracking sediment from the sampler, the team can measure how much settles in the wetlands upriver versus how much exits into the deepwater Gulf, said Claire Kemick, a Tulane graduate student working to collect the samples.\nThe study\u2019s early findings, announced at Louisiana\u2019s State of the Coast conference, show that the Mississippi River loses substantial amounts of water and sediment above what\u2019s called the Head of Passes, at the mouth of the river, where the Mississippi forms its distinct bird\u2019s foot by branching into three directions: the Southwest Pass shipping channel (west), Pass A Loutre (east) and South Pass (center).\nThat means the Bird\u2019s Foot Delta is headed toward further degradation, after losing ground for decades, said Mead Allison, co-lead of MissDelta and a professor in Tulane\u2019s Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering.\nAbove the Head of Passes, substantial amounts of sediment carried by the Mississippi River are lost through both natural and man-made channels, such as the rapidly expanding Neptune Pass near Buras, Louisiana, in lower Plaquemines Parish. But most is lost well before then.\nUsing data on sediment movement, the team can calibrate models to predict what will happen to the delta by 2100 under different scenarios, with varied sea-level rise, storm frequency and river-flow fluctuations. Once the researchers develop the models, they will use them to test various interventions that could save the delta, such as closing river exits and changing water-flow patterns.\nIn the fall, the MissDelta team will return to lower Plaquemines Parish to study the saltwater wedge that creeps up the river during low flow periods. For three years in a row, the wedge of heavy salt water has crept up the river underneath the fresh water, imperiling drinking water in the greater New Orleans area.\nThe goal is to find management approaches that can help build up this region, which Allison has called one of the most threatened places in the nation, if not on Earth.\nBut they cannot forge management solutions without an understanding of how the muddy Mississippi carries its load of sandy sediment in the lower delta. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t know very much about where the sediment is in the Lower Mississippi River,\u201d Kemick said. Further research will help determine where the coarse sand is settling in the riverbed.\nSediment loss is especially high during low or average river flow, when the water is traveling slowly enough to allow the heavy sand particles to sink to the bottom. When the river floods, the faster-moving river brings sand from throughout the drainage basin to Louisiana. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily help to build up the Bird\u2019s Foot area. Instead, it falls out in the channel, creating a need for more dredging to maintain the ship route.\nThe Mississippi River\u2019s sediment is an important resource for coastal restoration, Allison said. \u201cSand is white gold for Louisiana. We need to keep it.\u201d\nThe Louisiana Coastal Master Plan was built upon this principle, with an ambitious plan for a sediment diversion, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, that would be one of the largest environmental infrastructure projects in the history of the U.S.\nBut the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has suspended the permit to build the keystone project.\nMore than 50 Louisiana business and civic leaders sent a letter May 21 to Gov. Jeff Landry urging him to resume construction of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion at the size and scale that it was designed and permitted for.\n\u201cThese business and civic leaders are part of the backbone of Louisiana\u2014people who live, work, and invest in this region every day,\u201d said Simone Maloz, campaign director for Restore the Mississippi River Delta. \u201cDelaying or downsizing the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion threatens not just our coast, but our economy, our safety and our credibility as a state.\u201d\nConversations about the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion were absent from this year\u2019s State of the Coast conference, an interdisciplinary forum hosted by the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana.\n\u201cIn some ways, I feel like Mid-Barataria is kind of haunting this conference,\u201d said Alisha Renfro, a coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation. She is hopeful that Louisiana can find a pathway to resume the project, after investing $500 million into planning.\nThe state is also in danger of losing billions in federal funding if its leaders don\u2019t commit to finishing the construction.\nIt may be time to look for alternative coastal restoration projects, some scientists say. For Allison, that means not only determining how the Mississippi River sediment moves now but also where dredged sand could best restore coastal wetlands like the Barataria Basin.\nCurrently, dredge spoil used for coastal restoration remains relatively close to where it came from in the river. In the Barataria Basin, one project to restore approximately 302 acres of brackish marsh known as Bayou Grande Cheniere required nearly eight miles of pipes to move the sediment.\nOther solutions might involve closing gaps where sediment leaks out before reaching the Bird\u2019s Foot Delta. The Army Corps is essentially testing this theory now, Allison said, with its plan to reduce the flow at Neptune Pass, a nearby branch in the river that is creating new land in Quarantine Bay.\nThe plan could boost land-building in the Barataria Basin, Allison said. While the Army Corps proposes using rocks to limit the size of the channel\u2019s entrance and minimize the risk of navigational hazards, the construction at the outflow could reinforce the crevasse\u2019s land-building power, he said.\nIn addition to building sediment retention structures, the Army Corps could pump sand out of the river and place it directly at the outflow of the channel, allowing the water to redistribute it into a more natural wetland building pattern.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really encouraging that the Corps is thinking about these forward-looking strategies to better use dredged material,\u201d Allison said.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis story is a product of the Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk, an independent reporting network based at the University of Missouri in partnership with Report for America, with major funding from the Walton Family Foundation.",

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)\nA proposal to end the addition of fluoride from public drinking water in Louisiana failed Wednesday in the legislature following passionate testimony from health care and dental professionals.\nSenate Bill 2 by Sen. Michael \u201cBig Mike\u201d Fesi, R-Houma, would have required localities that want fluoride added to their water to have their residents petition for an election and vote on the issue. It failed in the House Committee on Health and Welfare in a 10-5 vote.\nLouisiana law currently mandates the addition of fluoride to drinking water systems with 5,000 or more service connections.\n\u201cWater fluoridation is a safe, effective and equitable public health intervention that has been proven for over eight decades to reduce dental decay significantly,\u201d Dr. Kimberly Smith-Bibbins, chief dental officer for SWLA Center for Health Services, said during committee testimony.\n\u201cWe can replace our teeth,\u201d Fesi said in a text message after the bill was voted down, sharing his doubts about the ability for utilities to regulate the amount of fluoride people consume. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can replace our thyroid or pineal gland.\u201d\nThere is not any firmly documented link between consuming fluoride and thyroid or endocrine issues, with many of the focused studies into it laced with methodology and bias concerns.\nFluoridated water systems serve about 38% of Louisianans, compared with a national rate of about 75%, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.\nSmith-Bibbins said Louisiana, in particular, benefits from public water fluorination, especially \u201cwhere many communities face barriers to accessing regular dental care.\u201d\n\u201cIt has served our children very, very well without negative consequences to our adults,\u201d Rep.

Removing fluoride requirements could cause a \u201ccataclysmic problem\u201d in public health outcomes for Louisiana, he said.\nLouisiana Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham spoke in support of Fesi\u2019s bill in committee, citing claims that overfluorination can lower children\u2019s IQs. The validity of studies that have come to this conclusion has been called into question, with critics citing inadequate data and only loose connections between fluoride dosing and lower IQ scores.\nAbraham argued that communities could opt in to fluoridation, to which Stagni responded that the option currently exists in state law for locals to remove it through a vote.\n\u201cIf people want out, the people have a mechanism right now to take fluoride out of their water,\u201d Stagni said.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is arguing that a Maryland federal court lacks the authority to require the return of wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia because he\u2019s in prison in El Salvador \u2014 even though the U.S. Supreme Court has directed administration officials to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return.\nIn addition, the judge in the highly publicized case has denied the Department of Justice\u2019s request for another 30 days to extend its time to submit briefs. Abrego Garcia has remained in prison since March.\nDOJ lawyers said in a brief filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, in Greenbelt, that because the administration has not brought back Abrego Garcia, the court cannot act on his case. \u201cThis Court lacks jurisdiction because Abrego Garcia is not in United States custody, his injury is not redressable by this Court\u2026,\u201d according to the DOJ brief.\nIt\u2019s the same argument DOJ attorneys made before another federal judge in the District of Columbia. That judge is deciding whether hundreds of men deported to El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law \u2014 the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 \u2014 are in U.S. custody, rather than El Salvador\u2019s custody, and therefore can be required to be returned.\nThe United States is paying the Salvadoran government up to $15 million to detain the men at a brutal mega-prison, CECOT.\nAbrego Garcia was among the nearly 300 men on the deportation flights to CECOT, but was not removed under the Alien Enemies Act. The Trump administration has admitted his removal to El Salvador was an \u201cadministrative error,\u201d because Abrego Garcia has had deportation protections from El Salvador since 2019 due to concerns he would face violence if returned to his home country.\nNeed for additional time \u2018rings hollow,\u2019 judge says\nThe DOJ motion to dismiss the case being heard by District Court Judge Paula Xinis came after Xinis on Monday denied the Trump administration\u2019s request for additional time.\nIn that request, the Department of Justice asked for 30 days to submit documents as part of an expedited briefing schedule to determine actions the government has taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return.\n\u201cThe Court ordered expedited discovery because of Defendants\u2019 refusal to follow the orders of this Court as affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the United States Supreme Court,\u201d she wrote in her order denying the request for more time.\n\u201cThe Court has conducted no fewer than five hearings in this case and at no point had Defendants even intimated they needed more time to answer or otherwise respond,\u201d she continued. \u201cThus, to say now that additional time is needed to do that which the law requires rings hollow.\u201d\nIn the DOJ brief, the Trump administration argues that even though the Supreme Court in April ruled that the government must \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s return, the high court did not rule on the issue of the lower court having jurisdiction over the case.\n\u201cThose decisions do not \u2018squarely address\u2019 these jurisdictional issues and therefore are not binding as to whether Abrego Garcia\u2019s claims are proper, his injury is redressable by this Court,\u201d according to the DOJ filing.\nThe Trump administration also argues that the suit Abrego Garcia\u2019s family and attorneys must bring is a habeas corpus claim, which allows people in the U.S. who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court. It can be used to challenge immigration detention.\n\u201cBecause Plaintiffs seek Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from allegedly unlawful detention on the grounds that it was effected illegally, they make a core habeas claim and must bring it exclusively in habeas,\u201d according to the DOJ brief. \u201cBut there is no jurisdiction in habeas.\u201d\nTravels to El Salvador\nTwo Maryland Democratic members of Congress \u2013 Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Glenn Ivey \u2013 traveled to El Salvador to meet and advocate for Abrego Garcia\u2019s return.\nVan Hollen said that Abrego Garcia had been moved from CECOT to a lower-security prison. He added that Salvadoran officials told him that Abrego Garcia was being held because of the financial agreement between the United States and El Salvador.\nWhile Van Hollen was able to meet and speak with Abrego Garcia last month, Ivey was not.\nIvey returned from El Salvador last weekend, and said Salvadoran officials would not permit him to see Abrego Garcia, who is a resident of his congressional district.\nAccording to Maryland Matters, Ivey said that Abrego Garica remaining in El Salvador despite the Supreme Court\u2019s April order is inching the U.S. toward a \u201cconstitutional crisis,\u201d because it seems like the Trump administration is \u201crefusing to comply with court orders. That\u2019s scary.\u201d\nAt the last hearing before Xinis, DOJ attorney Jonathan D. Guynn said the Trump administration was complying with all court orders and defended statements from Trump officials, including President Donald Trump, who have stated Abrego Garcia would not return to the U.S.\nGuynn said that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u2019s comment that Abrego Garcia \u201cwill not return\u201d to the U.S. meant that if Abrego Garcia was back in U.S. custody he would be removed either to another third country or back again to El Salvador.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll never walk free in the United States,\u201d Guynn said.\nLast updated 7:02 p.m., May. 28, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "13:40\nNews Story\nLouisiana lawmakers reject redistricting plan with more majority Black districts\nThe Louisiana Capitol Building, April 8, 2021. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator).\nA Louisiana legislative committee has killed two bills that would have added eight new majority Black districts to the state House and Senate.\nThe author of the proposals, Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, argued the maps are necessary because a federal judge has ruled the current state legislative maps, adopted in 2022, violate the federal Voting Rights Act. Attorney General Liz Murrill has appealed that decision on the state\u2019s behalf, and the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has yet to issue a decision.\nHouse Bill 487, which redistricts the Senate, was killed on a party-line 9-6 vote with Republicans prevailing. House Bill 488, the new House of Representative district map, fell in a 9-5 vote, again along party lines. The votes mean Louisiana will not update its legislative maps in the current legislative session, though they have the opportunity to do so in a future session.\n\u201cBy us not upholding our obligation and redrawing these maps \u2026 I think it sends a signal that we are unwilling to do so,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cRather than wait on the court to come up with a decision, I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us to get ahead of that and maybe draw these maps and show the court that we\u2019re willing to comply with Section 2\u201d of the Voting Rights Act.\nThe section Jordan cited prohibits voter discrimination based on a person\u2019s race, color or membership in a language minority group. Republicans have argued Section 2 is outdated, as it has served its purpose to dismantle Jim Crow-era laws.\nAlthough a third of Louisianians are Black, less than a third of state legislative districts have majority Black populations. The redistricting plan adopted in 2022 maintained the same number of majority Black districts from the previous redistricting cycle, based on 2010 Census demographics, even though the percentage of the state\u2019s Black population has increased in the interim.\nRepublicans on the committee repeatedly pointed out that the case is still on appeal and indicated they were optimistic courts may rule in the state\u2019s favor.\nLawmakers also expressed concern that Jordan\u2019s plan put upwards of 20 incumbent lawmakers outside of their existing district, meaning they would either have to move to maintain residency in their current districts or run against another incumbent to return to the legislature.\nJordan said that while he considered incumbency, his primary concern was giving Black voters an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is attempt to unpack and uncrack these districts so that they would comply with Section 2,\u201d Jordan said\nPacking is a type of gerrymandering that forces a large number of voters from one group into a single or small number of districts to weaken their power in other districts. Cracking dilutes the power of those voters into many districts.\nJordan\u2019s plan would have added new majority Black House districts in Natchitoches, Lake Charles, Shreveport and Baton Rouge, and Black Senate districts in Baton Rouge, Shreveport and Jefferson Parish.\nRepublican lawmakers expect the 5th Circuit to wait to release an opinion on the legislative maps until after the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on Louisiana\u2019s current congressional district boundaries, as the decision might create new precedent.\nIn the congressional redistricting case, non-Black voters are suing the state over a map lawmakers passed last year that created a second majority Black district, arguing it violated their constitutional rights. The Supreme Court decision is expected later next month.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two top Democratic lawmakers are calling on the Trump administration to detail exactly how it\u2019s spending money that Congress approved earlier this year for government operations.\nHouse Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray of Washington released a two-page letter Wednesday demanding the White House budget office share that information this week.\nThe detailed plans were due to Congress by April 29, but several departments and agencies haven\u2019t submitted the information to lawmakers, or have sent up incomplete documents, they wrote.\n\u201cThe widespread failure of departments and agencies to abide by the requirements of section 1113 is unacceptable, and the lack of transparency begs serious questions about what exactly this administration is seeking to hide from the Committees \u2014 and the American people,\u201d DeLauro and Murray wrote to the budget director, Russ Vought.\n\u201cThese spending plans are essential to understand how the executive branch is spending taxpayer dollars appropriated by Congress in fiscal year 2025, and they directly inform the legislative responsibilities of the Committees to consider fiscal year 2026 appropriations legislation, a process that is already underway,\u201d the two lawmakers added.\nRepeated requests for information\nThe lack of detailed information about how exactly the Trump administration is spending funding approved by Congress has come up during several Appropriations Committee hearings during the last month.\nConcerns from lawmakers, however, have not led to a change in heart as of this week\u2019s letter. The Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCongress was unable to broker agreement on the dozen annual spending bills for the current fiscal year, which began on Oct 1. Instead, lawmakers passed a series of stopgap spending bills that essentially held funding levels flat and kept the prior year\u2019s policies mostly in place.\nThe third stopgap spending bill, which lawmakers passed in March, required the Trump administration to tell Congress how it planned to spend those resources. The requirement is intended to assist lawmakers with their oversight responsibility and to help them shape the next fiscal year\u2019s dozen appropriations bills.\n\u201cAs the House and Senate Appropriations Committees intend to mark up the fiscal year 2026 bills next month, we demand that by the end of this month you comply with section 1113 and ensure that all spending plans contain sufficient information to demonstrate how each department and agency intends to prudently obligate all amounts provided by Congress for fiscal year 2025 within their period of availability and resubmit them to the Committees,\u201d DeLauro and Murray wrote.\nWebsite pulled down\nThe Trump administration did publicly post budget documents earlier this year that detailed how quickly departments and agencies planned to spend the money appropriated by Congress, known as apportionments.\nVought had that website pulled down in late March, leading to lawsuits from government watchdog groups.\nThe judge in those cases heard arguments earlier this month, but has yet to issue a ruling about whether the Trump administration violated the law by removing that information.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Seksan Mongkhonkhamsao/Getty Images)\nThe Louisiana House of Representatives approved a bill Tuesday that would require insurance companies to let homeowners purchase \u201cstated value\u201d policies, which cover the home for an amount they declare rather than for its full market value.\nHouse Bill 356, sponsored by Rep. Jacob Braud, R-Belle Chasse, cleared the chamber in a 79-20 vote and will head to the Senate for consideration.\nBraud said his proposal would allow people who do not have a mortgage to purchase a more affordable homeowner\u2019s policy. Some homeowners prefer to take on the added risk of having to come out of pocket for damages if it allows them to pay less in homeowner insurance premiums now, he added.\n\u201cThe premium costs have just been through the roof,\u201d Braud said, citing what many of his constituents have said about their policies.\nHe and several of his colleagues championed the bill as a pro-consumer measure.\nRep. Tim Kerner, R-Lafitte, said Braud\u2019s legislation might be the only one this year that actually helps homeowners with affordability.\n\u201cThe downside is that if something happens to their home during a hurricane, they\u2019re not gonna be able to replace it if it goes down,\u201d Kerner told Braud on the House floor. \u201cWell, let me tell you something, I know people losing their houses now.\u201d\nRep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, opposed the bill\u2019s mandate that all residential property insurers in the state create such policies upon request. Firment, who chairs the House Committee on Insurance, has spearheaded many of the tort reform bills this session in an effort to reduce premiums.\n\u201cIf we mandate every insurance company in the state to provide this product, I think people in South Louisiana will use it,\u201d Firment said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be sold a bill of goods without understanding because they\u2019re desperate.\u201d\nFirment said he believes the proposal would shift insurance costs to other parts of the state and lead to an increase in blighted property from people abandoning their damaged homes after storms.\nThis legislative session, lawmakers have largely addressed Louisiana\u2019s insurance crisis on the auto coverage front, passing a package of so-called \u201ctort reform\u201d bills that give insurance companies certain protections or advantages in litigation, making it harder for accident victims to file successful lawsuits.\nBraud\u2019s bill is one of the few proposals that addresses the other component of the crisis: the skyrocketing cost of homeowner insurance that has mostly affected South Louisiana. The only way to truly address the crisis was to make the provisions of his bill mandatory, he said.\n\u201cIt was clear to me that the insurers did not care to make this product,\u201d Braud said, adding that he believes it would mostly be purchased in extreme cases.\nInsurers would only have to offer a stated value policy at a homeowner\u2019s request, rather than make it a default level of coverage.\nThe proposal moves next to the Senate for consideration.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Allison Allsop / Louisiana Illuminator)\nThe Louisiana Legislature has unanimously approved a bill that grants a wish list of retirement reforms state higher education employees put forward, though it lacks one enticement faculty and staff consider critical to keeping them on campus.\nHouse Bill 24 by Rep. Tony Bacala, R-Prairieville, passed the Senate on a 36-0 vote and had previously cleared the House on a 97-0 vote. It next goes to Gov. Jeff Landry for his approval.\nBacala\u2019s bill expands eligibility for the Teachers Retirement System of Louisiana (TRSL) to include faculty at the state\u2019s community and technical colleges. It also extends the period when employees can switch from a \u201cportable\u201d retirement plan to the fixed, pension style plan offered to most state employees.\nQualifying campus faculty and employees will have seven years, instead of the current five years to choose between the two plans, aligning it with the typical timeline it takes for professors to earn tenure.\nBacala\u2019s bill incorporates most of the recommendations from a Board of Regents task force he helped form.\nAn increase in employer contributions to TRSL retirement plans was among the most anticipated portions of Bacala\u2019s bill that higher education employees had sought. In its original state, it would have increased the minimum employer contribution to portable plan accounts from 6.2% to 8% of employee pay.\nThe contribution bump was removed from the bill because it would have increased state spending more than $11 million annually, and the legislature is trying not to add to state spending amid uncertain fiscal times.\nBacala said he would try to address this provision in future legislation.\nLast year, lawmakers gave certain higher education employees a limited window to switch from the portable plan to defined benefits. According to the Board of Regents, 795 applied for the change as of the end of 2024.\nNearly 7,000 college and university faculty and staff members are enrolled in the state\u2019s \u201cportable\u201d or optional retirement plan that allows them to take their accrued benefits with them if they choose to leave the state for another job.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Kennedy Jr. changed the federal government\u2019s recommendation for the coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday, saying healthy children and healthy pregnant people no longer need to get it.\nKennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic who had to broker several deals with Republican senators to secure confirmation, didn\u2019t explain why he was making the change in a brief video.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased to announce that as of today the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cLast year the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another COVID shot despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children.\u201d\nNational Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Martin A. Makary both spoke briefly during the social media video to say they supported the decision. But neither pointed to new studies regarding COVID-19 boosters or any evidence of safety issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s common sense and it\u2019s good science,\u201d Bhattacharya said.\nKennedy made several promises to Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy \u2014 chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 in order to secure Cassidy\u2019s vote so that Kennedy could be confirmed as HHS secretary.\nAmong those was that Kennedy would \u201cmaintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee on immunization practices recommendations without changes.\u201d\nCassidy\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\u2018Extremely disappointed\u2019\nPublic health organizations raised concerns about the change in policy.\nDr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the organization was \u201cconcerned about and extremely disappointed by the announcement that HHS will no longer recommend COVID vaccination during pregnancy.\u201d\n\u201cAs ob-gyns who treat patients every day, we have seen firsthand how dangerous COVID infection can be during pregnancy and for newborns who depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection,\u201d Fleischman wrote. \u201cWe also understand that despite the change in recommendations from HHS, the science has not changed.\n\u201cIt is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families. The COVID vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants.\u201d\nDr. Sean O\u2019Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, wrote in a statement HHS\u2019 \u201cdecision bypasses a long-established, evidence-based process used to ensure vaccine safety and ignores the expertise of independent medical experts, including members of CDC committees who are examining the evidence regarding the vaccine to make recommendations for the fall.\u201d\n\u201cBy removing the recommendation, the decision could strip families of choice,\u201d O\u2019Leary wrote. \u201cThose who want to vaccinate may no longer be able to, as the implications for insurance coverage remain unclear. It\u2019s also unclear whether health care workers would be eligible to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is clear is that pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated.\u201d\nFormer surgeon general under Trump critical\nDr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general during Trump\u2019s first administration, wrote in a detailed social media post that Kennedy\u2019s announcement \u201craises significant concerns, as it overlooks both available evidence, and the complexities of public health.\u201d\n\u201cShifting from vaccine mandates to outright prohibitions does not reflect medical freedom; it represents a different form of government intervention, one that restricts individual choice and access to evidence-based care,\u201d Adams wrote. \u201cA balanced approach would prioritize informed decision-making, ensuring that vaccines remain available to those who need them while respecting personal autonomy.\n\u201cHoping as this policy change is implemented, anyone who is truly high risk can still easily get a vaccine, and that we don\u2019t let politics trump science, health, and previous proclamations about \u2018personal choice.\u2019\u201d\nAmerican Public Health Association Executive Director Dr. Georges C Benjamin wrote in a statement that \u201c(v)accines offer the best protection from severe symptoms and death associated with the COVID-19 virus for all populations.\n\u201cThis decision by Secretary Kennedy puts kids, pregnant moms and their babies at risk of unnecessary suffering that is preventable. Lots of questions remain as to how HHS leadership plans to implement this poorly thought out announcement that is not supported by the scientific evidence and our national experience.\u201d\nAn HHS press secretary wrote in an email to States Newsroom that \u201cas part of the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to common sense, the COVID-19 vaccine will be removed from the CDC\u2019s recommended immunization schedule.\u201d\n\u201cWith the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, it is time to move forward,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. \u201cHHS and the CDC remain committed to gold standard science and to ensuring the health and well-being of all Americans\u2014especially our nation\u2019s children\u2014using common sense.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Heather Cloud, R-Turkey Creek, seeks to implement a series of data-driven checks and technological tools to ensure that only eligible residents receive Medicaid benefits.\nThe bill requires the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) to conduct regular cross-checks with state and federal agencies, including the Department of Revenue and Social Security Administration. LDH must also review death records monthly, verify incarceration status quarterly and independently determine eligibility.\nIt also limits automatic (ex parte) renewals unless required by federal law, with a phase-out of current waivers by January 2026.\nThe bill is part of a broader effort to curb waste and fraud in the program, which provides health coverage to more than 1.8 million low-income Louisianans. But critics of the bill warn that the proposed changes could create administrative hurdles for eligible individuals and lead to disenrollment of vulnerable residents due to paperwork errors or data discrepancies.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\u201cWe know that any time that there is any additional step for verification, it\u2019s an opportunity for someone to lose coverage,\u201d said Courtney Foster, senior policy advisor for Medicaid at Invest in Louisiana, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \u201cA lot of what this bill says will be savings is for people getting kicked off of Medicaid.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all of those people that are getting kicked off are ineligible, Foster said. It could just mean that they didn\u2019t respond to official correspondence. Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, brought up these concerns on the senate floor.\n\u201cIf for whatever reason I don\u2019t answer the first time, or I think it\u2019s junk mail, it gets thrown out,\u201d Boudreaux said. \u201cHow do we have comfort knowing that on the certification process, that we\u2019re going to go above and beyond before we drop people off of the Medicaid rolls?\u201d\nCloud responded saying the bill doesn\u2019t change the current process for removing people from Medicaid if they don\u2019t meet eligibility requirements.\nThe removal process, as she explained it, starts when LDH identifies a possible issue with a person\u2019s Medicaid eligibility \u2014 such as needing to verify income or address \u2014 they begin by sending a letter requesting more information. This initial letter follows federal guidelines and allows five days for delivery.\nAfter that, LDH gives the person an additional 15 days to respond. During this combined 20-day window, the department also tries to contact them through other means, including phone calls, emails and text messages, to make sure they know what\u2019s needed to keep their coverage.\nIf there\u2019s still no response after 20 days, LDH sends an official \u201cadvance notice of termination\u201d letting the person know their Medicaid coverage will end. This notice must be sent at least 15 days before the termination takes effect. Because Medicaid coverage usually ends at the end of a month, this timing can sometimes give people a bit of extra time \u2014 potentially another full month of coverage \u2014 before they\u2019re removed from the rolls.\nCloud added that even after someone is dropped from Medicaid, they have another 90 days to provide the needed information and get their coverage reinstated retroactively.\n\u201cSo theoretically, they have up to 125 days after the first [letter] was sent out to get their coverage reinstated if they are terminated,\u201d Cloud said. \u201cIt would be as if they\u2019d never lost coverage. So that gave me a lot of comfort.\u201d\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThe fiscal note says reducing enrollment of ineligible recipients could save $74.9 million by 2026 and $941.5 million over five years, including state and federal dollars. The methodology for this savings includes the state assuming a majority of applicants won\u2019t respond to requests for more information, and only a fraction will attempt to re-enroll.\nFoster said most of the savings would come from procedural denials, not necessarily policy improvements. And the cost-savings associated with the bill are \u201cquestionable,\u201d she said, because most of the time, when someone loses Medicaid coverage, they don\u2019t realize it until the next time they go to the doctor or emergency room. That could mean people who are disenrolled from Medicaid for procedural reasons, but do qualify for coverage, may simply get back on Medicaid.\n\u201cA lot of people who will be kicked off are likely eligible and may roll back on within a couple of months,\u201d Foster said.\nImplementing the bill would also cost money, including operating expenses of $139,297 for printing and postage, $4.5 million for professional services, like system modifications and subscription services, and $104,050 for equipment, like computers and phones.\nIt also calls for creating 50 new positions with salaries and benefits, which Foster said adds additional layers of bureaucracy dedicated to \u201ckicking people off of Medicaid.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also important to remember, Foster said, that Medicaid beneficiaries are not the ones getting paid. The program gives low-income people access to consistent health care coverage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s people that are showing up to the doctor and then maybe the doctor should be getting paid from one source versus another,\u201d Foster said. \u201cBut the patient themselves is just going to the doctor.\u201d\nIf signed into law, the bill would go into effect Jan. 1, 2026.\nThis report was produced by the Gulf States Newsroom, a collaboration between Mississippi Public Broadcasting, WBHM in Alabama, WWNO and WRKF in Louisiana and NPR.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A collection of National Public Radio stations sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, seeking to block an executive order that would cut off their federal funding.\nThe 43-page filing says the order that President Donald Trump signed earlier this month \u201cviolates the expressed will of Congress and the First Amendment\u2019s bedrock guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association, and also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.\u201d\nThe executive order called on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives its funding from Congress, to cease sending money to the Public Broadcasting Service and NPR.\nThe order stated that government funding for public media \u201cis not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.\u201d\nThe Trump administration also appeared to take issue with the types of news stories that PBS and NPR report, arguing \u201cthat neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.\u201d\n\u2018Viewpoint-based discrimination\u2019\nThe lawsuit says the executive order has an \u201covert retaliatory purpose\u201d and \u201cis unlawful in multiple ways.\u201d\n\u201cThe Order is textbook retaliation and viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment, and it interferes with NPR\u2019s and the Local Member Stations\u2019 freedom of expressive association and editorial discretion,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cLastly, by seeking to deny NPR critical funding with no notice or meaningful process, the Order violates the Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause.\u201d\nThe lawsuit was filed by NPR along with three Colorado stations \u2014 Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio and KSUT Public Radio \u2014 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case has been assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss, who was nominated by then-President Barack Obama.\nWhite House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields wrote in a statement that the \u201cCorporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers\u2019 dime.\n\u201cTherefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS. The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.\u201d\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is funded by Congress and in turn provides grants to more than 1,500 public radio and television stations throughout the United States, was established as a private \u201cnonprofit corporation\u201d and is not \u201can agency or establishment of the United States Government,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\nPower of the purse\nCongress has consistently approved funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting on a bipartisan basis, including its current $535 million appropriation.\nThe lawsuit contends that the \u201closs of all direct funding from CPB and the loss (or significant decline) of revenue from local stations would be catastrophic for NPR.\u201d\nIt also states the president \u201chas no authority under the Constitution to\u201d interfere in funding decisions made by lawmakers.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary, the power of the purse is reserved to Congress, and the President has no inherent authority to override Congress\u2019s will on domestic spending decisions,\u201d the lawsuits says. \u201cBy unilaterally imposing restrictions and conditions on funds in contravention of Congress, the Order violates the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause of the Constitution.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "5:00\nNews Story\nUncertainty swirls around FEMA, NOAA ahead of \u2018above-normal\u2019 hurricane season\nTiffany Guidry stands outside the sno-ball stand she owns in LaPlace following Hurricane Ida in August 2021. (Julie O\u2019Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)\nThis article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.\nForecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect above-average hurricane activity this season.\nThe federal agency, in its annual outlook released Thursday, predicted 13 to 19 named storms, including six to 10 hurricanes. Of those, it expects three to five major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 strength, packing winds of 111 mph or greater.\nThe agency said there was a 60% chance of an above-normal season, a 30% chance of a near-normal season and a 10% chance of a below-normal season. The forecast represents an estimate of activity, not number of landfalls.\nThe average season features 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes, according to NOAA. The season begins Sunday, June 1, and ends Nov. 30.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready here at NOAA,\u201d said Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, during a news briefing held in Gretna, to mark 20 years since Hurricane Katrina. \u201cAre you?\u201d\nNOAA based its forecast on a confluence of factors, including warmer than average ocean temperatures, potentially weak wind shear and the possibility of higher activity from the West African Monsoon, a primary starting point for Atlantic hurricanes. Warmer oceans fuel storms with more energy, while weaker winds allow them to develop without disruption.\nForecasters at Colorado State University also anticipate an above-average season, with 17 named storms \u2014 including nine hurricanes, four of them major. The forecasters predicted activity would be about 125% of that during an average season between 1991 and 2020.\nBy comparison, activity in 2024 was about 130% of an average season\u2019s during that time. The 2024 season will be best-remembered for hurricanes Helene and Milton, which together caused more than 250 fatalities and $120 billion in damage across the Southeast.\nThe Colorado State University forecasters said this season there is a 51% chance of a major hurricane striking the U.S., with a 26% chance of one of the storms making landfall along the East Coast and 33% chance along the Gulf Coast. They predict a 56% chance of a major hurricane tracking through the Caribbean.\nThe season arrives amid widespread uncertainty over the role the federal government will play in disaster response and recovery, as the Trump administration fires employees, freezes funding and dismantles agencies. NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are among the targets.\n\u201cUncertainty is not great,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University\u2019s Department of Atmospheric Science. \u201cIt just adds another layer of stress. That isn\u2019t great when people are trying to prepare for hurricane season.\u201d\nAs much as 30 percent of the workforce at NOAA\u2019s National Weather Service has been eliminated, said Rick Spinrad, a former NOAA administrator under the Biden administration. He worried NOAA may struggle to maintain its Hurricane Hunter flights, which he said account for a 15 percent improvement in track and intensity forecasting.\n\u201cIf you lose that capacity to predict the track, you could either unnecessarily evacuate tens or hundreds of thousands of people, or evacuate the wrong people or not evacuate people who should be evacuated,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are putting lives and property in significant danger with the degradation of the forecast capability.\u201d\nNo changes to the flights have been proposed, said Michael \u201cMac\u201d McAlister, who has flown with the Hurricane Hunters for 10 years. This will be the 50th season for one of the two aircraft involved in the program, a WP-3D Orion named Kermit. The other plane is called Miss Piggy.\n\u201cThere are hardly any 50-year-old pieces of this aircraft left,\u201d McAlister said, referring to Kermit. \u201cThe wings get chopped off every five years. In my opinion these are two of the greatest national assets because of the data they provide.\u201d\nNo one from the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service, attended this year\u2019s National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans, said Craig Fugate, a former FEMA administrator under the Obama administration and former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\nNormally the National Hurricane Center would brief state and local emergency managers at the conference on new forecasting methods, to help the managers improve communications with the public about, say, when evacuations are necessary. The training is important because there can be high turnover among emergency managers, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m just not aware of any other time that the hurricane center staff wasn\u2019t at that conference,\u201d Fugate said.\nNOAA declined to comment on the conference but said Thursday its forecasts would be no less accurate. For instance, the federal agency said the model used to predict hurricanes would undergo an upgrade that would improve track and intensity forecasts by as much as 5 percent.\n\u201cWe are fully staffed at the Hurricane Center, and we are definitely ready to go,\u201d said Laura Grimm, acting NOAA administrator. \u201cWe are really making this a top priority for the administration.\u201d\nKim Doster, the agency\u2019s communications director, added in a statement, \u201cin the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.\u201d\nMeanwhile, FEMA is in turmoil, with President Donald Trump suggesting he might eliminate the federal agency. Cameron Hamilton, acting head of FEMA, was ousted earlier this month after testifying before a congressional subcommittee that elimination would not be \u201cin the best interest of the American people.\u201d His dismissal coincided with National Hurricane Preparedness Week, declared by Trump in a proclamation in which the president said he remained \u201csteadfastly committed to supporting hurricane recovery efforts and ensuring that Federal resources and tax dollars are allocated to American citizens in need.\u201d\nBut during Trump\u2019s first week in office he appointed a task force to review FEMA\u2019s ability to respond to disasters. And in March he signed an executive order asserting that federal policy must \u201crecognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels.\u201d The order called on state and local governments and individuals to \u201cplay a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness.\u201d\nIn April the administration denied a request for assistance from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, after tornadoes ripped through several counties there. The administration approved the request in May.\nNonetheless, FEMA told Inside Climate News in a statement, before Hamilton was fired, that its response to disasters would not be diminished.\n\u201cUnlike the previous administration\u2019s unprepared, disgraceful and inadequate response to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans affected by emergencies will get the help they need in a quick and efficient manner,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cAll operational and readiness requirements will continue to be managed without interruption in close coordination with local and state officials ahead of the 2025 Hurricane Season. Emergency management is best when led by local and state authorities.\u201d\nIn Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis welcomed the prospect of more state leadership in disaster response. During an April event in Kissimmee he said he believed the Trump administration would send block-grant funding to states, which could manage the calamities more efficiently.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be left in the cold. But I can tell you that the FEMA bureaucracy is an impediment to disaster recovery,\u201d said DeSantis, who ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary. \u201cWe\u2019re nimble. We\u2019re quick. We adjust. So empower the states. Give us the resources, and we don\u2019t necessarily need the federal government to be involved at all.\u201d\nBut state and local governments already lead the response to disasters, Fugate notes. Governors request federal help only when the scope of the crisis exceeds the state\u2019s capabilities, with the federal government providing little more than funding.\nHe said it was too soon to guess how all of the developments may affect hurricane season.\nEven more cuts could be coming\nTrump\u2019s budget request, released earlier this month, would slash more than $1.3 billion from NOAA and $646 million from FEMA. Congress must approve the proposal.\nAn earlier leaked draft, obtained by Inside Climate News, would abolish NOAA\u2019s research office, called Oceanic and Atmospheric Research or NOAA Research. The office is charged with providing unbiased science to, among other things, improve forecasts and enhance warnings ahead of disasters. The draft included $171 million for the office, down from $485 million in 2024. The few programs that remain, including research into severe storms, would be moved primarily to the National Weather Service and National Ocean Service.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s 2026 budget passback, as the draft was called, included \u201csignificant reductions to education, grants, research, and climate-related programs within NOAA,\u201d according to the document. \u201cPassback levels support a leaner NOAA that focuses on core operational needs, eliminates unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, terminates nonessential grant programs and ends activities that do not warrant a Federal role.\u201d\nProject 2025, the conservative strategy for remaking the federal government, calls for NOAA to be taken apart, with many functions eliminated, privatized or moved to other agencies or state and local governments. The document suggests reforming FEMA to shift much of its spending on preparedness and response to state and local governments.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just providing as accurate information as we can,\u201d said Andy Hazelton, a National Weather Service scientist who was let go earlier this year. \u201cHopefully we can get back to that, but it\u2019s been a very, very tough environment for the last few months.\u201d\nIn central Florida, all of the uncertainty has left Alan Harris, the emergency manager in Seminole County, grappling with how to prepare for hurricane season. Seminole is a suburban county north of Orlando that is spliced through by the St. Johns River, Florida\u2019s longest. The county has experienced flooding during several recent hurricanes, including Ian in 2022 and Milton in 2024.\nThe agency depends on forecasts from the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center and assistance from FEMA after a storm has passed. It had applied for a grant for a new generator for a special needs shelter under the federal Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which Trump signed into law in 2020. But the Trump administration ended the program recently.\n\u201cWe at the local level are going to make sure that our residents are taken care of regardless of what happens at the federal or state level,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe will need help. We just don\u2019t know where that help is going to come from. But I have 100 percent confidence that there will be help whether it\u2019s through mutual aid agreements or it\u2019s from other states or our own state. We\u2019re going to make sure our residents are taken care of.\u201d\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Now, the majority of Americans say that moment has passed with its promise unfulfilled.\nIn a study published on May 7, the Pew Research Center found that in 2020, 52 percent of U.S. adults believed that an increased focus on racial issues across the country would lead to significant change in the years to come. In 2025, 72 percent of U.S. adults said that the focus on racial inequality did not lead to any changes that helped the Black community.\nFurthermore, in 2025, 67% of Black Americans said they felt doubtful the United States would ever achieve racial equality; 65% felt similarly in 2020.\nThe 19th spoke with Black activists about the country\u2019s progress toward equality since Floyd\u2019s death and how they envision a more inclusive future.\n\u2018You have to do things to actually show how you feel\u2019\nAlaunna Thompson was attending a predominantly White high school in Montville, N.J., when Floyd died. His murder was a call for her to organize a protest in her local community, she said, describing her ongoing struggles with racism in school as the driver that pushed her to use her voice.\nProtestors gathered at Mackay Park in Englewood, N.J., to demand justice after Floyd\u2019s death. Following a route that led them around the city, participants stopped to deliver passionate speeches and craft signs that they would carry while organizing. Parents, teachers, students and Englewood residents all came out to support.\n\u201cIt was a mix of us feeling some way about our school and on top of that, hearing all this stuff [about] Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd. It was back to back to back.\u201d\nArbery was a 25-year-old Black man who was shot and killed while on an afternoon jog in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Georgia. Arbery\u2019s death happened in February 2020, just months before Floyd\u2019s.\nThompson remembers feeling sadness, anger and disbelief. With the stunting pain also came the realization that this time, something felt different.\n\u201cI saw people talking about [Floyd\u2019s] drug charges and the things he did, and I was just, like, \u2018Wow, this is really sad,\u2019 and I felt angry about it. Honestly, I thought nothing would happen,\u201d she said. When Derek Chauvin got arrested and convicted in federal court of killing Floyd, \u201cthat was a shock to me,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat\u2019s never really happened before.\u201d\nIn Thompson\u2019s eyes, while Floyd\u2019s murder did not put an end to racially motivated violence, it did shift our social understanding of how we discuss police brutality. Up until the day of Floyd\u2019s death in 2020, she had never witnessed so much language that reflected how brutal police violence is.\n\u201cPeople are more comfortable holding these police officers accountable now. I think versus the Trayvon Martin period, people were [thinking] these are not people who are going to get prosecuted because they are above the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re also more comfortable saying that this person killed this person instead of it being police brutality. This is murder.\u201d\nAt just 17 years old, Martin was shot and killed while walking in Sanford, Florida. His killer, George Zimmerman, was the captain of Sanford\u2019s neighborhood watch and reported to police that he saw a \u201csuspicious person\u201d prior to shooting Martin. Zimmerman was later found not guilty in the trial.\nAlthough Thompson does not feel there has been effective systemic change in the five years since Floyd\u2019s life was taken, she does recognize the impact that he has had. Her place in history is what will continue to compel her to use her voice, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about history. It\u2019s not about two little kids from Englewood who may not make that much of a difference when it comes to the law, but it makes a difference when it comes to which side of history you were on.\u201d\n\u2018The possibility that lies ahead\u2019\nThroughout her life, Angela Ferrell-Zabala has looked to the strength of her mother and grandmother to inspire her activism. At a young age, her family instilled in her the belief that she has a voice and the power to advocate against injustice in the world. As she grew older, she followed their lead in the work she\u2019s done for her community.\nAs a mother of four living in Washington, D.C., she wanted to do something about gun violence in the city. So she joined Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention advocacy group. Three years ago, she became its first executive director.\nFerrell-Zabala felt that Floyd\u2019s murder was a continuation of violence against Black and Brown people that had become normalized. While she helped the people in her community, she had to remember to give herself grace to deal with the emotional turmoil she was also experiencing.\n\u201cIn the moment, you just want to make sure everyone\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to wrap your arms around them, but then there\u2019s this point about \u2018What do I need?\u2019\u201d\nFive years later, Ferrell-Zabala said that it\u2019s a hard moment for the country \u2014 and a hard moment for Black folks in particular. Decades of pain and trauma are continuing to impact the Black community, and many in the community feel like no one cares about the struggles they are facing.\nFor instance, Ferrell-Zabala said that Black people are disproportionately impacted when it comes to gun violence, and communities say that solutions aren\u2019t meeting their needs fast enough. With corporations and the federal government rolling back inclusive programs that civil rights leaders fought hard for, many people have lost hope.\n\u201cRight now, it feels particularly difficult because there\u2019s this sense of, \u2018No one cares, no one gives a damn,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think what makes it harder [is that] now, it\u2019s beyond not caring. It [feels] like intentional cruelty.\u201d\nFerrell-Zabala told The 19th that the country has a long way to go when it comes to creating true equality, equity and justice. She looks to her grandmother\u2019s resilience as a reminder to keep working toward a better future. To move forward, she said that the Black community has to think about where they are and balance it with their radical visions of what could be.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I hold onto,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope many people hold onto who we are, where we come from and the possibility that lies ahead.\u201d\n\u2018We\u2019re the only thing protecting each other\u2019\nDestine Riggins saved on her phone an album of pictures labeled Black Lives Matter March. She took these photos five years ago in West Jefferson, a town in the rural Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. She was the sole photographer there.\nRiggins used to look at the photos and see impact, unity and change. Now, when she looks at them, Riggins said she feels like \u201cthe whole world is against us again.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re in a worse scenario right now than we were five years ago. With the current administration we have, police brutality is easy for them to slip under the rug or even for a policeman to get off, especially with [President Donald] Trump wanting to pardon officers,\u201d Riggins said.\nFloyd\u2019s murder immediately made Riggins think of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland, a Black woman roughly handled and arrested by the police in Texas and then found dead in her cell a few days later by what the local police consider suicide. There was also Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed in her home by the police last summer.\nSince the march, Riggins has watched the national conversation around race and policing shift, making her feel tired, heavy and more unsure than ever.\n\u201cEach time we see these murders by the police it feels like another hit to the Black community. Another disappointment. Another reason to not like the cops. And another reason for a White man to be able to kill a Black man,\u201d Riggins said.\nMillions of people across the country have been protesting against the Trump administration through efforts like the Hands Off and 50501 movements. Many Black communities have decided on other forms of resistance and several people, like Riggins, are choosing to turn inward, by resting and leaning on their community for support.\n\u201cThere is no protection for Black people except us, we\u2019re the only thing protecting each other and right now that feels kind of disintegrating. My biggest opinion is to lay low right now,\u201d Riggins said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bring any extra attention to myself because I don\u2019t have time to try to fight a justice system that was never meant for me in the first place.\u201d\n\u2018Police brutality shouldn\u2019t just be personal to Black people\u2019\nWhile Riggins took pictures, Queue Wellington helped lead the march in West Jefferson, where more than 300 people protested in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nGrowing up Black in a rural, White, conservative and poor region, Wellington constantly saw how white supremacy and police brutality negatively impacted everyone.\n\u201cWhite people love to cling to power, but that power is white supremacy. As this country continues to lean overtly more into fascism and acceptance of police brutality, then that means Black people will keep dying, White people will keep dying and everyone will keep dying \u2014 largely by the hands of the police or people in power,\u201d Wellington said.\nAfter the summer of 2020, Wellington saw an increase in White people in their town attempting to unlearn anti-Black behavior, understand systemic issues and work in community with Black movements. Since then, they said those same people have faded away and that their actions were likely performative.\n\u201cThere was a wave of White people trying to become more conscious or get more informed on things, but where are they now?\u201d Wellington said. \u201cBlack people have always had to juggle it all at the same time: work, bills, lives and oppression.\u201d\nWhile Wellington feels that things aren\u2019t better for Black Americans since the summer of racial reckoning, they do believe that at least more White people are grasping the reality of police brutality.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t get a thousand White people to understand, maybe having one White person on board or seeing the reality of police brutality will change things or even create safer environments for Black folks,\u201d Wellington said.\nWellington thinks this understanding could even be found in places like the Appalachian Mountains, where Stuart Mast, a White man, died while in deputies\u2019 custody in a similar way to Floyd.\nSeveral community members are outraged by Mast\u2019s death, and people who once \u201cbacked the blue\u201d are now questioning the system that police brutality has created.\n\u201cThe fact that White people in my community are outraged over police violence feels oddly familiar. We should all be asking why folks are getting killed by the police. This murder has started to cause a divide between the police and White people here,\u201d Wellington said. \u201cPolice brutality shouldn\u2019t just be personal to Black people, but to everyone because it affects everyone.\u201d\n\u2018Our joy has to be non-negotiable\u2019\nIn 2020, Monica Simpson and her community felt caught in the middle of challenging moments: Trump was finishing his first term and the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak.\nAs the executive director of SisterSong, a reproductive rights group based in Atlanta, Simpson joined other members to create mutual aid opportunities for those in need and help pregnant women get access to birth workers.\nThen Floyd was murdered. When the news broke, Simpson was immediately reminded of the other Black men and boys who were murdered by White men, such as Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice \u2014 and the list keeps going, she said. But it felt like the world had to keep moving forward. Simpson had to continue doing the work for her community.\n\u201cWe were having to still hold our community in all the ways that we need to for the work that we do every single day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to be on the frontlines at the same time.\u201d\nAt that time, the country saw what the media called a racial reckoning and Simpson felt that it took away from the grief the Black community was feeling after Floyd\u2019s murder.\nIn 2025, with Trump back in power and making more changes to disenfranchise marginalized communities, Simpson feels that Black communities did as much as they could to restore what Trump\u2019s 2016 administration destroyed. Black-led advocacy organizations came together, despite their contradictory beliefs, to put forth the work necessary to help their communities and each other.\nOverall, Simpson said the Black community knew a second Trump presidency \u201cwould be detrimental.\u201d Ninety-two percent of Black women voted for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election and mobilized their communities. During his first five months in office, Trump has made strides to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion programs and positions in the federal government, and many corporations have followed suit.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in more danger now than we were before,\u201d Simpson told The 19th. \u201cWe\u2019re in the same position of our rights, our bodies, our communities being under attack.\u201d\nTo create a more inclusive future, Simpson said that the Black community must continue to work together across religions, political values and identities because \u201cdisrespectability politics \u2026 have kept us divided.\u201d The Black community has to come together to advocate for their needs, which includes educating each other, reclaiming their culture and embracing moments of joy.\n\u201cWe need all the Black joy as possible because our joy has to be non-negotiable at this time,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a powerful and necessary part of how we make it through.\u201d\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis story was originally reported by Alexis Wray, Eden Turner and Sabreen Dawud of The 19th.

He testified at the State House on May 9, 2025, against legislation that would relax the rules around these controversial practices. (Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)\nMaine students have been restrained and secluded more than 22,000 times a year in some years. But the real number of times educators put students in holds, move them against their will and shut them alone in small rooms is likely much higher.\nRestraint and seclusion are widely condemned practices that create lasting trauma for students, their families and the educators involved. That\u2019s why every use is supposed to be documented and reported to the state. But over the past decade, only 24 out of more than 250 private schools and public districts in Maine have consistently reported their numbers.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nMaine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education, however the department did not say whether there was any penalty for failing to report.\nMaine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education. However, according to Bear Shea, the department\u2019s restraint and seclusion specialist, Maine DOE \u201chas not been given statutory authority or mechanisms to enforce compliance.\u201d\nRather, the department seems to operate under the assumption that a district\u2019s lack of reporting means schools didn\u2019t restrain or seclude any students that year.\n\u201cIt is possible that if a school district does not have any incidents of restraint and seclusion in a school year, they will not report any data,\u201d said Chloe Teboe, the department spokesperson, when asked about the dozens of districts that aren\u2019t reporting every year, according to publicly available state data. \u201cThe Maine DOE can only act on the data that is shared by school districts, as required by statute.\u201d\nAtlee Reilly, managing attorney for the advocacy organization Disability Rights Maine, said it\u2019s \u201cbeyond unlikely\u201d that districts failing to report have not used restraint or seclusion.\nOverall, reporting to the DOE has fallen off in recent years, Reilly told lawmakers on May 9 during discussion of a proposed bill that aims to relax the rules on restraint and seclusion. Many of the state\u2019s largest districts and schools that historically reported frequent use of restraint and seclusion have stopped sharing their numbers in recent years, according to statewide data.\n\u201cI know that some schools that have historically reported high numbers of restraints haven\u2019t reported,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cSo does that mean that they, all of a sudden, are not restraining or secluding youth? I think probably not.\u201d\nAt least one school not reporting high use to state\nA closer look at the Bangor Regional Program, a school for students with disabilities, reveals how restraint and seclusion practices can go unreported for years.\nBangor Public Schools is responsible for reporting its own numbers, as well as the data for the Bangor Regional Program, which serves students from several area districts. The state database includes numbers from the regional program for one of the past 10 years, after a 2019 investigation found the school had been restraining and secluding students thousands of times each year from 2015 to 2018, more than almost any other school in the state.\nDuring the 2019-20 school year, the regional program used 261 restraints and 325 seclusions on 33 individual students. Internal data provided by Bangor schools to Maine Morning Star in response to a records request shows that in the following years, the program continued using these practices. In 2021-22, the school reported 419 total uses of restraint and seclusion. In 2022-23, use dropped to 187, and in 2023-24, increased to 281.\nNone of these incidents were reported to the state, according to publicly available state data.\nThough Bangor Public Schools reports its data every year, when asked why the regional program\u2019s numbers were not shared with the state, spokesperson Ray Phinney said he didn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t find out due to recent changes in district leadership.\n\u201cThe superintendent who oversaw the submission of this is no longer with us,\u201d he said.\nThe DOE did not respond directly to questions about this school\u2019s lack of reporting, but the spokesperson said the department \u201creports any data received from school districts and does not make a practice of not publishing it.\u201d\nBen Jones, director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, a Maine-based nonprofit that works with schools to reduce restraint and seclusion, said it\u2019s important for the department to explain what happens when schools like the regional program collect data but don\u2019t report it to the state.\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t have a true sense of the scope of using these dangerous practices, so this, to me, points the spotlight back at reporting and collecting,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what more is DOE doing to ensure the completeness of the data, the completeness of this picture?\u201d\nFew districts regularly report data\nThis underreporting casts doubt on the apparent progress Maine has made in relying less on these practices in the wake of a 2021 law, which specified restraint and seclusion should only be used in emergency situations.\nThe law was intended to reduce the use of emergency behavioral interventions that are known to be traumatic \u2014 particularly for students with disabilities, who are disproportionately affected.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to tell if the numbers went down or up after the law change because of underreporting,\u201d Jones said.\nIn the 2022-23 school year, Maine schools reported 44% fewer incidents of restraint and seclusion in schools than it did four years earlier. But only 140 of Maine\u2019s 300-plus school administrative units submitted their data for that school year. In 2018-19, that number was 213.\nI don't want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it's traumatic, it's not good. However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.\n\u2013 Superintendent Clay Gleason, Maine School Administrative District 6\nOnly 24 districts have submitted restraint and seclusion data every year for the last decade, a Maine Morning Star analysis found.\nTogether, they represent fewer than one-quarter of Maine\u2019s roughly 170,000 K-12 students. Only two of the state\u2019s 10 largest districts, Bangor and Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 6 in the Buxton area, are among them.\nIn the 2018-19 school year, MSAD 6 staff reported restraining students 150 times and placing them in rooms by themselves 256 times.\nBy 2022-23, MSAD 6\u2019s use of those tactics, especially seclusions, had dropped considerably. District staff that year reported restraining students 100 times and placing them in seclusion rooms 132 times.\nThat district\u2019s reliance on restraint and seclusion roughly matches the trend statewide over that period. Across Maine, use of restraint and seclusion peaked in the 2018-19 year at more than 22,000 reported uses, according to the available state data. After passage of the 2021 law restricting their use to instances when a student\u2019s behavior poses an \u201cimminent danger\u201d of serious injury, overall incidents fell to just under 12,600 in the 2022-23 school year \u2014 a 44% drop.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it\u2019s traumatic, it\u2019s not good,\u201d said MSAD 6 Superintendent Clay Gleason. \u201cHowever, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.\u201d\nNumbers still high despite underreporting\nDespite inconsistent reporting, it\u2019s clear many Maine districts still rely on these practices thousands of times a year. In 2021, data reported directly by schools to the federal government showed that Maine ranked first and second in restraining and secluding students, respectively, per capita. According to an analysis of the most recent national numbers, the state fell to third and fourth per capita.\n\u201cThese are still extremely high numbers,\u201d said Jones with Lives in the Balance. \u201cEach one of these is a kid being grabbed or put into a closet, and then there\u2019s probably more of it going on based on what we know.\u201d\nThe number of reported restraints and seclusions vary widely from district to district, noted Alan Cobo-Lewis, director of the Center for Community Inclusion and Disability Studies and associate professor of Psychology at the University of Maine.\nSome districts have reported zero incidents for many years, and others like those in the Buxton-area, report large numbers. But \u201cwhether they\u2019re model programs, or whether they\u2019re just not reporting their restraints, I don\u2019t think that you can know that without actually visiting schools,\u201d Cobo-Lewis said.\n\u201cI have advocated for a while for the department to visit the schools that had high rates and also visit the schools that had zero,\u201d he said.\nWhile the federal government collects this data from districts, there is no federal oversight, and every state has different laws about restraint and seclusion. Some members of Congress have proposed a federal ban on school use of restraint and seclusion, with the most recent legislation introduced in 2023.\nThe proposal currently before Maine lawmakers would allow districts to move students against their will without reporting it as a restraint and would allow educators more flexibility in determining when they use these practices by decreasing the level of danger posed by a student\u2019s behavior from \u201cserious physical injury\u201d to just \u201cinjury.\u201d\nBoth Jones and Reilly of Disability Rights Maine worry that if the bill passes, schools will no longer have to report incidents where staff move students against their will into classrooms and quiet rooms. That would mean the statewide data on the number of restraints could drop.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is take a whole class of stuff \u2014 like the physical management of students that I think most people would look at and say, that child\u2019s being restrained \u2014 and say it\u2019s no longer restraint,\u201d Reilly said.\nHe added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that people are going to be putting their hands on kids less.\u201d\nFrom 2014 to 2023, school units reported 55 serious bodily injuries to students and 594 to staff members related to the use of a restraint or seclusion, according to publicly available data. In recent years, the number of students injured while being restrained and secluded has increased, with 22 of those 55 instances reported in the 2022-23 school year, all reported by Biddeford Schools. The southern coastal district did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nMost years, the vast majority of districts reported zero injuries.\nMSAD 6 in Buxton is one of the only districts that has reported staff and student injuries to the department every year, but Gleason said he did not recall any serious incidents, and did not know what criteria was used by staff who filled out forms.\n\u201cThere are minor injuries that happen to both staff and students, sometimes with somebody getting a little rug burn or bumping into a desk or something,\u201d he said, explaining the typical ways staff or students might get injured during a restraint or seclusion.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a standard kind of thing across districts and how they report it, or if it\u2019s like an internal measure,\u201d he added.\nAccording to state law, school units would not report injuries that do not meet the definition of serious physical injury, according to Shea, the department\u2019s restraint and seclusion specialist. But in practice, \u201cI have talked with many schools and there is a wide range of ways that [school administrative units] choose to report injuries with some tending to report even more minor injuries,\u201d he said.\nWhile the department collects injury data, there is no statewide policy about what districts should do in response to student or staff injuries.\nMajority of reports from schools for students with disabilities\nWhen public school districts determine they can\u2019t adequately serve a student with disabilities, some of them are referred to special purpose private schools. Although these schools still receive public funding, Jones said the programs are often insulated from scrutiny.\nHaving sat through dozens of those placement meetings, Jones said the student\u2019s parents and advocates are hoping that a move would increase support for the child, but that\u2019s not always the case.\nPointing to the high number of reported incidents, Jones said these schools can often be \u201chotbeds for the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion.\u201d\nOver the past decade, Maine\u2019s special purpose private schools have accounted for roughly 57% of all uses of restraint and seclusion in the state each year, going up to almost 70% in 2019-20, when the state saw the most incidents in a decade.\nThough the data from these schools haven\u2019t been consistently included in the state\u2019s annual data, students with disabilities in Maine and nationwide are much more likely to be subject to these practices.\nMaine\u2019s special purpose private schools served roughly 850 students in 2022-23 but accounted for 58% of all 7,975 restraints in the state, according to a Maine Morning Star analysis. That same year, they also accounted for about 47% of all seclusions in Maine: 2,154 of 4,618 incidents.\nThe Margaret Murphy Centers for Children, a special purpose private school with campuses in Auburn, Lewiston, Saco and Turner, has topped the state\u2019s list for seclusion every year since 2014-15; it has also restrained students more than any other school every year since 2017-18, state data shows.\nThe centers used these practices more than 11,000 times on just 108 students in 2019-20, according to the state data from 2023.\nThere is no state law restricting an educator from using these practices repeatedly on a particular child. And unless a parent complains and requests a district try a new approach, there is no statewide process for addressing the frequency of incidents.\nMargaret Murphy Senior Director Michelle Hathaway attributed those numbers to the severity of the student population\u2019s needs. The school exclusively serves children and young adults (up to age 22) with significant behavioral and developmental challenges, many of whom are referred to the school specifically because of the \u201cintensity or dangerousness of their behaviors,\u201d she said.\nThey sometimes display aggression \u2014 including attempts to hit, choke, or rip out hair \u2014 that can pose serious safety risks to themselves or others.\nHathaway wrote in an email that restraints are only used as a \u201clast resort\u201d but argued the law leaves room for interpretation and that ambiguity means some schools may \u201cover-document and over-report.\u201d\nFor example, she said a staff member holding a 3-year-old\u2019s hand to prevent them from running into a parking lot could technically, under current law, be considered a restraint.\nBut repeatedly using restraint and seclusion on a small number of students should be a red flag that something is not working, Jones said.\n\u201cOf course emergency situations will arise, but after the first few uses of restraint or seclusion, we are no longer talking about emergencies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are talking about predictable behavior that can be planned for, trained for.\u201d\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis report was originally published by the Maine Morning Star.

        "Content": "The Maine Department of Education touts the approach taken by the Topsham-area school district, MSAD 75, to reduce the use of restraint and seclusion. Amy Hall, left, special education director, and Samantha Lapointe, elementary special education coordinator, helped implement the alternative approach. (Troy Bennett/Maine Morning Star)\nAbout a decade ago, a Maine school district became concerned about how often staff members physically restrained students who were acting out and put them in seclusion rooms, especially the district\u2019s 500 or so special education students.\nThose tactics are only supposed to be used in emergencies under state law, but at the time, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 75 recorded 176 restraints and 152 seclusions on just 15 students, according to district-level data shared with Maine Morning Star. Staff were routinely scratched and bruised in the process, said Amy Hall, the district\u2019s special education director.\n\u201cWe started to get very concerned about the level of staff injuries, student injuries, and just the level of crisis we were dealing with in our schools,\u201d Hall said.\nSo in 2018, the district decided to pursue an alternative. Today, because staff members now view student behavioral issues as a problem to prevent and solve, rather than an infraction to punish \u2014 and because of a significant investment in training to execute that shift in mindset \u2014 the 2,350-student district\u2019s use of restraint and seclusion is down to the single digits: two restraints and seven seclusions in the 2022-23 school year.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nThe Maine Department of Education is touting that success story in the hope that more districts will sign onto MSAD 75\u2019s approach and rely less on restraint and seclusion \u2014 when a staff member temporarily immobilizes a student and places them alone in a room until they calm down. Research has shown that the tactics \u201care not effective in altering a student\u2019s behavior and that the experience of being restrained and secluded can be traumatizing and cause lasting effects for students,\u201d according to the Maine DOE website. The state and some school districts have worked to reduce their use for years due to staff and student injuries.\nThe model MSAD 75 turned to was developed by a Maine-based nonprofit, Lives in the Balance, that works nationally and has been adopted by a handful of other districts \u2014 including the much larger Fairfax Public Schools in Virginia \u2014 to dramatically reduce their use of restraint and seclusion.\nBut despite that model\u2019s success, it has not been widely adopted across Maine, according to Ben Jones, director of the organization\u2019s legal and policy initiatives. Although Lives in the Balance has offered free technical assistance to districts since 2022 through a state Department of Education partnership, Jones said only two districts have followed up on the offer.\nSarah Wilkinson, an assistant professor of special education at the University of Southern Maine who recently co-authored a report on student behavior, said the state is failing to provide adequate assistance to districts to make sure these tools can be implemented properly.\n\u201cAny one of these programs would decrease the behavioral crises, and then need for seclusion or restraint. But part of the issue there is that the state doesn\u2019t really have the infrastructure to support implementation,\u201d Wilkinson said.\nIn response to questions about state support, Chloe Teboe, a spokesperson for Maine DOE, said the department provides resources such as monthly office hours, one-on-one consultations, mentoring and regular training, available for districts that want them.\n\u201cWhat works in Falmouth isn\u2019t going to work in Machias or Fort Kent, and that\u2019s where folks at the district level need support to implement these approaches in a way that works for their population,\u201d Wilkinson said.\nSince 2021, Maine has limited the circumstances under which school staff can restrain and seclude students through a change in state law that aimed to nudge districts away from their frequent use. But recent complaints of worsening student behavior since the pandemic led to an effort to loosen those restrictions, which disability rights advocates fear could result in a spike.\nThe Topsham-area district, MSAD 75, is seeing that same increase in extreme behavior among younger students, Hall said, but relaxing the law on restraint and seclusion is not the answer.\n\u201cThe mental health needs of our population of students have increased, while restraints and seclusions have dramatically decreased,\u201d she said.\nInstead, Hall advocates for educators to rethink how they view behavior. Most kids will do well in school if they can. Problems with behavior often signal a response to an underlying problem that educators need to uncover and address, she said.\n\u201cIf a kid is not doing well, then we need to shift the way that we\u2019re working with that student,\u201d Hall said. \u201cOnce we get to a restraint or in a seclusion, you\u2019re way too late.\u201d\nChanging how schools think about student behavior\nThe founder of Lives in the Balance, Ross Greene, a child clinical psychologist and former Harvard Medical School faculty member, came up with the model based on a mindset shift that MSAD 75 adopted.\nGreene\u2019s approach helps schools address what he calls \u201cconcerning behaviors\u201d without resorting to punitive measures, based on the idea that when children struggle with frustration, refuse to follow instructions, or can\u2019t keep up academically or socially, their response is to act out.\n\u201cI get it, those behaviors are dangerous and scary and disruptive, but they\u2019re communicating the exact same thing \u2014 they\u2019re having difficulty meeting a particular expectation,\u201d he said.\nRather than respond with punishment or continue to demand compliance, educators can work with the child to identify and address the underlying problems. By temporarily adjusting expectations and focusing on solving problems, educators can prevent behavioral issues from escalating and build students\u2019 skills so they can meet expectations in the future, Greene said.\n\u201cThe problem is that a lot of adults, not just in schools, see a kid who\u2019s having difficulty meeting an expectation as being noncompliant, and what they do is they shoot for compliance,\u201d he said.\nGreene\u2019s Collaborative and Proactive Solutions model has been studied in students with significant behavioral challenges, including nonverbal students and students with oppositional defiant disorder, and those studies have found the model leads to notable improvements.\nOne district that\u2019s advocating to loosen the state\u2019s restraint and seclusion law, MSAD 11 in Gardiner, said it considered Greene\u2019s model but worries that the approach is not enough to address increased reports of aggressive student behavior.\n\u201cGiven that we\u2019ve almost never experienced the type of dysregulation we\u2019re seeing in very early learners, I am not confident that only going down the proactive pathway is a solution to the current context and climate that we are in,\u201d said Angela Hardy, the district\u2019s director of curriculum and instruction.\nIn the upcoming school year, Hardy said the district will try to implement some strategies that worked for MSAD 75 and that Greene advocates for, such as designing a learning environment that helps prevent incidents.\nClassroom design as prevention\nA special education teacher at the time, Samantha Lapointe started thinking that restraints and seclusions were no longer an option when MSAD 75 first made the change, even though the law permits their use in emergencies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how you would do business without those tools, until you commit to thinking about not having them,\u201d said Lapointe, who is now the district\u2019s elementary special education coordinator. \u201cThat leads to a lot of thinking about what to do instead \u2014 and that leads you into new territory, right around what new skillsets need to be stronger, what prevention strategies need to be stronger.\u201d\nClassroom design is one element of prevention, Lapointe said. The idea is to minimize any danger in case a student acts out \u2014 and reduce the need for staff to physically intervene.\nShe started working with students on the floor, then brought in a sofa. When the school got new furniture, she requested two heavy, communal tables instead of individual desks that students could easily move or overturn. The tables also had to be low to the ground so students climbing atop them would not be in danger. And Lapointe hung all the posters high enough so elementary students couldn\u2019t rip them off the walls. Staff also locked the closet that stored toys and activities.\n\u201cI\u2019ve still had kids climb on tables, and I\u2019ve had to ask myself, how dangerous is this really?\u201d she said. \u201cIs it an extreme, imminent risk of harm if they fall? You should be constantly weighing out what really constitutes danger to the extent that you would need to go hands-on.\u201d\nThe other piece was training ed techs \u2014 aides who often work one-on-one with students \u2014 in the new approach.\n\u201cAdults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand,\u201d Lapointe said. \u201cThe way you talk to kids matters a lot.\u201d\nAdults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand. The way you talk to kids matters a lot.\n\u2013 Samantha Lapointe, MSAD 75 elementary special education coordinator\nIf a student tries to leave the classroom, for example, instead of stopping them, staff can start a conversation by asking them where they\u2019re going, what they need to leave for and what their plan is after leaving, she said. Meanwhile, she also trained her staff to ask themselves: \u201cWhat can I tolerate? Why can\u2019t they leave the classroom? What\u2019s the worst that\u2019s going to happen?\u201d\n\u201cThe level of thinking and intentional decision-making needs to be very high, and that\u2019s one thing also that I train my staff in: intentionality,\u201d Lapointe said. \u201cYou must ask yourself, before you say anything, before you do anything: What is it you\u2019re going to say or do and why? What outcome are you hoping to get?\u201d\nThat\u2019s the kind of training Maine teachers are asking for and largely not receiving, said Wilkinson with the University of Southern Maine.\n\u201cTeachers or ed techs will report, \u2018We\u2019ve been safety-care trained, we\u2019ve had de-escalation training\u2019 \u2026 all of these things that really only happen when a behavior gets to a certain point,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cThat means that the behavior has to get to that point before they have the skills to deal with it. Teachers are not reporting that they\u2019re confident with all of the things you would do before the behavior escalates.\u201d\nEven in the Topsham-area district, the training in Collaborative and Proactive Solutions isn\u2019t complete. Lapointe said it\u2019s now a priority to expand beyond special education to general education classroom teachers and higher grades.\nA new approach\nThe Topsham-area district combines Greene\u2019s model with Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, or PBIS \u2014 a research-based model used in schools across the country that\u2019s built around positive reinforcement of good behavior and gradually increasing levels of intervention and consequences for kids who misbehave.\nThis is how the combination of the two models could look.\nIn the library, the expectation for all students is that they keep their voices low and read, Hall said. PBIS lays out a system to reinforce positive behavior, often through small rewards, and address infractions. But Greene\u2019s approach would come into play if a student can\u2019t keep quiet in the library, she said.\nIt may be that the child can\u2019t focus, keep still, has sensory issues, or is too stimulated in that setting. Instead of punishing the child, teachers try to problem solve: They might offer them headphones, move their reading time to a quiet classroom, or even allow the child to leave the library, Hall said.\nMoving away from demanding compliance from students helps educators understand and work with them to solve the issue underlying the behavior, instead of an outburst or aggression stemming from it, she said.\n\u201cInstead of just asking them to do the same thing over again and sustain in an environment that they can\u2019t, you try to figure out what\u2019s behind the behavior,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWe still have rewards, and kids still have consequences, but the consequences just aren\u2019t, \u2018We\u2019re going to put you in a seclusion room.\u2019 Because that\u2019s not a consequence, that\u2019s a crisis response.\u201d\nMaine Morning Star is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

(Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty and Fran Baltzer, Danielle Richards, and Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)\nTRENTON, N.J. \u2013 The U.S. government has sued Newark, Jersey City, Paterson and Hoboken \u2013 and their elected officials \u2013 for city policies prosecutors say interfere with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration detention and deportation goals.\nProsecutors want a judge to declare the policies an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution\u2019s supremacy clause, which holds that federal law prevails over state law. They also want an injunction to block the cities from protecting their residents and visitors from immigration enforcement.\n\u201cThe United States is currently facing a crisis of illegal immigration, and the Federal Government is set to put a stop to it,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cWhile states and local governments are free to stand aside as the United States performs this important work, they cannot stand in the way. And where inaction crosses into obstruction, local governments break federal law. That is what is happening across New Jersey right now. It is past time it ends.\u201d\nThe complaint, filed Thursday, names as defendants Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla and the cities\u2019 council presidents (all four mayors are Democrats). Baraka and Fulop are among six Democrats running to become New Jersey\u2019s next governor, and Baraka just two days ago beat another federal case against him over a contested immigration jail that recently opened in Newark.\nBaraka blasted the latest prosecution as \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not standing in the way of public safety. We are upholding the Constitution, providing oversight, and following the laws and guidelines of the State of New Jersey,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNothing in our policies prevents law enforcement from doing their jobs. What we refuse to do is turn our city into an arm of federal immigration enforcement, which the courts have already ruled is not our role.\u201d\nFulop said he would not be \u201cbullied\u201d and vowed to fight the feds.\n\u201cJersey City gets sued for being a sanctuary city \u2014 I guess MAGA ran out of conspiracy theories for the week,\u201d he said. \u201cHere is the truth: Jersey City\u2019s policies protect families, reflect our values and have led to record low crime rates.\u201d\nAnd Sayegh dismissed the complaint as \u201ca frivolous lawsuit and a flagrant affront to the rule of law.\u201d\n\u201cWe will not be intimidated, and we will fight this egregious attempt to score political points at Paterson\u2019s expense,\u201d Sayegh said.\nBhalla also said his city \u201cwill not back down.\u201d\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s treatment of immigrants, lawful residents, and countless citizens is truly disgraceful and often, unconstitutional. Families have been senselessly torn apart, and legal residents who have not been proven to have committed any crimes have been deported to jails overseas without due process. These actions of the federal government are truly barbaric, and Hoboken will not aid this lawlessness,\u201d he said.\nIn the 24-page complaint, U.S. Justice Department prosecutors led by Yaakov M. Roth, acting assistant attorney general, accused the cities of denying federal immigration agents access to undocumented people in local jails, forbidding local police from delivering them to federal immigration agents, and barring \u201cotherwise willing local officers from providing mission-critical information to federal immigration authorities.\u201d\nProsecutors cite executive orders and police directives that the cities issued in 2017, 2018 and 2019 during President Trump\u2019s first term, but that remain in effect. Such policies prohibit \u201ceven the most basic cooperation with federal officials\u201d and undermine immigration enforcement work, prosecutors argue.\n\u201cThese efforts to shield illegal aliens within the Garden State are unlawful,\u201d the complaint states.\nThe complaint also accuses city officials of discrimination, because they bar local police and municipal officials from cooperating only with federal immigration agents, not any other entity. Singling out one agency for unfavorable treatment constitutes discrimination, the lawsuit says.\n\u201cSuch discriminatory targeting of the Federal Government is unlawful,\u201d the complaint says.\nThe complaint comes three weeks after federal authorities began detaining undocumented people at Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed jail in Newark that has drawn protesters daily.\nJail officials initially had barred city officials from inspecting the facility, which led to Baraka\u2019s arrest earlier this month when he visited the site seeking entry. Prosecutors on Monday dropped charges against Baraka but then charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) with assaulting officers by acting as a human shield to protect Baraka from arrest. She denies the charges, and Congressional Democrats from around the country have denounced that arrest.\nImmigration advocates decried the lawsuit filed Friday as the feds\u2019 attempt strong-arm local governments into carrying out federal immigration enforcement.\nAmy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said the cities\u2019 policies don\u2019t violate federal law but instead \u201creflect a clear separation between local and federal responsibilities.\u201d She urged the cities to resist caving to federal \u201cbullying.\u201d\n\u201cOver the last few months, the Trump Administration\u2019s DOJ has made it clear that they want to make an example out of New Jersey \u2014 first by raiding our cities, then by expanding ICE jails in defiance of local law, and most recently by arresting elected officials and charging sitting members of Congress with felonies,\u201d Torres said in a statement. \u201cIt is clear that the DOJ remains hellbent on making a national example out of New Jersey. In return, NJAIJ calls upon the cities of Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken to be a national example of resistance, dissent, and champions for justice.\u201d\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis report was first published by the New Jersey Monitor, part of the States Newsroom nonprofit news network.

(Photo by Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)\nRepublican President Donald Trump, who called himself the \u201cfather of IVF\u201d on the campaign trail, issued an executive order in February directing policy advisers to create a report on how to make in vitro fertilization more accessible for Americans.\n\u201cToday, many hopeful couples dream of starting a family, but as many as one in seven are unable to conceive a child,\u201d the order read. \u201cDespite their hopes and efforts, infertility struggles can make conception difficult, turning what should be a joyful experience into an emotional and financial struggle.\u201d\nTrump gave domestic policy officials a 90-day deadline to send him a list of recommendations on how to protect access to IVF and reduce out-of-pocket costs for fertility care.\nLeaders at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and Resolve: The National Infertility Association \u2014 leading IVF advocacy groups \u2014 told States Newsroom they were not consulted by the Trump administration about the IVF plan.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been leading the effort for over a decade and passed legislation in state after state that now has improved coverage for 60 million Americans,\u201d said Sean Tipton, American Society for Reproductive Medicine\u2019s chief advocacy and policy officer. \u201cWe clearly have the expertise to be of assistance, but they didn\u2019t want to talk to us.\u201d\nResolve President and CEO Barbara Collura said the administration did not consult her organization, either.\nSubscribe to Reproductive Rights Today\nWant a better understanding of abortion policy in the states? Sign up for our free national newsletter. Reproductive Rights Today is a comprehensive daily wrap-up of changes to reproductive rights in the states, the front lines in the fight over abortion access in a Post-Roe America.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBoth Collura and Tipton said they hope the administration will call for expansion of IVF insurance coverage for servicemembers, veterans and other federal employees.\nCollura said the U.S. Office of Personnel Management can require health insurance plans to offer comprehensive IVF coverage, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services could declare IVF an essential health benefit through the Affordable Care Act and the U.S. Department of Defense could mandate coverage under Tricare. Members of the military can only get IVF covered today if they prove infertility stemmed from combat duty.\n\u201cThe Veterans Health Administration also does not offer IVF as routine care, and we want to change that, but we believe that that has to be done through Congress,\u201d she said.\nCongress would also have to direct private insurers to mandate IVF coverage. Trump first raised this idea in August during a Wisconsin town hall, but NBC News reported that GOP members of Congress were skeptical of the costs.\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill are focused on passing a \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that includes tax cuts for the wealthy and a massive decrease in Medicaid funding, according to our D.C. Bureau. It\u2019s unclear if Congress would be open to insurance coverage mandates.\nThe Trump administration laid off health care researchers and other government employees this year. HHS fired its six-person Assisted Reproductive Technology team in April.\nThe advocates are also wary of a faction of conservatives who have pushed a concept called \u201crestorative reproductive medicine,\u201d the notion that providers should treat the root causes of infertility through hormonal therapies, testing and nutrition, and turn to IVF as a last resort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political term backed by political groups that has nothing to do with medicine,\u201d Tipton said. \u201cWhen you look at the details, it sounds a lot like what our clinicians would refer to as the diagnostic workup for infertility patients, but make no mistake, this is a term that is pushed by groups who oppose IVF.\u201d\nOfficials at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, have backed restorative reproductive medicine. Emma Waters, a policy analyst at the foundation\u2019s Center for Technology and the Human Person, cowrote a report released in March backing the concept and calling for increased regulation of the infertility industry.\nJanae Stracke, the vice president of Heritage Action, the foundation\u2019s advocacy arm, praised a law Arkansas passed in April requiring the use of fertility awareness-based methods \u2014 checking body temperatures and cervical fluid levels to track menstrual cycles \u2014 in Title X programs.\n\u201cThe RESTORE Act is groundbreaking legislation that champions reproductive healthcare for women in Arkansas by prioritizing restorative reproductive medicine and empowering women with the tools they need to thrive,\u201d Stracke said in a statement.\nLittle Rock-based Arkansas Fertility and Gynecology has a header at the top of its website warning against restorative reproductive medicine, saying it\u2019s \u201cnot a medically proven alternative to IVF.\u201d\nCollura said she fears restorative reproductive medicine could grow in popularity and lead insurance companies to mandate that patients try it before getting approved for fertility treatments.\n\u201cThat bypasses what the diagnosis is. Reproduction is time-based: The longer you wait, the poorer outcomes you have,\u201d she said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want people to be forced into certain treatments that are actually not going to help them.\u201d\nDr. Karenne Fru, a reproductive endocrinologist at Muna Fertility in the Atlanta area, said proponents of restorative reproductive medicine misunderstand what physicians do, and doing tests for patients seeking fertility services is a basic standard of practice.\n\u201cIt is not a cure-all for someone with a total sperm count of, say, 100,000 or an absent vas deferens \u2014 the sperm can\u2019t get out. There\u2019s no way you can exercise, eat right, sleep well and fix that. That is how you\u2019re born,\u201d Fru said.\nHer state just passed a law protecting IVF, but she said that conflicts with Georgia\u2019s fetal personhood language in the six-week abortion ban that allows prospective parents to claim fetuses on their income taxes. Fru testified before state lawmakers in March during a hearing for a bill that would have banned all abortion and jeopardized fertility care, Georgia Recorder reported.\nTrump\u2019s promises about IVF insurance coverage have led some of her patients to postpone their reproductive plans, she said.\n\u201cThere are a lot of patients who are delaying care because they think that the president is going to make IVF free,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that playing with people\u2019s hopes and dreams in this way is unnecessarily cruel.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "5:00\nNews Story\nTrump\u2019s deportation push alarms a Louisiana refugee community\nLaotian community activist Phanat Xanamane lights a candle as part of the Sou Khuan ceremony in Broussard. (Alena Maschke/The Current)\nBROUSSARD \u2013 In the Laotian Sou Khuan ceremony, a string is tied around participants\u2019 wrists, in a ritual meant to preserve good luck and well-being by calling out to the spirits of their ancestors. Common across Southeast Asia, the ritual is often performed in moments of great change in a person\u2019s life \u2014 marriage, childbirth or a big professional leap.\nPhanat Xanamane, a community activist and artist in New Iberia, remembers wearing the string around his wrist when he left his home in New Iberia for grad school in New York.\n\u201cLooking down and seeing those strings on your wrist is a definite reminder of where you come from, who you are, and the people that love you and support you,\u201d Xanamane says. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that you have a community behind your back.\u201d\nWhen members of the Wat Thammarattanaram temple in Iberia Parish came together on a recent Sunday afternoon to take part in the ceremony, it seemed timely. For decades, Laotians have lived in the area, many harvesting peppers or shelling crawfish for a living, raising families and building a community along the way.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nMost arrived as refugees as part of an official resettlement process, giving them legal status at the time of their arrival, and have been legal permanent residents ever since, with some applying for citizenship once they became eligible.\nAs legal residents, most didn\u2019t have much to worry about as far as immigration enforcement was concerned.\nBut an aggressive deportation push by the Trump administration has stirred fear in this deeply rooted South Louisiana community. While the administrative realities of deporting Laotian refugees \u2014and many other immigrants \u2014 are complicated, those threatened by it are forced to grapple with the possibility of leaving home and family behind.\nA secret war\nThe Vietnam War is one of America\u2019s most well-studied, culturally relevant foreign military engagements, the subject of too many books, movies and newspaper articles to count. But in its shadow, a U.S. intervention took place that much of the American public knows little about.\nLaos, a small kingdom of a few million inhabitants at the time, took an officially neutral stance toward the conflict raging in neighboring Vietnam, although a similar battle of ideologies was being fought on its turf \u2014 largely facilitated by the Central Intelligence Agency, the largest paramilitary operation in the agency\u2019s history.\nBut its proclaimed neutrality and cooperation with the Americans didn\u2019t save Laos from becoming a victim of its geographic location. From 1964 to 1973, the U.S. military dropped two million tons of cluster bombs on Laos \u2014 more than all the bombs dropped in World War II combined.\nThe people of Laos, many of them rice farmers and other agricultural workers, fled the internal conflict and American carpet bombing, mostly to neighboring Thailand. The U.S. didn\u2019t succeed in pushing back the communist insurgents of Pathet Lao. Following the 1975 communist takeover, many more Laotians left their homes. In Thailand, they dwelled in refugee camps, hoping to return one day or looking for a way out.\nIn 1980 alone, 100,000 Laotians were resettled from Thai refugee camps, most of them to the U.S., where church and community groups sponsored them for resettlement, and they became permanent residents, with a path to citizenship down the line.\nThis is how one Laotian man arrived in South Louisiana. Having spent his early childhood in a refugee camp in Thailand, he arrived in San Francisco with his family in 1986. They soon resettled in South Louisiana, where they had family and a community. He was issued a green card, the document proving his right to live and work in the U.S.\nThen, on a July day in 1997, everything changed.\nNow 46, he recounts shooting a gun into the air at 17-years-old. A dumb move, for sure, but luckily no one got hurt. But that didn\u2019t shield him from consequences. He was charged with aggravated assault for firing the 9mm handgun and entered a plea deal. Police records from the time are longer available.\nWhat he didn\u2019t know was that by pleading guilty, he had put his immigration status at risk. While considered proof of \u201cpermanent residency,\u201d a green card is a provisional document and the status it confers is subject to revocation for a number of reasons, including criminal charges or failure to renew the card.\nAfter being released from jail, the man, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of raising his profile with immigration authorities, was transferred to an immigration detention facility in Oakdale.\nHe spent two years in immigration detention, appealing his case to an immigration judge to no avail. As a result, the government wanted to deport him, but there was one problem \u2014 the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a repatriation agreement with Laos. He was paroled and went on with his life in Iberia Parish.\nLimbo\nIn practical terms, refugees arrive in the U.S. in one of two ways. They may flee a country where they feel their life or liberty is under threat and enter the U.S., legally or illegally, to claim asylum. Being on U.S. soil is a requirement for claiming asylum, while the resettlement process usually starts abroad, often in refugee camps.\nThe other way for refugees to arrive in the country is the refugee resettlement process, in which refugees who have fled to a country of relative safety, such as Thailand was for fleeing Laotians, can apply to be resettled elsewhere.\nHowever refugees arrive, their eligibility for deportation, should they lose their permission to stay in the country, is in part determined by diplomatic relationships between the U.S. and the refugees\u2019 country of origin.\nHistorically, Laos has rarely issued travel documents for deportation. In response, in July 2018, the U.S. placed sanctions on the Laotian government, including a stop on issuing visas for certain high-level Lao government officials, in an effort to force them to cooperate with U.S. deportation policy.\nThe Laotian government subsequently agreed to issue a limited number of travel documents each year, but deportations to the country remain rare. According to the Asian Law Caucus, there are currently over 4,800 Laotians considered deportable by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) living in the U.S.\nThe 47-year-old from South Louisiana is one of them. After the government was unable to deport him to Laos, where he had spent a mere two years of his life, he was paroled. In the decades to follow, he built a life in the U.S., got married and started a family, all while attending regular check-ins with ICE to inform them about his whereabouts.\nA recent call-in letter to a local ICE office didn\u2019t come as a shock \u2014 he had been checking in with immigration authorities every other year or so since he was released from detention. But the current climate around immigration did make him wary. He brought an attorney and a friend to the appointment, in case he would be detained again and needed someone to drive his car back.\nHe wasn\u2019t. But the situation once again made him reflect on the threat he has faced for decades, of losing the life he has built over a teenage mistake. He worried how his wife and three children would fare if he suddenly disappeared.\n\u201cIt was wrong, what I did,\u201d he says. \u201cBut can you hold this against me for the rest of my life? There\u2019s no way out of it.\u201d The uncertainty of his long-lasting parole, he says, amounts to \u201cdouble-jeopardy\u201d \u2014 being tried for the same crime twice.\nSince then, he has heard from others in his situation that they were given ankle monitors and were required to apply for permission for seeking work considered outside of their area of residence.\nUnsettled\nIt\u2019s cases like his that call into question whether Trump\u2019s declared goal of mass deportations is actually achievable. Since the start of his second administration, arrests of immigrants have picked up, but deportations have lagged, leading to high numbers of immigrants detained in a growing number of detention facilities across the country.\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop those in local immigrant communities from worrying about their neighbors, friends and family members. Even without a criminal record, something that may have seemed a small error in the past \u2014 such as failing to submit an application for a green card renewal \u2014 may put someone at risk of deportation or at least long-term detention in increasingly crowded facilities.\nMany in his community, much of which remains working class, don\u2019t fully grasp the administrative processes of the immigration system, Xanamane says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had several people, families, reach out to me and other knowledgeable young people \u2014 more white collar professionals, lawyers, community organizers \u2014 and say: can you help us? I have a son, I have a cousin, I have a husband, et cetera, that may be in danger of being deported,\u201d he says.\nThe memory of living under an oppressive regime has made many older Laotian refugees additionally fearful of engaging with government officials, causing many to forgo their opportunity to apply for citizenship, a more protective status, and remaining permanent residents instead.\nIt also has caused political subjects to be somewhat taboo at the kitchen table, notes Xanamane, who\u2019s first name is that of the Thai refugee camp where he was born. This, he feels, has to change given the current circumstances.\n\u201cWe have a voice and we have concerns that apply to our community, and we want to make sure that we\u2019re protected,\u201d he says. \u201cMy goal is just not to have my community, the families in my community, be torn apart.\u201d\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis article was originally published by The Current, a nonprofit news organization serving Lafayette and southern Louisiana.

(John Gray/Verite News)\nA bill requiring local governments to enforce a ban on sleeping on public property passed through a Louisiana legislative committee Wednesday within the hearing\u2019s final minutes, though housing advocates and groups that serve the homeless say it remains problematic in its current form.\nThe proposal, House Bill 619 by Rep. Alonzo Knox, D-New Orleans, would direct local governments to enforce a ban on \u201cpublic camping\u201d or face possible lawsuits. Local governments could instead designate government-sanctioned encampments \u2013 much like the recent state-operated \u201cTransition Center\u201d in New Orleans \u2013 in areas where they wouldn\u2019t \u201cmaterially affect the property value\u201d of homes or businesses.\nAny resident or business within 1,000 feet of an illegal public camp, as well as a local district attorney, would be able to sue local governments if they failed to enforce the ban.\nKnox\u2019s bill also requires homeless service providers who receive state funds to provide detailed documentation of their work to municipalities upon request or else lose their funding. Unity of Greater New Orleans, the leading nonprofit serving the city\u2019s homeless population, has drawn scrutiny from Knox and others for not providing more specific data on how it spends federal dollars.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nKnox has repeatedly accused housing nonprofits of waste and decried the \u201chomeless industrial complex.\u201d He pushed for the legislative audit of New Orleans\u2019 Continuum of Care providers earlier this year. It found that the city and Unity spent $216 million between 2019-24, with the majority of funds going toward permanent supportive housing.\nThe audit also found that shelters need better oversight to ensure they\u2019re meeting minimum health and safety standards.\nWhen Knox\u2019s measure was brought up Wednesday in the House Committee on Health and Welfare, it was after hearings on two other bills spanned more than three hours. Chairman Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas, noted that 11 people wanted to speak against Knox\u2019s bill but wouldn\u2019t have time because the House had already convened on the floor.\nCommittee members were given the option to defer Knox\u2019s bill until next week but chose instead to continue the meeting. With limited time, Miller limited the opposition to just three speakers. Two attendees who\u2019ve experienced homelessness were among those who didn\u2019t have the chance to speak.\nKnox agreed to amendments suggested by Rep Chris Turner, R-Ruston, which included changes in how the bill defines dwelling structures and extended the timeline for encampment clearing notices. Committee members suggested that the amendments should remove opposition to the bill.\nBut opponents said the amendments did not allay their concerns, and in some cases even increased the risk of harm.\n\u2018Serious legal and ethical conflicts\u2019\nThe state-sanctioned encampments proposed in Knox\u2019s bill parallel Gov. Jeff Landry\u2019s recent transition center in New Orleans, set up at a warehouse in a remote industrial section of the city. Unsheltered people were taken there from encampments downtown just before the Super Bowl.\nKnox toured and praised the site while it was open, but his bill has sparked questions about how money for housing can be spent most efficiently.\nLandry\u2019s transition center, which cost about $17 million, ultimately placed 108 people in permanent supportive housing. Since 2023, Unity of Greater New Orleans has spent $2.3 million to permanently house 275 people, according to the audit.\nThe state spent about $100,000 per person on the warehouse site over 10 weeks, compared to the $20,000 per year it costs to provide housing and support services per person, said Angela Owczarek with the Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a housing rights advocacy group.\nA pandemic-era emergency rental assistance program, which ended last year, cost about $3,000 per New Orleans household to prevent homelessness for those facing eviction, Owczarek said.\nElsa Dimitradis, executive director of Acadiana Regional Coalition on Homelessness and Housing, testified that she had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Knox\u2019s bill, particularly the mandate about sharing client information with local governments. She warned the potential violations of privacy and disability laws could jeopardize $93 million in federal funding for housing nonprofits across the state.\nUnity of Greater New Orleans is already suing the state for trying to compel the organization to produce protected information about its clients, such as medical histories and Social Security numbers.\nDimitradis also testified that the bill as written \u201cappears to allow for open-ended demands at any time without clear standards or limitations,\u201d which is \u201can operational threat.\u201d\nHannah Adams of the National Housing Law Project argued the bill should provide exceptions to the ban if local governments are actively working to rehouse people.\n\u201cClearing an encampment when social workers are actively working to rehouse individuals does interfere with their ability to maintain contact and secure long-term housing for their clients,\u201d Adams told the committee.\nThe audit, likewise, noted that unexpected NOPD sweeps and state pressure to clear encampments contributed to delays in the city\u2019s rehousing efforts.\nMonique Blossom, director of policy at Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center, also warned that by directing state officials to inspect group homes, the bill risks violating the federal Fair Housing Act, opening the state to liability. The bill could lead to the shuttering of some group homes, including domestic violence shelters, sober living homes and even homes for seriously ill children who need to stay near hospitals, she said\nDonna Paramore, executive director of the Travelers Aid Society of Greater New Orleans, told Illuminator the group is in \u201cstrong opposition\u201d to the bill despite the amendments.\n\u201cThe framework it proposes still undermines essential safeguards for vulnerable populations,\u201d Paramore said. The issues outlined by Dimitradis \u201ccould jeopardize federal funding\u201d and \u201ccreate serious legal and ethical conflicts,\u201d she added.\nParamore also noted her nonprofit undergoes an independent financial audit each year and has never had an adverse finding. She said that instead of banning public encampments, the state should expand supportive housing, behavioral health services and trauma-informed care.\nKnox dismissed objections at the close of the hearing, calling some \u201ctechnical and nitpicking.\u201d He rejected Adams\u2019 request for leniency when social workers are actively working on rehousing someone.\n\u201cIf that language were to be included, they will always be \u2018actively working,\u2019\u201d Knox said.\nThe representative\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment after hearing.\nKnox\u2019s bill was advanced to the House floor without objection.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

He ruled that former Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration exceeded its authority by including abortion in rules finalized last year.\n\u201cThis court\u2019s decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women\u2019s rights and reproductive freedom,\u201d said Inimai Chettiar, the president of paid leave advocacy group A Better Balance, in a statement.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nThe ruling is a victory for state officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and a group of Catholic Church organizations.Plaintiffs sued the EEOC over the inclusion of abortion in the guidelines, which the agency released in April 2024 following a lengthy public comment process, Illuminator reported.\nRoughly 54,000 Americans said abortion should be excluded from the definition of \u201cpregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions,\u201d while some 40,000 said pregnancy termination should be included.\nLawyers for the states \u2014 both have near-total abortion bans \u2014 argued the rule doesn\u2019t align with the Dobbs v. Women\u2019s Health Organization decision from the U.S. Supreme Court, while Catholic groups said the abortion provision violates freedom of religion.\n\u201cThis is a win for Louisiana and for life,\u201d Republican Attorney General Liz Murrill said on social media.\nSeveral other lawsuits against the law are in play. A federal judge ruled in April that a separate group of Catholic employers do not have to protect their employees\u2019 access to abortion and fertility treatments, North Dakota Monitor reported.\nIn February, another judge ruled that a lawsuit filed by 17 GOP attorneys general against the EEOC over abortion accommodations in the workplace can move forward, according to The Associated Press.\nAnd the Texas government and its agencies don\u2019t have to comply with any part of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.

(Video by James Hiatt)\nSix grassroots environmental groups filed a federal lawsuit this week that takes aim at a 2024 Louisiana law that essentially crippled community-based air monitoring in the state.\nThe suit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, calls the law an \u201cindustry-friendly ban\u201d that bars groups from using their own independent air monitoring systems to warn residents living in fenceline communities about potential health risks.\n\u201cOur legislature and officials should do everything in their power to stop industry from polluting our air in the first place,\u201d said Joy Banner, co-founder of The Descendants Project, one of the six plaintiffs in the lawsuit. \u201cTo attack our First Amendment rights instead is arcane, illegal and dangerous.\u201d\nThe coalition\u2019s lawsuit argues that Louisiana\u2019s air monitoring law suppresses evidence collected by more affordable air quality monitoring equipment that they use to help \u201cfenceline\u201d communities better understand the quality of the air they\u2019re breathing.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nThe lawsuit alleges the law does this by preventing the use of this data to allege air quality violations, with penalties of up to $32,500 a day, plus $1 million for intentional violations. The plaintiffs argue this violates their right to free speech.\nThe lawsuit comes at a time when a new report from a special legislative task force is urging Louisiana lawmakers to invest millions more in monitoring and real-time notification of hazardous emissions in communities hardest hit by pollution.\nThe Bayou State is one of the most industrialized in the United States, with 476 major air pollution sources \u2014 including petroleum, chemical, plastics and sugar facilities \u2014 as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe task force was made up of state environmental officials, industry lobbyists and representatives from the nonprofit environmental group that was a target of the new law, which set standards for air monitoring so high that grassroots groups can\u2019t meet them.\nThe report submitted last month to the House and Senate legislative environmental committees recommends that lawmakers spend at least $13 million to establish a more robust and localized air monitoring and notification system within the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality.\nLDEQ\u2019s current system consists of 29 continuous monitoring sites that report annually to the EPA and track real-time data on emissions \u2014 including particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. It also operates seven non-continuous monitoring sites that help the agency track long-term trends in air quality. And it has four temporary monitoring sites that can be strategically placed in areas of concern, generally collecting a year of data in each location.\nThe report recommends that LDEQ place additional air monitors near the top polluting industrial facilities in the state based on the volume and toxicity of their emissions and their proximity to \u201cfenceline\u201d communities. The committee estimated these regulatory monitors would cost nearly $800,000 per site and between $150,000 to $200,000 in annual operating and maintenance expenses.\nIt suggested the state could locate them near 10% to 20% of Louisiana\u2019s major air pollution sources \u2014 which would mean tens of millions of dollars just in capital costs.\nIn addition to more monitoring, the task force recommends a notification system capable of blasting out real-time text and phone call alerts about possible air quality dangers to nearby residents. Such a notification system has an estimated price tag of $5.2 million for initial set up and annual maintenance.\nThe recommendations would require LDEQ to hire 48 new people, to join the team of seven currently dedicated to overseeing the data collected by the existing network of monitoring sites, at an annual cost of about $8.2 million.\nLouisiana leaders mum on more monitoring\nBut there\u2019s no indication yet from state leaders or LDEQ that money will be allocated to implement the report\u2019s recommendations. The Republican chairs of Louisiana\u2019s Senate Environmental Quality Committee and House committee on Natural Resources and Environment did not respond to questions from Floodlight about the report. Inquiries to officials with LDEQ also went unanswered.\n\u201cI would hope that the Legislature would believe that having information that affects people\u2019s health, affects workers\u2019 health and affects communities would be an important priority for them,\u201d said Marylee Orr, executive director of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN).\nLEAN had a seat on the 11-member task force that drafted the report. The organization received $500,000 in federal funding allocated for community-run air monitoring programs in former President Joe Biden\u2019s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\nLEAN used the money to deploy a fleet of mobile air-monitoring vehicles that collected samples along the Mississippi River area in southwest Louisiana known as \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d The group also has partnered with a bulk storage facility for liquids \u2014 including ethanol, diesel and other petroleum products \u2014 in St. Rose to monitor air quality in nearby neighborhoods.\nLocalized, coordinated air monitoring efforts like LEAN\u2019s have been a tool marginalized communities overburdened by polluting industries have tried to demonstrate air quality problems and push state leaders for tougher regulations and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.\nOrr said LEAN favors this latest step urging the Legislature to act but, \u201cI don\u2019t know where the money\u2019s going to be coming from.\u201d\nCurrent system seen as inadequate\nEnvironmental advocates have long criticized Louisiana\u2019s existing air monitoring system, calling it insufficient to accurately measure pollution since there aren\u2019t enough monitors located where air quality is the most compromised.\nThe state ranks fourth highest among 56 states and territories for toxic emissions per square mile, according to EPA\u2019s Toxic Release Inventory. Roughly 400 Louisiana facilities emitted 132 million pounds of toxic pollution in 2022.\nChet Wayland, former director of the EPA\u2019s Air Quality Assessment Division, said most states\u2019 air monitoring systems are designed to meet the minimum standards for ambient air. That means not necessarily putting them near industrial facilities, but rather in more densely populated places to measure air pollutants including particulate matter, ozone and sulfur dioxide, he said.\nWayland said states can increase air quality oversight through community-based air monitors. He said such localized air monitoring, as California and New York use, is the best way to track the emissions of the more dangerous air toxins like benzene, toluene, heavy metals and industrial solvents.\n\u201cWe all would love to see more data available. Clearly we can\u2019t monitor every single place that we should be monitoring. The resources aren\u2019t there from the federal standpoint and \u2014 I get it \u2014 they\u2019re not there from the state standpoint as well,\u201d Wayland said.\nHe said a \u201csmart strategy\u201d would be to place monitors in places where people are more likely to be exposed to harmful air pollutants, adding, \u201cIt would be nice to have some indication of what the air quality is in those areas.\u201d\nThe task force report also suggests supplementing new monitors with air quality sensors that are cheaper and could detect pollutants wafting through communities. The report acknowledges these air sensors are \u201cprone to inaccuracies\u201d and are most useful for offering general insight into air quality \u2014 not as a resource for enforcement.\nFuture of federal funding in question\nNationally, approximately $117 million was earmarked in the IRA for state, local governments, tribal nations and community groups to implement, upgrade and continue various air monitoring programs in fenceline communities.\nBut Romany Webb, deputy director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, noted that Congress is currently considering a budget proposal that seeks to repeal a lot of those funds and clawback any unobligated money across all IRA-funded initiatives.\n\u201cBut, as I\u2019m sure you know, the bill still has to pass the Senate and is likely to change (perhaps significantly) before that happens,\u201d Webb said.\nEPA spokesperson Shayla Powell said the agency is \u201creviewing all of its grant programs\u201d to gauge whether they are an \u201cappropriate use of taxpayer dollars\u201d and \u201calign with\u201d the current administration\u2019s policies.\nShe added, \u201cMaybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn\u2019t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and \u2018environmental justice\u2019 preferencing the EPA\u2019s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d\nJay Benforado, board chair for the Association for Advancing Participatory Sciences, said all signals from the current administration lead him to think that community air monitoring won\u2019t survive.\nAs for the task force report, Benforado said its recommendations failed to factor in the valuable role that community members, volunteers and academics could play in monitoring air quality.\n\u201cI felt the (task force) report \u2026 missed the mark somewhat in terms of garnering the full value of community air monitoring,\u201d Benforado said. \u201cTheir definition of community air monitoring was how a state government runs community air monitoring. There was less emphasis on engaging the community as equal participants in an air monitoring program.\u201d\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nFloodlight is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action.",

Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, stands after a June 20, 2023, Senate Committee on Health and Welfare meeting. (Claire Sullivan/Louisiana Illuminator)\nTensions are escalating at the State Capitol as a legislative package that attempts to lower auto insurance costs in Louisiana nears its final stage of approval.\nOn Wednesday, the Senate advanced six of the more controversial insurance measures in a floor session that lasted late into the night. The debate included impassioned floor speeches and a heated clash between two lawmakers, both attorneys who stand on opposite sides of the issue.\nGov. Jeff Landry has signaled support for the proposals.\nOnly one of the bills cleared the chamber with bipartisan support, while the other five passed mostly along party lines with Republicans voting in favor of them and Democrats against. Those five are so-called \u201ctort reform\u201d proposals that give insurance companies certain protections or advantages in litigation, making it harder for accident victims to file successful lawsuits.\nTort reform legislation from previous years has failed to reduce auto insurance rates, though most Republicans, including state Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, have said those measures were not strong enough.\nThis lack of results was among the points of contention during Wednesday\u2019s debate on Senate Bill 231, which took up most of the evening before the bill passed in a 27-8 vote. Sponsored by Sen. Mike Reese, R-Leesville, it would effectively reduce the money plaintiffs can recover for medical expenses in an auto accident lawsuit. The amount would be limited to what a plaintiff actually pays for care rather than what doctors and hospitals bill.\nSupporters of Reese\u2019s bill argue it would provide medical billing transparency in personal injury lawsuits and prevent plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys from basing claims on artificially inflated medical bills no one actually pays.\nOpponents argue transparency should apply to both sides. They pointed to a separate tort reform law that allows insurers to hide certain details related to their policyholder\u2019s coverage during a trial. Jurors could lower a monetary award if they believe an individual defendant \u2014 rather than an insurance company \u2014 will be personally on the hook for paying it, according to their viewpoint.\n\u201cCurrent law allows the plaintiff to lie to the jury, and it does not allow the defendant to tell the truth,\u201d Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, an attorney whose practice includes insurance defense, said in support of the measure.\nSen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, took issue over what he called Seabaugh\u2019s \u201cambush-type\u201d strategy to tack on a late-hour amendment to Reese\u2019s bill that other senators had no time to review.\nLuneau, a personal injury lawyer, said the amended bill was being rushed because Seabaugh had a conflicting court date Tuesday, when the Senate convenes next after a long Memorial Day holiday.\nStanding at the Senate floor lectern within a foot of each other, Luneau and Seabaugh got into an exchange that quickly grew intense.\nSeabaugh said the amendment, which was eventually adopted, requires judges and juries to be shown both the amount paid and the amount billed for medical expenses in auto injury cases, but confusion ensued over its text. The Republican senator, defending his amendment, said that Luneau, himself, had requested the provision.\nWhen Luneau denied this and offered to withdraw the purported request, Seabaugh, in a raised voice, accused Luneau of lying.\n\u201cYou were pounding the table, saying \u2018Let\u2019s tell the jury everything. Let\u2019s let them see the billed amount,\u2019\u201d Seabaugh said, pausing but drawing no response from Luneau. \u201cYou are just gonna come up here and blatantly bald-faced lie, and I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\nThe accusation drew quick intervention from Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and prompted Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Louis Carral Jr. to swiftly approach the lectern, prepared to physically separate the two men.\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys, guys, come on!\u201d Henry told the two senators. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of decorum that we expect to have in the Senate. Y\u2019all need to relax.\u201d\nThe amendment actually would have allowed defendants to try to lower jury awards following a trial.\nLater, Luneau delivered a lengthy speech against the bill, so long that he appeared to be mounting a filibuster to delay a vote. But he ultimately ceded the floor after detailing his comprehensive argument against tort reform.\nLuneau cited data from the Louisiana Department of Insurance that shows there are more than 100 auto insurance companies in Louisiana, countering arguments that more insurers are needed in the state to create competition. Overall, they received $5.9 billion in premiums and paid out $3.4 billion in claims and losses, the data shows.\nThe five largest auto insurers in the state \u2014 State Farm, Progressive, Geico, Allstate and GoAuto \u2014 control 70% of the market, according to state data Luneau shared.\n\u201cThis is a bad bill,\u201d Luneau said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take money away from people who are legitimately injured, and it\u2019s not going to reduce automobile insurance rates. And we\u2019ll be right back here again with people screaming about the next round of tort reform we need to do.\u201d\nReese\u2019s bill next heads to the House for consideration.\nRate history disclosure\nOnly one of the five proposals, House Bill 148, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Wiley, R-Maurepas, received bipartisan support. Republicans counted for all of the no votes in the 26-9 outcome.\nWiley\u2019s proposal would require homeowner and auto insurance companies to show customers what they paid previously for coverage when sending out renewal notices. It would let customers see whether their rates have changed before they decide to extend their policy.\nThe bill would also give the state insurance commissioner power to strike down any insurance rate increase considered \u201cexcessive\u201d or unreasonably high. Temple has lobbied against this provision, arguing it would allow him and other future insurance commissioners to approve or reject rates just for political reasons such as improving their reelection chances.\nSenate Republicans weakened the provision Wednesday when they inserted language into Wiley\u2019s bill that could let Temple approve excessively high rates as long as an insurer shows that they weren\u2019t chosen arbitrarily or randomly.\nGov. Landry\u2019s approach to lower insurance rates could cast his political fate\nAnother amendment to Wiley\u2019s bill allows the public to review documents insurance companies file with the state when seeking a rate increase, but only if the insurance commissioner determines the information shouldn\u2019t be kept confidential as a proprietary trade secret.\nThe measure will return to the House for a final vote on amendments before heading to the governor\u2019s desk.\nOther insurance legislation the Senate approved included:\nHouse Bill 450, by Rep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, would end the Housley presumption, a standard of evidence explained in a 1991 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that applies to auto accidents, medical malpractice and other injury lawsuits. In a nutshell, the Housley presumption says courts should assume a plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from the accident in question if they were in good health beforehand.\nThe bill received final approval in a 28-9 vote and awaits Gov. Landry\u2019s signature.\nHouse Bill 434, sponsored by Rep. Jason DeWitt, R-Alexandria, would limit bodily injury claims by plaintiffs who did not carry auto insurance at the time of the accident. It would forbid them from recovering as much as $100,000 worth of damages.\nThe bill received final approval in a 28-9 vote and has been sent to the governor.\nHouse Bill 431, sponsored by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, would change Louisiana\u2019s comparative fault statute, which assigns a percentage of blame to each party in an accident and allows for the recovery of damages in proportion with those percentages.\nProponents argue comparative fault allows someone to recover damages for injuries sustained in accidents for which they are mostly at fault. Opponents say it is the fairest way to assign liability.\nUnder current law, if a court finds one party in a lawsuit is 60% at fault for an accident and the other party is 40% at fault, they would each be liable for their respective share of the damages and could file claims against each other for the remaining amounts. Under Chenevert\u2019s bill, anyone who is 51% or more at fault for an accident would get nothing.\nThe bill passed in a 28-9 vote and will return to the House for changes made in the Senate.\nHouse Bill 436, by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, would prohibit \u201cunauthorized aliens\u201d \u2014 defined in the measure as individuals illegally in the United States under federal immigration law \u2014 who are injured in car accidents from receiving compensation for pain, suffering and lost income. The proposal would still allow recovery for property damages and medical expenses. Auto insurance companies could still sell policies to unauthorized immigrants.\nIt cleared the chamber in a 27-10 vote and will return to the House for a vote on Senate amendments.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Organizers disembarked from their buses, prepared their drums and signs and began marching towards the ICE detention center. The group was greeted by facility guards who kept them from setting foot on the property.\nNoor Abdalla, Khalid\u2019s wife, came out to the crowd to thank them for their demonstrations, saying that they are keeping Khalil going as he faces deportation. Abdalla had visited with Khalil on Thursday with their newborn son, Deen.

(Photo by Trevor Srednick/Getty Images)\nThe U.S. Senate voted early Thursday to prevent California from enforcing regulations on tailpipe emission from new cars and trucks, upending state regulations for the nearly 40% of Americans whose states follow California standards.\nThe House has already passed an identical measure, meaning the Senate vote sends the resolution to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk.\nThe 51-46 vote, with Michigan Democrat Elissa Slotkin joining all Republicans present to vote in favor, cleared a Congressional Review Act resolution repealing Environmental Protection Agency waivers that allow California to set regulations for emissions from cars and light-duty trucks.\nThe state policy includes a ramp-up to having no new gas-powered cars sold in the state by 2035.\nDemocrats blasted the near-party-line vote for contradicting the Senate parliamentarian, who\u2019d ruled the waiver that the EPA had granted to California to set its own tailpipe standards was not a regulation that could be rolled back under the Congressional Review Act, or CRA.\nThe CRA allows for a simple majority in the Senate to vote to repeal recent executive branch rules, bypassing the chamber\u2019s usual 60-vote threshold for legislation.\n\u2018Chaos and uncertainty\u2019 around the U.S.\nThe EPA under President Joe Biden issued waivers under a Clean Air Act provision that allows California, which had more stringent standards than what Congress enacted in the 1970 law, to set its own standards for air pollution.\nNo other state is allowed to set independent standards, but any state may adopt California\u2019s.\nFor the light-duty vehicle emissions rule, 17 other states \u2014 Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington \u2014 and the District of Columbia adopted some portion of the standard.\nThe action by the Senate, particularly because of the mechanism for revoking the waiver, made the future of the standards in all those states uncertain, Justin Balik, vice president for states at the national environmental advocacy group Evergreen Action, said in a Thursday interview.\n\u201cWhat, fundamentally, they\u2019re doing is sowing a huge amount of chaos and uncertainty in states around the country, not just in California,\u201d he said of the senators.\nSlotkin, who voted against procedural measures before her vote in favor of the resolution itself, said her vote was in defense of her state\u2019s automotive industry. Slotkin campaigned on a promise not to allow an electric vehicle mandate.\n\u201cToday, I voted to prevent California and the states that follow its standard from effectively banning gas-powered cars by 2035,\u201d she wrote in a statement. \u201cI have a special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.\u201d\nDebate over choice\nCritics said the state regulation was effectively an electric vehicle mandate that robbed consumers of the option to purchase the vehicle of their choice.\nBecause of California\u2019s market share \u2014 the state accounts for 11% of cars and trucks sold in the country, according to the California Air Resources Board \u2014 and adoption by other states, the Golden State standard had a virtually nationwide effect, they argued.\nRepublicans in the Senate focused on the 2035 deadline to end sales of new gas-powered vehicles, describing it as an electric vehicle mandate.\nIn a video posted to social media, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, John Barrasso of Wyoming, stood next to Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and touted the vote as a victory for consumer choice.\n\u201cRepublicans have defeated Democrats\u2019 delusional dream of forcing every American to drive an electric vehicle,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cThey wanted to force-feed the entire country things that don\u2019t necessarily work, not practical.\u201d\nBut proponents of the California standards said the Senate was removing choice from state policymakers, despite Republicans\u2019 longtime advocacy for state and local control.\nManish Bapna, the president of the advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the move in a statement that said senators undermined state power.\n\u201cThis vote is an unprecedented and reckless attack on states\u2019 legal authority to address the pollution causing asthma, lung disease and heart conditions,\u201d Bapna said. \u201cAfter a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign from Big Oil, Republicans readily jettisoned their long-held view that states can best enact measures that reflect the values and interests of their residents.\n\u201cIf other states don\u2019t like California\u2019s approach, they don\u2019t need to follow it,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cBut federal lawmakers shouldn\u2019t be intervening to block states from providing cleaner air and a healthier environment.\u201d\nProcedural fight\nRepublicans\u2019 use of the Congressional Review Act provoked a backlash from Democrats and environmental allies, who described it as \u201cgoing nuclear\u201d to tank the chamber\u2019s filibuster rule.\nThe Senate parliamentarian and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said the waiver could not be repealed with a CRA resolution, but Senate Republicans opted to use the procedure anyway.\n\u201cSenate Republicans exposed themselves as fair weather institutionalists. By overriding the parliamentarian \u2014 which the chair explicitly noted that the parliamentarian has been overridden \u2014 and in order to do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, Republicans have eroded away at the Senate foundation and undermined this institution they claim to care about,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said after a procedural vote late Wednesday.\nRepublicans defended the move, saying they were responding to an unprecedented case in the chamber. The question of how Senate rules applied to the waiver should be decided by senators themselves, Majority Leader John Thune said.\n\u201cI believe that when the Senate is facing a novel situation like this one, with disagreement among its members, it is appropriate for the Senate to speak as a body to the question \u2013 something the Senate does when questions over application of the rules arise,\u201d he said in a floor speech.\nThune, of South Dakota, noted that the Senate resolved a rules question with a floor vote just last year after a Democrat raised a point of order against a Republican\u2019s attempt to fast-track a measure.\n\u201cNobody at the time cried nuclear, nobody said the Democrat member was blowing up the Senate \u2013 in fact, most members probably don\u2019t even remember the situation, because it was just the Senate doing what the Senate is supposed to do, and that\u2019s voting on how to apply the rules when faced with a new situation.\u201d\nUncertainty abounds\nCritics of the move attacked the process, the policy and the precedent, saying the Senate undid a half-century of a California-federal government relationship regarding the Clean Air Act that had served all parties well.\nJohn Boesel, the president and CEO of clean transportation industry group CALSTART, called the Senate action radical.\n\u201cThis vote upends decades of policy that has successfully resulted in cleaner air and the growth of a robust clean transportation industry,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt is a brazen, yet futile, attempt to bring the clean transportation industry to a sudden halt. CALSTART will continue to partner with the states working to fill this gaping void left by today\u2019s federal action.\u201d\nAnd the unusual use of the Congressional Review Act will likely lead to lawsuits from California and at least some of the states that follow it to \u201cprotect their authority,\u201d Balik, of Evergreen Action, said.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s going to take some time to play out,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the meantime, the whole marketplace has been plunged into unnecessary chaos. Part of what the industry always says is, \u2018We need certainty.\u2019 And if anything, right now, we have the exact opposite thanks to what Congress is doing.\u201d\nLast updated 5:52 p.m., May. 22, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Make America Healthy Again commission, created earlier this year by President Donald Trump, released its first report Thursday, calling on the administration and lawmakers to improve the well-being of the country\u2019s children.\nThe 73-page report was published just after Trump and several Cabinet secretaries held an event highlighting their concerns with four areas \u2014 nutrition, physical activity, environmental factors and \u201covermedicalization.\u201d\n\u201cOver the next 80 days, the commission will build on its work in this report to develop a road map to bold and transformative public health reforms for our consideration,\u201d Trump said.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the report and the administration\u2019s approach to childhood health issues is that \u201cthere is no difference between good economic policy, good environmental policy and good public health policy and good industrial policy. We can have all of them.\u201d\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that everyone knows American farming interests need to be at the center of the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, agenda.\n\u201cWe have the most robust, the safest, the best agriculture system in the world,\u201d Rollins said.\nMainstream farm groups, however, were not happy. \u201cFarmers are identified as \u2018critical partners,\u2019 yet were excluded from development of the report, despite many requests for a seat at the table,\u201d American Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall wrote in a statement.\n\u2018Corporatization and consolidation\u2019 in food system\nThe numerous ways that American agriculture and the food people choose to eat have evolved received considerable attention in the report.\n\u201cOur agricultural system has historically focused on abundance and affordability. The progress we have made is largely thanks to the hard work of American farmers, ranchers, and food scientists,\u201d it states. \u201cHowever, the rise of (ultra processed food) has corresponded with a pattern of corporatization and consolidation in our food system. Today\u2019s diet-related chronic disease crisis, demand a closer examination of this pattern and its broader impact.\u201d\nThe report mentions pesticides numerous times, but doesn\u2019t call for them to be banned outright.\n\u201cSome studies have raised concerns about possible links between some of these products and adverse health outcomes, especially in children, but human studies are limited,\u201d the report says. \u201cFor example, a selection of research studies on a herbicide (glyphosate) have noted a range of possible health effects, ranging from reproductive and developmental disorders as well as cancers, liver inflammation and metabolic disturbances.\u201d\nKennedy testified during a U.S. Senate committee hearing earlier this week that based on drafts of the report he had seen, \u201cthere is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\u201d\nHis comments came during an exchange with Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who specifically asked him about glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, that she referred to as \u201cone of the most thoroughly studied products of its kind.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about more than 1,500 studies and 50-plus years of review by the EPA and other leading global health authorities that have affirmed its safety when used as directed,\u201d Hyde-Smith said. \u201cHave you been able to review thousands of studies and decades of scientific review in a matter of months?\u201d\nKennedy responded during that Tuesday hearing that her \u201cinformation about the report is just simply wrong.\u201d\nSleep, stress, social media\nThe report combines recommendations that have long been supported by research, like exercising regularly and eating a well-balanced diet, with proposals that aren\u2019t fully supported by science.\nIt notes that \u201cphysical activity, encompassing moderate-to-vigorous exercise, aerobic fitness, and reduced sedentary time, is critical for child health and well being.\n\u201cHowever, American youth have seen a steady decline in activity and cardiorespiratory fitness over decades, contributing to rising obesity, diabetes, mental health disorders, and cardiometabolic risks.\u201d\nThe report calls out children who are unable to get enough sleep and chronic stress as health challenges, in addition to the prevalence of social media.\n\u201cThe near-ubiquitous presence of social media in the lives of American adolescents, with up to 95% of teens regularly using at least one or more of these platforms\u2014is increasingly correlated with a concerning rise in mental health challenges, particularly among younger users,\u201d the report says. \u201cWith the vast majority of teenagers engaging with these platforms, understanding the nuanced consequences and mental health impacts of social media on their developing well-being is of critical public health importance.\u201d\nNo mention of gun violence\nThe report didn\u2019t include any mention of gun violence, a leading cause of death in American children and teenagers, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, analysis from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF and a report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.\n\u201cThe United States has by far the highest rate of child and teen firearm mortality among peer nations. In no other similarly large, wealthy country are firearms in the top four causes of death for children and teens, let alone the number one cause,\u201d KFF\u2019s analysis states. \u201cU.S. states with the most gun laws have lower rates of child and teen firearm deaths than states with few gun laws. But, even states with the lowest child and teen firearm deaths have rates much higher than what peer countries experience.\u201d\nThe Johns Hopkins report notes that the gun death rate in children between the ages of 1 and 17 has \u201cincreased by 106 percent since 2013 and (has) been the leading cause of death among this group since 2020.\u201d\nIn 2022, there were 2,526 gun deaths in that age range, for an average of seven a day, according to the report.\nThe KFF analysis shows other leading causes of childhood death include motor vehicles, cancer, suffocation, congenital anomalies, poisoning and drowning.\nFarm Bureau, Corn Growers critical\nFarm groups were dubious about the report\u2019s conclusions.\nThe American Farm Bureau\u2019s Duvall said it was \u201cdeeply troubling for the White House to endorse a report that sows seeds of doubt and fear about our food system and farming practices, then attempts to celebrate farmers and the critical role they play in producing the safest food supply in the world.\u201d\n\u201cThe report also expresses a desire to ensure farmers continue to thrive, but undermining confidence in our food system directly contradicts that noble goal,\u201d said Duvall. \u201cThe report spotlights outlier studies and presents unproven theories that feed a false narrative and only then does it acknowledge a mountain of evidence about the safety of our food system.\u201d\nIowa Corn Growers Association Chair Jolene Riessen said the \u201cmisinformation surrounding crop protection tools is incredibly upsetting because if there\u2019s one thing all farmers have in common, it\u2019s that we care about raising safe, healthy, and affordable food that nourishes families around the world.\n\u201cAgriculture is a science, and we have spent years testing and researching pesticides, like glyphosate, to reaffirm that they are a safe and vital tool farmers rely on to feed and fuel the world.\u201d\nOthers said the report was lacking. Lori Ann Burd, the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s environmental health director, wrote in a statement the \u201creport\u2019s acknowledgement of pesticides\u2019 risks to our children\u2019s health is a small step forward,\u201d before rebuking Trump administration officials for not going further.\n\u201cThe grassroots movement of millions of Americans who trusted Trump with their votes won\u2019t forget that RFK Jr. was cowed by the powerful industrial farming forces determined to make sure there are no U.S. restrictions on harmful pesticides like atrazine, which is banned in 60 nations,\u201d Burd wrote. \u201cInstead of protecting our kids, we use over 70 million pounds of atrazine each year on the corn and sugarcane crops that are making Americans sick. The fight to ban atrazine will continue.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Department of Education must temporarily reinstate the hundreds of employees laid off earlier this year and cannot follow through on an executive order from President Donald Trump seeking to dismantle the agency, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled Thursday.\nThe ruling stems from a pair of March lawsuits \u2014 one from a slew of Democratic attorneys general, another from a coalition of advocacy and labor groups \u2014 and blocks three Trump initiatives, marking a major blow to the president\u2019s education agenda as his administration seeks to dramatically reshape the federal role in education.\nThe lawsuits challenge some of the administration\u2019s most consequential education initiatives so far: a reduction in force effort at the agency that gutted more than 1,300 employees, Trump\u2019s executive order calling on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department and Trump\u2019s proposal to rehouse the student loan portfolio in the Small Business Administration and special education services in the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\u201cA department without enough employees to perform statutorily mandated functions is not a department at all,\u201d U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun wrote in his 88-page memorandum and order granting a preliminary injunction.\n\u201cThis court cannot be asked to cover its eyes while the Department\u2019s employees are continuously fired and units are transferred out until the Department becomes a shell of itself,\u201d wrote Joun, whom former President Joe Biden appointed.\nJoun\u2019s preliminary injunction took effect immediately and will remain until the merits of the consolidated case are decided.\nA department spokesperson said the administration would immediately appeal the ruling. The agency has since filed an appeal.\nWin for Democratic states\nOne of the cases comes from a coalition of Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.\nThe other lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts.\nThe department\u2019s reduction in force plan prompted concerns from education advocates and leaders over how the agency would be able to carry out its core responsibilities after roughly halving its workforce, including major cuts to key units including the Office of Federal Student Aid, Office for Civil Rights and the Institute of Education Sciences.\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest teachers unions in the country, celebrated the ruling in a Thursday statement.\n\u201cToday, the court rightly rejected one of the administration\u2019s very first illegal, and consequential, acts: abolishing the federal role in education,\u201d Weingarten said.\n\u201cThis decision is a first step to reverse this war on knowledge and the undermining of broad-based opportunity. For America to build a brighter future, we must all take more responsibility, not less, for the success of our children.\u201d\nJoun\u2019s order also bars the agency from carrying out the president\u2019s directive to transfer the student loan portfolio and special education services out of the agency.\nTrump announced the proposal, which had no accompanying executive order, at the opening of an Oval Office appearance with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The department had told States Newsroom earlier this week that it had nothing new to share at this time regarding the proposed transfer.\nJudge \u2018dramatically overstepped\u2019\nMadi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, said the agency \u201cwill immediately challenge this on an emergency basis.\u201d\n\u201cOnce again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people,\u201d she said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.\n\u201cPresident Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind. This ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s ruling came just a day after McMahon took a grilling from U.S. House Democrats over the drastic cuts and proposed changes at her department during a hearing in a panel of the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations.\nMcMahon appeared before the lawmakers to outline Trump\u2019s fiscal year 2026 budget request, which calls for $12 billion in spending cuts at the department.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)\nThis report has been updated.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. House early Thursday approved the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that Republican leaders spent months negotiating with centrists and far-right members of the party \u2014 two distinct factions that hold vastly different policy goals \u2014 over intense opposition from Democrats.\nThe 215-214 vote ships the package to the Senate, where GOP lawmakers are expected to rewrite much of it, before sending it back across the Capitol for final approval, a process likely to stretch through the summer.\nPresident Donald Trump, who said he backed the House version, would then need to sign the legislation, which under the complicated process being used by Republicans can pass with just a majority vote in the GOP-controlled Senate.\nTrump called on the Senate to pass the legislation as quickly as possible, writing in a social media post that \u201c(t)here is no time to waste\u201d and that the bill is \u201carguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!\u201d\nSpeaker Mike Johnson said minutes before the vote that he expects lawmakers to give the measure final approval before the Fourth of July.\n\u201cNow, look, we\u2019re accomplishing a big thing here today, but we know this isn\u2019t the end of the road just yet,\u201d Johnson, R-La., said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working closely with Leader (John) Thune and our Senate colleagues, the Senate Republicans, to get this done and delivered to the president\u2019s desk by our Independence Day. That\u2019s July 4. Today proves that we can do that, and we will do that.\u201d\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., argued against the legislation, saying it \u201cundermines reproductive freedom, undermines the progress that we have made in combating the climate crisis, undermines gun safety, undermines the rule of law and the independence of the federal judiciary. It even undermines the ability of hard-working and law-abiding immigrant families to provide remittances to their loved ones, who may just happen to live abroad.\u201d\nJeffries raised concerns with how the proposals in the bill would impact the economy and the federal government\u2019s financial stability.\n\u201cCosts aren\u2019t going down. They\u2019re going up. Inflation is out of control. Insurance rates remain stubbornly high,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cOur Moody\u2019s rating, our credit rating, has been downgraded, and you\u2019ve got people losing confidence in this economy. Republicans are crashing this economy in real time and driving us toward a recession.\u201d\nOhio\u2019s Warren Davidson and Kentucky\u2019s Thomas Massie were the only Republicans to vote against passing the bill, which members debated throughout the night prior to the vote just after daylight in the nation\u2019s capital. All Democrats, who dubbed it \u201cone big ugly bill,\u201d were opposed. Maryland GOP Rep. Andy Harris, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, voted \u201cpresent.\u201d\nMassie spoke against the bill overnight, calling it \u201ca debt bomb ticking.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d love to stand here and tell the American people: We can cut your taxes and we can increase spending, and everything\u2019s going to be just fine. But I can\u2019t do that because I\u2019m here to deliver a dose of reality,\u201d Massie said. \u201cThis bill dramatically increases deficits in the near term, but promises our government will be fiscally responsible five years from now. Where have we heard that before? How do you bind a future Congress to these promises?\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing later in the day that Trump wants Davidson and Massie to face primary challenges next year during the midterm elections.\n\u201cI believe he does,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think he likes to see grandstanders in Congress.\u201d\nIn the works for weeks\nThe 1,116-page package combines 11 bills that GOP lawmakers debated and reported out of committee during the last several weeks.\nThe legislation would:\n- Extend the 2017 tax law, including tax cuts for businesses and individuals;\n- Bolster spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars;\n- Rework energy permitting;\n- Restructure higher education aid such as student loans and Pell Grants;\n- Shift some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program food aid program for low-income Americans to state governments; and\n- Overhaul Medicaid, the nation\u2019s program for health care for low-income people and some people with disabilities.\nThe bill would make deep cuts to Medicaid spending, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years under the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe budget measure would also raise the debt limit by $4 trillion.\nA new Congressional Budget Office analysis released late Tuesday showed the package tilted toward the wealthy, projecting it would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners.\nRepublicans hold especially thin majorities in the House and Senate, meaning that nearly every GOP lawmaker \u2014 ranging from centrists who barely won their general elections to far-right members who are more at risk of losing a primary challenge \u2014 needed to support the bill.\nBalancing the demands of hundreds of lawmakers led to nearly constant talks during the last few days as Johnson struggled to secure the votes to pass the bill before his Memorial Day deadline.\nAny deal Johnson made with far-right members of the party risked alienating centrist GOP lawmakers and vice versa.\nAn agreement finally came together Wednesday evening when GOP leaders released a 42-page amendment that made changes to various sections of the package, including the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, and Medicaid work requirements and nixed the potential sale of some public lands.\nTax cuts\nHouse debate on the package fell largely along party lines, with Democrats contending it would benefit the wealthy at the expense of lower-income Americans, including millions who would lose access to Medicaid.\nRepublicans argued the legislation is necessary to avoid a tax hike at the end of the year, when the 2017 GOP law expires, and to curb government spending in the years ahead.\nWays and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., said the tax section of the package would halt a tax increase for many that would have taken place after the vast majority of the provisions in that law expire at the end of this year.\n\u201cWorking families, farmers and small businesses win with this bill,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe expand and make permanent the small business deduction and increase the child tax credit, the standard deduction and the death tax exemption.\u201d\nThe legislation would increase the tax rate for colleges and universities with substantial endowments, which would match the corporate tax rate, he said.\nMassachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, ranking member on that tax-writing committee, said the legislation would lead the United States to \u201cborrow $4 trillion and with interest payments over the next 10 years, $5 trillion, to justify a tax cut for the billionaire class.\u201d\nNeal said that the wealthy would see a greater benefit from the GOP tax provisions than working-class Americans.\n\u201cIf you made a million dollars last year, you\u2019re going to get $81,000 of tax relief. If you made less than $50,000 Guess what? Not quite so lucky,\u201d Neal said. \u201cBut you know what? $1 a day goes a long way, because that\u2019s where the numbers land.\u201d\nNeal said Democrats would have worked with Republicans to extend the 2017 tax cuts if the GOP had capped them for those making less than $400,000 a year, with people making more than that going back to the higher rate.\nChild tax credit\nThe child tax credit will increase to $2,500, up from the $2,000 enacted under the 2017 tax law. The refundability portion of the credit, or the amount parents could receive in a refund check after paying their tax liability, will remain capped but will increase with inflation by $100 annually. As of now, the amount a parent could receive back per child stands at $1,700.\nWhile Republicans hailed the increase as a win for families, critics say it continues to leave out the poorest families as the refund amount is dependent on how much a parent earns. The credit phases in at 15 cents per income dollar, one child at a time.\n\u201cThe Republican bill will leave out 17 million American children who are in families that don\u2019t earn enough to receive the full child tax credit,\u201d Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington said Wednesday in the House Committee on Rules. Her amendment to make the tax credit fully refundable was rejected.\nOn the House floor Thursday morning, DelBene criticized the bill as a \u201cbig, broken promise.\u201d\nSALT\nRepublicans from high-tax blue states declared victory on the increase in the SALT cap, or the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted from federal taxable income. After long, drawn-out disagreement, Republicans representing districts in California, New Jersey and New York secured a bump to $40,000, up from the $10,000 cap enacted under Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law.\nHowever, the cap comes with an income limit of $500,000, after which it phases down. Both the $40,000 cap and the $500,000 income threshold will increase annually at 1% until hitting a ceiling of $44,000 and $552,000.\nRep. Mike Lawler of New York said during debate that he \u201cwould never support a tax bill that did not adequately lift the cap on SALT.\u201d\n\u201cThis bill does that. It increases the cap on SALT by 300%,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cAnd I would remind my Democratic colleagues, when they had full control in Washington, they lifted the cap on SALT by exactly $0, zilch, zip, nada.\u201d\nMedicaid work requirements\nEnergy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., said his panel\u2019s bill would ensure Medicaid coverage continued for low-income families, individuals who are disabled and seniors through new work requirements and other changes.\n\u201cThis bill protects coverage for those individuals by ensuring ineligible recipients do not cut the line in front of our most vulnerable Americans,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cThe decision by left-leaning state governments to spend taxpayer dollars on people who are ineligible for the program is indefensible. Medicaid should not cover illegal immigrants, deceased or duplicative beneficiaries, or able-bodied adults without dependents who choose not to work.\u201d\nThe policy change would require those who rely on the state-federal health program, and who are between the ages of 19 and 65, to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month.\nThe language has numerous exceptions, including for pregnant people, parents of dependent children, people who have complex medical conditions, tribal community members, those in the foster care system, people who were in foster care who are below the age of 26 and individuals released from incarceration in the last 90 days, among others.\nNew Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, ranking member on the committee that oversees major health care programs, said the Republican bill would not only cut funding for Medicaid, but also for Medicare, the program relied on by seniors and some younger people with disabilities.\n\u201cRepublicans are stripping health care away from people by putting all sorts of burdensome and time-consuming road blocks in the way of people just trying to get by,\u201d Pallone said. \u201cThe vast majority of people on Medicaid are already working. This is not about work. It\u2019s about burying people in so much paperwork that they fall behind and lose their health coverage, and if someone loses their health coverage through Medicaid, this GOP tax scam also bans them from getting coverage through the ACA marketplace.\u201d\nWhile the GOP bill doesn\u2019t directly address Medicare, he said, a federal budget law, known as the Pay-As-You-Go Act, would force spending cuts called sequestration to that health program.\n\u201cThe Medicare cuts will lead to reduced access to care for seniors, longer wait times for appointments, and increased costs,\u201d Pallone said.\nStates to share in food aid costs\nHouse Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn \u201cGT\u201d Thompson, R-Pa., pressed for support for his piece of the legislation, saying changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are needed.\n\u201cSNAP is the only state-administered welfare program that does not have a cost-share component, and while the federal government funds 100% of the benefit, states are tasked with operating it,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe only problem: They aren\u2019t operating it well.\u201d\nHe also cheered several of the package\u2019s tax provisions, saying they would benefit farmers.\n\u201cThe one big, beautiful bill makes permanent and expands the Trump tax cuts. It also prevents the death tax from hitting over 2 million family farms,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt locks in the small business deduction, helping 98% of American farms stay afloat.\u201d\nMinnesota Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, ranking member on the panel, wrote in a statement that the proposed changes would \u201cmake America hungrier, poorer and sicker.\u201d\n\u201cAt a time when grocery prices are going up and retirement accounts are going down, we must protect the basic needs programs that help people afford food and health care,\u201d Craig wrote. \u201cAs a mother and someone who needed food assistance at periods in my own childhood, I condemn this attempt to snatch food off our children\u2019s plates to fund tax breaks for large corporations.\u201d\nBorder security, air traffic control, EV fees\nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Sam Graves, R-Mo., said his piece of the package would combine \u201ccritical investments in border security, national defense and modernization of America\u2019s air traffic control system, while eliminating wasteful spending and other deficit reduction measures.\u201d\n\u201cSpecifically, this bill addresses long overdue needs in the United States Coast Guard, which for over two decades has received less than half of the capital investment necessary to effectively carry out its critical missions,\u201d Graves said.\nThe transportation section of the package, he said, includes $21 billion for the Coast Guard and $12.5 billion to modernize the air traffic control systems while establishing a $250 annual fee for electric vehicles and a $100 annual fee for hybrid vehicles that would go toward the Highway Trust Fund. That account has traditionally been funded through a gas tax.\nWashington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, ranking member on the transportation panel, said he wanted \u201cto continue historic funding for transportation, infrastructure, and stronger and healthier communities.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, this reconciliation package leaves very little room for those investments,\u201d Larsen said.\n\u201cThis bill causes immediate harm by yanking money from locally selected projects that our constituents in Republican and Democratic districts alike are counting on,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd for what? To help pay for the tax cuts for the richest Americans and largest and largest corporations.\u201d\nStudent loan overhaul, medical research\nHouse Education and Workforce Committee ranking member Bobby Scott, D-Va., urged opposition to what he called the \u201cbig, bad billionaires bill,\u201d saying it would lead to a massive reshaping of higher education aid.\n\u201cThe bill not only can increase the deficit, it has 4 million students who will lose their Pell Grants, 18 million children could potentially lose their free school lunch, 13.7 million people are set to lose their health care and everybody loses when the National Institutes of Health research is cut,\u201d Scott said.\nNatural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., said his portion of the legislation would \u201cgenerate over $20 billion in savings and new revenue for the federal government, primarily by direct royalty and lease fees from the sale of oil, gas, timber and mine resources, while curbing wasteful spending.\u201d\n\u201cOur title reinstates onshore and offshore oil and gas lease sales, holds annual geothermal lease sales and ensures a fair process for critical mineral development nationwide,\u201d Westerman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also directed the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to utilize long-term timber sale contracts.\u201d\nThe Trump administration released a Statement of Administration Policy on Wednesday urging GOP lawmakers to approve the legislation, when it still appeared several members of the party might delay or even block the bill in the House.\n\u201cThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration,\u201d the SAP states. \u201cTherefore, the House of Representatives should immediately pass this bill to show the American people that they are serious about \u2018promises made, promises kept.\u2019\n\u201cPresident Trump is committed to keeping his promises, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\u201d\nLast updated 12:44 p.m., May. 22, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Summary": "The federal judge overseeing the case of a Columbia University student activist held at a Louisiana immigration detention center has deferred to the private prison company managing the facility in determining certain rules for her court.\u00a0 The questioned standards come into play as Mahmoud Khalil faces his next court hearing Thursday morning at the LaSalle [&#8230;]",
        "Content": "20:39\nNews Story\nLouisiana immigration judge defers to ICE center operator on court rules\nThe GEO Group has denied Mahmoud Khalil from having contact with his newborn son, although ICE rules allow it.\nSupporters of Mahmoud Khalil rally outside the federal courthouse in Newark, N.J., on March 28, 2025. (Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)\nThe federal judge overseeing the case of a Columbia University student activist held at a Louisiana immigration detention center has deferred to the private prison company managing the facility in determining certain rules for her court.\nThe questioned standards come into play as Mahmoud Khalil faces his next court hearing Thursday morning at the LaSalle Detention Center in Jena, when his attorneys say they\u2019ll file a motion to throw out the case against him for \u201cegregious government misconduct,\u201d namely that Khalil was arrested without a warrant. They\u2019ll also argue that Khalil is at risk of harm by Israel \u201canywhere in the world\u201d and thus cannot be removed to Syria or Algeria.\nThe hearing is the first since one of Khalil\u2019s attorneys, Nora Ahmed with the American Civil Liberties Union, was prevented from bringing her laptop computer into the courtroom on the grounds of the LaSalle Detention Center for an April 11 hearing. Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans said Khalil\u2019s attorneys must abide by policies set by the facility\u2019s operator, the GEO Group. Ahmed was prevented from having her electronics with her, despite attorneys for the federal government being allowed to have their computers.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nComans\u2019 ruling gives the Trump administration an unfair advantage in the case, Ahmed said in an interview with the Illuminator.\n\u201cIt facially goes to show how biased the hearing was from the get-go \u2013 that this attorney was denied all of the access to electronics that the government\u201d had, Ahmed said.\nKhalil has been held at the Lasalle Detention Center since March 8, when federal authorities took him from his Columbia University apartment building in New York City. Although he\u2019s a legal U.S. resident, ICE officials said they had a warrant to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. He\u2019s the first person President Donald Trump sought to deport from the U.S. for his involvement in pro-Palestinian campus protests.\nMotion sought formal order\nOver two months after being taken into federal custody, Khalil has yet to be charged with a crime. At his April 11 hearing, Comans ruled him deportable in light of a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating that Khalil\u2019s activities at Columbia could have \u201cadverse foreign policy consequences.\u201d\nAccording to a motion filed April 28, Ahmed was prevented from bringing her laptop and phone into that hearing, despite DOJ policy explicitly allowing counsel to have electronics. Ahmed said she had already been given permission to take her electronics inside by the ICE facility\u2019s warden, GEO Group employee Shad Rice. GEO Group personnel handle security for the facility, including the secured area between the facility\u2019s entrance and the courtroom doors.\nUnable to bring her computer into the courtroom, Ahmed worked with a notebook and pen instead.\nJudge Comans\u2019 refusal to let Ahmed retrieve her computer is in direct violation of the Department of Justice\u2019s policy, according to the April 29 motion. The policy states that attorneys \u201cin proceedings before [Executive Office for Immigration Review] will be permitted to use electronic devices in EOIR courtrooms.\u201d\nAfter the hearing, according to the motion, Rice told Ahmed that \u201cthe Judge appeared to contradict herself\u201d by blaming him and the GEO Group for Ahmed not being allowed to bring her laptop into the courtroom.\nJason Burke, administrator for the LaSalle Immigration Court, told the Illuminator that Justice Department rules do indeed allow Ahmed to bring her laptop to court proceedings, \u201cbut they got to get to EOIR space first. which we don\u2019t control when we\u2019re in a detention center.\u201d\nThe GEO Group declined to answer questions regarding the matter.\nIn light of the confusion on April 11, the April 28 motion asked the court to ensure that Khalil\u2019s counsel at upcoming hearings could bring their electronics into chambers.\nComans ruled May 9 that the motion was moot, writing that \u201cshould an attorney elect to appear in person, they are subject to the detention facility\u2019s rules.\u201d\nHomero L\u00f3pez, director of Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy in New Orleans, was startled when he learned of the judge\u2019s order, which he described as \u201cbulls\u2013t.\u201d L\u00f3pez previously had a similar issue in 2022 at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in the Acadia Parish town of Basile. It was resolved when ICE Field Office Director Melissa Harper \u201cclarified with Basile management that laptops will be permitted,\u201d per emails L\u00f3pez provided to Illuminator.\nL\u00f3pez said it was particularly surprising to have that issue at the Jena center, where, unlike other Louisiana ICE centers, the detention area and courtroom have separate entrances.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had to once ask anybody for additional permission to bring electronics into court\u201d at Jena, nor has any other attorney he knows, L\u00f3pez said. Comans should have directed ICE to get GEO Group to abide by federal policy \u2013 not defer to the company \u2013 he added.\nThe judge\u2019s failure to do so \u201cis another way to discourage people from taking on cases at that facility,\u201d L\u00f3pez said.\nUnequal footing for ICE detainees\nKhalil\u2019s lawyers argue that the unequal access highlights a lack of transparency around immigration proceedings, and the hurdles the GEO Group and the federal justice present that affect a detainee\u2019s legal proceedings. In a briefing for reporters Wednesday, co-counsel Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at City University of New York, described Comans as \u201can immigration judge who\u2019s not an independent judge, who\u2019s really a DOJ functionary.\u201d\nKhalil\u2019s counsel decried this lack of transparency in a second motion, also filed April 28. The motion requested that, due to enormous public interest in Khalil\u2019s case, Comans allow virtual or telephonic access for her proceedings.\nDuring the April 11 hearing, Ahmed had asked permission to read out a statement about public access \u2013 a request Comans refused.\nAhmed\u2019s quashed statement was a plea for Comans to ensure broader access to the hearing, noting that \u201cwhat transpires today \u2013 determining who is allowed to stay on American soil and who must leave it \u2013 will have reverberations for years to come. As such, we ask this court to accommodate those intent on observing these proceedings.\u201d\nInstead, GEO Group security allowed less than two dozen people to enter the facility, leaving supporters and members of the news media to wait outside, some of whom had traveled from as far as New York.\nZach Kopkin, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace in New Orleans, was among those denied access. He told Illuminator that it \u201cfelt really important that Jewish folks be in that room\u201d and \u201cthat we fight back with the truth, which is that a ton of Jews are also critical of the Israeli government\u2019s war crimes and genocide.\u201d\nComans also called the second motion moot, noting simply that \u201cimmigration hearings are generally open to the public, although certain exceptions apply.\u201d Khalil\u2019s team still has an outstanding request to the judge for an overflow room.\nKhalil hopes to hold month-old son\nNew allegations against the GEO Group of violating federal policy in Khalil\u2019s case were levied Wednesday. The LaSalle facility has refused to allow Khalil to hold his newborn son, who was born while he\u2019s been in federal custody, citing \u201csecurity concerns.\u201d This comes despite ICE directives and federal policies which explicitly encourage contact between detained parents and children.\nKhalil filed a request Wednesday with a federal court to order ICE to allow him a contact visit with his month-old son by the end of the day. The federal court accepted the argument and Khalil\u2019s counsel say they\u2019re working out details of the visit. Khalil\u2019s wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, traveled over 1,000 miles with their child so Khalil could hold him for the first time.\nAccording to emails within the filing, the GEO Group\u2019s facility administrator said its procedures allow for \u201cnon-contact\u201d visits only through a secure window.\nICE policy notes that contact visits \u201cmay be facilitated at all ICE detention facilities.\u201d\nKhalil\u2019s lawyers argue the GEO Group\u2019s refusal of contact is part of the \u201cpunitive\u201d nature of his detention and transfer from its New Jersey facility, where family contact visits are provided daily and parents are allowed to hold their children.\nJudge Comans will also decide whether Dr. Abdalla is permitted to hold their infant while attending proceedings Thursday.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Screenshot from committee livestream)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon took heat from U.S. House Democrats on Wednesday over the drastic cuts and proposed changes at her federal agency in the months since President Donald Trump took office.\nDemocrats on a panel within the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations expressed dissatisfaction with McMahon\u2019s education initiatives so far, as well as Trump\u2019s fiscal year 2026 budget request released earlier this month. The request calls for $12 billion in spending cuts at the department.\nMcMahon appeared before the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies to outline the budget request as part of the panel\u2019s work to write the bill to fund the department for the coming fiscal year.\nMcMahon told the panel that the department aims to \u201cshrink federal bureaucracy, save taxpayer money and empower states \u2014 who best know their local needs \u2014 to manage education in this country.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reduced a department that was overstaffed by thousands of positions, cut old contracts that were enriching private parties at taxpayer expense, suspended grants for illegal (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs and now are putting forward a budget request that reduces department funding by more than 15%,\u201d she said.\nTrump and his administration have sought to dramatically reshape the federal role in education, including an executive order calling on McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department, the gutting of more than 1,300 employees at the agency, threats to revoke funds for schools that use DEI practices and a crackdown on \u201cwoke\u201d higher education.\n\u2018Disdain for public education\u2019\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the full panel and the subcommittee, called McMahon\u2019s actions at the department \u201clawless,\u201d adding that they \u201creek of disdain for public education\u201d and are \u201churting the most vulnerable in our nation.\u201d\n\u201cUnder your leadership of the department, hundreds of millions of dollars have been frozen, and entire programs have been terminated,\u201d the Connecticut Democrat said. \u201cFunding for vital research, protection of students\u2019 civil rights and programs that support the recruitment and professional development of effective educators have been terminated.\u201d\nDeLauro also lambasted the budget\u2019s proposal to consolidate 18 grant programs for K-12 education and replace them with a $2 billion formula grant that would give states spending flexibility.\nA White House document summarizing major changes in the budget request said the consolidation would cut spending by more than $4.5 billion, a point DeLauro emphasized.\n\u201cYet at the same time, you propose that we provide $4.5 billion less to educate our nation\u2019s children overall,\u201d she said. \u201cA block grant is a cut \u2014 all of my colleagues here know that the states cannot afford to pick up the slack.\u201d\nIn another exchange in the lengthy hearing, McMahon pushed back against New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman\u2019s assertion that the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights is \u201cbeing decimated.\u201d The unit has seen significant staffing cuts as part of the department\u2019s reduction in force effort along with the closure of several regional offices.\n\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t being decimated,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cWe have reduced the size of it, however, we are taking on a backlog of cases that were left over from the Biden administration and we\u2019re working through those.\u201d\nWatson Coleman proceeded to press McMahon on why the department would reduce its resources if the agency has a backlog in addition to confronting cases that will come before it now.\n\u201cBecause we are working more efficiently in the department,\u201d McMahon replied.\nPrioritizing school choice\nMeanwhile, Republicans focused largely on school choice initiatives and how McMahon and the department are prioritizing those efforts.\nThe term \u201cschool choice\u201d applies to alternative programs to a student\u2019s assigned public school. Proponents say school choice programs are necessary for parents dissatisfied with their local public schools, though critics argue these efforts drain critical funds from school districts.\nRep. Robert Aderholt, chair of the subcommittee, said \u201ctoo many schools, encouraged and facilitated by federal funding, have let things like social justice advocacy and divisive issues crowd out the focus on teaching students and the core subjects.\u201d\n\u201cThankfully, some states have pursued choice options for students whose traditional public schools have not served them well, including through charter schools,\u201d the Alabama Republican said.\nMcMahon said increasing school choice was one of her priorities as secretary and highlighted the budget\u2019s proposed increase of $60 million to expand the number of charter schools in the country, according to the budget request.\n\u201cThe president absolutely believes, as do I, that the more choice that parents have, the better off the students are, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly in different states,\u201d she said.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by David Ryder/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge in Boston Wednesday found the Trump administration violated his preliminary injunction barring third-country removals of migrants without due process, after immigration lawyers say their clients were placed on deportation flights to South Sudan.\n\u201cIt was impossible for these people to have a meaningful opportunity to object to their transfer to South Sudan,\u201d U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy said. \u201cThe government\u2019s actions in this case are unquestionably violative of this court\u2019s order.\u201d\nMurphy said he will narrowly tailor a remedy to the violation of his April order. He said the Trump administration must give proper due process to the eight men who were placed on deportation flights on Tuesday and given less than 24 hours to challenge their removal to South Sudan.\nSouth Sudan, in East Africa, is violence-ridden and the U.S. State Department advises against travel there.\nDepartment of Justice attorneys would not confirm where the plane landed, but according to flight tracking data reviewed by the New York Times, there is a chartered plane owned by a company used in the past for deportations that has landed in the East African nation of Djibouti.\nMurphy did not detail what contempt charges would look like, but asked Department of Justice attorneys for a list of names of people involved in the flights for potential consequences.\nThe hearing in Massachusetts is one of several clashes between the Trump administration and the judiciary branch over the issue of due process in immigration enforcement, as the Trump administration aims to enact mass deportations.\nThe White House in a statement attacked Murphy as a \u201cfar-left activist judge\u201d trying to protect migrants with criminal convictions. The list of individuals the White House said were on the flight were from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma and Vietnam.\nFlight originated in Texas\nAn hour before Wednesday\u2019s hearing, top Department of Homeland Security officials at a press conference defended the decision, but declined to confirm if the migrants were sent to South Sudan and argued the country was not their \u201cfinal destination.\u201d\nHowever, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons said that South Sudan had agreed to take the men.\n\u201cWe conducted a deportation flight from Texas to remove some of the most barbaric violent individuals illegally in the United States,\u201d DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said at the press event.\nMcLaughlin said that the men were still in DHS custody.\nMurphy, appointed by former President Joe Biden, has not ordered the Trump administration to return any of the men. At the hearing, he did question a top ICE official in Texas, Marcos Charles, and directed him to find out if it were possible to hold credible fear interviews for the men instead of requiring they be returned to the U.S.\nImmigration attorneys who last night had asked for the emergency hearing pushed for the immigrants to be brought back to the U.S.\nDOJ attorney Drew Ensign disagreed and said that any remedy from Murphy should be narrowly tailored and that ordering the men to be returned would be \u201ctoo broad.\u201d\nEnsign also said the Trump administration\u2019s position is that 24 hours is enough time for an immigrant to challenge their removal to a country that is not their home.\nTrina Realmuto, of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, argued 30 days is preferable, because many of those removed do not have legal representation and need time to find an attorney and determine if they could face possible harm in another country.\nMurphy said that he would clarify how much time is appropriate. He directed DOJ attorneys to make sure that everyone involved in third-country removals, from pilots to immigration officers, to be aware of his order and the possible criminal contempt charges if it\u2019s not followed.\nOn late Tuesday, in an emergency hearing, Murphy ordered the government to keep the eight migrants in DHS custody until more details could be revealed in Wednesday\u2019s hearing to determine if his April order was violated.\nIn that earlier order, Murphy barred the Trump administration from removing individuals from a country that is not their home country without giving them time to raise any concerns that they might face harm in the country they would be removed to.\nRepeated conflicts between administration and judges\nSending migrants to South Sudan would bring the same concerns as sending them to Libya, another third country with a history of clashes.\nThe Trump administration extended Temporary Protection Status to nationals of South Sudan for six months to remain in the U.S., meaning those immigrants were granted work permits and deportation protections because their home country was deemed too dangerous to return to.\nIn early May, Murphy warned Trump officials that any deportations to a third country such as Libya and Saudi Arabia \u2014 countries with human rights violations that the Trump administration was considering for deportations \u2014 would have clearly violated his April preliminary injunction.\nIt\u2019s not the first conflict between federal judges and the Trump administration.\nA federal judge in Maryland grilled Department of Justice lawyers and accused the administration of stonewalling information on its efforts to return a wrongly deported man from El Salvador. Another federal judge in Maryland ordered the return of a separate wrongly deported man to an El Salvador prison, an order that the DOJ is currently appealing.\nA federal judge in the District of Columbia ordered the administration to return deportation planes to the U.S. carrying men removed under the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798, but the planes landed in El Salvador to take the migrants to the notorious prison CECOT. The judge threatened possible contempt against the Trump administration.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Friday again rejected a request from the Trump administration to remove its block on using the Alien Enemies Act over concerns about due process.\nThe Trump administration in March invoked the Alien Enemies Act to apply to Venezuelans 14 and older with suspected gang ties to rapidly deport them, raising concerns about a lack of due process.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Jerome Zeringue, R-Houma, and Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, in the Louisiana House of Representative, Feb. 2, 2022. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)\nLegislation to convert Louisiana\u2019s insurance commissioner from an elected office into an appointed one stalled on the state Senate floor Tuesday when the author of the proposal realized it was likely to fail.\nSenate Bill 214 would have let the next governor, subject to Senate approval, appoint the state\u2019s next insurance commissioner to a six-year term, with a limit of two terms. Under current law, the commissioner is chosen every four years through the same statewide election when voters select a governor. It is one of only two statewide elected offices that can be changed into an appointed position without a constitutional amendment though still requires two-thirds support from lawmakers. The other is the commissioner of agriculture.\nThe proposal would have allowed current Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple to run for re-election before the move to an appointed office holder.\nJust a week ago, the bill cleared the Senate Committee on Insurance with unanimous support. On Tuesday, however, its author, Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, pulled the bill as opposition mounted from certain Republicans. In an interview, he said he started counting votes and decided it might be better to replace his bill with a resolution that would create a task force to study the issue.\n\u201cIt was never a bill that I thought would have unanimous support,\u201d Duplessis said. \u201cSome people want the status quo \u2026 I just don\u2019t think I had the numbers. It would have been close.\u201d\nWhile presenting the bill on the floor, Duplessis told colleagues there\u2019s good reason for certain state officials to be appointed rather than elected. He mentioned the secretaries of the health and environmental quality departments as important offices that should be insulated from the politics of elected office.\n\u201cI think that some roles are so specialized and technical that they shouldn\u2019t be politicized,\u201d he said.\nVery few voters pay attention to the office of insurance commissioner, Duplessis said, pointing out that Temple ran for office unopposed.\nRepublicans have generally been supportive of Temple, a former insurance executive who is opposed to Duplessis\u2019 bill and has lobbied for legislation with the backing of insurance companies.\nDemocrats, on the other hand, have been critical of the commissioner\u2019s cozy relationship with the industry he\u2019s charged with regulating and believe Temple could do more to rein in high premiums.\nThe one big exception to that partisan alignment is Gov. Jeff Landry, who has been publicly feuding with Temple over the causes of the insurance crisis in Louisiana. Even with his reelection bid still two years away, the governor has incentive to deflect any blame voters might lay at his feet for insurance costs even though the crisis began before he took office in 2024.\nTemple and the companies he regulates have long claimed personal injury lawsuits are driving the state\u2019s high insurance premiums. He has advocated for so-called \u201ctort reform\u201d laws that give insurance companies certain protections or advantages in litigation. Tort reform efforts in previous years have failed to reduce insurance rates, though Temple and his supporters have said those measures were not strong enough.\nGov. Landry\u2019s approach to lower insurance rates could cast his political fate\nDuplessis\u2019 bill had the backing of some conservative Republicans, such as Sen. Stewart Cathey of Monroe. Cathey added the amendment to require Senate confirmation of the governor\u2019s pick for commissioner.\nBut as other Republicans lined up to speak against the bill, debate started to sour when Sen. Adam Bass of Bossier City accused Duplessis of trying to strip away voters\u2019 rights.\n\u201cWhat other voting rights are you interested in taking away from the citizens?\u201d Bass asked Duplessis.\nDuplessis rejected the characterization and said he only wants to address the state\u2019s insurance crisis with novel proposals. He noted 39 other states have appointed, rather than elected, insurance commissioners. Among the 10 states with the lowest auto insurance rates in the country, nine of them have appointed commissioners, he added.\n\u201cI am someone who generally believes in the power of elections and the will of the people,\u201d Duplessis said. \u201cBut when something isn\u2019t working and the outcomes are consistently failing consumers and driving up costs, we have to be honest enough to say it\u2019s time to do something different.\u201d\nSen. Kirk Talbot, R-River Ridge, spoke against the bill, though he said he authored similar legislation years ago. He said he studied the issue and eventually concluded the elected system \u201cwas the better way to go.\u201d\nTalbot repeated a statistic that Temple often cites from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which indicates there were more bodily injury claims from auto accidents in Louisiana with a population of roughly 4.5 million, than there were in the state of New York with a population of over 19 million in 2021, which is the most recent data available.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what needs to be addressed, not this,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we are addressing with this vast package of tort reform bills that the commissioner has supported.\u201d\nStill, that same source indicates the dollar value of the incurred losses of Louisiana\u2019s claims was less than half that of New York\u2019s and roughly equal to the losses in Arkansas where liability premiums were the lowest out of all the southern states.\nOther states with more injury claims than New York included North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and California.\nLouisiana\u2019s insurance commissioner was originally an appointed position when the post was created in 1957. Gov. Earl K. Long supported the launch of a state insurance department, separating its functions from the office of one of his political adversaries, Secretary of State Wade O. Martin. The very first appointed commissioner, Rufus Hayes, became the first elected one for his second term.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "5:15\nNews Story\nLouisiana college athletic programs closer to scoring state tax dollars\nThe LSU baseball team celebrates after winning the College World Series against Florida, 18-4, on June 26, 2023, at Charles Schwab Field in Omaha, Nebraska. (Jacob Reeder/LSU Sports Information)\nMost college athletic programs in Louisiana could soon each receive nearly $2 million in state tax revenue annually under a plan advancing in the legislature.\nHouse Bill 639 by Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, cleared the House on a 74-15 vote. It would increase the tax on sports gambling from 15% to 21.5%. One-fourth of that revenue would go to the Supporting Programs, Opportunities, Resources and Teams (SPORT) Fund to benefit student-athletes at Louisiana\u2019s public universities that compete at the NCAA Division I level \u2013 UL Lafayette, UL Monroe, Louisiana Tech, LSU, Grambling, McNeese, Nicholls, Northwestern State, Southeastern, Southern and the University of New Orleans.\nUnder the new tax rate, Louisiana would receive about $77 million annually from sports gambling, with about $20 million dedicated to the new fund. Each school would get approximately $1.7 million annually.\nThat\u2019s a small drop in the bucket for LSU, which has an athletics budget of over $200 million. But it would be a significant lifeline for schools such as Southern, Nicholls and ULM, which each spend less than $20 million a year on their sports program.\nThe proposed increase in sports gambling taxes has support from conservative and progressive corners, both saying the revenue should be used to offset the \u201csocial ills\u201d of gambling. The higher rate would generate more money for addiction programs.\nBut the decision to dedicate some of that revenue to college athletics at a time when the state is under budget constraints troubles some progressives.\n\u201cLegalized mobile gambling has created or exacerbated many social and cultural problems, including addiction, bankruptcies and even increases in domestic violence. New tax revenue should be used first and foremost to address some of those problems before we talk about spending more money on college sports,\u201d said Peter Robins-Brown, executive director of Louisiana Progress, an advocacy group for marginalized communities.\nPresently, the state\u2019s split for sports gambling tax revenue calls for 25% to go toward early childhood education, 10% to local governments, 3% to gambling addiction programs, and the rest to other priorities and the state general fund.\nUnder Riser\u2019s bill, childhood education, local governments and addiction recovery would retain their existing share of tax proceeds. In addition to the 25% for college athletics, another 3% would be dedicated to the Louisiana Postsecondary Inclusive Education Fund to finance programs for students with disabilities. The rest goes into the state general fund for a variety of government needs.\nRiser\u2019s bill will next be discussed in a Senate committee.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Democrats on Tuesday blasted the assault charges the Trump administration is pursuing against New Jersey U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver following a clash with law enforcement earlier this month outside an immigration detention center in Newark.\nLeaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, Democratic Women\u2019s Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus defended McIver at a press conference attended by dozens of Democrats outside of the U.S. Capitol, arguing that the New Jersey Democrat was simply doing her job in conducting oversight of the facility.\nIn a criminal complaint, McIver is charged with two counts of \u201cassaulting, resisting, and impeding certain officers or employees,\u201d with one charge involving a Homeland Security Investigations special agent and another surrounding an Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer.\nThe charges are tied to McIver\u2019s May 9 visit to the detention center, where she was accompanied by fellow New Jersey Democrats \u2014 Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman. The lawmakers had said they wanted to inspect the detention center.\nFederal authorities say McIver assaulted two officers as she tried to prevent the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Alina Habba, acting U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, announced Monday that she would be dropping a trespassing charge against Baraka stemming from the same standoff.\n\u2018Reprehensible political stunt\u2019\nAt the Capitol press conference, Rep. Yvette Clarke, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, described the charges as a \u201creprehensible political stunt.\u201d\nThe New York Democrat said \u201cmembers of Congress have every right to conduct oversight at ICE facilities and any other federal agency, and when egregious, undeniable and vicious violations of the law and people\u2019s freedoms are taking place, we, they, in fact, have an obligation to do so.\u201d\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said McIver, Menendez and Watson Coleman \u201cstood their ground, used their voice and did their job.\u201d\n\u201cThey actually are obeying the Constitution. They are standing up to give checks and balances to this administration at a time that the Republicans in control of the House and the Senate are laying down and completely abrogating their duties to check and balance and give oversight to the president,\u201d he added.\nNew Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone also condemned the charges on Tuesday, calling the Justice Department\u2019s actions \u201coutrageous.\u201d\nAhead of a Tuesday hearing in the House Judiciary Committee on \u201cthreats to ICE operations,\u201d Pallone led several other New Jersey Democrats in writing to the panel\u2019s chair, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, and ranking member, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, to express their support for the three lawmakers\u2019 oversight visit to the detention center.\nThe group also condemned what they see as efforts from the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to \u201cpoliticize and suppress lawful Congressional oversight through acts of intimidation and threats of legal action against our colleagues.\u201d\n\u2018Baseless charges\u2019\nRep. Greg Casar, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said the Department of Justice \u201cfiling baseless charges against a member of Congress for simply doing her job should send a chill down the spine of every American.\u201d\nThe Texas Democrat said the caucus held a meeting just before the press conference where they decided that they are \u201cjust about to go and do a lot more oversight visits at ICE facilities.\u201d\nHe said the members of the caucus recognized at the meeting that President Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t want us conducting oversight at ICE facilities like these brave members of Congress were doing \u2014 he wants to intimidate us out of doing that.\u201d\nU.S. Rep. Troy Carter reacts to charges against McIver\nU.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, issued the following statement following reports of the Trump administration pursuing assault charges against House colleague LaMonica McIver after her encounter with law enforcement outside an immigration detention center in Newark.\n\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s decision to charge Congresswoman LaMonica McIver for performing her constitutional duty is deeply disturbing and wholly unacceptable.\n\u201cMembers of Congress have clear legal authority to inspect federal detention facilities without prior notice. This isn\u2019t a gray area \u2014 it\u2019s established law and a vital check on executive power.\n\u201cCharging a sitting Member of Congress for lawful oversight sets a dangerous precedent. It\u2019s not about safety or justice\u2014it\u2019s political retaliation masquerading as law enforcement.\n\u201cWe cannot allow the Department of Justice to be used as a tool of intimidation. I stand with Congresswoman McIver and every Member committed to holding government accountable. This is a test of our democracy \u2014 and we must not fail it.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Screenshot from committee webcast)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Tuesday was grilled by senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee about funding estimates for a barrier along the southern border, as well as concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s adherence to due process in immigration enforcement.\nNoem was sharply criticized by Democrats for her answers to questions about habeas corpus, which they said she did not define correctly. \u201cHabeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country,\u201d Noem said before she was cut off by Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who had asked her for a definition.\n\u201cThat\u2019s incorrect,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cHabeas corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people. If not for that protection, the government could simply arrest people, including American citizens, and hold them indefinitely for no reason.\u201d\nAs for the cost of President Donald Trump\u2019s border plans, even Republicans expressed doubts.\n\u201cI know the wall is (of) great symbolic value, but I think we should reassess the cost,\u201d Republican Chair Rand Paul of Kentucky said about the House\u2019s reconciliation package, which calls for $46 billion in border wall funding.\nNoem appeared before the committee to discuss President Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal year 2026 budget request for Congress along with the border security provisions in the reconciliation package. Congressional Republicans are using reconciliation \u2014 a special procedure that skirts the Senate\u2019s 60-vote filibuster \u2014 to put together one bill to fulfill Trump\u2019s priorities on border security, tax cuts, energy policy and defense.\n\u201cThe border crisis is the biggest problem that was facing our country, and it was one that was imperative to fixing for our nation\u2019s future,\u201d Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, said. \u201cWe\u2019re solving this crisis at a record pace, and we have delivered the most secure border in American history.\u201d\nSenate Democrats pressed Noem about DHS spending, noting that she is on track to run out of funding by mid-July, and her agency\u2019s immigration crackdown that has led to expensive immigration enforcement.\nThe top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, noted that detaining migrants at the Guantanamo naval base costs as much as $100,000 a day, compared to $160 a day at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s kind of outrageous,\u201d Peters said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned by the staggering cost of this, and I would hope, Secretary (Noem), you could commit to providing this committee a detailed breakdown of the total cost of that operation there.\u201d\nNoem said she would get the cost breakdown for him.\nQuestions about habeas corpus\nSeveral Senate Democrats, including Hassan, Andy Kim of New Jersey and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, questioned comments from senior White House officials such as Stephen Miller, who has said discussions about suspending habeas corpus were underway.\nHabeas corpus allows people in the U.S. who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court, and it can be used to challenge immigration detention.\nThe U.S. Constitution in allowing for habeas corpus to be suspended says \u201cin Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\u201d That provision is within Article I of the Constitution, which covers the functions of the legislative branch, or Congress.\nHabeas corpus has only been suspended four times in U.S. history, during the Civil War; in almost a dozen South Carolina counties that were overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during reconstruction; in a 1905 insurrection in U.S. territories in the Philippines; and after the Pearl Harbor bombing in Hawaii.\nSlotkin told Noem she was concerned by her response that she believes the president has the right to suspend habeas corpus.\n\u201cYou sat here in front of all of us and swore an oath to the Constitution,\u201d Slotkin said to Noem, adding that if the president were to suspend habeas corpus, it would be a \u201ccomplete overreach.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a right that we all get, that American citizens get, that people who are in the United States legally have,\u201d Slotkin said.\nKim asked Noem, a former member of the U.S. House, if she knew what section of the Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus and which article it\u2019s under.\nNoem did not know the answer to either question.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in Article I,\u201d Kim said. \u201cDo you know which branch of government Article I outlines the tasks and the responsibilities for?\u201d\nNoem said Congress. She then argued former President Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus.\nLincoln suspended habeas corpus between Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia because of the Civil War and initially did so without congressional approval. He later called Congress back into session to get congressional approval for it.\nReality show with competing immigrants\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut asked Noem if DHS was considering hosting a reality show that would make immigrants compete for citizenship, according to multiple media reports.\nNoem vehemently denied that DHS was looking at it.\n\u201cThere may have been something submitted somewhere along the line, because there are proposals pitched to the department, but me and my executive team have no knowledge of a reality show, and it\u2019s not under consideration,\u201d she said.\nKim pressed Noem about the recent confrontation between House lawmakers and immigration officials at Delaney Hall in his home state of New Jersey.\nThree New Jersey Democratic members \u2013 Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez \u2014 were in Newark protesting the reopening of Delaney Hall, an immigrant detention center.\nThe mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, who was also protesting, was arrested.\nThe Trump administration Monday levied two felony charges against one of those members, McIver, accusing her of assaulting officers during Baraka\u2019s arrest.\nKim said he was concerned about the incident and asked Noem if she was aware that members of Congress do not need prior notice to conduct oversight at DHS facilities.\nMembers of Congress are allowed to conduct oversight visits at any DHS facility that detains immigrants, without prior notice, under provisions in an appropriations law.\nNoem accused the three House members of \u201cstorming\u201d the facility.\n\u201cWe give tours when members of Congress ask for it, we just ask that they not be politicized,\u201d she said.\nPrep for big sporting events\nFlorida GOP Sen. Rick Scott and Rand Paul asked Noem about how prepared DHS is for providing security to big sporting events such as the Super Bowl and soccer\u2019s World Cup.\nScott wanted to know how security preparations for the 2026 World Cup, which includes games in Miami, are going.\nMiami is one of 11 U.S. cities hosting the World Cup. The others are Atlanta; Boston; Dallas; Houston; Kansas City, Missouri; Los Angeles; the San Francisco Bay area; the New York and New Jersey metropolitan area; Philadelphia; and Seattle.\n\u201cWe are working diligently with FIFA and other entities to ensure that cities and states have the assets that they need. This will be an unprecedented world event,\u201d Noem said. \u201cIt will be taking place in three different countries and many cities across our country, but also Mexico and Canada, and it will take place over a month.\u201d\nThe World Cup, which first began in the 1930s, is typically held in one country every four years. The last time two countries hosted the month-long event was in 2002, with Japan and South Korea.\nPaul asked Noem if the NFL or FIFA, international soccer\u2019s governing body, ever paid DHS for its security measures.\nNoem said no.\n\u201cHere\u2019s my point,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe NFL makes billions of dollars. These people ought to pay. I mean, it\u2019s ridiculous that the average taxpayer could never afford to go to an NFL Super Bowl, (and) has got to pay for their security.\u201d\nLast updated 4:02 p.m., May. 20, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Kennedy Jr. testifies before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. (Screenshot from committee webcast)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before Congress on Tuesday that a major report due out later this week from his agency will not disparage farmers or a commonly used pesticide.\nKennedy, who has long been critical of certain aspects of modern agriculture and processed food, at a U.S. Senate hearing urged lawmakers to read the widely anticipated \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report once it\u2019s published Thursday, but didn\u2019t go into details about any possible recommendations.\n\u201cEverybody will see the report,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nobody that has a greater commitment to the American farmer than we do. The MAHA movement collapses if we can\u2019t partner with the American farmer in producing a safe, robust and abundant food supply.\u201d\nHis comments followed stern questioning from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who said she had read news reports from \u201creliable sources\u201d that the MAHA Commission\u2019s initial assessment \u201cmay unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools that roughly 2% of our population relies on to help feed the remaining 98%.\u201d\n\u201cIf Americans lose confidence in the safety and integrity of our food supply due to the unfounded claims that mislead consumers, public health will be at risk,\u201d Hyde-Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ve said this before, and it\u2019s worth saying again, countries have gone to war over many things \u2014 politics, religion, race, trade, natural resources, oil, pride, you name it \u2014 but threaten a nation\u2019s food supply and allow people to go hungry. Let\u2019s see what happens then.\u201d\nHyde-Smith, who was her home state\u2019s commissioner of agriculture and commerce from 2012 to 2018, probed Kennedy about his past work in environmental law and whether he might be inserting \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d into the forthcoming report.\nShe asked Kennedy if he would try to change the current approval for glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, that she referred to as \u201cone of the most thoroughly studied products of its kind.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about more than 1,500 studies and 50-plus years of review by the EPA and other leading global health authorities that have affirmed its safety when used as directed,\u201d Hyde-Smith said. \u201cHave you been able to review thousands of studies and decades of scientific review in a matter of months?\u201d\nKennedy responded that her \u201cinformation about the report is just simply wrong.\u201d\n\u201cThe drafts that I\u2019ve seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,\u201d Kennedy said.\nHyde-Smith continued her questioning and told Kennedy that it would be \u201ca shame if the MAHA commission issues reports suggesting, without substantial facts and evidence, that our government got things terribly wrong when it reviewed a number of crop protection tools and deemed them to be safe.\u201d\nHome energy program in Maine\nSeveral other Republicans on the Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee raised concerns during the two-hour hearing about how Kennedy has run HHS since they confirmed him in February.\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, brought up the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which the Trump administration has called on Congress to eliminate.\n\u201cThe LIHEAP program, which we\u2019ve talked about, is absolutely vital for thousands of older Mainers and low-income families,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIt helps them avoid the constant worry of having to choose between keeping warm, buying essential foods and medications and other basic necessities.\u201d\nKennedy sought to distance himself from the president\u2019s budget request, saying that he understands \u201cthe critical, historical importance of this program.\u201d\n\u201cPresident (Donald) Trump\u2019s rationale and (the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s) rationale is that President Trump\u2019s energy policies are going to lower the cost of energy \u2026 so that everybody will get lower cost heating oil,\u201d Kennedy said.\nNIH indirect costs\nSubcommittee Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., brought up several issues with Kennedy, including efforts to change how much the National Institutes of Health provides to medical schools and research universities for Facilities and Administrative fees, often called indirect costs.\nNIH sought to set that amount at 15% across the board for any institution that receives a research grant from the agency, a significantly lower amount than many of the organizations had negotiated over the years, bringing about strong objections from institutions of higher education.\nThat NIH policy has not taken effect as several lawsuits work their way through the federal court system.\nKennedy indicated NIH has figured out a way to help medical schools and research universities pay for items like gloves, test tubes and mass spectrometers, particularly at state schools.\n\u201cIn the public universities, we are very much aware that those universities are using the money well, that it is absolutely necessary for them. And we\u2019re looking at a series of different ways that we can fund those costs through them,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cBut not through the independent, indirect cost structure, which loses all control, which deprives us of all control of how that money is spent.\u201d\nKansas Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican, brought up the measles outbreak and pressed Kennedy on whether HHS needed additional resources to help his home state and others get the virus under control.\nKennedy testified the \u201cbest way to prevent the spread of measles is through vaccination\u201d and that HHS has been urging \u201cpeople to get their MMR vaccines.\u201d\nSouth Dakota grant on mine safety\nSouth Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds called on Kennedy to continue fixing issues created earlier this year when HHS fired people working on mine safety issues at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n\u201cMy office has learned that staff at NIOSH\u2019s Spokane mining research division have been laid off. This office focuses on the unique challenges of Western mining operations that are often more geologically complex and exposed to harsher conditions,\u201d Rounds said. \u201cThis division provides critical technical support for institutions like the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, which recently received a $1.25 million grant to improve underground mining safety. However, the grant has now been canceled due to loss of oversight from the Spokane office.\n\u201cThis is not just a missed opportunity, it undermines our ability to meet national security goals tied to mineral independence and supply chain resilience.\u201d\nKennedy testified that he\u2019s been able to bring back 238 workers at the agency and said he would work with Rounds to address ongoing issues.\nPledge to fund Head Start, but no dollar amount\nAlabama Sen. Katie Britt, a Republican, asked Kennedy about news reports earlier this year that HHS would ask Congress to zero out funding for Head Start, one of numerous programs left out of the administration\u2019s skinny budget request. Head Start provides early learning, health, family and development programs for free for children from low-income families.\nKennedy testified that eliminating Head Start would likely not be in the full budget request, which is set to be released later this year, though the White House budget office has not said when. He said it would ask Congress to fully fund the program, but didn\u2019t share a dollar amount.\n\u201cThere\u2019s 800,000 of the poorest kids in this country who are served by this program. It not only teaches the kids preschool skills \u2014 reading, writing and arithmetic \u2014 before they get to prepare them for school. But it also teaches the parents and teaches them how to be good parents.\u201d\nKennedy said there are challenges faced by the Head Start program that he hopes to change during the next four years, including the quality of the food.\n\u201cThe food they\u2019re serving at Head Start is terrible. You need to change that,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning the poorest kids from their youngest years, and we\u2019re going to change that.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)\nAfter outcry from several corners of the legal community, Louisiana lawmakers scuttled a controversial proposal backed by Attorney General Liz Murrill that could have moved thousands of criminal cases involving children and teenagers from juvenile to adult courts every year.\nThe Louisiana Senate Finance Committee voted 6-5 Monday to reject Senate Bill 74 by Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport. The committee\u2019s decision came a few weeks after state voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar constitutional amendment.\nThe legislation would have mostly affected Orleans, Jefferson, East Baton Rouge and Caddo parishes, where juvenile courts operate separately from district courts.\nLarry Frieman, chief deputy attorney general, told senators the bill was crafted specifically to address New Orleans juvenile court judges who are too lenient on the teens and children who come before them.\n\u201cThey are one of the ones that have created this problem that we are trying to fix,\u201d Frieman said.\nPushback for the bill came from a wide swath of people involved in the criminal justice system who often aren\u2019t aligned with each other. District attorneys, public defenders, judges and anti-incarceration groups all spoke out against the proposal.\n\u201cThe logistics of it are not as simple as everyone seems to think,\u201d said Kyla Romanach, chief public defender for East Baton Rouge Parish, who opposed the legislation.\nHad it been approved, the bill would have allowed district attorneys and the attorney general to transfer 15- and 16-year-olds accused of felony crimes from juvenile courts to state district courts that mostly handle adult cases.\nDistrict attorneys and the attorney general also would have gained the ability to move cases involving children under 15 accused of any crime, misdemeanor or felony, from juvenile courts to city and parish courts that focus on adult cases.\nDistrict attorneys can already move 14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds into the adult criminal justice system, but only when they are accused of the most serious crimes such as murder, manslaughter and rape.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThe Louisiana Legislature also passed a statute last year that reclassifies all 17-year-olds as adults in the eyes of the criminal justice system. They are automatically tried in adult court and face adult prison sentences.\nThe attorney general\u2019s failed legislation would have further blurred the lines between punishments for adults and minors in Louisiana, though the additional children and teenagers transferred from juvenile to adult courts under the bill would have been subjected to juvenile law standards, Frieman said.\nJudges, prosecutors and public defenders from the four parishes with juvenile courts indicated the attorney general\u2019s proposal would cost their courthouses and offices hundreds of thousands of dollars each.\nDistrict attorneys and public defenders from East Baton Rouge, Jefferson and Caddo all said they would have to hire more staff to track cases in juvenile and district court if the legislation had been approved.\nFederal and state law also require minors to be separated from adult detainees. District courthouses in the four affected parishes don\u2019t have the appropriate accommodations for minors and would have had to retrofit their buildings.\nEast Baton Rouge judges said the changes they would have to undertake at their courthouse would have cost between $3 million and $10 million, according to a legislative financial analysis.\nLegislators initially delayed a vote on the bill last week over questions about the accuracy of the fiscal review attached to it. An earlier version didn\u2019t have as many of the potential costs included, in part, because State Public Defender R\u00e9my Starns told the legislative staff to disregard information provided by his office.\nDaniel Druilhet, a member of the Legislative Fiscal Office staff, said Starns asked him to ignore any costs public defenders had initially said would be associated with the bill when drafting the fiscal review.\n\u201c[W]hile I did receive an initial response from the Office of the State Public Defender, including information from those four jurisdictions related to potential costs, I was contacted by Mr. Starns on May 2, 2025, instructing me not to include that cost in the fiscal note,\u201d Druilhet told senators at a public hearing last week.\nIn response to Druilhet\u2019s comments, the senators put off a vote on the matter for a week so a new financial write-up could be put together.\nSen. Katrina Jackson-Andrews, D-Monroe, chastised Starns for intervening in the legislative process.\n\u201cI want our state employees to understand there\u2019s not a time when they can tell our fiscal office not to consider costs that have been submitted,\u201d she said after Druilhet\u2019s testimony.\nStarns told Jackson he had decided, after an amendment was added to the legislation, that the expenses his office had turned over to the fiscal office were no longer relevant.\nStarns has been working closely with the attorney general on other criminal justice bills filed this session that would give Starns more authority over local public defender office budgets and personnel.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Billy Long, nominee for Internal Revenue Service commissioner, testifies before the Senate Finance Committee at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. (Screenshot from committee webcast)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senators tasked with tax writing split along party lines Tuesday praising and grilling former Republican U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Internal Revenue Service, the agency tasked with enforcing the largest source of U.S. revenue as the country faces record debt and interest costs.\nLong, who served in Congress from 2011 to 2023 and previously spent multiple years as a talk radio host, testified to the Senate Finance Committee that he plans to get rid of \u201cstinking thinking\u201d at the IRS and implement a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to modernize the agency and \u201cinvest in retaining skilled members of the team.\u201d\n\u201cThis does not mean a bloated agency, but an efficient one where employees have the tools they need to succeed,\u201d Long said.\nThe agency has lost more than 11,000 employees, or 11% of its workforce, either through deferred resignations or mass firing of probationary workers since Trump began his second term, according to a May 2 report from the agency\u2019s inspector general. Trump said in December he intended to nominate Long for the IRS post.\n\u2018Top-down culture change\u2019\nCommittee Chair Mike Crapo of Idaho opened the confirmation hearing expressing his confidence in Long, saying he will direct a \u201csea change\u201d at the agency that will benefit taxpayers.\n\u201cPresident Trump called Congressman Long the \u2018consummate people person.\u2019 Congressman Long is very clear that he will make himself available to all IRS employees, no matter their seniority. Moreover, he wants to implement a top-down culture change at the agency,\u201d Crapo said.\nThe confirmation hearing comes as lawmakers struggle to agree on a budget reconciliation package, which will extend and expand Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law and in turn widen IRS responsibilities.\nSen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said he trusted Long\u2019s work ethic and told him, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a tax bill here in the next couple of months. To be able to get that done, as we did it in 2017, there\u2019ll be a lot of work the IRS has to do to be able to put guidance documents out, to be able to get clear instructions of what that means.\u201d\nNonexistent tribal tax credits\nDemocrats approached the hearing with skepticism.\nThe nearly two-hour back-and-forth with Long followed recent revelations that he accepted donations to his defunct Senate campaign shortly after Trump nominated him as the IRS commissioner. Democratic senators on the panel have also called for an investigation into Long\u2019s work with a company that peddled nonexistent tribal tax credits.\n\u201cBottom line, the American people have the right to know whether the future IRS commissioner is a crook,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the panel\u2019s top Democrat.\nLong denies any wrongdoing.\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, pressed Long about $65,000 he allegedly received for his involvement promoting the fake tax credits for the companies Capital Edge Strategies and White River.\n\u201cKnowing that (the credits) are illegal, the IRS has said they\u2019re illegal, how do you stand here before this committee and tell the chairman just a few minutes ago that you have no conflict of interest?\u201d Cortez Masto asked.\nLong replied that he\u2019s in compliance with the Office of Government Ethics regarding his nomination and that he \u201cdid not have any perception whatsoever that these (credits) did not exist.\u201d\nOther Democrats on the panel questioned Long on Trump\u2019s recent statements that he would pull Harvard University\u2019s tax-exempt status over its refusal to comply with demands from the administration.\nWyden characterized Long as a \u201cMAGA devotee\u201d and said that Trump wants to use the IRS \u201cas a cudgel to beat his adversaries into submission.\u201d\n14-page letter\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, who sent Long a 14-page letter questioning his past, repeatedly asked Long about a statute prohibiting the president from ordering tax audits on specific people or businesses.\n\u201cIs it illegal for the President to instruct the IRS to remove nonprofit status from taxpayers?\u201d Warren asked several times.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to have the answer that you need, I apologize,\u201d Long said.\nSenate Republicans on the panel questioned Long on how he can improve customer service for taxpayers \u2014 despite the party successfully fighting in 2023 to cut new IRS funding under President Joe Biden in 2022.\nSen. Todd Young of Indiana said the agency is \u201cbehind the curve\u201d on technology and that its customer service issues are \u201cout of hand.\u201d\n\u201cIf confirmed, will you commit to developing a comprehensive IRS modernization plan that prioritizes customer service, identifies critical technology infrastructure needs and ensures greater transparency and audit practices? Yes or no?\u201d Young asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Long replied.\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Young said.\nLast updated 3:21 p.m., May. 20, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Emily Chenevert\u2019s House Bill 685, which prohibits policy on diversity, equity and inclusion in state government and prevents state colleges and universities from requiring DEI in their curricula with limited exceptions. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)\nThe Louisiana House of Representatives approved a bill Monday that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion practices across state government and prohibit state universities and colleges from requiring certain race and gender-based curriculum for undergraduate students.\nHouse Bill 685 by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, advanced from the House on a 57-32 vote, narrowly clearing the 53-vote threshold for passage. Sixteen members, including several moderate Democrats and Republicans, were absent for the vote.\nIn an unusual move, every Democratic lawmaker present stood together in solidarity behind the House floor lectern, while nearly every Black lawmaker took turns making speeches against the bill.\n\u201cTo me, this is an anti-Black bill,\u201d Rep. Edmond Jordan of Baton Rouge said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just divisive. It\u2019s offensive.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the most racially oppressive piece of legislation that I think I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Rep. Candace Newell of New Orleans said.\nRepublican Reps. Beth Billings of Destrehan, Vincent Cox of Gretna and Jeff Wiley of Maurepas joined Democrats in opposing the bill.\n\u201cIt was needlessly divisive,\u201d Billings said in an interview when asked why she opposed the bill.\nIn tearful comments after the speeches, Chenevert said her bill is not racist.\n\u201cThis is not divisive,\u201d Chenevert said. \u201cThis is protecting every Louisianian. This is about equality for all.\u201d\nChenevert\u2019s bill has been dramatically rewritten from her original legislation, which only banned DEI practices in state government.\nAs is, the bill would prohibit required classes that cover any of the following subjects:\n- Critical race theory\n- White fragility or white guilt\n- Systemic racism, institutional racism or anti-racism\n- Systemic bias or implicit bias\n- Intersectionality\n- Gender identity\n- Allyship\n- Race-based reparations\n- Race-based privilege\nAmendments added to the bill on the House floor would allow any of the subjects to be taught if it is \u201cincluded at the discretion of the faculty member, is not prescribed by the institution as a program requirement, and is part of a broader pedagogical objective.\u201d\nOpponents of the bill said even with the amendments, the legislation could have a chilling effect on faculty\u2019s academic freedom and freedom of speech.\nThe bill also makes an exception for majors, minors and certificates that are specifically related to race or gender studies.\nThe Louisiana chapter of the American Association of University Professors sent a letter to lawmakers Monday asking them to oppose the bill.\n\u201cThis legislation would stifle the \u2018marketplace of ideas\u2019 and infantilize our students, forcing faculty to avoid concepts the legislature dislikes and presenting only those that have gained their favor,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThis is antithetical to freedom in a democratic society and hurts our students as they transition into fully enfranchised citizens.\u201d\nThe Southern University Foundation, which is affiliated with Louisiana\u2019s largest historically Black university, also opposes the bill.\nChenevert\u2019s bill will next be discussed in a Senate committee.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "Content": "HONG KONG \u2014 The concert was set to be small but significant: the first by an all-Korean K-pop band in mainland China after an unofficial ban on such shows for almost a decade.\nThat was exciting news for fans like Haerin Ouyang, a university student in the coastal Chinese city of Fuzhou, where the South Korean boy band Epex had been scheduled to perform on Saturday.\nBut the show was canceled earlier this month, less than two weeks after it was announced, leaving Ouyang \u201cheartbroken.\u201d\n\u201cThe venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,\u201d she said.\nC9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited \u201clocal circumstances\u201d in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.\nThe ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.\nBefore the ban, China \u2014 the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan \u2014 was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.\n\u201cIn the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China\u2019s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,\u201d said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.\nThe China ban is estimated to have cost the South Korean economy almost $16 billion since 2016, she said.\nBut the Epex concert\u2019s cancellation does not necessarily reflect the official position of the Chinese government, Kang cautioned, as China has been gradually reopening to South Korean culture after years of tension.\nWhile K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.\nA large-scale K-pop joint concert is also scheduled to be held in September at a 40,000-seat stadium in the Chinese island province of Hainan. The Korea Entertainment Producers\u2019 Association, which announced the event in April, did not reply to an email asking whether that concert is still going ahead.\nKang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would \u201cproceed without issue.\u201d\nThere are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China\u2019s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.\n\u201cIt shows that there is a greater opportunity for collaboration between the two countries, especially in the entertainment industry,\u201d said Ellen Kim, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. \u201cIt might be a starting point for industry-level cooperation that could open more doors between the two countries.\u201d\nThe diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.\nChina\u2019s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.\nIn addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop\u2019s high-spending fans.\nChina has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever.\n\u201cIt now has robust resilience against the \u2018invasion\u2019 of foreign content,\u201d she said.\nChina\u2019s potential thaw toward South Korean entertainment comes as it further restricts the number of Hollywood films allowed to be screened in its theaters in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nChina-South Korea ties could also get a boost from next week\u2019s South Korean presidential election. The front-runner, Lee Jae-myung, is considered friendlier to China than his predecessor.\n\u201cIf he wins, it might be a matter of time that things will change, which will allow the Korean entertainers to come into the country and play their music,\u201d Kim said.",

        "Content": "HONG KONG \u2014 If President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want international students at Harvard, there are plenty of foreign governments and universities happy to take them \u2014 along with their talents that have helped make the United States a global tech and scientific leader.\nThe future of international students at the oldest, richest and most renowned university in the U.S. is uncertain after the Trump administration announced a ban on their enrollment starting in the 2025-26 academic year.\nAfter Harvard refused to turn over extensive data about its international students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the school was being held accountable for \u201cfostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.\u201d\nHarvard has sued over the move, calling it unlawful, and on Friday a federal judge in Boston put it on hold for two weeks. If the Trump administration prevails, new international students would be barred from enrolling at Harvard while current ones would be forced to either transfer elsewhere or lose their legal status.\nU.S. universities including Harvard rely heavily on international students, who often pay far more in tuition than their American classmates. Many of them end up staying in the U.S., where they have been responsible for major breakthroughs in strategically important fields such as artificial intelligence where the U.S., China and other nations are locked in intense competition.\nTrump\u2019s campaign against Harvard is a \u201cterrible policy error\u201d that could undermine the world-leading role the U.S. has played in research and development since World War II, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, told NBC News in an email Monday.\nA downturn in international students would affect American universities\u2019 \u201ctalent pipeline\u201d and income, while benefiting U.S. competitors, he said. \u201cChina will become significantly more attractive than before to students and researchers from the Global South,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cWestern Europe will also gain significantly.\u201d\nThere was already growing unease among international students at U.S. universities amid anti-immigrant rhetoric by Trump, in addition to deep funding cuts and efforts to intervene in universities\u2019 internal operations. Hundreds of students\u2019 visas have been revoked, while the Trump administration has detained and sought to deport others over pro-Palestinian and other activism.\nAt Harvard, more than a quarter of the student body of about 25,000 comes from overseas and the looming ban has caught up students from more than 140 countries, including the future queen of Belgium.\nHarvard\u2019s biggest group of overseas students, about 20%, come from China, which was long the top source of international students in the U.S. before being overtaken by India last year.\nThe number of Chinese students in the U.S. has been dropping \u2014to about 277,000 during the 2023-24 school year, compared with more than 372,000 in 2019-20 \u2014 due to disruptions from the Covid pandemic as well as growing U.S.-China tensions.\nChinese academics were also driven away by the China Initiative, a national security program from Trump\u2019s first term that drew accusations of racial profiling. Many of them have moved their research to Chinese universities.\nResponding to the Harvard ban, Beijing said U.S.-China educational cooperation is \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d and that it would \u201csafeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students and scholars overseas.\u201d\n\u201cChina has consistently opposed the politicization of educational exchanges,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Friday. \u201cSuch actions by the U.S. will only damage its own image and international credibility.\u201d\nIzzy Shen, 23, an incoming Harvard student from Beijing, said her visa application was refused hours after Trump\u2019s Harvard ban.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be so fast,\u201d said Shen, whose application had already been marked \u201capproved.\u201d\nShen, who was admitted to Harvard\u2019s Master in Design Engineering program, said she remained \u201crelatively optimistic\u201d and that the situation would \u201cget clearer\u201d after the injunction hearing Thursday.\nDuo Yi, who was admitted to the public policy doctoral program at Harvard Kennedy School, said she is now exploring other options amid growing uncertainty about her enrolment. Trump is \u201csimply too unpredictable,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no way of knowing what direction his future policies will take.\u201d\nForeign governments and universities are not waiting to woo the Harvard students spurned by Trump. In the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, officials have urged universities to take proactive action \u201cto attract top talent.\u201d\nHong Kong\u2019s \u201cdoors are wide open\u201d to \u201cany students who face discrimination and unfair treatment in the U.S.,\u201d John Lee, the city\u2019s top leader, said Tuesday.\nHong Kong has four universities in the top 100 of U.S. News & World Report\u2019s Best Global Universities Rankings, which is topped by Harvard, though experts say academic freedom in the former British colony of 7.5 million people has eroded since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020.\nThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said Friday that Harvard undergraduates and postgraduates, as well as students with confirmed offers of admission, were welcome to study there instead.\nEurope has also sought to lure scientists worried about funding cuts and freedom of research under Trump, launching a $570 million initiative this month called \u201cChoose Europe.\u201d\nThough she did not mention Trump by name, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized \u201cfree and open research\u201d in a speech promoting the initiative at Sorbonne University in Paris.\n\u201cAs threats rise across the world, Europe will not compromise on its principles,\u201d she said. \u201cEurope must remain the home of academic and scientific freedom.\u201d\nDespite concerns about the Harvard ban, Alex Zeng, an overseas education consultant based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, said American universities remained the top choice for many Chinese students.\n\u201cThe rich still want to go to the U.S. for education,\u201d Zeng said.",

They are working with local forces to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State, which in 2014 seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria but was later pushed back.\nSince rebels ousted Syria's former President Bashar al-Assad in December, the United States and other countries are re-engaging with Damascus under new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.\nBarrack, also U.S. ambassador to Turkey, raised the American flag over the ambassador\u2019s residence in Damascus last week for the first time since 2012.\nWhen asked how the Trump administration will shape its Syria policy and whether the U.S. is considering troop withdrawal from Syria, Barrack said: \u201cWhat I can assure you is that our current Syria policy will not be close to the Syria policy of the last 100 years, because none of these have worked.\u201d\nReducing the number of bases to one from eight was an important part of that shift, he said, according to an interview transcript.\nTwo security sources in bases where U.S. troops are deployed told Reuters in April that military equipment and vehicles had already moved out of eastern Deir el-Zor and were being consolidated in the province of Hasakah.\nOne of the sources said the consolidation plan involved pulling all U.S. troops out of Deir el-Zor province.\nA U.S. State Department official said separately that the military presence would be reduced \u201cif and when appropriate\u201d based on conditions, adding troops are routinely calibrated based on operational needs and contingencies.\nBarrack said that the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were a U.S. ally and a \u201cvery important factor\u201d for the U.S. Congress, and that directing them to integrate into a new Syrian government was also very important.\n\u201cEveryone needs to be reasonable in their expectations,\u201d he said.\nThe SDF is the main ally in a U.S. coalition against Islamic State militants in Syria. It is spearheaded by the YPG militia, which Ankara sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The PKK decided to disband last month after a 40-year conflict with the Turkish state.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said last week that the SDF was using \u201cstalling tactics\u201d, despite a deal with the Syrian government to integrate into Syria\u2018s armed forces.",

He is expected to face trial in the third quarter of 2026, the prosecutor\u2019s office said.\nMerzouk\u2019s family and lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the announcement.\nThe teenager was shot during a traffic stop in Nanterre.

As the car pulled forward, the officer fired once.\nAfter the killing, Nanterre prosecutor Pascal Prache said his initial investigation led him to conclude that the officer\u2019s use of his weapon was not legally justified.\nProtests over his killing spread around France and some turned violent, with stores looted and public buildings torched. Thousands of people were arrested as the government ratcheted up its law enforcement response to quell the unrest, and hundreds of people were injured. In related protests in the overseas territory of French Guiana in South America, a 54-year-old died after being hit by a stray bullet.\nThe reaction to the killing was a potent reminder of the persistent poverty, discrimination, unemployment and other lack of opportunity in neighborhoods around France where many residents trace their roots to former French colonies.",

        "Content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In mid-May, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, frustrated over what he saw as numbers of arrests and deportations of unauthorized immigrants that were too low, berated and threatened to fire senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials if they did not begin detaining 3,000 migrants a day, according to two sources who spoke to attendees.\nMiller also threatened to fire leaders of field offices posting the bottom 10% of arrest numbers monthly, the two sources said.\nWeeks later, ICE is launching the Trump administration\u2019s largest immigration crackdown.\n\u201cOperation At Large,\u201d a nationwide, ICE-led plan already underway to ramp up arrests of unauthorized immigrants, includes more than 5,000 personnel from across federal law enforcement agencies and up to 21,000 National Guard troops, according to an operation plan described to NBC News by three sources with knowledge of the personnel allocations who detailed the previously unreported plans.\nDrawing those numbers from other law enforcement agencies, though, has been a source of tension among some officials, who feel they have been taken off other core national security missions, according to three additional law enforcement and military officials. Like others interviewed for this article, they requested anonymity in order to share sensitive information.\nIt is the latest example of how President Donald Trump\u2019s push for mass deportations is reshaping federal law enforcement as officials shift resources toward immigration-related cases \u2014 including nonviolent administrative offenses \u2014 leaving less time and attention for other types of criminal investigations.\nThe plan calls for using 3,000 ICE agents, including 1,800 from Homeland Security Investigations, which generally investigates transnational crimes and is not typically involved in arresting noncriminal immigrants; 2,000 Justice Department employees from the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration; and 500 employees from Customs and Border Protection. It also includes 250 IRS agents, some of whom may be used to provide information on the whereabouts of immigrants using tax information, while others would have the authority to make arrests, according to the operation plan.\nThe Department of Homeland Security has also requested the use of 21,000 National Guard members to provide support in ICE operations, according to two additional sources familiar with the request, though that number has yet to be approved by the Defense Department or by governors who would be deploying their state\u2019s units, multiple sources cautioned.Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, responding to the Miller meeting, said, \u201cKeeping President Trump\u2019s promise to deport illegal aliens is something the Administration takes seriously. We are committed to aggressively and efficiently removing illegal aliens from the United States, and ensuring our law enforcement officers have the resources necessary to do so. The safety of the American people depends upon it.\u201d\nAssistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, \u201cUnder Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump\u2019s and the American people\u2019s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe.\u201d\nMore than a dozen current and former law enforcement sources described other changes inside federal law enforcement driven by the Trump administration\u2019s focus on immigration.\nAt the FBI, where it was once unusual for special agents to go on immigration-related law enforcement operations, according to multiple current and former law enforcement officials, field offices around the country have been ordered to assign significantly more agents to assist with ICE operations to arrest people on administrative immigration warrants.\nMisdemeanor cases for border crossings are regularly appearing in federal court, a rarity in recent years. Justice Department teams focused on other issues are being disbanded, with members being dispersed to teams focused on immigration and other administration priorities.\nAnd prosecutors say cases without immigration components have stalled or are moving more slowly, according to documents seen by NBC News and conversations with six current and former prosecutors and a senior FBI official, who described how immigration is now a central part of discussions around whether to pursue cases.\n\u201cImmigration status is now question No. 1 in terms of charging decisions,\u201d an assistant U.S. attorney said. \u201cIs this person a documented immigrant? Is this person an undocumented immigrant? Is this person a citizen? Are they somehow deportable? What is their immigration status? And the answer to that question is now largely driving our charging decisions.\u201d\nAt least one U.S. attorney\u2019s office abandoned a potential federal prosecution of someone who prosecutors felt was dangerous because the case against the person lacked an immigration component, an email obtained by NBC News showed. The office instead left the case to state prosecutors.\nReorganizing federal law enforcement to prioritize immigration could have sweeping long-term effects on the U.S. justice system. The Trump administration set early quotas for immigration arrests and has marshaled resources to go far beyond early statements about focusing only on deporting violent criminals, as well as invoking laws that have not previously been used for immigration enforcement, like the Alien Enemies Act.Prioritizing immigration also means shifting finite resources in ways that de-prioritize other cases. Last month, FBI field offices around the country shifted agents from other beats to immigration enforcement, according to current and former FBI officials and memos obtained by NBC News. A senior FBI official wrote in a memo to bureau managers that the Justice Department \u201cexpects a significant increase in the number of agents participating in immigration enforcement operations.\u201d\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that \u201cimmigration security is national security,\u201d pointing to the Egyptian national accused of launching an antisemitic attack in Colorado on Sunday. The man entered the United States on a valid visa before he filed for asylum, after which the visa expired. Jackson argued the administration\u2019s moves to prioritize immigration enforcement will not carry an opportunity cost.\n\u201cEnforcing our immigration laws and removing illegal aliens is one big way President Trump is \u2018Making America Safe Again.\u2019 But the president can walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d Jackson continued. \u201cWe\u2019re holding all criminals accountable, whether they\u2019re illegal aliens or American citizens. That\u2019s why nationwide murder rates have plummeted, fugitives from the FBI\u2019s most wanted list have been captured, and police officers are empowered to do their jobs, unlike under the Biden Administration\u2019s soft-on-crime regime.\u201d\n(Falling murder rates predate the second Trump administration, with rates rising during and immediately after the Covid pandemic before dropping in each of 2022, 2023 and the first half of 2024, according to FBI data.)\nHow immigration is affecting other law enforcement operations\nStill, federal law enforcement officials who spoke to NBC News said the increased focus on cases with an immigration angle is pulling resources from other law enforcement priorities.\n\u201cThere is such a priority on making immigration arrests that it takes longer to get answers on anything else. Something that used to be resolved in a matter of days now takes weeks,\u201d a law enforcement official said.\nThe shift in resources affects not only the type of cases taken but also the type of personnel involved in immigration raids. The FBI is almost always the agency leading the charge in joint investigations, but it has traditionally avoided getting involved in enforcement operations that involve only immigration enforcement, current and former officials confirmed.\nThose operations, which are led by ICE, involve noncriminal administrative removal warrants for immigration offenses, not the type of criminal warrants the FBI typically serves, three officials said.\nSince Trump took office, the FBI has routinely joined ICE operations. Some FBI employees have received guidance to minimize the actions they take during immigration-related raids and, particularly, to avoid entering into homes when they join ICE operations, four current and former law enforcement officials said.\nThe Trump administration is also deliberating over creating a task force led by a senior leader from the Department of Homeland Security and a senior leader from the Justice Department, according to an undated draft implementation guide reviewed by NBC News and a person familiar with the deliberations. It is unclear whether that version is the most current draft under consideration.\nThe Homeland Security Task Force would work in the FBI and ICE field offices across the country to \u201cidentify and target for prosecution transnational criminal organizations engaged in diverse criminal schemes,\u201d the draft said. It continues: \u201cIn addition to the prosecution of the above criminal violations, the mission of the HSTF is further to facilitate the removal of criminal aliens from the United States.\u201d\nThe draft plan raises questions about which additional federal resources could be pulled in solely to focus on immigration. It says the new task force would work with the National Counterterrorism Center, the U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon to \u201cassist with targeting and investigations.\u201d\nMeanwhile, it is unclear whether or when the shifting resources and reorganization will result in the Trump administration\u2019s hitting its desired deportation numbers, like the 3,000-person daily quota Miller demanded in the mid-May meeting. ICE no longer posts comprehensive daily arrest statistics, but on social media, it has posted details of at least 350 arrests since May 26.",

        "Summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The beginning of June marks the start of the traditional monthlong ruling season at the Supreme Court, when the justices hand down decisions in their biggest and most contentious cases.",
        "Content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The beginning of June marks the start of the traditional monthlong ruling season at the Supreme Court, when the justices hand down decisions in their biggest and most contentious cases.\nBut this year is different.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s second term has disrupted the court calendar, with the nine justices now spending as much time, if not more, juggling consequential emergency cases that need to be handled quickly as they do on the regular docket of cases that have gotten months of attention and deliberation.\n\u201cIt underscores the degree to which Donald Trump and the Trump administration are sucking all of the oxygen out of the room,\u201d said Leah Litman, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and the author of a new book about the court, \u201cLawless.\u201d\nThis can affect the public\u2019s knowledge and understanding of what the court is doing in part because media organizations are used to devoting additional resources to coverage during June that are not necessarily available at other times of the year, she added.\nIt also changes the normal rhythms of the court\u2019s operations. The court announces ahead of time when rulings in argued cases are expected, and they are always issued at 10 a.m. But emergency decisions can drop at any time of day, with no advance notice. One recent decision was released in the early hours of a Saturday morning.\nNearly all the emergency cases are related to the administration\u2019s aggressive interpretations of federal law in executive orders that have regularly been blocked by federal judges.\nAs June begins, the Supreme Court has 33 cases to decide out of 62 on the so-called merits docket. Those are the cases in which the justices heard arguments in the current nine-month term, which started in October, and would be expected to decide by issuing lengthy written decisions. The next scheduled ruling day is Thursday.\nIn the meantime, the court since January has already issued rulings of some description in 11 Trump-related emergency cases via what has been dubbed the \u201cshadow docket,\u201d and it has several others pending. These are cases in which the justices do not generally hear oral arguments, and they are often decided by brief court orders without the lengthy, detailed reasoning associated with major Supreme Court decisions.\nBut the shadow docket decisions can be just as practically important as the cases decided on the merits docket, sparking concerns about transparency and process.\nThis term's big Supreme Court decisions\nVia the shadow docket, the court has already allowed Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people in the military to go into effect, given a green light to the firing of independent agency members, and approved the administration\u2019s removal of legal protections for thousands of Venezuelan immigrants.\nThe justices have also put the brakes on an attempt by the administration to use a wartime law to deport Venezuelans it claims are gang members and ordered Trump to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly sent to El Salvador.\nOn Friday, the court allowed the Trump administration to revoke legal protections for more than 500,000 immigrants.\nIn the meantime, the docket of merits cases has a relatively small number of headline-grabbing cases compared with previous years.\nOf those cases yet to be decided, the biggest is a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans gender transition care for minors. The court is also set to rule on a conservative religious objection to LGBTQ-themed books in a Maryland county\u2019s schools and an effort by Texas to restrict access to pornographic websites.\nBy comparison, last June, the court\u2019s rulings included one granting Trump broad immunity from prosecution for events that took place during his first term as president, a trio of rulings that weakened federal agency power, a decision upholding a law that bars domestic abusers from possessing guns, and another rejecting a challenge to the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.\nIn the summer of 2023, the court within a matter of days ended affirmative action in college admissions and killed President Joe Biden\u2019s student loan debt relief plan.\nAnd the previous summer, the court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision.\nHow the shadow docket is changing the court\n\u201cThe emergency docket seems to have almost swallowed the court\u2019s merits docket over the past month or so,\u201d said Greg Garre, a Washington lawyer who regularly argues cases at the court. One case he argued, concerning Oklahoma\u2019s attempt to launch the first religious public charter school, was poised to be one of the biggest of the term. But it ended up fizzling when the court deadlocked 4-4.\nIn fact, some cases that arise as emergency applications have ended up being converted into merits cases, creating what some view as a \u201crocket docket\u201d \u2014 that is, major cases zooming immediately to the high court instead of taking months or years to navigate the normal appeals process.\n\u201cIn a few years, we may no longer be able to say that the emergency docket is an \u2018irregular\u2019 procedure. It might become the normal procedure for all high-stakes litigation,\u201d said William Baude, a University of Chicago Law School professor who coined the \u201cshadow docket\u201d phrase.\nOne high-profile example was the court\u2019s January decision upholding a law that was intended to ban TikTok if its Chinese owner did not immediately sell it. The Supreme Court resolved the entire case within weeks after it reached the court via an emergency appeal.\nThe court also elected to hear oral arguments in a trio of shadow docket cases concerning nationwide injunctions issued by judges that blocked Trump\u2019s plan to end birthright citizenship, in a further blurring of the regular merits docket and the fast-moving shadow docket.\nSome Supreme Court watchers have speculated that the justices deliberately kept their merits docket relatively light this term, knowing that there was the possibility of election-related cases in the fall and a potential wave of Trump-related cases if he won the election, based on what happened in his first term.\n\u201cI definitely feel like the court is reserving space in its schedule for emergency docket cases involving Trump administration initiatives,\u201d said John Elwood, another lawyer who argues cases at the court.",

        "Summary": "A federal judge on Tuesday ruled the U.S.",
        "Content": "A federal judge on Tuesday ruled the U.S. Bureau of Prisons must keep providing transgender inmates gender-affirming care, despite an executive order President Donald Trump signed on his first day back in office to halt funding for such care.\nU.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., allowed a group of more than 2,000 transgender inmates in federal prisons to pursue a lawsuit challenging the order as a class action. He ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide them with hormone therapy and accommodations such as clothing and hair-removal devices while the lawsuit plays out.\nThe ruling does not require the bureau to provide surgical care related to gender transitions.\nWhite House spokesperson Harrison Fields said the Trump administration expects to ultimately prevail in the legal dispute.\n\u201cThe District Court\u2019s decision allowing transgender women, aka MEN, in women\u2019s prisons fundamentally makes women less safe and ignores the biological truth that there are only two genders,\u201d Fields said in an email.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the inmates, said the ruling was \u201ca critical reminder to the Trump administration that trans people, like all people, have constitutional rights that don\u2019t simply disappear because the president has decided to wage an ideological battle.\u201d\nAbout 2,230 transgender inmates are housed in federal custodial facilities and halfway houses, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. About two-thirds of them, 1,506, are transgender women, most of whom are housed in men\u2019s prisons.\nThe named plaintiffs, two transgender men and one transgender woman, sued the Trump administration in March to challenge Trump\u2019s January 20 executive order aimed at combating what the administration called \u201cgender ideology extremism.\u201d\nThe executive order directed the federal government to only recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; and house transgender women in men\u2019s prisons. It also ordered the bureau to stop spending any money on \u201cany medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d\nLamberth, appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, said in Tuesday\u2019s ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their lawsuit because the bureau did not perform any analysis before cutting off treatment that its own medical staff had previously deemed to be medically appropriate for the inmates.\nEven if it had extensively studied the issue before deciding to stop gender-affirming care, the decision might still violate the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment\u2019s protections against \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment, Lamberth wrote.\nThe Department of Justice had argued that the judge should defer to the policy decision of a democratically elected president, but Lamberth said a functioning democracy requires respect for \u201call duly enacted laws,\u201d including those that blocked the executive branch from acting in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner.\nDemocratic self-governance \u201cdoes not mean blind submission to the whims of the most recent election-victor,\u201d Lamberth wrote.\nThe executive order said it was meant to promote the \u201cdignity, safety, and wellbeing of women, and to stop the spread of \u201cgender ideology\u201d which denies \u201cthe immutable biological reality of sex.\u201d But the inmates receiving hormone treatments had little interest in promoting any ideology, and were instead taking \u201cmeasures to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",

        "Content": "A Chinese researcher in Michigan and her boyfriend have been charged with smuggling a biological pathogen that \u201ccan cause devastating diseases in crops\u201d into the United States, according to federal charging documents unsealed Tuesday.\nYunqing Jian, 33, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan, and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, 34, were charged with multiple counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, smuggling goods into the country and making false statements to investigators, the complaint says.\nLiu was entering the country at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in July when border officers found the pathogen, a fungus known as Fusarium graminearum, in his backpack, according to the complaint. The small clumps of reddish plant material were discovered in four plastic baggies tucked into a wad of tissues.\nLiu and his girlfriend researched the pathogen as university students in China, the complaint says. Since 2023, Jian had been working at the University of Michigan\u2019s Molecular Plant-Microbe Interaction Laboratory.\nLiu initially told the officers that he did not know what the materials were and that someone must have planted them in his bag, but he then told a different story, the complaint says.\n\u201cLiu stated that he intentionally hid the samples in his backpack because he knew there were restrictions on the importation of the materials,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cLiu confirmed that he had intentionally put the samples in a wad of tissues so CBP Officers would be less likely to find and confiscate them, and he could continue his research in the United States.\u201d\nAccording to the complaint, Liu also said he planned to use the University of Michigan laboratory to conduct research on the pathogen. When investigators spoke to Jian, she denied knowing anything about Liu\u2019s smuggling or plans to research the pathogen, the complaint says.\nBut an examination of Liu\u2019s and Jian\u2019s electronic devices uncovered WeChat messages from 2022 in which they discussed smuggling seeds into the United States.\n\u201cI put them in my Martin boots,\u201d Liu wrote, according to the complaint. \u201cIn a small bag. The ziplock bag. Very small.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Jian replied, the complaint says. \u201cJust put it in your shoes.\u201d\nAt a federal court hearing Tuesday afternoon, a judge ordered Jian to remain behind bars after prosecutors described her as a flight risk. Liu, who was not allowed into the country after the pathogen was allegedly discovered in his backpack, remains at large.\nThe FBI Counterintelligence Division conducted the investigation.\n\u201cFusarium graminearum is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cThe toxins produced by Fusarium graminearum cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock and humans.\u201d\nU.S. Attorney Jerome Gorgon said in a statement: \u201cThe alleged actions of these Chinese nationals \u2014 including a loyal member of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 are of the gravest national security concerns.\u201d\nThe Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was not aware of the case.\n\u201cThe Chinese government has always required Chinese citizens overseas to strictly abide by local laws and regulations, while also safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law,\u201d ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.\nThe University of Michigan said it condemns \u201cany actions that seek to cause harm, threaten national security or undermine the university\u2019s critical public mission.\u201d\n\u201cIt is important to note that the university has received no funding from the Chinese government in relation to research conducted by the accused individuals,\u201d the university added in a statement. \u201cWe have and will continue to cooperate with federal law enforcement in its ongoing investigation and prosecution.\u201d",

        "Content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 In a twist, the state of Florida\u2019s top higher education board voted Tuesday against a contract for Santa Ono, who was set to be the next president of the University of Florida. The decision came after growing opposition on the right to Ono's past statements about diversity, equity and inclusion, Covid and transgender rights, among other issues.\nUnder Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has prided itself on being at the vanguard of the national conservative movement. But the rejection of Ono, the former president of the University of Michigan, put DeSantis in a thorny political position, and it was a notable outcome in a state Republican ecosystem generally defined by donors and influential figures\u2019 getting their way.\nOne of DeSantis\u2019 longtime biggest political supporters \u2014 Mori Hosseini, the billionaire chair of the University of Florida Board of Trustees \u2014 strongly backed Ono\u2019s bid to become president of the state\u2019s flagship university.\nOn the other hand, national conservatives, including Christopher Rufo, an activist who built his reputation fighting racial sensitivity trainings and critical race theory courses; Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a Trump ally running for governor; and Donald Trump Jr. argued that Ono\u2019s past support for DEI policies made him unqualified for the job.\n\u201cWTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!???\u201d Trump Jr. wrote on X last month. \u201cThis woke psycho might be a perfect fit for a Communist school in California, but how is he even being considered for this role in Florida?\n\u201cEvery single member of the Florida Board of Governors should vote against him!!!\u201d he continued.\nTwo Trump advisers familiar with the issue said his post did not speak for the White House, which was not officially engaged in the fight.\nTrump Jr.\u2019s post amplified one from Rufo, whom DeSantis has praised and whom he appointed to a separate university board in the state in 2023. Rufo's message blasted Ono for a video in which he promoted \"equity and inclusion ... embedded in all areas of academic work\u201d when he was president and vice chancellor at the University of British Columbia in Canada.\nOno\u2019s record on DEI policies, the handling of the Covid pandemic and issues like environmental justice were heavily scrutinized Tuesday at the meeting of the Florida Board of Governors, the state\u2019s top education board, which needed to vote to ratify Ono\u2019s new contract.\nOno said repeatedly that he had \u201cevolved\u201d on those issues at a hearing that lasted nearly four hours. But the board ultimately rejected him in a 10-6 vote, with notable \u201cno\u201d votes from DeSantis allies, including former state House Speakers Jose Oliva and Paul Renner, along with the outgoing leader of the state Education Department, Manny Diaz, whom DeSantis recently appointed to lead the University of West Florida.\n\u201cThere is no way those guys vote against him without getting some signal from the governor,\u201d a longtime DeSantis adviser said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone expected this, but if you look at the votes, I think that tells you where the governor is at.\u201d\nFour Florida Republicans told NBC News that their understanding was that DeSantis was initially behind Ono but that the national conservative backlash forced him to not fully put his support behind him publicly or make direct calls to the Board of Governors.\nBut behind the scenes, his team was quietly discussing how to give him a push, according to two people familiar with the matter. One of them said DeSantis' chief of staff, Jason Weida, was making calls in support of Ono ahead of the vote.\nUnderscoring the politically sensitive nature of the vote, DeSantis\u2019 political operation tried to claim some victory after it.\n\u201cSanta Ono is OUT,\u201d posted Jordan Schachtel, a newly hired DeSantis political staffer. \u201cThe Florida Board of Governors has voted to Reject Ono as President of the University of Florida.\u201d\n\u201cFlorida has voted to reject wokeness, DEI, CRT, at our flagship university,\u201d he continued.\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also praised the vote, saying it was the \"right decision.\"\nDonalds, who has Trump's backing in his 2026 bid for governor, was an Ono skeptic from the start. Notably, DeSantis\u2019 wife, Casey, is also considering a run for governor, and the two prominent Florida Republicans are seen as being on a political collision course if Casey DeSantis ultimately decides to run.\n\u201cI give credit to the Florida Board of Governors for standing up for Florida\u2019s conservative values,\u201d Donalds told NBC News. \u201cWoke has no place in our university system. It\u2019s time to restart the presidential search at UF.\u201d\nOther longtime Florida operatives said Donalds and other conservative groups amplifying the fight to the Republican political base nationally helped keep DeSantis out of the conversation in a more public way.\n\u201cThe governor was obviously all in,\u201d a DeSantis ally said. \u201cThen Byron Donalds and [the conservative group] Turning Point came out against. The governor in the end does the one thing he knows how to do: run away and protect himself.\u201d\nDeSantis\u2019 office did not respond to a request for comment.\nDuring the contentious meeting, Ono tried to explain that he has had an \u201cevolution\u201d of thought on issues like DEI and that he was both aligned with and attracted to Florida\u2019s brand of governance, which has cracked down on both.\n\u201cThose sorts of programs will not have a place at the University of Florida,\u201d he told the board.\nStill, it wasn't enough to convince the skeptics on the board.\n\u201cI really, really want to try to get to a yes,\u201d board member Carson Good said. \u201cI can\u2019t give a [yes vote], but I wish you the very best and will support you if you win.\u201d",

        "Summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The federal prosecutor who oversaw the Capitol riot investigation is speaking out about President Donald Trump's mass pardon of Jan. 6 rioters and the Trump administration's targeting of career law enforcement officials who worked cases against the people who attacked the U.S.",
        "Content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The federal prosecutor who oversaw the Capitol riot investigation is speaking out about President Donald Trump's mass pardon of Jan. 6 rioters and the Trump administration's targeting of career law enforcement officials who worked cases against the people who attacked the U.S. Capitol.\nGreg Rosen, who was the chief of the Capitol Siege Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, called the Justice Department's handling of Jan. 6 cases appropriate, proportional and righteous, noting that hundreds of defendants convicted of misdemeanors ultimately were sentenced to probation.\n\u201cThe concept that these defendants were railroaded or mistreated is belied by the actual facts,\u201d Rosen said in an interview days after he resigned from the Justice Department. \u201cThe reality is every single case was treated with the utmost scrutiny, and every single case required the same level of due process, maximal due process afforded by the U.S. Constitution.\"\nJudges appointed by presidents of both parties adjudicated the cases, and Rosen said the historical record created by the prosecutions \"is what will speak volumes, not conjecture and not speculation.\u201d\nRosen, who was previously a prosecutor in Virginia, served at the Justice Department for more than a decade, culminating in his role overseeing the Jan. 6 cases, leading a unit that was shut down when Trump came to office. Trump pardoned roughly 1,500 defendants and commuted the sentences of members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. Those pardons, Rosen said, sent the wrong message to the American public.\n\u201cThe underlying message of the pardons and the expressive nature of the pardons is that political violence is acceptable, particularly if it\u2019s done for a specific purpose,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cPolitical violence in an American society, in a constitutional republic, is essentially the brain rot of the republic. I think Benjamin Franklin once said, \u2018It\u2019s a republic if you can keep it.\u2019 To have pardons ... pardoned people who committed wrong, objectively speaking, and then to celebrate that is a message to the American people that the rule of law may not matter.\u201d\nWhite House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t need lectures from Democrats about his use of pardons\u201d before he cited President Joe Biden\u2019s pardons, including that of his son Hunter Biden and his pre-emptive pardon of Dr. Anthony Fauci. \u201cPresident Trump is using his pardon and commutation powers to right many wrongs, acting reasonably and responsibly within his constitutional authority,\u201d Fields said.\nRosen resigned from the Justice Department last week and is joining a private law firm after a tumultuous few months when some of his colleagues were fired, while he and other leaders were demoted to entry-level positions by the former interim U.S. attorney for Washington, Ed Martin, whom Trump named as his pardon attorney and as director of the Justice Department's working group investigating what Trump has called \"weaponization\" of law enforcement against himself and allies.\nRosen also spoke about the Trump administration's pending settlement of a lawsuit filed by the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to climb through a broken glass door in the building. Trump and his allies are also discussing potential settlements with Jan. 6 defendants. Rosen called the news \"shocking\" and said it was not supported by the evidence.\nThe notion that Jan. 6 defendants were \"part of some system of weaponization is just not borne out by the truth, it's not borne out by the facts,\" he said.\nThe public, Rosen said, often overlooks that the prosecutions of Jan. 6 defendants began in the final days of Trump's first term, when Trump himself was publicly declaring that rioters would be held accountable.\nRosen said it should be easy to evaluate what happened from an apolitical and nonpartisan perspective. \"A crime obviously occurred,\" Rosen said. \"We investigated that crime, we brought charges, and those charges were vetted and scrupulously analyzed by \u2014 not only internal to the department,\" before charges were brought, \"but externally, by judges and juries.\u201d\nRosen said the firings and demotions of federal employees who worked on Jan. 6 cases have left the Trump administration less prepared to handle the types of cases it proclaimed to want to prioritize.\n\"The irony here is that every single one of those prosecutors, the ones who were fired or the ones who were demoted, were individuals who would have otherwise served the community, served the District of Columbia and helped prevent violent crime in a way consistent with any administration's priorities, let alone this administration's priorities,\" Rosen said. \"Frankly, it's ridiculous that we are seeing retaliation being taken against people who did their jobs and did their jobs effectively with the full-throated support of the United States government.\"\n\u201cThis is not a circumstance where we are essentially deep state actors, so to speak. We are just trying to do our jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom my perspective, it sends a terrible message. It sends a message that every aspect of what you do will somehow be politicized or the word I think that keeps getting used is \u2018weaponized,\u2019 and that\u2019s very unfortunate.\u201d\nRosen, whose father was in law enforcement, said he always wanted to be a trial attorney. He was drawn to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington because of its unique status as an office that prosecutes both local and federal crimes.\nNow, Rosen is joining the boutique litigation firm Rogers Joseph O'Donnell, as some Washington law firms that have worked cases against Trump or his priorities face threats from the administration.\n\"Law firms, whether you are on a firm that is from big law or whether you're at a solo practitioning firm, you should be able to represent your clients zealously and zealously in a way that is not impacted by who the president of the United States is,\" Rosen said. \"There can be a chilling effect. And I think what we're seeing in the litigation across the board, particularly when it came to some of the executive orders, is that firms can be practically, morally and financially impacted in ways that could not just hurt the business, but undermine the rule of law and the ability of lawyers to fulfill their constitutional duties.\"\nRosen said he hopes the record created by the prosecutions of Jan. 6 defendants helps shape how the attack is perceived in history, even as political actors chip away at its reality.\n\"What I hope the takeaway will be to citizens of this country is that what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, was a national disgrace and then the prosecution that followed reaffirmed the principles of the rule of law and vindicated the rights and the bravery of law enforcement,\" Rosen said.\n\u201cI would not change a thing about the way we conducted ourselves and the honor in which we brought to the court and to the system,\u201d he added.\nWatch more from this story on \u201cHallie Jackson Now\u201d Tuesday night at 5 p.m. ET on NBC News Now.",

        "Content": "Citigroup on Tuesday ended a seven-year-old policy restricting how it provides banking services to firearm manufacturers, sellers and resellers.\nThe bank launched the policy in March 2018 after a teenage gunman killed 17 people and injured more than a dozen in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14 that year.\nCiti said at the time that it would require clients to \"adhere to these best practices: (1) they don't sell firearms to someone who hasn't passed a background check, (2) they restrict the sale of firearms for individuals under 21 years of age, and (3) they don't sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines.\"\nThe bank's policy applied only to its business clients, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500-sized companies. It did not restrict how Citi's personal banking customers used their cards. Citi says it provides banking services to more than 19,000 companies globally.\n\"As a society, we all know that something needs to change. And as a company, we feel we must do our part,\" Citigroup Executive Vice President of Enterprise Services and Public Affairs Ed Skyler said in 2018.\nBut Skyler says things have changed. \"The policy was intended to promote the adoption of best sales practices as prudent risk management and didn\u2019t address the manufacturing of firearms,\" he wrote Tuesday in a blog post announcing that Citi \"will no longer have a specific policy as it relates to firearms.\"\n\"Many retailers have been following these best practices,\" Skyler wrote, \"and we hope communities and lawmakers will continue to seek out ways to prevent the tragic consequences of gun violence.\"\nMarch for Our Lives, a gun-control advocacy group organized in part by students who survived the Parkland massacre, slammed Citi's decision Tuesday.\n\"Citi just chose appeasing Donald Trump over protecting the lives of kids,\" said March for Our Lives Executive Director Jackie Corin. \"Seven years ago, after 17 of my peers and teachers were murdered, Citi found the courage to say 'no more' \u2014 no more financing gun sales to teenagers. Today, they're saying our lives matter less than their politics.\"\nA Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment beyond Skyler's published remarks.\n\u201cPresident Trump is ushering in a wave of common sense, and it\u2019s encouraging to see companies like Citi embrace this by ending their discriminatory policies against millions of law-abiding gun owners in America,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said.\nThe change at Citi comes amid broader political pressure over so-called debanking, with influential tech leaders and right-wing officials having alleged in recent years that the Biden administration improperly blocked certain people, such as cryptocurrency proponents and conservatives, from banking services.\nThat argument hasn't gone away since President Donald Trump returned to the White House; he confronted the CEOs of America's two largest banks \u2014 Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 with similar complaints at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year. Both banks said at the time that they would never close an account for political reasons. Bank of America said, \"We welcome conservatives and have no political litmus test.\"\nCiti said Tuesday that it would \"update our employee Code of Conduct and our customer-facing Global Financial Access Policy to clearly state that we do not discriminate on the basis of political affiliation in the same way we are clear that we do not discriminate on the basis of other traits such as race and religion. This will codify what we\u2019ve long practiced, and we will continue to conduct trainings to ensure compliance.\"\nBanking executives have repeatedly said they terminate banking services only when there are issues with anti-money laundering laws or know-your-client regulations, not because of political affiliations.\n\"We bank 70 million American consumers, so our bank is open to everybody,\" Bank of American CEO Brian Moynihan said later.",

        "Summary": "A record amount of sargassum piled up across the Caribbean and nearby areas in May, and more is expected this month, according to a new report.",
        "Content": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2014 A record amount of sargassum piled up across the Caribbean and nearby areas in May, and more is expected this month, according to a new report.\nThe brown prickly algae is suffocating shorelines from Puerto Rico to Guyana and beyond, disrupting tourism, killing wildlife and even releasing toxic gases that forced one school in the French Caribbean island of Martinique to temporarily close.\nThe amount \u2014 38 million metric tons \u2014 is the biggest quantity of algae observed across the Caribbean Sea, the western and eastern Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico since scientists began studying the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt in 2011, said Brian Barnes, an assistant research professor at the University of South Florida who worked on the report published on Monday by the University of South Florida\u2019s Optical Oceanography Lab.\nThe previous record was set in June 2022, with some 22 million metric tons.\n\u201cThe peaks just seem to keep getting bigger and bigger year after year,\u201d he said.\nBut scientists don\u2019t know why yet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a supremely satisfying answer.\u201d\nThree different types of sargassum exist in the Caribbean and nearby areas, reproducing asexually as they remain afloat thanks to tiny air sacs. They thrive in different ways depending on sunlight, nutrients and water temperature, factors that scientists are currently studying, Barnes said.\nExperts also have said that agricultural runoff, warming waters and changes in wind, current and rain could have an effect.\nWhile large clumps of algae in the open ocean are what Barnes called a \u201chealthy, happy ecosystem\u201d for creatures ranging from tiny shrimp to endangered sea turtles, sargassum near or on shore can wreak havoc.\nIt can block sunlight that coral reefs need to survive, and if the algae sinks, it can smother reefs and sea grasses. Once it reaches shore, the creatures living in the algae die or are picked off by birds, Barnes said.\nHuge piles of stinky seaweed also are a headache for the Caribbean, where tourism often generates big money for small islands.\n\u201cIt is a challenge, but it\u2019s certainly not affecting every single inch of the Caribbean,\u201d said Frank Comito, special adviser to the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association.\nIn the popular tourist spot of Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, officials have invested in barriers to prevent sargassum from reaching the shore, he said.\nIn the Dutch Caribbean territory of St. Maarten, crews with backhoes were dispatched in late May as part of an emergency clean-up after residents complained of strong smells of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which can affect a person\u2019s respiratory system.\n\u201cThe smell is quite terrible,\u201d Barnes said.\nMeanwhile, in the French Caribbean, officials expect to soon use storage barges and an upgraded special vessel that can collect several tons of seaweed a day.\nThe sargassum \u201cdisfigures our coasts, prevents swimming and makes life impossible for local residents,\u201d French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou recently told reporters.\nBut Comito said such vessels are \u201cmassively expensive\u201d and not a popular option, noting that another option \u2014 using heavy equipment \u2014- is labor-intensive.\n\u201cYou have to be careful because there could be sea turtle eggs affected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can go in there and massively rake and scrape the whole thing.\u201d\nSome Caribbean islands struggle financially, so most of the cleanup is done by hotels, with some offering guests refunds or a free shuttle to unaffected beaches.\nEvery year, the amount of sargassum expands in late spring, peaks around summer and starts to decline in the late fall or early winter, Barnes said.\nThe new record set is hardly stationary \u2014 experts said they expect even more sargassum for June.",

        "Content": "A possible new dwarf planet has been discovered at the edge of our solar system, so far-flung that it takes around 25,000 years to complete one orbit around the sun.\nThe object, known as 2017 OF201, was found by researchers at the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University who were searching for \u201cPlanet Nine,\u201d a hypothetical planet larger than Earth that is thought to orbit beyond Neptune. Some astronomers theorize that a mysterious ninth planet, which so far remains undetected, could explain an unusual clustering of objects and other anomalies observed in the outer solar system.\nIn searching for the elusive Planet Nine, researchers instead turned up a different resident in our cosmic backyard.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very different from how Pluto was discovered,\u201d said Sihao Cheng, a member at the Institute for Advanced Study who led the research team. \u201cThis project was really an adventure.\u201d\nIf confirmed, the newfound dwarf planet would be what Cheng calls an \u201cextreme cousin\u201d of Pluto. The findings were published on the preprint website arXiv and have not yet been peer-reviewed.\nCheng and his colleagues estimate that 2017 OF201 measures about 435 miles across \u2014 significantly smaller than Pluto, which measures nearly 1,500 miles across.\nA dwarf planet is classified as a celestial body that orbits the sun that has enough mass and gravity to be mostly round, but unlike other planets, has not cleared its orbital path of asteroids and other objects.\nEritas Yang, one of the study\u2019s co-authors and a graduate student at Princeton University, said that one of 2017 OF201\u2019s most interesting features is its extremely elongated orbit. At its farthest point from the sun, the object is more than 1,600 times more distant than the Earth is to the sun.\nThe researchers found the dwarf planet candidate by meticulously sifting through a huge data set from a telescope in Chile that was scanning the universe for evidence of dark energy. By cobbling together observations over time, the researchers identified a moving object with migrations that followed a clear pattern.\n2017 OF201 is likely one of the most distant visible objects in the solar system, but its discovery suggests there could be other dwarf planets populating that region of space.\n\u201cWe were using public data that has been there for a long time,\u201d said Jiaxuan Li, a study co-author and a graduate student at Princeton University. \u201cIt was just hidden there.\u201d\nLi said the object is close to the sun at the moment, which means the researchers need to wait about a month before they can conduct follow-up observations using ground-based telescopes. The scientists are also hopeful that they can eventually secure some time to study the object with the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb Space Telescope.\nIn the meantime, Cheng said he hasn\u2019t given up searching for Planet Nine. The new discovery, however, may throw a wrench into some long-standing theories of the planet\u2019s existence.\nThe hypothesis behind Planet Nine is that a planet several times the size of Earth in the outer solar system could explain why a group of icy objects seem to have unusually clustered orbits.\n\u201cUnder the influence of Planet Nine, all objects that do not have this specific orbital geometry will eventually become unstable and get kicked out of the solar system,\u201d Yang said.\n2017 OF201\u2019s elongated orbit makes it an outlier from the clustered objects, but Yang\u2019s calculations suggest that the orbit of 2017 OF201 should remain stable over roughly the next billion years.\nIn other words, 2017 OF201 likely would not be able to remain if Planet Nine does exist. But Yang said more research is needed, and the discovery of the new dwarf planet candidate is not necessarily a death knell for Planet Nine.\nFor one, the simulations only used one specific location for Planet Nine, but scientists don't all agree on where the hypothetical planet lurks \u2014 if it's there at all.\nKonstantin Batygin, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology, proposed the existence of Planet Nine in a study published with his Caltech colleague Mike Brown in 2016.\nHe said the discovery of 2017 OF201 doesn\u2019t prove or disprove the theory. The objects in the outer solar system that are likely to show a footprint of Planet Nine\u2019s gravity, Batygin said, are the ones where the closest points on their orbits around the sun are still distant enough that they don\u2019t strongly interact with Neptune.\n\u201cThis one, unfortunately, does not fall into that category,\u201d Batygin told NBC News. \u201cThis object is on a chaotic orbit, and so when it comes to the question of \u2018What does it really mean for Planet Nine?\u2019 The answer is not very much, because it\u2019s chaotic.\u201d\nBatygin said he was excited to see the new study because it adds more context to how objects came to be in the outer solar system, and he called the researchers\u2019 efforts mining public data sets \u201cheroic.\u201d\nCheng, for his part, said he hasn\u2019t abandoned hope of finding Planet Nine.\n\u201cThis whole project started as a search for Planet Nine, and I\u2019m still in that mode,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is an interesting story for scientific discovery. Who knows if Planet Nine exists, but it can be interesting if you\u2019re willing to take some risks.\u201d",

        "Content": "Final results from a long-running U.S.-based experiment announced Tuesday show a tiny particle continues to act strangely \u2014 but that\u2019s still good news for the laws of physics as we know them.\n\u201cThis experiment is a huge feat in precision,\u201d said Tova Holmes, an experimental physicist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville who is not part of the collaboration.\nThe mysterious particles called muons are considered heavier cousins to electrons. They wobble like a top when inside a magnetic field, and scientists are studying that motion to see if it lines up with the foundational rulebook of physics called the Standard Model.\nExperiments in the 1960s and 1970s seemed to indicate all was well. But tests at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the late 1990s and early 2000s produced something unexpected: the muons weren\u2019t behaving like they should.\nDecades later, an international collaboration of scientists decided to rerun the experiments with an even higher degree of precision. The team raced muons around a magnetic, ring-shaped track \u2014 the same one used in Brookhaven\u2019s experiment \u2014 and studied their signature wiggle at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago.\nThe first two sets of results \u2014 unveiled in 2021 and 2023 \u2014 seemed to confirm the muons\u2019 weird behavior, prompting theoretical physicists to try to reconcile the new measurements with the Standard Model.\nNow, the group has completed the experiment and released a measurement of the muon\u2019s wobble that agrees with what they found before, using more than double the amount of data compared to 2023. They submitted their results to the journal Physical Review Letters.\nThat said, it\u2019s not yet closing time for our most basic understanding of what\u2019s holding the universe together. While the muons raced around their track, other scientists found a way to more closely reconcile their behavior with the Standard Model with the help of supercomputers.\nThere\u2019s still more work to be done as researchers continue to put their heads together and future experiments take a stab at measuring the muon wobble \u2014 including one at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex that\u2019s expected to start near the end of the decade. Scientists also are still analyzing the final muon data to see if they can glean information about other mysterious entities like dark matter.\n\u201cThis measurement will remain a benchmark ... for many years to come,\u201d said Marco Incagli with the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Italy.\nBy wrangling muons, scientists are striving to answer fundamental questions that have long puzzled humanity, said Peter Winter with Argonne National Laboratory.\n\u201cAren\u2019t we all curious to understand how the universe works?\u201d said Winter.",

        "Content": "President Donald Trump on Friday signed four executive orders aimed at easing regulations on and expanding the production of nuclear energy.\nThe executive orders aim to reform nuclear energy research at the Department of Energy, clear a path to allow the Energy Department to build nuclear reactors on federally-owned land, overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and expand uranium mining and enrichment in the U.S.\nThe CEOs of several nuclear energy companies \u2014 including Joseph Dominguez of Constellation Energy, Jacob DeWitte of Oklo and Scott Nolan of General Matter \u2014 stood alongside the president, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum while Trump signed the executive orders.\nIn remarks before the president signed the orders, Burgum said that they would \"turn the clock back on over fifty years of overregulation of an industry,\" adding later that \"each of these help attack separate issues that have held back this industry.\"\nMeanwhile, Trump described the nuclear energy industry as \"hot,\" telling reporters, \"It's a hot industry. It's a brilliant industry. You have to do it right.\"\nA senior administration official who briefed reporters ahead of the signing said that the executive order that will allow nuclear reactors to be built on federal land was aimed in part at helping address growing electricity demand due to AI technology, telling reporters that the order, \"allows for safe and reliable nuclear energy to power and operate critical defense facilities and AI data centers.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s executive orders also aim to speed up the review and regulatory processes for building and operating nuclear reactors, with the fourth executive order including a provision that requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to make decisions on new nuclear reactor licenses within 18 months, the official said.\nThe new timetable reflected a goal of \"lowering regulatory burdens and shortening the licensing timeline\" for nuclear reactors, they added.\nDominguez, in remarks before Trump signed the orders, lauded the president's decision to shorten the nuclear regulatory process, saying that, \"The problem in the industry has historically been regulatory delay.\"\n\"We\u2019re wasting too much time on permitting, and we\u2019re answering silly questions, not the important ones,\" he added later.\nNuclear energy has been seen as a way to help transition away from fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions because nuclear power generates electricity without burning coal, oil or natural gas.\nWhile production of solar and wind energy has tripled in the United States over the past decade, there are concerns that available power sources will not be able to keep up with the enormous demand for energy \u2014 particularly in the years ahead as artificial intelligence systems account for huge amounts of global power consumption.\nIn remarks shortly before the president signed the executive orders in the Oval Office, Hegseth addressed the need for more energy to fuel AI, telling reporters, \"We're including artificial intelligence in everything we do. If we don't, we're not fast enough. We're not keeping up with adversaries. You need the energy to fuel it. Nuclear is a huge part of that.\"\nA report released this month from the consulting firm ICF International estimated that electricity demand in the U.S. will increase 25% by 2030 (compared to 2023) and will jump 78% by 2050, largely as a result of the growing need for data centers to support AI technology.\nEven with a sped-up regulatory process, it could take years to complete construction and scale up nuclear infrastructure. Nuclear power also has considerable risks compared to other \u201cgreen\u201d energy sources. For one, it requires long-term strategies for how to manage and dispose of hazardous waste. There is also the potential for accidents, such as a core meltdown, or targeted attacks that could release radioactive contamination into the environment.\nTrump on Friday also signed a fifth executive order calling for the restoration of \"gold standard science as a cornerstone of federal scientific research,\" the senior administration official said.\nMichael Kratsios, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology, told reporters Friday that the executive orders \u201cwill ensure continued American strength and global leadership in science and technology.\"",

        "Content": "Kentucky is known as the land of horses, bourbon and bluegrass \u2014 and soon, it will be home to a whole lot of cicadas.\nBillions of the winged insects are set to emerge from underground starting this month for a weekslong, frenzied and famously noisy mating ritual.\nThis year, cicadas are expected to pop out of the ground in nearly a dozen states, but the emergence will mostly be centered in Kentucky and Tennessee. The insects will also appear in Illinois, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and small portions of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New York.\nSome have nicknamed this season\u2019s cicadas the \u201cbourbon brood,\u201d because of their concentration across Kentucky.\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of the epicenter, so it just felt like we could make it Kentucky proud,\u201d said Jonathan Larson, an assistant extension professor in entomology at the University of Kentucky.\nThe bugs are known as periodical cicadas, because they spend a fixed number of years underground before coming to the surface to search for a mate. Seven broods of periodical cicadas can be found in North America, and depending on their type, they emerge either once every 13 years or once every 17 years.\nThis year\u2019s cicadas belong to Brood XIV, which live on a 17-year cycle.\nLarson said the \u201cbourbon brood\u201d moniker is apt because the insects\u2019 periodical nature is somewhat akin to the process of distilling Kentucky\u2019s famous whiskey.\n\u201cYou have to age bourbon,\u201d Larson said. \u201cWe put it in barrels in the dark for a long time, so it\u2019s kind of similar.\u201d\nCicada sightings have already begun in some southern counties in Kentucky, according to Larson, but the real show will begin in the coming weeks as the soil warms.\n\u201cI would expect in the next two weeks, we\u2019ll really hit full stride,\u201d he said.\nWhen that happens, some areas will be literally blanketed with cicadas. But it's not just the sheer number of them that make periodical cicada emergences a distinct experience, it's also the ear-piercing noise that comes with it.\nCicadas emit a high-pitched buzzing that can reach up to 100 decibels. The raucous noise is actually their mating song, used to find and attract females. After the insects emerge from underground, the females have only a few weeks to find a mate and lay their eggs before they die.\n\u201cThe whole thing is wild and beautiful and weird and kind of wonderful,\u201d Larson said.\nCicadas are harmless to humans, but some people find them a nuisance, especially after the insects die and huge numbers of carcasses cover the ground.\n\u201cAt this early stage, there won\u2019t be any smells or anything, but later, in about five weeks, as many of them have died, there can be kind of a rotten, decomposing smell in some areas, if there\u2019s big enough piles of them,\u201d Larson said.\nThousands of species of cicadas can be found around the world, but periodical cicadas are different because they spend the majority of their lives below ground, where they feed on tree roots and wait either 13 years or 17 years before tunneling to the surface.\nThe first cicadas typically emerge in waves sometime in early or mid-May, but most will make their way to the surface in June when conditions are warmer. Larson said cicadas usually wait for soil temperatures to hit around 64 degrees Fahrenheit before they make their push for the surface.\nThe insects\u2019 dependence on environmental cues has raised concerns about how climate change may be affecting cicadas and their mating ritual.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s warmer earlier in the year, there is the potential that they could start moving closer to the surface before they ought to,\u201d Larson said, and this could prove deadly to cicadas, since \u201cwe could have a late freeze or extreme weather events like flooding, which we\u2019ve seen a lot of in Kentucky.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an active area of research for scientists, who are particularly interested in studying the long-term impacts of climate change on cicada broods.\nMeanwhile, in the coming weeks Larson and other bug enthusiasts across multiple states will have the chance to witness a fascinating phenomenon.\n\u201cI hope people will go and try to experience it,\u201d Larson said. \u201cIt only happens here in the U.S. There aren\u2019t other places that can experience this, so I encourage people to do cicada tourism if they can.\u201d\nCitizen scientists can even help with research efforts by snapping pictures of the insects and recording geographical details about sightings on an app called Cicada Safari.",

        "Summary": "To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
        "Content": "To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.\nScientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papua New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.\nHeat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.\nScientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that\u2019s still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.\n\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.\nThough scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.\nCertain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.\nOther animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn\u2019t yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.\n\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.\nThe tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it\u2019s not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.\nResearchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.\n\u201cThese natural systems really are under stress, but there\u2019s a capacity for incredible resilience,\u201d Versteeg said.",

        "Summary": "A new Food and Drug Administration AI tool that could speed up reviews and approvals of medical devices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps is struggling with simple tasks, according to two people familiar with it.",
        "Content": "A new Food and Drug Administration AI tool that could speed up reviews and approvals of medical devices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps is struggling with simple tasks, according to two people familiar with it.\nThe tool \u2014 which is still in beta testing \u2014 is buggy, doesn\u2019t yet connect to the FDA\u2019s internal systems and has issues when it comes to uploading documents or allowing users to submit questions, the people say. It\u2019s also not currently connected to the internet and can\u2019t access new content, such as recently published studies or anything behind a paywall.\nThe artificial intelligence, internally dubbed CDRH-GPT, is intended to help staffers at the agency\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a division responsible for ensuring the safety of devices implanted in the body, as well as essential tools like X-rays and CT scanners.\nThe division was among those affected by the sweeping mass layoffs at the Department for Health and Human Services earlier this year. While many of the device reviewers were spared, the agency eliminated much of the backend support that enables them to issue approval decisions on time.\nThe work of reviewers includes sifting through large amounts of data from animal studies and clinical trials. Depending on the applicant, it can take months or even over a year \u2014 which an AI tool could feasibly help shorten.\nExperts, however, are concerned that the FDA\u2019s push toward AI could outpace what the technology is actually ready for.\nSince taking over the agency on April 1, Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has pushed to integrate artificial intelligence across the FDA\u2019s divisions. How this move into AI could affect the safety and effectiveness of drugs or medical devices hasn\u2019t been determined.\nLast month, Makary set a June 30 deadline for the AI rollout. On Monday, he said the agency was ahead of schedule.\nBut the two people familiar with CDRH-GPT say that it still needs significant work and that FDA staff were already concerned about meeting the June deadline, at least in its original form.\n\u201cI worry that they may be moving toward AI too quickly out of desperation, before it\u2019s ready to perform,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, the head of the medical ethics division at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. He stressed that reviewing medical devices accurately is essential, since people\u2019s lives depend on it.\n\u201cIt still needs human supplementation,\u201d Caplan said. AI \u201cis really just not intelligent enough yet to really probe the applicant or challenge or interact.\u201d\nThe FDA directs all media inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services. A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment.\nOn Monday, Makary announced that a separate AI tool, called Elsa, had been rolled out to all FDA employees. Elsa is now intended for basic tasks agencywide, such as summarizing data from adverse event reports.\n\u201cThe first reviewer who used this AI assistant tool actually said that the AI did in six minutes what it would normally take him two to three days to do,\u201d Makary said in an interview last week. \u201cAnd we\u2019re hoping that those increased efficiencies help. So I think we\u2019ve got a bright future.\u201d\nThe reality inside the agency is quite different, the same two sources said.\nWhile the concept is solid and a step in the right direction, they said, some staff feel it\u2019s being rushed and not yet ready for prime time.\n\u201cAI tools to help with certain tasks for reviewers and scientists seems reasonable given the potential utility of AI,\u201d one of the people said. However, the person said they disagree with the \u201caggressive roll out\u201d and claims that it could reduce work \u201cby hours and days.\u201d\nTo be sure, experts say, it\u2019s not uncommon for a company or government agency to launch a new product and then refine it through iterative updates over time.\nStaff have worked hard to get Elsa up and running, the people said, but it still can\u2019t handle some core functions and needs more development before it can support the agency\u2019s complex regulatory work.\nWhen staff tested the tool Monday with questions about FDA-approved products or other public information, it provided summaries that were either incorrect or only partially accurate, one of the people said.\nIt\u2019s unclear, the people said, whether CDRH-GPT will eventually be integrated into Elsa or remain a standalone system.\nRichard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and a former government ethics lawyer, said there are also concerns about potential conflicts of interest. He wondered whether there is a protocol in place to prevent any government official \u2014 such as an FDA reviewer using the technology \u2014 from having financial ties with companies that could benefit from AI. While the technology has existed for years, he said, it\u2018s still a new venture for the FDA.\n\u201cWe need to make sure that the people involved in these decisions do not have a financial interest in the artificial intelligence companies that would get the contracts,\u201d Painter said. \u201cA conflict of interest can greatly compromise the integrity and the reputation of a federal agency.\u201d\nSome at the FDA don\u2019t see AI as a solution to their overwhelming workloads \u2014 they see it as a sign that they may eventually be replaced.\nThe FDA is \u201calready spread thin from the RIF [layoffs] and the steady loss of individuals while in a hiring freeze and no capacity to backfill,\u201d one of the people said.",

        "Summary": "As cancer drug deaths pile up, doctors are increasingly testing for gene variants that can cause thousands of patients to suffer harsh chemo toxicity.",
        "Content": "JoEllen Zembruski-Ruple, while in the care of New York City\u2019s renowned Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, swallowed the first three chemotherapy pills to treat her squamous cell carcinoma on Jan. 29, her family members said. They didn\u2019t realize the drug could kill her.\nSix days later, Zembruski-Ruple went to Sloan Kettering\u2019s urgent care department to treat sores in her mouth and swelling around her eyes. The hospital diagnosed oral yeast infection and sent her home, her sister and partner said. Two days later, they said, she returned in agony \u2014 with severe diarrhea and vomiting \u2014 and was admitted. \u201cEnzyme deficiency,\u201d Zembruski-Ruple texted a friend.\nThe 65-year-old, a patient advocate who had worked for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and other groups, would never go home.\nCovered in bruises and unable to swallow or talk, she eventually entered hospice care and died March 25 from the very drug that was supposed to extend her life, said her longtime partner, Richard Khavkine. Zembruski-Ruple was deficient in the enzyme that metabolizes capecitabine, the chemotherapy drug she took, said Khavkine and Susan Zembruski, one of her sisters. Zembruski-Ruple was among about 1,300 Americans each year who die from the toxic effects of that pill or its cousin, the IV drug fluorouracil known as 5-FU.\nDoctors can test for the deficiency \u2014 and then either switch drugs or lower the dosage if patients have a genetic variant that carries risk. The FDA approved an antidote in 2015, but it\u2019s expensive and must be administered within four days of the first chemotherapy treatment.\nNewer cancer drugs sometimes include a companion diagnostic to determine whether a drug works with an individual patient\u2019s genetics. But 5-FU went on the market in 1962 and sells for about $17 a dose; producers of its generic aren\u2019t seeking approval for toxicity tests, which typically cost hundreds of dollars.\nDoctors have only gradually understood which gene variants are dangerous in which patients, and how to deal with them, said Alan Venook, a colorectal and liver cancer specialist at the University of California-San Francisco.\nBy the time Zembruski-Ruple\u2019s doctors told her she had the deficiency, she had been on the drug for eight days, said Khavkine, who watched over his partner with her sister throughout the seven-week ordeal.\nKhavkine said he \u201cwould have asked for the test\u201d if he had known about it, but added \u201cnobody told us about the possibility of this deficiency.\u201d Zembruski-Ruple\u2019s sister also said she wasn\u2019t warned about the fatal risks of the chemo, or told about the test.\n\u201cThey never said why they didn\u2019t test her,\u201d Zembruski said. \u201cIf the test existed, they should have said there is a test. If they said, \u2018Insurance won\u2019t cover it,\u2019 I would have said, \u2018Here\u2019s my credit card.\u2019 We should have known about it.\u201d\nGuidance moves at a glacial pace\nDespite growing awareness of the deficiency, and an advocacy group made up of grieving friends and relatives who push for routine testing of all patients before they take the drug, the medical establishment has moved slowly.\nA panel of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN \u2014 specialists from Sloan Kettering and other top research centers \u2014 until recently did not recommend testing, and the FDA does not require it.\nIn response to a query from KFF Health News about its policy, Sloan Kettering spokesperson Courtney Nowak said the hospital treats patients \u201cin accordance with NCCN guidelines.\u201d She said the hospital would not discuss a patient\u2019s care.\nOn Jan. 24, the FDA issued a warning about the enzyme deficiency in which it urged health care providers to \u201cinform patients prior to treatment\u201d about the risks of taking 5-FU and capecitabine.\nOn March 31 \u2014 six days after Zembruski-Ruple\u2019s death \u2014 the network\u2019s expert panel for most gastrointestinal cancers took a first step toward recommending testing for the deficiency.\nWorried that President Donald Trump\u2019s FDA might do nothing, Venook said, the panel \u2014 whose guidance shapes the practices of oncologists and health insurers \u2014 recommended that doctors consider testing before dosing patients with 5-FU or capecitabine.\nHowever, its guidance stated that \u201cno specific test is recommended at this time,\u201d citing a lack of data to \u201cinform dose adjustments.\u201d\nSloan Kettering \u201cwill consider this guidance in developing personalized treatment plans for each patient,\u201d Nowak told KFF Health News.\nThe new NCCN guidance was \u201cnot the blanket recommendation we were working toward, but it is a major step toward our ultimate goal,\u201d said Kerin Milesky, a public health official in Brewster, Massachusetts, who\u2019s part of an advocacy group for testing. Her husband, Larry, died two years ago at age 73 after a single treatment of capecitabine.\nEuropean drug regulators began urging oncologists to test patients for deficiency in May 2020. Patients with potentially risky genetics are started on a half-dose of the cancer drug. If they suffer no major toxicity, the dose is increased.\nA lifesaving ultimatum?\nEmily Alimonti, a 42-year-old biotech salesperson in upstate New York, chose that path before starting capecitabine treatment in December. She said her doctors \u2014 including an oncologist at Sloan Kettering \u2014 told her they didn\u2019t do deficiency testing, but Alimonti insisted. \u201cNope,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not starting it until I get the test back.\u201d\nThe test showed that Alimonti had a copy of a risky gene variant, so doctors gave her a lower dose of the drug. Even that has been hard to tolerate; she\u2019s had to skip doses because of low white blood cell counts, Alimonti said. She still doesn\u2019t know whether her insurer will cover the test.\nAround 300,000 people are treated with 5-FU or capecitabine in the United States each year, but its toxicity could well have prevented FDA approval were it up for approval today. Short of withdrawing a drug, however, U.S. regulators have little power to manage its use. And 5-FU and capecitabine are still powerful tools against many cancers.\nAt a January workshop that included FDA officials and cancer specialists, Venook, the NCCN panel\u2019s co-chair, asked whether it was reasonable to recommend that doctors obtain a genetic test \u201cwithout saying what to do with the result.\u201d\nBut Richard Pazdur, the FDA\u2019s top cancer expert, said it was time to end the debate and commence testing, even if the results could be ambiguous. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the information, how do you have counseling?\u201d he asked.\nTwo months later, Venook\u2019s panel changed course. The price of tests has fallen below $300 and results can be returned as soon as three days, Venook said. Doubts about the FDA\u2019s ability to further confront the issue spurred the panel\u2019s change of heart, he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if FDA is going to exist tomorrow,\u201d Venook told KFF Health News. \u201cThey\u2019re taking a wrecking ball to common sense, and that\u2019s one of the reasons we felt we had to go forward.\u201d\nOn May 20, the FDA posted a Federal Register notice seeking public input on the issue, a move that suggested it was considering further action.\nVenook said he often tests his own patients, but the results can be fuzzy. If the test finds two copies of certain dangerous gene variants in a patient, he avoids using the drug. But such cases are rare \u2014 and Zembruski-Ruple was one of them, according to her sister and Khavkine.\nMany more patients have a single copy of a suspect gene, an ambiguous result that requires clinical judgment to assess, Venook said.\nA full-gene scan would provide more information but adds expense and time, and even then the answer may be murky, Venook said. He worries that starting patients on lower doses could mean fewer cures, especially for newly diagnosed colon cancer patients.\nPower should rest with patients\nScott Kapoor, a Toronto-area emergency room physician whose brother Anil, a much-loved urologist and surgeon, died of 5-FU toxicity at age 58 in 2023, views Venook\u2019s arguments as medical paternalism. Patients should decide whether to test and what to do with the results, he said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s better \u2014 don\u2019t tell the patient about the test, don\u2019t test them, potentially kill them in 20 days?\u201d he said. \u201cOr tell them about the testing while warning that potentially the cancer will kill them in a year?\u201d\n\u201cPeople say oncologists don\u2019t know what to do with the information,\u201d said Karen Merritt, whose mother died after an infusion of 5-FU in 2014. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not a doctor, but I can understand the Mayo Clinic report on it.\u201d\nThe Mayo Clinic recommends starting patients on half a dose if they have one suspect gene variant. And \u201cthe vast majority of patients will be able to start treatment without delays,\u201d Daniel Hertz, a clinical pharmacologist from the University of Michigan, said at the January meeting.\nSome hospitals began testing after patients died because of the deficiency, said Lindsay Murray, of Andover, Massachusetts, who has advocated for widespread testing since her mother was treated with capecitabine and died in 2021.\nIn some cases, Venook said, relatives of dead patients have sued hospitals, leading to settlements.\nKapoor said his brother \u2014 like many patients of non-European origin \u2014 had a gene variant that hasn\u2019t been widely studied and isn\u2019t included in most tests. But a full-gene scan would have detected it, Kapoor said, and such scans can also be done for a few hundred dollars.\nThe cancer network panel\u2019s changed language is disappointing, he said, though \u201cbetter than nothing.\u201d\nIn video tributes to Zembruski-Ruple, her friends, colleagues, and clients remembered her as kind, helpful, and engaging. \u201cJoEllen was beautiful both inside and out,\u201d said Barbara McKeon, a former colleague at the MS Society. \u201cShe was funny, creative, had a great sense of style.\u201d\n\u201cJoEllen had this balance of classy and playful misbehavior,\u201d psychotherapist Anastatia Fabris said. \u201cMy beautiful, vibrant, funny, and loving friend JoEllen.\u201d",

        "Content": "American teens are increasingly turning to the weight-loss drug Wegovy as more families and their doctors gain confidence in its use for young people with obesity, new data shared with Reuters shows.\nThe average rate of teens beginning treatment with the highly effective Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO drug grew 50% last year to 14.8 prescriptions per 100,000 adolescents, according to an analysis by health data firm Truveta.\nThat\u2019s up from a rate of 9.9 prescriptions per 100,000 in 2023, the first full year that Wegovy was available to children aged 12 and older. The average rate climbed further during the first three months of this year, reaching 17.3 new prescriptions per 100,000.\nThat still represents a minute fraction of the estimated 23,000 out of every 100,000 teens in the country who are living with obesity, and is far slower than the uptake among U.S. adults.\n\u201cIt\u2019s promising that more young people are using these medications, but it\u2019s still a very small percentage of patients with severe obesity that are getting access to them,\u201d said Dr. Cate Varney, director of obesity medicine at the University of Virginia Health system. \u201cWhen lifestyle changes alone are insufficient, we need these additional tools.\u201d\nFor its analysis, Truveta reviewed the electronic health records of 1.3 million patients ages 12 through 17. The data covers 30 U.S. health systems with more than 900 hospitals and 20,000 clinics across the country.\nThe analysis did not include other GLP-1 drugs, including Novo\u2019s Ozempic and Eli Lilly\u2019s LLY.N Zepbound, which are not approved to treat obesity in adolescents, or compounded versions of these therapies.\nWegovy became an option to treat adolescents in late 2022 after decades in which the conventional approaches of diet, exercise and counseling largely failed.\nAbout 8 million American teens, or 23% of people ages 12 to 19, have obesity, up from 5% in 1980, according to U.S. government data. Young people with obesity run a much higher risk of developing chronic, costly, life-shortening conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular and liver diseases.\nIn January 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommended that doctors provide weight-loss drugs to children with obesity starting at age 12. Yet the medical community has not uniformly embraced GLP-1s for adolescents.\nSome doctors are hesitant because the drugs\u2019 long-term safety for children during a critical phase of development is unknown, and the treatments may need to be used indefinitely.\nOverall, there are limited options for many teens and their parents because insurance plans often do not cover any treatment for obesity, including intensive behavioral counseling, visits with a dietician or the new GLP-1 medications.\nAt Nemours Children\u2019s Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware, the Healthy Weight and Wellness Clinic treated about 2,000 adolescent patients last year.\nAbout 25% were prescribed Wegovy or another GLP-1 medication, said Dr. Thao-Ly Phan, the clinic\u2019s medical director. The number of adolescents with a GLP-1 prescription nearly doubled from 2023.\nOn average, their patients taking a GLP-1 drug lost 15 pounds (6.8 kg) within 6 to 12 months, and nearly 30 pounds after more than a year.\nFor many of the other patients, the medications were not an option, either because of insurance hurdles or concern within families about potential risks. Other teens opted for lifestyle changes or older, cheaper weight-loss drugs, with some success.\n\u201cIt is important for us to continue to monitor and better understand outcomes from the medications \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 before widespread use,\u201d Phan said.\nU.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the idea of prescribing Ozempic or Wegovy widely to children to treat obesity.\nIn a federal health report he released last month, GLP-1 drugs were cited as an example of the \u201covermedicalization of our kids.\u201d It noted a lack of \u201clong-term safety data, raising the specter of unforeseen problems that interrupt, damage, or impair metabolism and growth development.\u201d\nNovo in a statement said semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, \u201cdid not appear to affect growth or pubertal development\u201d during its clinical trials involving teens.\nFor many adults, Novo said, obesity starts in childhood or adolescence, and \u201cwe are confident in the proven safety and efficacy of our GLP-1 medicines.\u201d\nEli Lilly\u2019s weight-loss drug Zepbound is in late-stage clinical trials for use by adolescents. Lilly told Reuters that \u201cthere has been no evidence to date suggesting impairment in growth or metabolism\u201d from GLP-1 medications.\nDr. Robert Siegel, a pediatrician and director of the Center for Better Health and Nutrition at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital, said about 15% of adolescents being treated there were prescribed Wegovy or a similar GLP-1 medication from July 2021 to July 2023. They include patients being treated for type 2 diabetes for which the GLP-1 drugs were originally developed.\nSiegel said he prefers to start teens on three to six months of intensive lifestyle management before even considering medication.\nWhile obesity specialists can help navigate potential risks from the drugs, many primary-care providers need more training, he said. They may not have the equipment to monitor for the loss of muscle mass \u2014 a side effect of these medicines \u2014 or lack the resources to work with families over an extended period on healthier eating and exercise.\n\u201cThese medications are likely to be needed for a very long time to maintain weight,\u201d Siegel said, \u201cand we only have a relatively short-term experience with them.\u201d",

        "Summary": "Instead of wearing traditional cotton socks, opt for these editor-approved workout socks for low- and high-impact training. Shop from brands like Bombas, Feetures and more.",
        "Content": "I used to think all socks were the same \u2014 a pack of cotton socks were all-purpose in my eyes. I would pick up a pack from the drugstore and use them for everything. That was until I finally tried dedicated workout socks. These socks help me get through my exercise in ways I couldn\u2019t imagine, including giving me more compression in my arches and increasing overall comfort.\nHowever, not all workout socks are the same. Many are designed for specific exercises like running and cycling. To help you find the best workout socks for your fitness journey, I spoke to experts about what to consider, including fabric compositions, and gathered NBC Select staff-tested options that align with their expert guidance.\nHow I picked the best workout socks\nChoosing the best workout socks is often based on personal preferences, including design features and materials. However, our experts helped weigh in on key features to be mindful of when shopping. When curating this list, I kept the following in mind:\n- Material: One of the main things that make workout socks different from the socks you wear on a daily basis is their composition. Workout socks can include fabrics such as cotton, nylon, polyester, spandex/elastane and wool. Traditional cotton socks tend to soak up moisture, while these fabrics wick away sweat, regulate temperature and offer more stretch. All of the socks below have at least two of these materials.\n- Activity: Workout socks are made for various low- and high-impact fitness activities. This list has options for all movements, including specific choices for running, yoga, cycling and more.\n- Price: Unlike standard cotton socks you might wear daily, workout socks tend to have a higher price point because of material composition and design elements. My list has individual socks as low as $10 and bundles as high as $52.\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nThe best workout socks of 2025\nBest overall\nFeetures make some of our favorite socks, including the Elite Max Cushion pair. I wear them for every activity \u2014 running, HIIT classes, strength training \u2014 because they make my arches feel more comfortable, thanks to its medium compression. They also offer so much cushioning that it feels like pillows are on my feet. Although they initially feel thick and plush, they are lightweight and breathable, so my feet never feel sweaty after 30+ minutes of constant movement. Plus, I noticed they hold up well even after frequent wear and washes.\nBest for high-intensity workouts\nForme\u2019s Ankle Guard socks won an NBC Select Wellness Award for best overall workout socks. NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio tested these socks and loved the support. \u201cThese are the perfect socks for all kinds of workouts, whether I\u2019m running on the treadmill or taking a HIIT class,\u201d says Godio. \u201cThey\u2019re tighter around the ankles, which gives me a great amount of support when walking or running. The best part is that they\u2019re not restrictive and very breathable, so I can wear them all day.\u201d\nBest grip\nNBC Select reporter Zoe Malin also tested these NBC Select Wellness Award winners and loves wearing them during her reformer pilates and barre classes. \u201cThe material is soft and comfortable against my skin, and even though I\u2019ve washed them dozens of times, they\u2019re still pretty sticky,\u201d she says. \u201cI love the crew length \u2014 since they cover my ankles, they rarely slip down.\u201d\nBest crew\nTo run the New York City Marathon, NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson chose her Saucony sneakers with these accompanying socks. \u201cI prefer the ankle-height option because they help make me feel more stable when running,\u201d she says. The Saucony is also good at wicking away sweat thanks to the polyester construction and it has decent stretch thanks to the spandex.\nBest ribbed\nNBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown loves wearing these socks during her yoga and dumbbell workouts. \u201cThe fabric is nice and thick and the design is fun to show off too,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to wear them in the summer with shorts.\u201d The crew workout socks come in either green or pink stripes and the ribbing holds the socks in place, according to the brand.\nBest half-crew length\nThis pair of half-crew length socks from Set is another favorite of Godio\u2019s, who wears them whenever she goes on long runs or walks. \u201cI\u2019ve looked high and low for crew socks that look good with my running sneakers (obviously in an attempt to be on trend), and these fit the bill,\u201d she says. \u201cThey aren\u2019t super long, so they don\u2019t shorten my legs when I wear them, which is a huge problem I have with socks that go above my ankles. Plus, they\u2019re amazing quality \u2014 I\u2019ve put them through the wringer in terms of high-intensity workouts, and they\u2019re still as good as new.\u201d\nBest no-show\nMalin also recommends these no-show socks due to their versatility. \u201cI love these socks because they\u2019re so reliable \u2014 I can wear them for running, training and walking. The heel and toe is slightly more cushioned than the other parts of the sock, which is exactly where I need the most support,\u201d she says. \u201cI also appreciate the heel tab, which protects my ankles from rubbing against the back of my shoe and getting blisters. I\u2019ve worn these weekly for about six months and wash them constantly, and they\u2019re still in great shape.\u201d\nBest ankle\nThese Wellness Award winners are another favorite of Malin's, who wears them for any fitness activity because they have enough cushion to support her as she runs and trains. Our testers also love that they are breathable and moisture-wicking, and they never have issues with the socks falling or slipping off their heel as they move around.\nBest for cycling\nWhen running outside or cycling in sub-40-degree temperatures, NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz chooses this Swiftwick Pursuit pair. \u201cMy hands and feet get cold easily, so I pay special attention to socks and gloves during winter,\u201d he says. \u201cThese socks are made with 60% Merino wool, which keeps my feet much warmer than any other material I\u2019ve tried.\u201d\nBest for pilates\nExperts in our guide to the best Pilates socks suggest these grip socks because they\u2019re durable, snug and support your arches. The ankle socks have slight cushioning, and to prevent any discomfort, they also have a heel tab to protect the Achilles tendon, according to the brand.\nBest for running\n\u201cThese running socks hug my arches just the right amount, which helps reduce swelling when I\u2019m on my long runs,\u201d says Swanson. \u201cInevitably, my feet will always be sore after 17 miles, but these make a huge difference in the level of comfort I experience.\u201d\nBest for yoga\n\u201cI love that these socks are toeless and breathable because I overheat easily, so I can wear them without wanting to immediately rip them off,\u201d says Brown, who practices yoga most mornings in her living room. \u201cThe grips on the bottom work on a range of yoga mats, in my experience, and they help to keep the sock from sliding around on my foot. I\u2019ve had these socks for years and the grippies are all still in place after being washed over and over.\u201d\nBest bundle\n\u201cThese are by far my favorite workout and lounge socks,\u201d says NBC Select page Ella Morrissey, who loves the Bombas Marl Ankle Socks so much she purchased them in a pack. \u201cThey are incredibly comfortable, have the right level of thickness, and don\u2019t get worn down by my shoes when I\u2019m running.\u201d Although this quartet is in women\u2019s sizing, it also comes in men\u2019s sizing.\nHow to shop for workout socks\nTo help you determine which workout sock is best, our experts suggest looking at material composition, compression, cushion and more.\nMaterial\nYou might notice a few different fabric blends in workout socks because certain materials have specific benefits, including sweat-wicking. Below, Preeti Gopinath, an associate professor of textiles at The New School\u2019s Parsons School of Design, breaks down five you may commonly see on a label:\n- Cotton: This fabric will soak away sweat. However, it takes longer to evaporate and dry, so your feet might stay wet when wearing 100% cotton.\n- Polyester and nylon: These two focus on wicking away moisture and evaporating it quickly so feet stay dry and cool. This is called comfort cooling \u2014 the faster the sweat evaporates from your skin, the cooler your feet will feel. These also help improve the socks\u2019 durability because they are made of filament fibers versus cotton, which is made of multiple fibers twisted together where each joint becomes a breaking point. One of the main differences between polyester and nylon is that nylon has a little more stretch.\n- Merino wool: Merino wool is a great fabric to consider because it\u2019s soft, can keep your feet warm and resists moisture, which is great for short periods when working out. However, once it soaks up a lot of moisture, it can become heavy and gross.\n- Spandex/elastane: Spandex primarily adds a stretch to the socks and is the stretchiest of all fabrics. No matter how much they may spread, they will revert to their original shape.\nWhile the material of your sock may depend on personal preference, it\u2019s also essential to pay attention to how it impacts the overall health of your foot when working out. Socks made 100% out of synthetic materials may increase the risk of infections like athlete\u2019s foot because they may not find the balance of moisture-wicking and breathability, says Dr. Alicia Canzanese, a board-certified podiatrist. Therefore, socks should combine natural and synthetic fabrics to increase the benefits and lower risk, Canzanese says.\nCompression\nOn the sock label, you may see arch support and arch compression; however, they do not mean the same thing or are used interchangeably. Arch compression is an excellent quality in workout socks because it helps with comfortability by increasing blood flow and helps reduce swelling and fluid build-up, according to Canzanese. It can also provide relief from plantar fasciitis, says Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a board-certified podiatrist. Calf compression socks can help support conditions like shin splints and ankle instability and prevent generalized swelling, according to Parthasarathy.\nCushion\nWith socks, you don\u2019t want too much of a good thing; instead, you\u2019ll want more balance when it comes to cushioning. Cushioning plays a significant role in comfortability; however, too much cushioning can take up more room in your shoe and can increase the risk of blisters because there\u2019s a risk of more friction with a lack of space, says Canzanese. If you need lots of cushioning for comfort, you\u2019re better off looking for that in your workout sneakers instead of a pair of socks or wearing multiple layers of socks, she says.\nFit\nThe socks should fit like a glove especially around the arch, says Parthasarathy. You also want the heel area of the sock to align with your foot without the sock itself stretching out. Your feet should not slide around in the socks, nor should your feet feel restricted in them. This helps you avoid blisters, discomfort and injury, according to our experts.\nCut\nWorkout socks will come in multiple lengths including no show, ankle, crew and quarter. The decision of the cut will likely fall on personal preference and the activity you choose, according to our experts. However, more fabric can provide more protection, says Parthasarathy.\nMeet our experts\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

        "Summary": "Cole Schmidtknecht, 22, had insurance but couldn\u2019t afford to refill his asthma inhaler after the cost jumped from $70 to more than $500 at his pharmacy.",
        "Content": "When 22-year-old Cole Schmidtknecht tried to get a refill on the inhaler prescribed by his doctor to prevent asthma attacks, the medication that had formerly cost him less than $70 at his Appleton, Wisconsin pharmacy was now priced at more than $500, according to Cole\u2019s father, Bil Schmidtknecht.\nStunned, Cole left the store with a medication designed to stop asthma attacks once they start, but without the Advair Diskus inhaler he needed to prevent attacks from happening in the first place.\nFive days after his pharmacy visit last year, Cole had a severe asthma attack, stopped breathing and collapsed. He never regained consciousness and died. Doctors attributed his death to asthma.\nHis parents, Bil and Shanon Schmidtknecht, blame what they say is a dysfunctional system where medications can change in price overnight and without notice.\nA part of the insurance system that many Americans don\u2019t know about was responsible for the spike in Cole\u2019s inhaler price. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, are the middlemen that control behind the scenes which drugs will be on an insurance company\u2019s list of covered medications (called its formulary).\nIf you are dealing with bills that seem to be out of line or a denial of coverage, care or repairs, whether for health, home or auto, please email us at Costofdenial@nbcuni.com.\nThey add or subtract medications through a process that emphasizes profits for the pharmacy benefit manager by way of \u201crebates\u201d from drug makers, said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nPBMs \u201care looking for the drug that makes them the most money,\u201d Andersen said\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane that it\u2019s happening in America,\u201d Bil Schmidknecht said. \u201cIt\u2019s not broken. It\u2019s designed to work this way. It\u2019s just hurting us.\u201d\nThe Schmidtknechts are pushing for legislation that would require a 90-day warning when an insurance company\u2019s formulary is changed. They are also suing Optum Rx, the PBM that took Cole\u2019s Advair Diskus off his insurance company\u2019s formulary, and Walgreens, his pharmacy, which, the Schmidtknechts say, didn\u2019t offer Cole a way to control his asthma while another solution could be found.\nThe lawsuit claims that Cole did not get the required 30 days\u2019 notice of the change, that his doctor wasn\u2019t contacted and that the pharmacy didn\u2019t provide Cole with any more affordable options.\nThe Schmidknechts said Cole left the pharmacy with only a rescue inhaler, which is used for quick relief. But that type of medication by itself isn\u2019t strong enough to keep someone out of the emergency room if the asthma attack is severe, Dr. David Bernstein, an immunologist who is a professor in the division of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at the University of Cincinnati, said.\n\u201cIt was empty at his house, next to his bed,\u201d Bil said of the emergency inhaler.\nIn a motion to dismiss the Schmidkneckt\u2019s lawsuit, Optum Rx expressed \u201cits deepest sympathies\u201d for Cole\u2019s death and said federal law prohibits the case from being brought in state court. Optum also said three alternatives, each with a $5 copay, were available, and its system instructed Walgreens to contact Cole\u2019s doctor about those options.\nWalgreens also offered \u201cits deepest sympathies and cited privacy for why it can\u2019t discuss specifics in the case. In a statement, it added, \u201cIn general, in cases where a medication is not covered by insurance, pharmacy staff may work with the plan, patient, and/or prescriber in an effort to process and dispense the prescription if able.\u201d\nCole would be 24 now. When speaking about all the things he could have been doing, his parents nearly break down.\n\u201cHe was just so young, and he had his whole life ahead of him,\u201d Shanon said. \u201cAnd it was so preventable and so unnecessary.\u201d\nFor the Schmidkneckts, it's about policy change. \u201cJustice for Cole, of course, but bigger than that, justice for us all,\u201d Shanon said.\nGetting that change won\u2019t be easy.\nIn the U.S., just three PBMs process 80% of prescriptions. And a big part of the PBM formulary playbook is secrecy, Anderson said.\nThat way, patients don\u2019t learn how PBMs make their decisions about drugs and why a medication that had been on the formulary no longer is.\nOften no one, from the patients to the drug companies to the insurers, is aware of the details of the decisions the PBMs are making.\n\u201cThey do not share this information widely, as it is considered a trade secret,\u201d Anderson said.\nThe deals are \u201ca negotiation between the drug companies and the PBM,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe drug company wants their drug on the formulary in a favorable position. The PBM wants to get the largest possible rebate.\u201d\nThe \u201crebate\u201d is the difference between the list price for a drug and what the PBM can buy it for, which can be \u201ca very much lower number than the list price,\u201d Anderson said.\nWhen there are multiple drugs that do essentially the same thing, then there\u2019s a bidding war, usually a silent one.\nThe rewards for the PBMs can be huge. A Federal Trade Commission report released in January found that, over the past few years, the three biggest PBMs \u2014 CVS Health Caremark Rx, Cigna\u2019s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Optum Rx \u2014 inflated the costs of numerous life-saving medications by billions of dollars. The companies countered that the FTC report\u2019s conclusions were misleading.\nIn January, CVS Health said in a statement that it \u201cis inappropriate and misleading to draw broad conclusions from cherry-picked \u2018specialty generic\u2019 outliers\u201d and that the company\u2019s \u201ctop priority is to make health care more affordable.\u201d OptumRx said that it helped eligible patients save $1.3 billion last year and estimated that the median out-of-pocket payment for these patients was $5.\nTo remember Cole, both his parents had a tattoo just like his inked onto their wrists. When they feel overwhelmed they glance down at it to remember the change they want to make in his honor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just everyone\u2019s little reminder, you know, from Cole to just keep living and that we can still be happy,\u201d Shanon said. \u201cI keep trying to remind myself that happiness and joy and grief can co-exist.\u201d",

        "Summary": "Following the MIND diet is associated with a strong and consistent reduction in dementia risk.",
        "Content": "New evidence finds that the MIND diet lives up to its name, even when it is started later in life.\nMiddle-aged and older participants in a large, long-term study were less likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other types of dementia if they followed a diet filled with green, leafy vegetables, olive oil, whole grains and lots of berries, according to a report presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition.\nResearchers from University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa and the University of Southern California discovered that adhering to the MIND diet, which combines the Mediterranean diet with the blood-pressure-lowering DASH diet, results in a stronger and more consistent reduction in dementia risk than what is seen with other healthy diets.\nThe new findings suggest it\u2019s never too late to switch to a healthy diet, said the study\u2019s lead author, Song-Yi Park, an associate professor at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa. \u201cIt shows that sticking to a healthy diet, as well as improving the health of the person\u2019s diet over time, is very important for older adults who want to prevent dementia.\u201d\nWhile all the Mediterranean-related diets appear to be good for the brain, the MIND dietary pattern was specifically designed for brain health.\n\u201cOne important difference is that MIND includes berries, which have been linked to brain health,\u201d Park said.\nThe MIND diet, or Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, scores individual foods based on how protective they are and how much is eaten. Berries \u2014 especially strawberries and blueberries \u2014 for example, get a score of 1 if two or more servings are consumed per week. The score drops to 0.5 if just one serving per week is consumed and a score of 0 if none are.\nA person\u2019s individual diet gets an overall rating by adding up the scores for individual foods. The higher the overall score, the better it is for the person\u2019s brain.\nPark and her colleagues turned to data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults who had provided information about what they ate as part of a research project known as The Multiethnic Cohort to get a closer look at how diet influenced the risk of developing dementia.\nThe Multiethnic Cohort was started in the early 1990s through a joint effort of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. The men and women enrolled in the study came from five ethnic/racial populations: Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, Black Americans, Latinos and whites.\nAt the outset, the 215,000 participants were ages 45 to 75. When data for the new study was analyzed, more than 21,000 participants had developed Alzheimer\u2019s or a related dementia.\nAt the beginning of the study, people who scored higher for adherence to MIND had a 9% lower risk of developing dementia.\nThe amount of reduction varied among the racial groups in the new analysis. Greater risk reduction, 13%, was seen in participants who identified as Black, Latino or white.\nParticipants who improved their adherence to MIND over the 10-year period had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared with those whose adherence declined, and that trend was seen across all age and racial groups.\nHow to follow the MIND diet\nSome suggestions for reaching the optimal score for the MIND diet, according to a 2015 study:\n- Leafy green vegetables, such as kale, spinach, broccoli, bok choy and mustard: six or more servings per week\n- Other vegetables: one serving per day\n- Nuts, such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios: five or more servings per week\n- Cheese: less than one per week\n- Whole grains: three or more per day\n- Fish (not fried): one or more servings per week\n- Red meat: less than one serving per week\n- Fast fried foods: less than one per week\n- Pastries and sweets: less than five servings per week\nPark cautioned that like all observational studies, the new research reports an association and doesn\u2019t prove that the diet prevents dementia.\nIt is a high-quality study, Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School, said in an email.\n\u201cIt adds to the evidence that a Mediterranean-type diet has important benefits for reducing the risk of dementia,\u201d said Willett, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cThe differences between groups defined by race/ethnicity may well be due to random variation, so at this time it\u2019s reasonable to assume that this healthy dietary pattern has benefits for all groups.\"\nWhen it comes to leafy green vegetables, it\u2019s probably best to consume a variety rather than a single type, Willett said.\n\u201cIn particular, spinach is good in many ways, but has high oxalate content and high intake of spinach can cause kidney stones,\u201d he said.\nIn general, the MIND diet is in line with the principles of the two diets it\u2019s built from, said Dr. Yian Gu, an associate professor of neurological sciences at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. \u201cEach of those diets has unique characteristics,\u201d she said.\nThe Mediterranean diet emphasizes multiple daily servings of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains, legumes, olive oil, seafood, and nuts and seeds, such as chia, flax, pumpkin and sesame.\nDASH, or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, is meant to prevent hypertension, so it emphasizes low salt, which isn\u2019t a major component in the Mediterranean diet.\nThe MIND diet is easy to follow, Gu said, encouraging people to pick the green, leafy vegetables they prefer. What\u2019s important is to increase the diversity of vegetables.\nAnother benefit of Mediterranean-type diets: They are helpful with other types of chronic disease, including heart disease and cancer, she said.",

        "Content": "New research suggests that blood tests known as \u201cliquid biopsies\u201d can improve the treatment of some people with metastatic breast cancer and help their tumors remain under control for more than a year.\nFor many, it\u2019s been a long time coming: More than a decade ago, researchers and investors predicted that liquid biopsies \u2014 which are sensitive enough to detect tumor cells and DNA in the blood \u2014 would be \u201cgame changers\u201d in the realm of cancer.\nAlthough liquid biopsies haven\u2019t replaced standard cancer screening methods like mammograms and colonoscopies, the new study and others like it demonstrate that the blood tests can help doctors monitor cancer and help them select treatments likelier to work.\nLiquid biopsies are so sophisticated that they can detect minuscule bits of DNA that have leaked out of tumor cells and are floating freely in the blood. The most sensitive liquid biopsies, like those used in the new study, go one step further, detecting ominous changes in key proteins in cancer cells.\nThe research \u2014 published Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology\u2019s annual meeting in Chicago \u2014 focused on people whose breast cancers are fueled by estrogen. The most effective treatment for that type of advanced disease includes drugs designed to target specific proteins in breast cancer cells. If those proteins mutate, the drugs stop working, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the cancer begins growing again.\nBy detecting these mutations, liquid biopsies serve as an early warning system that people need a different medication, said Dr. Nicholas Turner, study co-author and a professor of molecular oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden hospital in the United Kingdom.\nIn the new study, people who changed their treatment based on liquid biopsy results were twice as likely to have their tumors controlled than study participants who didn\u2019t change therapy.\nTurner said the approach offers a significant improvement compared with current practice.\nCurrently, doctors look for signs that a cancer treatment is no longer working by performing imaging tests, such as CT scans or PET scans, every three months. These scans allow doctors to see whether tumors are getting bigger.\nThe study found that liquid biopsies can detect mutations up to nine months before the changes would have become apparent on scans, Turner said. That gives people the opportunity to abandon ineffective treatments as early as possible and switch to ones with better chances of controlling the cancer.\nIn about 1 in 10 people in the study, liquid biopsies found that their cancer had developed mutations that would make their current treatment less effective.\n\u201cWe have very effective treatments, but they can wear off,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd if they wear off and the cancer starts growing again, it can make the person unwell. If they have cancer in the bones, it can start to cause pain.\u201d\nResearchers randomly assigned half of the 315 people with mutations to change therapy right away and the other half to continue their medications as usual, said Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli, an author of the study and director of breast medical oncology at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. One percent of study participants were men.\nFor the people who changed therapy early, researchers replaced a hormonal drug they had been taking with an experimental cancer drug called camizestrant, which isn\u2019t yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Camizestrant interferes with estrogen\u2019s ability to stimulate cancer growth. AstraZeneca funded the clinical trial, which was built on early, basic research funded by the National Institutes of Health, Cristofanilli said.\nIn study participants who switched to camizestrant, their cancers remained stable \u2014 without significant tumor growth \u2014 for 16 months, compared with nine months for people who didn\u2019t switch medications, according to the study.\nAfter one year, 61% of study participants who switched to camizestrant had stable disease, compared with 33% of those who didn\u2019t change treatment, according to the study. After two years, 30% of people who switched still had stable disease, compared with 5% who didn\u2019t.\nStudy participants who switched therapies reported good overall health and quality of life for 23 months, compared with others in the study, who reported a deterioration in health and quality of life after 6.4 months.\n\u201cIf we switch the treatment at just the right time, we can keep the cancer asleep, stop it from progressing and keep the person well,\u201d Turner said. \u201cMany of my patients get back to work and just keep going with normal lives. They get time with their kids.\u201d\nAlthough camizestrant is only available through clinical trials, a similar drug, Faslodex, has been approved by the FDA.\nUnanswered questions\nAlthough camizestrant caused more side effects than the hormonal drugs, most people continued taking it. About 1.3% of participants stopped taking camizestrant because of side effects, compared with 1.9% who discontinued therapy with the hormonal drug.\nSide effects of camizestrant included a reduction in white blood cells and a heart rate that is slower than normal. People taking the drug also were likelier to see flashes or floating spots in their peripheral vision.\nDr. Heather Parsons, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research, said: \u201cThis is an important study, but the results are immature.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to understand if changing therapy early helps patients or if it leads us to use more toxic therapies sooner,\u201d Parsons said.\nThe study didn\u2019t answer a major question: whether the new approach helps patients live longer. Turner said he plans to follow the participants to learn whether the new regimen improves survival.\nThanks to better treatments, people with metastatic breast cancer now live about five years after their cancer spreads. That means that it can take several years to detect whether one treatment extends life more than another, Turner said.\nDoctors don\u2019t know whether all patients would respond as well as those in the study. Most people in the study were white, with very few Black participants.\nAbout 317,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women in the U.S. this year, in addition to 2,800 cases in men, according to the American Cancer Society. About 42,170 people will die from the disease.\nDr. Kelly Shanahan, a physician who has lived with estrogen-driven metastatic breast cancer since 2013, called the results \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201ccompelling.\u201d\n\u201cI would certainly want to talk to my oncologist about an early switch if I were in this situation, especially if the side effects of camizestrant were acceptable to me,\u201d said Shanahan, who serves as the director of research and president of the board of METAvivor, an advocacy group for people with metastatic disease.\nOther uses for liquid biopsies\nScientists are developing liquid biopsies to improve the treatment of many types of cancer.\nIn a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2022, researchers in Australia used tumor DNA in the blood to predict which people with early colon cancer would need chemotherapy after surgery \u2014 and who could skip it without increasing their risk of relapse. Many doctors now use liquid biopsies when treating colon cancer patients, although the tests used in the study aren\u2019t available in all countries, said Dr. Jeanne Tie, the first author of that study and a senior research fellow of personalized oncology at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Victoria, Australia.\nLiquid biopsies are also being studied to screen healthy people for cancer.\nFor example, the FDA last year approved the first blood test, called Shield, to screen for colorectal cancer. The blood test is not meant to replace the colonoscopy, however, which is still required as part of a definitive diagnosis, and neither the American Cancer Society nor the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has endorsed Shield as a form of cancer screening. While the Shield test correctly identified 83% of colon cancers, it hasn\u2019t been shown to save lives.\nDoctors might one day use liquid biopsies to provide further answers when mammogram results are unclear, particularly for women with dense breasts, whose tumors are often missed by standard screenings, Cristofanilli said. He hopes that blood tests will reduce the number of painful needle biopsies.",

        "Content": "The nation\u2019s top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get Covid vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.\nThe change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that Covid vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.\nBut the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.\n\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it could have been.\u201d\nKennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nOn Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.\nA subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.\n\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\u201d\nThat kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.\nChildhood vaccination rates for Covid are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 Covid vaccine, according to CDC data.\nTalk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the Covid pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.\nA CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.\nBut Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.\nThe new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \u201cincredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.",

The rescission request would codify the work of the Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development, eliminate foreign aid programs it deemed wasteful and cease funding for other international institutions. READ MORE: What you need to know about impoundment, and how Trump vows to use it The request includes almost $1.1 billion in funds that were previously approved by Congress to support the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). CPB distributes funds to NPR and PBS local stations, which combine federal money and their own fundraising efforts to support the public media networks.

Give Now By \u2014 Steff Staples Steff Staples\nPresident Donald Trump asked Congress on Tuesday to take back $9.4 billion in federal funding for foreign aid, the State Department and public media. The rescission request would codify the work of the Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development, eliminate foreign aid programs it deemed wasteful and cease funding for other international institutions. READ MORE: What you need to know about impoundment, and how Trump vows to use it The request includes almost $1.1 billion in funds that were previously approved by Congress to support the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). CPB distributes funds to NPR and PBS local stations, which combine federal money and their own fundraising efforts to support the public media networks.

Failure\u2019s not an option.\u201d Speaker Johnson called Musk\u2019s harsh criticism of the bill \u201cvery disappointing.\u201d \u201cWith all due respect,\u201d said Johnson, who said he spoke with Musk for more than 20 minutes, \u201cmy friend Elon is terribly wrong about the one big beautiful bill.\u201d At its core, the package seeks to extend the tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump\u2019s first term at the White House, and add new ones the presidents campaigned on, including no taxes on tips and others. It also includes a massive build-up of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security. To defray the lost tax revenue to the government and avoid piling onto the nation\u2019s $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services. Estimates are 8.6 million people would no longer have health care and nearly 4 million would lose Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits, known as SNAP.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to soon provide an overall analysis of the package\u2019s impacts on the government balance sheets. But Republicans are ready to blast those findings from the congressional scorekeeper as flawed. Trump Tuesday switched to tougher tactics, deriding the holdout Republican senators to get on board.

Bessent has also been meeting behind closed doors with senators and GOP leadership. The road ahead is also a test for Thune of South Dakota who, like Johnson, is a newer leader in Congress and among the many Republicans adjusting their own priorities with Trump\u2019s return to the White House.

There are also discussions about altering the $40,000 cap that the House proposed for state and local deductions, known as SALT, which are important to lawmakers in high-tax New York, California and other states, but less so among GOP senators. \u201cWe\u2019re having all those discussions,\u201d said Sen.

As AI demand rises, the main source of new supply over the coming years is expected to be from gas-fired plants, a cheap and reliable source of power but one that produces planet-warming emissions. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind account for about 24% of data center power in the U.S., while nuclear comprises about 15%, according to the IEA. It will take years before enough climate-friendlier power sources, including nuclear, could start slowing the expansion of fossil fuel power generation. A report released by the U.S. Department of Energy late last year estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028 when it could consume up to 12% of the nation\u2019s electricity.

(AP) \u2014 Newark Mayor Ras Baraka sued New Jersey\u2019s top federal prosecutor on Tuesday over his arrest on a trespassing charge at a federal immigration detention facility, saying the Trump-appointed attorney had pursued the case out of political spite. Baraka, who leads New Jersey\u2019s biggest city, is a candidate in a crowded primary field for the Democratic nomination for governor next Tuesday. The lawsuit against interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba coincided with the day early in-person voting began. The lawsuit seeks damages for \u201cfalse arrest and malicious prosecution,\u201d and also accuses Habba of defamation for comments she made about his case, which was later dropped. Citing a post on X in which Habba said Baraka \u201ccommitted trespass,\u201d the lawsuit says Habba issued a \u201cdefamatory statement\u201d and authorized his \u201cfalse arrest\u201d despite \u201cclear evidence that Mayor Baraka had not committed the petty offense of \u2018defiant trespass.\u2019\u201d The suit also names Ricky Patel, the Homeland Security Investigations agent in charge in Newark. Baraka\u2019s attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, said they also expect to sue President Donald Trump\u2019s administration but are required to wait six months. \u201cThis is not about revenge,\u201d Baraka said during a news conference. \u201cUltimately, I think this is about them taking accountability for what has happened to me.\u201d Emails seeking comment were left Tuesday with Habba\u2019s office and the Homeland Security Department, where Patel works. Videos capture chaos outside the detention center The episode outside the Delaney Hall federal immigration detention center has had dramatic fallout. It began on May 9 when Baraka tried to join three Democratic members of Congress \u2014 Rob Menendez, LaMonica McIver and Bonnie Watson Coleman \u2014 who went to the facility for an oversight tour, something authorized under federal law. Baraka, an outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown and the detention center, was denied entry. Video from the event showed him walking from the facility side of the fence to the street side, where other people had been protesting. Uniformed officials then came to arrest him. As they did, people could be heard urging the group to protect the mayor. The video shows a crowd forming and pushing as officials led off a handcuffed Baraka.

New Jersey targeted over its so-called sanctuary policies Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, opened earlier this year as a federal immigration detention facility. Florida-based Geo Group Inc., which owns and operates the property, was awarded a 15-year contract valued at $1 billion in February. The announcement was part of the president\u2019s plans to sharply increase detention beds nationwide from a budget of about 41,000 beds this year. Baraka sued Geo soon after that deal was announced. Then, on May 23, the Trump Justice Department filed a suit against Newark and three other New Jersey cities over their so-called sanctuary policies. There is no legal definition for sanctuary city policies, but they generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers. New Jersey\u2019s attorney general has a statewide directive in place prohibiting local police from collaborating in federal civil immigration matters. The policies are aimed at barring cooperation on civil enforcement matters, not at blocking cooperation on criminal matters. They specifically carve out exceptions for when Immigration and Customs Enforcement supplies police with a judicial criminal warrant. The Justice Department said, though, the cities won\u2019t notify ICE when they\u2019ve made criminal arrests, according to the suit. It\u2019s unclear whether Baraka\u2019s role in these fights with the White House is affecting his campaign for governor. He\u2019s one of six candidates seeking the Democratic nomination in the June 10 election to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. On Tuesday, Baraka explained the timing of the suit as an effort to get the case before the court before it was too late. He described the arrest and fallout as a distraction during the campaign. \u201cBut I also think that us not responding is consent,\u201d he said. In a video ad in the election\u2019s final weeks, Baraka has embraced a theme his rivals are also pushing: affordability. He says he\u2019ll cut taxes.

Turning that aspiration into reality has proved difficult. READ MORE: Trump signs action requiring proof of citizenship for voters, other measures overhauling U.S. elections Trump\u2019s executive order directing a documentary, proof-of-citizenship requirement for federal elections has been blocked by a judge, while federal legislation to accomplish it doesn\u2019t appear to have the votes to pass in the Senate. At the same time, state-level efforts have found little success, even in places where Republicans control the legislature and governor\u2019s office. The most recent state effort to falter is in Texas, where a Senate bill failed to gain full legislative approval before lawmakers adjourned on Monday. The Texas bill was one of the nation\u2019s most sweeping proof-of-citizenship proposals because it would have applied not only to new registrants but also to the state\u2019s roughly 18.6 million registered voters. \u201cThe bill authors failed spectacularly to explain how this bill would be implemented and how it would be able to be implemented without inconveniencing a ton of voters,\u201d said Anthony Gutierrez, director of the voting rights group Common Cause Texas. Voting by noncitizens is rare Voting by noncitizens is already illegal and punishable as a felony, potentially leading to deportation, but Trump and his allies have pressed for a proof-of-citizenship mandate by arguing it would improve public confidence in elections. Before his win last year, Trump falsely claimed noncitizens might vote in large enough numbers to sway the outcome. Although noncitizen voting does occur, research and reviews of state cases has shown it to be rare and more often a mistake. Voting rights groups say the various proposals seeking to require proof-of-citizenship are overly burdensome and threaten to disenfranchise millions of Americans. Many do not have easy access to their birth certificates, have not gotten a U.S. passport or have a name that no longer matches the one on their birth certificate \u2014 such as women who changed their last name when they married. Married women who changed names are a particular concern The number of states considering bills related to proof of citizenship for voting tripled from 2023 to this year, said Liz Avore, senior policy adviser with the Voting Rights Lab, an advocacy group that tracks election legislation in the states. That hasn\u2019t resulted in many new laws, at least so far. Republicans in Wyoming passed their own proof-of-citizenship legislation, but similar measures have stalled or failed in multiple GOP-led states, including Florida, Missouri, Texas and Utah. A proposal remains active in Ohio, although Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has said he doesn\u2019t want to sign any more bills that make it harder to vote. READ MORE: Why voting rights groups warn the SAVE Act may make it harder for married women to vote In Texas, the legislation swiftly passed the state Senate after it was introduced in March but never made it to a floor vote in the House. It was unclear why legislation that was such a priority for Senate Republicans \u2013 every one of them co-authored the bill \u2014 ended up faltering. \u201cI just think people realized, as flawed as this playbook has been in other states, Texas didn\u2019t need to make this mistake,\u201d said Rep. John Bucy, a Democrat who serves as vice chair of the House elections committee. Bucy pointed to specific concerns about married women who changed their last name. This surfaced in local elections earlier this year in New Hampshire, which passed a proof-of-citizenship requirement last year. Similar laws have created confusion Other states that previously sought to add such a requirement have faced lawsuits and complications when trying to implement it. In Arizona, a state audit found that problems with the way data was handled had affected the tracking and verification of residents\u2019 citizenship status. It came after officials had identified some 200,000 voters who were thought to have provided proof of their citizenship but had not. A proof-of-citizenship requirement was in effect for three years in Kansas before it was overturned by federal courts. The state\u2019s own expert estimated that almost all of the roughly 30,000 people who were prevented from registering to vote while it was in effect were U.S. citizens who otherwise had been eligible. In Missouri, legislation seeking to add a proof-of-citizenship requirement cleared a Senate committee but never came to a vote in the Republican-led chamber. READ MORE: Trump has pressed for new voting requirements. Republicans in Congress will try to make that happen Republican state Sen. Ben Brown had promoted the legislation as a follow-up to a constitutional amendment stating that only U.S. citizens can vote, which Missouri voters overwhelmingly approved last November. He said there were several factors that led to the bill not advancing this year. Due to the session\u2019s limited schedule, he chose to prioritize another elections bill banning foreign contributions in state ballot measure campaigns. \u201cOur legislative session ending mid-May means a lot of things die at the finish line because you simply run out of time,\u201d Brown said, noting he also took time to research concerns raised by local election officials and plans to reintroduce the proof-of-citizenship bill next year. Complications prompt states to focus on other issues The Republican-controlled Legislature in Utah also prioritized other election changes, adding voter ID requirements and requiring people to opt in to receive their ballots in the mail. Before Gov. Spencer Cox signed the bill into law, Utah was the only Republican-controlled state that allowed all elections to be conducted by mail without a need to opt in. Under the Florida bill that has failed to advance, voter registration applications wouldn\u2019t be considered valid until state officials had verified citizenship, either by confirming a previous voting history, checking the applicant\u2019s status in state and federal databases, or verifying documents they provided. The bill would have required voters to prove their citizenship even when updating their registration to change their address or party affiliation. Its sponsor, Republican state Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka, said it was meant to follow through on Trump\u2019s executive order: \u201cThis bill fully answers the president\u2019s call,\u201d she said. Cassidy reported from Atlanta.

WATCH: Trump directs DOJ to investigate former administration officials who criticized him Miles Taylor, once chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, warned in an interview with The Associated Press of the far-reaching implications of Trump\u2019s April 9 memorandum, \u201cAddressing Risks Associated with an Egregious Leaker and Disseminator of Falsehoods,\u201d when it comes to suppressing criticism of the president. That memo accused Taylor of concocting stories to sell his book and directed the secretary of Homeland Security and other government agencies to look into Taylor and strip him of any security clearances. Taylor sent a letter via email to inspectors general at the departments of Justice and Homeland Security on Tuesday.

Give Now By \u2014 Rebecca Santana, Associated Press Rebecca Santana, Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A former Homeland Security official during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration who authored an anonymous op-ed sharply critical of the president is calling on independent government watchdogs to investigate after Trump ordered the department to look into his government service. WATCH: Trump directs DOJ to investigate former administration officials who criticized him Miles Taylor, once chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, warned in an interview with The Associated Press of the far-reaching implications of Trump\u2019s April 9 memorandum, \u201cAddressing Risks Associated with an Egregious Leaker and Disseminator of Falsehoods,\u201d when it comes to suppressing criticism of the president. That memo accused Taylor of concocting stories to sell his book and directed the secretary of Homeland Security and other government agencies to look into Taylor and strip him of any security clearances. Taylor sent a letter via email to inspectors general at the departments of Justice and Homeland Security on Tuesday. Coming on the same April day that Trump also ordered an investigation into Chris Krebs, a former top cybersecurity official, the dual memoranda illustrated how Trump has sought to use the powers of the presidency against his adversaries. Speaking to the AP, Taylor said the order targeting him sets a \u201cscary precedent\u201d and that\u2019s why he decided to call on the inspectors general to investigate. \u201cI didn\u2019t commit any crime, and that\u2019s what\u2019s extraordinary about this.

Among other cuts, President Trump\u2019s request is expected to include the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nonprofit through which NPR and PBS get federal funding. Lisa Desjardins reports on what this could look like and what is ahead. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Amna Nawaz: As lawmakers return to Washington, they expect what's known as a rescission request to cross their desks in the next 24 hours. That's a push from the White House to cut funding already passed by Congress.Among other cuts, President Trump's request is expected to include the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It's the nonprofit through which NPR and PBS get federal funding, including for this program.Our Lisa Desjardins has been reporting on what this could look like and what's ahead in a high-stakes few weeks on the Hill.Good to see you, Lisa. Lisa Desjardins: Yes. Good to see you. Amna Nawaz: So tell us what we expect in this package of budget cuts and why it matters. Lisa Desjardins: First, let's start with why it matters.This is an important first test for President Trump after months of slashing government without congressional approval. Now he's going to test what Congress may approve of this, as all of this works through the courts. Now the question is also, of course, what these cuts would do.So let's go through my reporting. Right now, these are round figures. We haven't gotten the full details yet, but about $8 billion in cuts expected for foreign aid. That's a fraction of usual annual foreign aid, and about $1 billion in cuts for public broadcasting, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.That public broadcasting number, Amna, would be 100 percent of the funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for the next two years. That would mean great strain on stations around the country. Republicans, though, argue that it's time for the federal government to get out of that business and for others to pay for it. Amna Nawaz: Lisa, tell us about what's ahead now for the proposal. I mean, the big question is, does it have the votes to pass? Lisa Desjardins: In the House, it does seem that these cuts have the votes to pass. The Senate is another question. I'm eager to get up there tomorrow to talk to senators to find out.But I also want to take people through how this works. It's an unusual procedure. First of all, Congress would have 45 days from the minute they get this rescission request after the president submits it to act. Now, Congress can amend it. It can pass some, but not all of it. And there is only a majority vote required in each chamber for these rescissions to take effect.Now, we do expect things to start in the House, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune said today he wants this to go to the Senate by the end of the month to move quickly. If either chamber does not agree, then this funding would actually be locked in. It could not be cut. Amna Nawaz: We know there's been a couple of issues that have been real sticking points for some senators, things like potential Medicaid cuts. There's also a lot of talk about this contempt provision. Tell us about that. Lisa Desjardins: Right. I'm happy to take people through this.First of all, where we are with this bill, it's not just a big bill, and I'm going to keep repeating this. It is one of the biggest bills in U.S. history. So what's happening right now is senators are looking at the House bill. They can only spare three Republican votes in the Senate. Right now, that House version does not have the votes to pass the Senate. And I'm going to show you why. There are a number of concerns.First of all, there are a group of Republican senators who do not like the deficit effects of this. They say it would add too much to the debt, another group concerned about Medicaid and the social safety net funding in this, and now an overlapping group as well concerned about the clean energy credits in here, which would be eliminated. They say their states actually need those energy credits.Now, as you say, though, there is this other issue getting national attention. I want to take people deep into the bill. This is page 514 of the bill. This is what it says: \"No court of the United States may enforce a contempt citation for an injunction or temporary restraining order if no security was given.\"What does that mean? That means that courts could not enforce an order blocking some of Trump's actions if the plaintiffs, those objecting, hadn't put up a bond, essentially, for multimillions of dollars. And that, in fact, is the case for most of these injunctions right now before the courts. So a lot of opponents see this as an attempt to block courts and to block that action.Why haven't we talked about it on this show before? Because in order to pass the Senate, this bill has to have budgetary effects. This provision does not have a budgetary effect. This is expected to be stripped out before the Senate votes. Amna Nawaz: In the meantime, Lisa, you have also been going through the new Trump rules for the federal work force. Tell us what you found there and how you think could be shifting ahead. Lisa Desjardins: This came down Friday after Elon Musk basically was exiting from government. And this is part of sort of that idea of DOGE trying to cement these effects after he's gone. It's important.I read through these, and these changes would have major cultural and workplace place effects in them. So let's look through them in multiple ways. First of all, these new federal hiring rules would mean that agencies could no longer collect or give out data on the race or gender of the work force. They would be encouraged, in fact, told they should recruit from state schools, religious schools, religious groups, the military, and also some other groups like 4-H that are thought to be more rural around the country.Now, instead of filling out the question as it is now, applications, would have to fill out four short essays. Two of those would have to deal with the Constitution, but one, every applicant would have to answer a question about how they would comply and support President Trump's executive orders.Finally, for senior jobs, they are saying there will be a course given that you would have to pay for if you choose to sort of fast-track yourself to become a senior executive, and that course would train people on Trump's executive orders. So, of course, there are Republicans who say, hey, this is great, government's too elite as it is, we need to look at state schools and others.But there are other people who say, no, this is politicizing the federal work force in a way that career servants should not be politicized. So it is something that's happening now, and it's something we need to watch carefully. Amna Nawaz: Lisa Desjardins, thank you very much. Lisa Desjardins: You're welcome.

Watch the news conference in the video player above. Daniel Park, 32, was taken into custody on Tuesday night at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport upon his return from Poland, U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli told reporters. READ MORE: FBI arrests man linked to California fertility clinic explosion at JFK airport, officials say Federal authorities allege Park shipped 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate to Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, who bombed the clinic and was killed in the blast. The chemical compound is an explosive precursor that can be used to make homemade bombs, Essayli said. Park, who is from Kent, Washington, also traveled to Southern California in late January to stay with Bartkus for about two weeks, Essayli said. Authorities described Bartkus and Park as members of the anti-natalist movement, a fringe group that opposes childbirth and population growth and believes people should not continue to procreate. Officials said he intentionally targeted the fertility clinic as an act of terrorism. He tried to livestream the explosion, but the attempt failed, the FBI says. The blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palms Springs and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Witnesses described a loud boom followed by a chaotic scene, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along the sidewalk and street. A body was found near a charred vehicle outside the clinic.

Before moving to Colorado Springs three years ago, he spent 17 years in Kuwait, according to court documents. He has been living in the U.S. illegally, having arrived in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X.

The New York Times, citing McLaughlin, said his family\u2019s visas have since been revoked and they were arrested Tuesday by ICE. Hundreds of thousands of people overstay their visas each year in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department reports. The case against Soliman Soliman told authorities that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting for his daughter to graduate before carrying it out, the affidavit said. A newspaper in Colorado Springs that profiled one of Soliman\u2019s children in April noted the family\u2019s journey from Egypt to Kuwait and then to the U.S. It said after initially struggling in school, she landed academic honors and volunteered at a local hospital. Soliman currently faces federal hate crime charges and attempted murder charges at the state level, but authorities say additional charges could be brought.

The attack unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who was disguised as a gardener, had 18 Molotov cocktails but threw just two during Sunday\u2019s attack in which he yelled \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d police said. Soliman, 45, didn\u2019t carry out his full plan \u201cbecause he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,\u201d police wrote in an affidavit. The two incendiary devices he did throw at the group of about 20 people staging their weekly demonstration were enough to injure more than half of them, and authorities said he expressed no regrets about the attack. Soliman \u2014 an Egyptian national who is in the U.S. illegally, according to federal officials \u2014 planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted what he described as a \u201cZionist group,\u201d authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime. His name is first spelled Mohammed in some court documents. \u201cWhen he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again,\u201d Colorado\u2019s acting U.S. attorney, J. Bishop Grewell, said during a news conference Monday. Federal and state prosecutors filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively. He faces additional state charges related to the incendiary devices, and more charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment. Soliman is being held on a $10 million bond. His attorney, Kathryn Herold, declined to comment Monday after a hearing where he appeared before a state judge. His next hearing is Thursday. Soliman has been living in the U.S. illegally, having entered the country in August 2022 on a B-2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. She said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that it also expired. DHS did not respond to requests for additional information. Immigration agents on Tuesday were taking Soliman\u2019s wife and five children into custody, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a post on X. Federal officials also are investigating whether any of his family members knew about his plan, she wrote. According to an FBI affidavit, Soliman told the police he was driven by a desire \u201cto kill all Zionist people\u201d \u2014 a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel. The attack at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington. WATCH: Investigators say man used makeshift flamethrower in attack on pro-Israel group in Boulder Six victims hospitalized The victims ranged in age from 52 to 88, and their injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. Six victims were initially taken to a hospital, and three remained hospitalized Tuesday at the UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus, hospital spokesperson Kelli Christensen said. She declined to provide information on their conditions and said they had requested privacy. Members of the volunteer group called Run For Their Lives were attacked while holding their weekly demonstration. Video captured by witness Alex Osante of San Diego shows people pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught fire during the attack. Molotov cocktails found Osante said that after the assailant threw the two incendiary devices, apparently catching himself on fire as he threw the second, he took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video Osante filmed. The Molotov cocktails were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said. \u201cHe stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,\u201d the affidavit says. He had gas in a backpack sprayer but told investigators he didn\u2019t spray it on anyone but himself \u201cbecause he had planned on dying.\u201d Soliman also told investigators that he took a concealed-carry class and tried to buy a gun but was denied because he isn\u2019t a U.S. citizen. Authorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. He was also injured and taken to a hospital. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Amna Nawaz: Federal and state prosecutors have charged a man with 16 counts of attempted murder and with a hate crime after he allegedly set fire to demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, yesterday who were marching in support of Israeli hostages. Twelve people were hurt. At least two are still in the hospital.And, today, the Trump administration has condemned the attacker both for his alleged crimes, but also for his legal status, saying he overstayed his visa.Laura Barron-Lopez has our report.(Shouting) Laura Barron-Lopez: Dramatic cell phone video showed a chaotic scene of people rushing to treat burn victims outside the courthouse in downtown Boulder after a man set fire to a group of pro-Israel demonstrators who held weekly walks to raise awareness about Israeli hostages. Woman: Everybody, get back. Laura Barron-Lopez: An organizer with the group Run for Their Lives described his horror. Man: You want to help them, and then this is when we all retreated and realized that he doesn't care. He's there to harm as much as possible. Laura Barron-Lopez: Law enforcement said the suspect, who has been identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, used a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices on the crowd before he was taken into custody. Alex Osante, Eyewitness: I saw fire. I saw people falling and screaming and crying and tripping. He had three Molotov cocktails. One of them, he threw inside of a group at the group, and one lady lit on fire from head to toe. Laura Barron-Lopez: The FBI said he had at least 16 more Molotov cocktails in his possession. Eyewitnesses said he shouted \"Free Palestine\" and anti-Israel slurs.Today, prosecutors charged with a federal hate crime and at the state level 16 counts of attempted murder.J. Bishop Grewell, Acting U.S. Attorney For the District of Colorado: We fully intend to hold Mr. Solomon accountable for his actions. And these charges are the first step. Laura Barron-Lopez: And new court documents today revealed Soliman confessed to police that he planned his attack for a year, saying he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wish they were all dead. And he said he would do it again.Phil Weiser (D), Colorado Attorney General: This has every single sign of being a hate crime. Laura Barron-Lopez: Colorado's attorney general and FBI leaders signaled that Soliman's intent was clear.Mark Michalek, FBI Special Agent in Charge: This is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism. Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country. Laura Barron-Lopez: Authorities scoured for evidence today, both at the suspect's alleged residence and into his background. For now, they believe he acted alone.A Department of Homeland Security official said Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally. After arriving legally in 2022, he overstayed his tourist B-2 visa. President Trump today seized upon that on his social media, writing: \"This is yet another example of why we must keep our border secure.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned the attack, saying the victims were targeted simply because they were Jews.One of the victims was a Holocaust survivor, according to a Justice Department official. Mark Michalek: Hate-fueled acts of violence have no place in our community, and we will use every tool and resource available to hold those who commit such acts fully accountable. Laura Barron-Lopez: This week's attack is the latest in a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States, marking the second attack in his many weeks. Last month, two Israeli Embassy staffers were murdered outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. That suspect also shouted \"Free Palestine\" as he was being arrested.For the \"PBS News Hour,\" I'm Laura Barron-Lopez.

Over the weekend, Trump announced he was withdrawing the nomination of his original pick to lead NASA, billionaire Jared Isaacman. Miles O'Brien reports. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Amna Nawaz: Well, funding for science is also very much on the chopping block in the president's proposed budget. That includes cuts to NASA.It's a fraught moment for the agency, particularly for those focused on earth science and not human space travel. Just this weekend, President Trump announced he was withdrawing the nomination of his original pick to lead NASA, billionaire Jared Isaacman.Our Miles O'Brien has a look at all of this, starting with the proposed cuts. Neil Armstrong, Former NASA Astronaut: That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. Miles O\u2019Brien: It would be the largest single-year budget cut in NASA's storied history, including the early '70s, when the Apollo moon program was winding down.The Trump White House wants to reduce the $25 billion allocation for the space agency by 24 percent. Space science would be cut nearly in half. Adam Riess, Johns Hopkins University: That would be sort of, I won't say, almost extinction level for a lot of the space science that we pursue. Miles O\u2019Brien: Adam Riess is a professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University. He and two colleagues won the Nobel Prize in physics for discovering the acceleration of our expanding universe. They used the Hubble space telescope, along with ground-based instruments, to collect their data. Adam Riess: I think people are awed and inspired by the mystery of space, what's out there. These are, in the scheme of things, relatively modest investments for us as humans to do this most ambitious thing, to try to understand the place in which we live. Miles O\u2019Brien: The budget would eliminate a planned robotic mission to bring to Earth rock and regolith samples from the surface of Mars. It cuts climate monitoring satellites, eliminates green aviation programs, and zeros out science education efforts, declaring them woke.It's just part of the wholesale targeting of federally funded science. The National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are all facing steep cuts.John Grunsfeld, Former NASA Associate Administrator for Science: It actually looks pretty bleak across the spectrum. Miles O\u2019Brien: John Grunsfeld is an astrophysicist and astronaut who flew five shuttle missions, including three to upgrade and repair Hubble. He later served as NASA's associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate. John Grunsfeld: It sends a signal that America is stepping back from leadership in virtually every science area, including NASA. The proposal for the NASA science budget is, in fact, cataclysmic for U.S. leadership in science. Miles O\u2019Brien: No one in the Trump administration responded to our repeated requests for comment.Former National Space Council Executive Secretary Mark Albrecht was not a party to the White House budget proposal, but he helped lead the 2024 Trump transition team at NASA.Is the Trump administration anti-science? Mark Albrecht, Former Executive Secretary, National Space Council: Absolutely not. But I can assure you there's no evidence that I have ever seen that there is a desire to reduce America's leadership in science. Miles O\u2019Brien: NASA's science that has anything to do with climate change is targeted for cuts. Mark Albrecht: What was eliminated were things that were not contributing to the central mission. If you ask the question, who is the lead agency in the federal government for climate and climate research, the answer is NOAA. So the issue is not that we don't do climate research, but that we move it over to NOAA, who is the agency that's responsible for it. Miles O\u2019Brien: But NOAA is facing similar deep cuts. The Trump NASA budget does preserve funding for the Nancy Grace Roman, Hubble, and Webb Space telescopes. Man: And liftoff of Artemis 1. Miles O\u2019Brien: It adds money for human spaceflight, $7 billion for a return to the moon, and a billion for missions focused on Mars. Lori Garver, Former NASA Deputy Administrator: There's this singular focus on human spaceflight that NASA really has never historically had before. Miles O\u2019Brien: Lori Garver was the deputy administrator of NASA in the Obama years. She says the agency may have first caught the public fancy by putting flags and footprints on the moon, but it has evolved into an unrivaled science and engineering enterprise, offering plenty of breakthroughs and thrills, no astronauts required. Lori Garver: Underneath the human spaceflight program has always been aeronautics research, robotics, scientific exploration, and earth sciences, viewing the Earth from space. Those are the things that continue year after year to poll pretty high in the public realm. Miles O\u2019Brien: California Congressman George Whitesides is a former NASA chief of staff and CEO of Virgin Galactic. He's now the vice ranking member on the Science Committee. Rep. George Whitesides (D-CA): What we see is a full-scale assault on science in America. It is probably the biggest attack on our scientific establishment in history. It's a poorly wielded chain saw. Miles O\u2019Brien: Some Republicans suggest the chain saw is required to refocus the federal science enterprise. Mark Albrecht: There has been a lot of things that need reorientation, and I think they're getting reoriented. Could that in fact result in a couple years with a big new push in science that is managed differently? I see no reason to believe that wouldn't be true. Miles O\u2019Brien: But as scientists look for opportunities in other countries, a brain drain is already under way. They say even a few years of retreat could lead to irreparable harm. Rep. George Whitesides: I think that once we get into the real damage that is going to be caused to the weather service, to NASA satellites that are monitoring fire, when we see the carnage that is going to be inflicted on NASA centers around the country, that there will be pushback.But that is an untested proposition. We haven't seen that really yet. Miles O\u2019Brien: It is uncharted territory, an experiment that scientists would prefer not to attempt \u2014 Amna. Amna Nawaz: So, Miles, take us back now to the president's original pick nominated to lead the agency. That's Jared Isaacman. What do we know about him? Why was he picked to lead the agency? And why did the president then pull that nomination? Miles O\u2019Brien: Yes, it was a stunner over the weekend.Jared Isaacman, self-made billionaire with a payment system called Shift4, picked by the president. Isaacman, with very close ties to Elon Musk, having purchased two space flights from SpaceX, conducting the first civilian space walk, among other things, owns a fleet of fighter jets, seemed kind of perfect for the job, went through his nomination hearings well, was well on his way to an up-vote in the Senate to become the next NASA administrator.And then over the weekend, it got pulled by the White House. And the reason that's been given is that he has a history of giving to Democratic candidates over the years. I looked at the public records for that. He has indeed given to several Democratic candidates, also Republicans over the years, and he's not registered as a Democrat.I'm told this information was known to the White House from day one, so it's rather mysterious why this nomination was pulled so suddenly this past weekend. Amna Nawaz: And what do we know, Miles, about what his leadership would have meant for NASA? Miles O\u2019Brien: It was a real generational shift. It's from old space to very new, to \u2014 from the commercial ventures were going to take center stage here. His close relationship with Elon Musk, his desire to explore using private rockets was quite obvious.And many at NASA saw this as a real change of philosophy there, or at least pushing further into the commercial realm. There are some choices that are being bandied about to potentially replace him as a NASA nominee. And some of them are retired Air Force generals, which would indicate a shift in an entirely different direction.Amna, many Republicans would like to see space being moved more into the militaristic sphere. So it'll be interesting to see how this plays out at NASA amid all these very draconian budget cuts. Amna Nawaz: And NASA is now facing its largest ever budget cut. What does it mean that this is a leaderless agency? Miles O\u2019Brien: Yes, it'll take a time to get somebody else vetted, through the process, through the hearings.And it's facing its biggest cut year to year ever, takes the agency back to its \u2014 adjusted for inflation, back to 1961 budget levels. So it cries out for a strong leader at this time, and it appears the corner office is going to be empty of the permanent leader for quite some time. Amna Nawaz: All right, Miles O'Brien, always good to speak with you. Thank you so much. Miles O\u2019Brien: You're welcome, Amna.

San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said he was \u201cdeeply upset\u201d by an ICE operation at a popular Italian restaurant just before the dinner rush on Friday. A chaotic showdown unfolded outside as customers and witnesses shouted, smoke filled the air, and agents wore heavy tactical gear to face an angry crowd. Todd Lyons, ICE\u2019s acting director, turned emotional when asked to explain why officials wear masks. He said some have received death threats and been harassed online. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I\u2019m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, their family on the line because people don\u2019t like what immigration enforcement is,\u201d he said at a news conference in Boston to announce nearly 1,500 arrests in the region as part of a month-long \u201csurge operation.\u201d Lyons was leaving the room when a reporter asked him about the masks. He returned to the podium. \u201cIs that the issue here that we\u2019re just upset about the masks?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr is anyone upset about the fact that ICE officers\u2019 families were labeled terrorists?\u201d Lyons may have been referring to comments by San Diego Councilman Sean Elo-Rivera, who called ICE officers \u201cterrorists\u201d after Friday\u2019s restaurant raid. \u201cThis isn\u2019t safety. It\u2019s state-sponsored terrorism,\u201d Elo-Rivera wrote on Instagram. The Department of Homeland Security reposted Elo-Rivera\u2019s message, saying that likening ICE to terrorists was \u201csickening.\u201d The councilman stuck by his comments on Monday. Other elected officials, such as Gloria and U.S. Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego, both Democrats, were more muted but also sharply critical of ICE and the Republican White House. \u201cFederal actions like these are billed as a public safety measure, but it had the complete opposite effect. What we saw undermines trust and creates fear in our community,\u201d Gloria said. ICE said Monday that the operation at Buona Forchetta, an anchor of San Diego\u2019s trendy South Park neighborhood, resulted in four arrests of people in the U.S. illegally. Authorities executed criminal search warrants for illegal hiring and making false statements when the crowd \u201cbecame unruly,\u201d prompting them to use flash-bang devices. \u201cWhen gatherings like these are formed, it not only places law enforcement in danger but also the demonstrators/onlookers attempting to impede law enforcement activity,\u201d ICE said in a statement. The owners said they were closing their restaurants in Southern California for two days. \u201cWe wish we could find stronger words, but the truth is we are heartbroken,\u201d the owners said in a statement. \u201cThe traumatic incident involving a federal enforcement operation at our original and beloved South Park location has left a mark on all of us. A wound that is still raw, still echoing in our kitchens, our dining rooms, and our hearts.\u201d Lyons said in an interview on Fox & Friends Sunday that ICE was averaging about 1,600 arrests a day, a sharp increase from previous data that showed 78,155 arrests between Jan. 20 and May 19 \u2014 a daily average of 656. He said ICE can and will do more. Stephen Miller, the key architect of Trump\u2019s immigration policy, last week set a goal of 3,000 arrests a day and said the number could go higher. That pace would be a huge challenge with current funding. ICE housed an average of more than 46,000 detainees during the first half of May, already above its budgeted capacity. Lyons said operations like the surge in Massachusetts wouldn\u2019t be necessary if \u201csanctuary cities would change their policy.\u201d There\u2019s no legal definition for sanctuary city policies, but they generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

(AP) \u2014 A man armed with a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices launched a fiery attack on demonstrators in Colorado who were calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Twelve people were injured and the FBI described the violence as a \u201ctargeted terror attack.\u201d The suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d durig the attack Sunday, according to Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Denver field office. Authorities believe Soliman acted alone. He has been charged with multiple state counts and a federal a hate crime. How did the attack unfold? A placard states the county courthouse is closed after an attack that injured multiple people in Boulder, Colorado. Photo by Mark Makela/Reuters Authorities said the attacker targeted volunteers with Run for Their Lives, which organizes running and walking events to call for the immediate release of Israelis being held in Gaza. The hostages were captured by militants during an incursion into southern Israel in 2023 that precipitated the latest Israel-Hamas war. The group gathered Sunday at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and students. Witnesses said the suspect first used the flame thrower, then threw two Molotov cocktails into the crowd. Soliman was arrested at the scene. Video from the scene shows a shirtless Soliman shouting at onlookers while holding two clear bottles containing a transparent liquid. Another video shows a witness shouting: \u201cHe\u2019s right there. He\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails,\u201d as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect. Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty told reporters Monday that authorities uncovered 16 unused Molotov cocktails. One witness, Alex Osante, said Soliman appeared to catch himself on fire during the attack. A booking photo shows him with a bandage over one of his ears. Police said he was taken to the hospital after he was arrested but haven\u2019t described his injuries. What was his motive? Witnesses said Soliman yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d as he launched the attack. An FBI affidavit said he confessed to the attack. He told investigators \u201che wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,\u201d that he specifically targeted the Run for Their Lives group and that he had researched and planned the attack for more than a year, according to the affidavit. \u201cThis act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,\u201d FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X. The Israel-Hamas war has inflamed global tensions and contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. A week earlier, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot to death in Washington, D.C., by a man who yelled \u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza\u201d as he was led away by police. What charges does Soliman face? Soliman participated in a brief court hearing Monday afternoon via video from the Boulder County jail. He is charged federally with commission of a hate crime, which carries a sentence of life in prison when the charge includes attempted murder. Colorado state charges include 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of using an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. A judge set a $10 million cash-only bond on the state charges. Additional charges are possible in federal court. The Justice Department plans to seek a grand jury indictment. Who is Soliman? Soliman was born in Egypt and he moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, where he lived with his wife and five children, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait. The Department of Homeland Security said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and has been living in the U.S. illegally since his visa expired in February 2023. Soliman worked as an Uber driver and had passed the company\u2019s eligibility requirements, which include a criminal background check, according to a spokesperson for Uber. An online resume under Suliman\u2019s name says he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Soliman listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo, on the resume. Who was injured? The people injured in the Pearl Street attack range in age from 52 to 88. Their injuries \u2014 some serious and some minor \u2014 were consistent with reports of people being set on fire, Redfearn said. Authorities initially said there were eight victims, but said four others later were identified. Photos from the scene showed a burning woman lying on the ground in a fetal position and a man helping to put out the flames using a jug of water. \u201cThe immense wave of positive messages we\u2019ve received is another signal of the health and strong spirits of our community,\u201d Rabbi Yisroel and Leah Wilhelm, directors of the Rohr Chabad House at the University of Colorado said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage everyone to respond energetically to this attack by celebrating Shavuot joyously, by attending the reading of the Ten Commandments, and by recommitting to the heritage and traditions we hold so dear.\u201d Rodriguez reported from San Francisco.

(AP) \u2014 A man accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and an incendiary device to attack a group in Boulder, Colorado, that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to court documents filed Monday. The suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, told police he planned it for a year and specifically targeted what he described as the \u201cZionist group,\u201d the FBI said. Eight people were injured in the attack, some with burns, as a group was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Witnesses reported the man yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d during the attack. An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again. The affidavit was released in support of a federal hate crime charged filed by the Justice Department on Monday. Court records show Soliman was scheduled to appear in state court in Boulder at 1:30 p.m. The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday saying he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the \u201cvicious terror attack\u201d in Colorado. READ MORE: Police investigating attack at outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado Attack leads to increased security elsewhere \u201cSadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,\u201d said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder. In New York, the police department said it upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot. The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, \u201cHe\u2019s right there. He\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails,\u201d as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand. Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a \u201cboom\u201d sound followed by people yelling and screaming. In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

Suspect reemerged after initial attack before being arrested After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed. Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a \u201crope of fire\u201d shot in front of her and then \u201ctwo big flares.\u201d She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help. Law enforcement found more than a dozen unlit Molotov cocktails near where Soliman was arrested. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said. Inside his car, law enforcement found papers with the words \u201cIsrael,\u201d \u201cPalestine,\u201d and \u201cUSAID,\u201d the affidavit says. Soliman told investigators that he constructed homemade Molotov cocktails after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients. He drove to Boulder with the devices in his car and stopped along the way for gas, according to the affidavit. He said in his interview that his goal was to \u201ckill all Zionists,\u201d the FBI said, and that he intentionally targeted the group and knew they they would be assembled on Sunday afternoon. \u201cHe stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,\u201d the affidavit says. The group that was attacked has said it was trying to raise attention to the plight of the Israeli hostages in Gaza. Authorities say they believe the suspect acted alone Authorities said Sunday they believe Soliman acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear. State and federal authorities planned to hold a news conference Monday afternoon. Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after having entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information. Public records listed Soliman as living in a modest rented townhouse in Colorado Springs, where local media outlets reported federal law enforcement agents were on the scene Sunday. Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his family as kindly neighbors with five children, three young kids and two teenagers, who\u2019d play with Pruiett\u2019s kids in front of their building, share food and hellos. But she said when she saw Soliman on video in Boulder, shirtless and holding bottles with flames licking up the grass in front of him, it was hard to recognize him. \u201cThere had to be something deeply disturbing him, cause that is not the guy we see in the neighborhood,\u201d said Pruiett, leaning on her doorframe and gazing several feet away at Soliman\u2019s apartment. Soliman had never been outwardly political, she said, \u201che didn\u2019t push his views or values on anyone.\u201d On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman\u2019s home to come out. Nobody came out, and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett. The raid lasted several hours, she said. An online resume under Soliman\u2019s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo. FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a \u201cneedless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.\u201d \u201cThis act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts.

Give Now By \u2014 Colleen Slevin, Associated Press Colleen Slevin, Associated Press By \u2014 Eric Tucker, Associated Press Eric Tucker, Associated Press\nBOULDER, Colo. (AP) \u2014 A man accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and an incendiary device to attack a group in Boulder, Colorado, that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to court documents filed Monday. The suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, told police he planned it for a year and specifically targeted what he described as the \u201cZionist group,\u201d the FBI said. Eight people were injured in the attack, some with burns, as a group was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Witnesses reported the man yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d during the attack. An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again. The affidavit was released in support of a federal hate crime charged filed by the Justice Department on Monday. Court records show Soliman was scheduled to appear in state court in Boulder at 1:30 p.m. The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday saying he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the \u201cvicious terror attack\u201d in Colorado.

In New York, the police department said it upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot. The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a \u201cboom\u201d sound followed by people yelling and screaming. In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

June Crenshaw, deputy director of the Capital Pride Alliance, joins John Yang to discuss. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. John Yang: WorldPride, the international LGBTQ plus celebration is underway in Washington, D.C. against the backdrop of the Trump administration rolling back LGBTQ rights and protections, particularly for transgender people. The co-creator of the ACLU's Freedom to Be campaign, which advocates for trans people's rights, says that makes the event all the more significant.Gillian Branstetter, \"Freedom To BE,\" ACLU: There is nothing that Donald Trump has done or can do to LGBT people that we have not faced before. We have to show up for one another and show that, no, the power actually lives with us, the people.And if, you know, he wants us sitting in our home, scrolling on our phones, terrified of what will come next, I think what's important for us to do is remember that courage is contagious. John Yang: But President Trump's anti DEI policies have led some corporate sponsors to drop out, and some foreign transgender groups have canceled their participation.June Crenshaw is the deputy director of the Capitol Pride alliance. The Washington D.C. Group hosting World Pride.June, when Washington was selected to be the host city for World Pride. As I understand it, the idea was to it'll be a celebration of the 50th anniversary of D.C. Pride. The Washington D.C. Pride event with what's happened with the second Trump administration has the emphasis and maybe the tone changed. June Crenshaw, Capital Pride Alliance: We certainly expected for WorldPride to be a different celebration. And since the Trump administration, we've had to pivot and really go back to our roots when prides were protests and to really shift to an advocacy type of approach, but not forgetting the fact that we needed to build unity and community and also experience joy.We weren't prepared for the swiftness of these real horrific actions towards members of our community and really are having to adjust to the new circumstances. And again, Washington, D.C. is a perfect place for this because it's a place where resistance occurs, activism occurs, but also progress. John Yang: Some people who are planning to come from foreign countries, sort of outsiders looking in, have expressed concern about personal safety, particularly transgender people. Three European nations have issued travel advisories. The Canadian LGBTQ rights group Eagle Canada cancelled its particular participation. We have a bit of tape here from a member of Toronto's Club for Trans and Binary Swimmers. Let's take a listen. Ry Shissler, Toronto\u2019s Purple Fins: Can my team's rights be respective? Are we going to be arrested just for existing? Are we going to be assaulted and have the authorities defend us instead of the attacker? Those are all questions we couldn't definitively say yes to. So we had to say no, we can't come. John Yang: What do you say to people who have those feelings? June Crenshaw: Those are really legitimate concerns and we certainly don't want to minimize anyone's safety. We are asking individuals to consider their safety and their entire circumstances when making a decision to attend.But for those members of our community that can show up, we're asking you to show up. It is so important for us to have unity and visibility and resistance in this moment. The Trump administration wants us to disappear. And really showing up for WorldPride is a direct no to that request. John Yang: A number of longtime corporate sponsors have pulled out, citing the administration's orders on DEI. Booz Allen Hamilton, Deloitte, Comcast have you been affected by that? June Crenshaw: We've been impacted by that just as many prides across the nation and even globally. I would say that we've seen probably a 20 percent reduction in our corporate sponsors than years pass and it's hard to tell the most vulnerable members of our community to be visible, to resist when corporations that have resources and power are not finding avenues to do that.So it's disappointing, but it sets us back to our roots of, you know, really looking to the community and not brands to advocate for us. There have been many organizations that have continued to support and to stand with us and we have a long memory of who those individuals are. John Yang: To be sure, there are celebratory events. There will be a parade, there'll be a street festival. What's the overall message you hope comes out of this event? June Crenshaw: That we are a strong, resilient group, that we've navigated this before, that there's opportunities for us, you know, again, to show unity, to come together, to develop an agenda of fighting back, that there should be strategies around protecting the most vulnerable members of our community that are losing rights, the ability to serve in the military and a whole sundry of other things that are happening.We are here. We're not going anywhere. And we need to come together and fight back all the horrific laws and the ways in which our community is being targeted. John Yang: June Crenshaw, thank you very much. June Crenshaw: Thank you.

In the coming days, people will immerse themselves in religious rituals and acts of worship that originated more than 1,400 years ago. READ MORE: The Hajj pilgrimage and why it\u2019s significant for Muslims They also have to contend with excess heat and other earthly factors, like a ban on children under the age of 12 and a crackdown on unauthorized entry. Here\u2019s what to know about this year\u2019s Hajj. Beating the heat in the Saudi desert Last year\u2019s pilgrims struggled through burning sun and suffocating hot weather, with the mercury hitting 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit). More than 1,300 people died. This year, Saudi authorities are advising caution in direct sunlight, telling pilgrims to avoid going out during the day and uncovering their heads, except for rituals, unless necessary. People walk as they arrive at the grand mosque during the annual hajj pilgrimage in the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, June 3, 2025. Photo by Saudi Press Agency/Handout via Reuters An official safety kit emphasizes the importance of light-colored clothing and umbrellas. It also has details on recognizing and treating the symptoms of dehydration and heat exhaustion. But it\u2019s tough to avoid the heat and crowds when the Hajj is outdoors. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many, elevating the personal stakes further, and temperatures in Mecca are already 41 degrees Celsius (about 106 Fahrenheit). Although the desert kingdom spends billions of dollars on crowd control and cooling, the sheer number of pilgrims and climatic conditions make it difficult to guarantee people\u2019s safety. A ban on children under 12 at the Hajj Saudi Arabia has banned children under 12 from this year\u2019s Hajj \u2014 one of the biggest policy changes in recent years. Riyadh reportedly introduced the ban as a precautionary measure to ensure children\u2019s safety during the pilgrimage, which could be a dangerous environment for them because of the huge crowds. Children are exempt from doing the Hajj and are not required to fulfill other Islamic obligations, like prayer and fasting, until they reach puberty. READ MORE: Muslims converge at Mount Arafat to worship as Hajj pilgrimage reaches its peak But that doesn\u2019t stop some parents from wanting to take their children to experience the Hajj and see the holiest site in Islam, the Kaaba, the black, cube-shaped structure that is the focal point for daily prayers. Father of five Talha Ayub, from the Pakistani city of Lahore, said his kids were staying with their grandparents while he and his wife performed the Hajj in a \u201cmore relaxed way.\u201d \u201cEven if children were allowed, we probably wouldn\u2019t have taken them because the weather is extremely harsh this year,\u201d said Ayub, whose children are aged 1 to 13. \u201cI have mixed feelings about leaving them behind. I\u2019ll miss them.\u201d There\u2019s no official age breakdown for pilgrims, but most are between 35 and 64. Layaways and lowering the price tag The price of a Hajj ranges from $4,000 to $20,000, depending on the length of stay, level of comfort, and country of departure. Depreciating currencies, high inflation, and tax hikes in Saudi Arabia also have an impact on how much Muslims end up paying. The countries that typically send the most pilgrims are developing nations. Some have trimmed the price of government-backed Hajj programs to make them more affordable. But this step isn\u2019t always enough. Farid Ahmed Majumder, secretary general of the Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh, said the country was allowed to send some 127,000 pilgrims this year but failed to meet this quota, mainly because of higher costs. Pakistan has reduced the price of the state-run Hajj program. It has also debuted a flexible payment system. People walk past a marble mosaic of the Koran at a museum near the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, June 3, 2025. Photo by Khaled Abdullah/ Reuters Farmer and small business owner Zaheer Ahmad said he didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for his Hajj up-front, 1.2 million rupees or about $4,255. He paid in three installments, applying for the Hajj in December with an advance and finishing his payments in February. \u201cOtherwise, I might not have been able to go for Hajj at all,\u201d he said. In Saudi Arabia, which has also introduced flexible payments, domestic pilgrims pay 20% within 72 hours of booking, another 40% during Ramadan and the final 40% the following month. Managing wait times and overcrowding Although the Hajj is at least a once-in-a-lifetime obligation \u2014 for every Muslim who can afford it and is physically able to make it \u2014 people don\u2019t want to wait a lifetime to fulfill it. But the Hajj has limited capacity, countries have set quotas, and there is only one time each year to do it. Patience really is a virtue and everything needs to align: availability, health, and finances. READ MORE: Saudi Arabia cracks down on Hajj permits to prevent overcrowding Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have decades-long waiting lists for the Hajj.

Give Now By \u2014 Riazat Butt, Associated Press Riazat Butt, Associated Press\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) \u2014 Muslims from around the world are in the Saudi city of Mecca for the Hajj, one of the Five Pillars of Islam. In the coming days, people will immerse themselves in religious rituals and acts of worship that originated more than 1,400 years ago. READ MORE: The Hajj pilgrimage and why it\u2019s significant for Muslims They also have to contend with excess heat and other earthly factors, like a ban on children under the age of 12 and a crackdown on unauthorized entry. Here\u2019s what to know about this year\u2019s Hajj. Beating the heat in the Saudi desert Last year\u2019s pilgrims struggled through burning sun and suffocating hot weather, with the mercury hitting 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit). More than 1,300 people died. This year, Saudi authorities are advising caution in direct sunlight, telling pilgrims to avoid going out during the day and uncovering their heads, except for rituals, unless necessary.

It also has details on recognizing and treating the symptoms of dehydration and heat exhaustion. But it\u2019s tough to avoid the heat and crowds when the Hajj is outdoors. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many, elevating the personal stakes further, and temperatures in Mecca are already 41 degrees Celsius (about 106 Fahrenheit). Although the desert kingdom spends billions of dollars on crowd control and cooling, the sheer number of pilgrims and climatic conditions make it difficult to guarantee people\u2019s safety. A ban on children under 12 at the Hajj Saudi Arabia has banned children under 12 from this year\u2019s Hajj \u2014 one of the biggest policy changes in recent years. Riyadh reportedly introduced the ban as a precautionary measure to ensure children\u2019s safety during the pilgrimage, which could be a dangerous environment for them because of the huge crowds. Children are exempt from doing the Hajj and are not required to fulfill other Islamic obligations, like prayer and fasting, until they reach puberty.

Father of five Talha Ayub, from the Pakistani city of Lahore, said his kids were staying with their grandparents while he and his wife performed the Hajj in a \u201cmore relaxed way.\u201d \u201cEven if children were allowed, we probably wouldn\u2019t have taken them because the weather is extremely harsh this year,\u201d said Ayub, whose children are aged 1 to 13. \u201cI have mixed feelings about leaving them behind. I\u2019ll miss them.\u201d There\u2019s no official age breakdown for pilgrims, but most are between 35 and 64. Layaways and lowering the price tag The price of a Hajj ranges from $4,000 to $20,000, depending on the length of stay, level of comfort, and country of departure. Depreciating currencies, high inflation, and tax hikes in Saudi Arabia also have an impact on how much Muslims end up paying. The countries that typically send the most pilgrims are developing nations. Some have trimmed the price of government-backed Hajj programs to make them more affordable. But this step isn\u2019t always enough. Farid Ahmed Majumder, secretary general of the Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh, said the country was allowed to send some 127,000 pilgrims this year but failed to meet this quota, mainly because of higher costs. Pakistan has reduced the price of the state-run Hajj program. It has also debuted a flexible payment system. People walk past a marble mosaic of the Koran at a museum near the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, June 3, 2025. Photo by Khaled Abdullah/ Reuters Farmer and small business owner Zaheer Ahmad said he didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for his Hajj up-front, 1.2 million rupees or about $4,255. He paid in three installments, applying for the Hajj in December with an advance and finishing his payments in February. \u201cOtherwise, I might not have been able to go for Hajj at all,\u201d he said. In Saudi Arabia, which has also introduced flexible payments, domestic pilgrims pay 20% within 72 hours of booking, another 40% during Ramadan and the final 40% the following month. Managing wait times and overcrowding Although the Hajj is at least a once-in-a-lifetime obligation \u2014 for every Muslim who can afford it and is physically able to make it \u2014 people don\u2019t want to wait a lifetime to fulfill it. But the Hajj has limited capacity, countries have set quotas, and there is only one time each year to do it. Patience really is a virtue and everything needs to align: availability, health, and finances.

It comes as half a million Gazans are extremely food insecure and on the verge of famine. Nick Schifrin reports. A warning, images in this story are disturbing. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: It's designed to deliver food to the most desperate, but for the third time in three days, Gazans faced gunfire outside a new humanitarian aid site. Today, as many as 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers. That's according to Palestinian health officials and the International Red Cross. Amna Nawaz: Some half-a-million people in Gaza are extremely food-insecure and are on the verge of famine.Nick Schifrin begins our coverage. And a warning: Images in this story are disturbing. Nick Schifrin: This morning in Gaza, they set out to end their hunger. They died hungry, more than two dozen killed before they could pick up food. Some died anonymously, their body bags marked \"Name Unknown\" next to the time of death.For others, irreplaceable loss. Ahmed Zadan will never again see his mother. \"Mom, please come back to me,\" he says. \"Please come back.\"Relatives say Reem Ahmed was killed trying to feed her family. Another son lays his head on his mother's body one last time.For Gazans, accessing the barest of necessities, beans, pasta, rice, has become a daily gamble with their lives. Often for crumbs.Rasha Al-Nahal shows what little she managed to collect. Rasha Al-Nahal, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter): We don't get anything. We see people getting killed in front of us and end up leaving empty-handed. We're tired and we can't take this anymore. We'd rather die than deal with this. Death is more dignified to us than what's happening to us. Nick Schifrin: The new sites are run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which funnels Gazans into small areas secured by private American contractors. The sites lie within exclusive military zones, and Israeli soldiers are right outside.Today, Israeli troops fired about a third of a mile from the humanitarian site only to protect themselves, said spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin. Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, Israeli Defense Forces Spokesperson: Earlier today, IDF forces carried out warning fire approximately half-a-kilometer from the aid distribution center targeting a few individuals who were approaching in a way that posed a security threat.We are not preventing Gaza residents from accessing the aid distribution sites. The IDF is committed to uncovering the truth and will examine any incident that requires review. Nick Schifrin: But it's not the first time Israeli troops have fired outside GHF sites. And on multiple occasions, aid distribution has descended into chaos. U.N. and aid officials oppose these sites because they do not adhere to traditional humanitarian principles, International Rescue Committee's Ciaran Donnelly told me last week. Ciaran Donnelly, Senior Vice President, International Rescue Committee: The way that it's been organized, with limited distribution sites, forcing people to concentrate themselves in fundamentally undignified and inhumane conditions to receive food, just simply doesn't meet that very basic test for good humanitarian work. Nick Schifrin: But Israel and the U.S. argue Hamas has been stealing aid to fund its attacks and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which opened a female-only distribution site today, is the best way to feed a hungry population that is terrorized by Hamas, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said today. Tammy Bruce, State Department Spokesperson: They wouldn't need to be there if Hamas would lay down their weapons and release all the hostages and the bodies that they're also holding. Nick Schifrin: But the war goes on, as does daily displacement of families, who are forced to find whatever food they can.For the \"PBS News Hour,\" I'm Nick Schifrin.

Geoff Bennett: The day's other headlines start in South Korea, where liberal opposition leader Lee Jae-myung won his country's presidential race.(Cheering) Geoff Bennett: Members of his party celebrated tonight after a joint exit poll showed Lee was projected to beat his conservative opponent, who came out later to concede.The snap election follows conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol's removal from office. His short-lived declaration of martial law last year sparked political upheaval that deeply divided South Koreans. On the heels of tonight's victory, Lee promised supporters he will reunite the country. Lee Jae-Myung, South Korean President-Elect (through interpreter): While politicians may clash over interests and draw lines between factions, the people are not bound to follow those divisions. People are the master of this nation, and politicians are workers who are responsible for people's lives. Political quarrels may not be avoidable, but people don't have to be divided and hate each other.

The Ukrainian Security Service released video that it says shows the blast, though it has not been independently verified.Here in the U.S., budget officials have sent the first so-called rescissions package to Congress. In a social media post, the Office of Management and Budget said the measure contains what it calls billions in wasteful foreign aid and federal funding for NPR and PBS. All told, the package would eliminate some $9.4 billion that had already been allocated by Congress.That includes more than $8 billion in foreign aid cuts, plus more than $1 billion that was set aside for public media, including PBS, which airs this program. The package requires a simple majority in the House and Senate to pass.The mayor of Newark sued New Jersey's top federal prosecutor today over his arrest outside of an immigration detention center last month. Ras Baraka accuses interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba of pursuing the case for political reasons. She says \u2014 she was appointed by President Trump.Baraka is running for the state's Democratic nomination for governor. His lawsuit came on the same day that early in-person voting started. Cell phone video from may showed a chaotic scene outside of the detention facility in Newark, where Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge that was later dropped.U.S. immigration officials detained the family today of the man accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on social media that officials are investigating whether they knew about Mohamed Sabry Soliman's plans.According to court documents, he told authorities that no one knew his intentions. Soliman injured 12 people on Sunday who were marching in support of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Officials say he's an Egyptian national living in the U.S. illegally. The immigration status of his family is not clear.There is smoke and storms in the forecast for tens of millions of Americans from the U.S.-Canada border all the way to the Gulf Coast. Severe storms dumped hail and several inches of rain in the middle of the country today, with nearly 20 million people under flood alerts. Those storms are colliding with a massive plume of wildfire smoke from Canada that remains visible from space and is still prompting air quality alerts across the Upper Midwest.Meantime, a giant cloud of dust from the Sahara Desert is currently clouding parts of the Caribbean as it heads toward Florida. It's expected to spread across the Gulf Coast region later this week.On Wall Street today, stocks inched ever closer to record highs. The Dow Jones industrial average added more than 200 points, or about half-a-percent. The Nasdaq rose more than 150 points on the day.

The blimp is suddenly\u2026 Geoff Bennett: The Ohio-based company began making airships for the U.S. Navy back in 1917. And in 1925 its first branded blimp took to the skies outside Akron.Since then, they have become a larger-than-life staple of American culture, hovering over sporting events and national celebrations. There are currently four Goodyear Blimps in the world, one of them in Germany and three here in the U.S. In fact, there are fewer blimp pilots in the world, just 10, than astronauts.

The brown prickly algae is suffocating shorelines from Puerto Rico to Guyana and beyond, disrupting tourism, killing wildlife and even releasing toxic gases that forced one school in the French Caribbean island of Martinique to temporarily close. WATCH: Farmers turn to seaweed in attempt to reduce methane emissions from livestock The amount \u2014 38 million metric tons \u2014 is the biggest quantity of algae observed across the Caribbean Sea, the western and eastern Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico since scientists began studying the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt in 2011, said Brian Barnes, an assistant research professor at the University of South Florida who worked on the report published on Monday by the University of South Florida\u2019s Optical Oceanography Lab. The previous record was set in June 2022, with some 22 million metric tons. \u201cThe peaks just seem to keep getting bigger and bigger year after year,\u201d he said.

They thrive in different ways depending on sunlight, nutrients and water temperature, factors that scientists are currently studying, Barnes said.

While large clumps of algae in the open ocean are what Barnes called a \u201chealthy, happy ecosystem\u201d for creatures ranging from tiny shrimp to endangered sea turtles, sargassum near or on shore can wreak havoc. It can block sunlight that coral reefs need to survive, and if the algae sinks, it can smother reefs and sea grasses. Once it reaches shore, the creatures living in the algae die or are picked off by birds, Barnes said. Huge piles of stinky seaweed also are a headache for the Caribbean, where tourism often generates big money for small islands. \u201cIt is a challenge, but it\u2019s certainly not affecting every single inch of the Caribbean,\u201d said Frank Comito, special adviser to the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association. In the popular tourist spot of Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, officials have invested in barriers to prevent sargassum from reaching the shore, he said. In the Dutch Caribbean territory of St. Maarten, crews with backhoes were dispatched in late May as part of an emergency clean-up after residents complained of strong smells of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which can affect a person\u2019s respiratory system. \u201cThe smell is quite terrible,\u201d Barnes said. Meanwhile, in the French Caribbean, officials expect to soon use storage barges and an upgraded special vessel that can collect several tons of seaweed a day. The sargassum \u201cdisfigures our coasts, prevents swimming and makes life impossible for local residents,\u201d French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou recently told reporters. But Comito said such vessels are \u201cmassively expensive\u201d and not a popular option, noting that another option \u2014 using heavy equipment \u2014- is labor-intensive. \u201cYou have to be careful because there could be sea turtle eggs affected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can go in there and massively rake and scrape the whole thing.\u201d Some Caribbean islands struggle financially, so most of the cleanup is done by hotels, with some offering guests refunds or a free shuttle to unaffected beaches. Every year, the amount of sargassum expands in late spring, peaks around summer and starts to decline in the late fall or early winter, Barnes said.

But Comito said such vessels are \u201cmassively expensive\u201d and not a popular option, noting that another option \u2014 using heavy equipment \u2014- is labor-intensive. \u201cYou have to be careful because there could be sea turtle eggs affected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can go in there and massively rake and scrape the whole thing.\u201d Some Caribbean islands struggle financially, so most of the cleanup is done by hotels, with some offering guests refunds or a free shuttle to unaffected beaches. Every year, the amount of sargassum expands in late spring, peaks around summer and starts to decline in the late fall or early winter, Barnes said. The new record set is hardly stationary \u2014 experts said they expect even more sargassum for June. Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times. Give Now",

Amna Nawaz: Ukraine and Russia today met for the second time in two weeks to discuss peace, but walked away without any progress towards ending the war. The fighting is as intense as ever.And, this weekend, Ukraine launched an unprecedented attack, launching drones deep inside Russia to target Russian bombers.Nick Schifrin reports. Nick Schifrin: Today in Turkey, a tense face-off, two foes failing again to end Europe's largest war in 80 years. And while the war rages, the two sides are as far apart as ever.Ukraine is demanding a complete cease-fire before formal negotiations, the freedom to join the European Union and NATO, foreign military security guarantees, no military restrictions, and no legal recognition of Russian-occupied territories.The Russian demands almost exactly opposed, no unconditional cease-fire, a block on Ukraine's joining NATO, the exclusion of all foreign military support in intelligence, caps on the size of Ukraine's military, and the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from at least four regions of which Russia only controls a portion, as well as international recognition of all occupied Ukrainian territory as Russian.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of stalling. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian President (through interpreter): They said they're ready for a two-to-three-day cease-fire to collect bodies from the battlefield. I think they're idiots, because the whole point of a cease-fire is to prevent people from being killed in the first place. I really want our American partners to take strong steps to impose a package of sanctions and to pressure the Russians into a cease-fire. Nick Schifrin: Russian delegation head Vladimir Medinsky was more matter of fact.Vladimir Medinsky, Head of Russian Delegation (through interpreter): We have handed over our memorandum to the Turkish side, which consists of two parts, first, how to achieve a real long-term peace. And the second part is what steps should be taken to make a full-fledged cease-fire possible. Nick Schifrin: The two sides did agree today to exchange the bodies of killed soldiers, 1,000 wounded, ill or young prisoners, and Russia will return more than 300 Ukrainian children kidnapped near the front lines.But, this weekend, Ukraine reached well beyond those front lines, launching more than 100 drones that had been hidden inside shipping containers and trucked inside Russia to attack Russian bombers. Ukraine claimed to have destroyed more than 40 bombers on four military bases some thousands of miles from Ukraine's border, the destruction of at least a handful of planes visible from space.Ukraine said the operation took more than a year-and-a-half to plan, and a senior U.S. defense official confirmed Ukraine provided no advanced warning.Meanwhile, Russia's strikes have accelerated this weekend. It launched the largest drone salvo of the war. One attack killed more than a dozen soldiers, leading to Ukraine's land forces commander, Amna, submitting his resignation. Amna Nawaz: Nick, take us back to that Ukrainian unprecedented attack deep inside Russia. How significant an attack was that? Nick Schifrin: So the Ukrainians claimed it was 41 Russian bombers. Russia only has about 90 of these bombers. So if Ukraine is telling the truth, then it's a huge portion of Russia's strategic assets in terms of its bombers.A senior defense official yesterday told reporters that the number is probably inflated, and a separate U.S. official told me that as well. But, nonetheless, it is a very significant strike. We have seen multiple aircraft burned out, even from space, as I pointed out.It shows a lot of planning. It shows an intelligence capability inside Russia that we did not know Ukraine had, just logistics, trying to get all of those drones, to construct them in Russia, to build some kind of container to conceal them, and then to get close to these four bases. That shows a level of sophistication that a senior defense official told us yesterday we have not seen Ukraine have.It also demonstrates, Amna, perhaps that Ukraine still has the capability to do that kind of attack again. Amna Nawaz: So even if the numbers are potentially inflated, could that potentially reduce Russia's ability to carry out strikes against Ukraine? Nick Schifrin: So, I think part of it does depend on the numbers, the number of bombers that they in fact end up having to have destroyed.But what this will do, even if the number is lower, it will require the fewer bombers that they have to fly more frequently. And, therefore, it should reduce the number of sorties that Russia can launch in order to launch these glide bombs, these cruise missiles into Ukraine, which has been absolutely devastating for Ukrainian forces.So, again, we don't know the full impact, but it's bound to have a negative impact on Russia's ability to launch deep into Ukraine. Amna Nawaz: Aside from Ukraine, these are bombers that fly around the world, right? They have the purpose of showing off Russia's reach and their nuclear capability. Does this weaken Russia's global military reach? Nick Schifrin: I think it's a really important question.So, when we put it into the context of other Russian losses, think about the lack of bases now in Syria, because Assad has been overthrown. Think about the Black Sea fleet, which has been a cornerstone of Russia for centuries. They have lost their ability to have that Black Sea fleet in Western Crimea on the Black Sea.Think about the percentage of helicopters, of armor, right? These get into strategic losses for Russia. And some of the analysts who are looking for this attack, frankly, to be outsized in terms of its impact do believe that these kinds of strategic losses will add up and that, even if Russia doesn't have to necessarily stop attacking Ukraine tonight or next week or next month or even this year perhaps, these things will add up in Putin's mind.And the hope of these analysts is that the costs of this war simply add up for these strategic losses, rather than the tactical or operational stuff inside Ukraine itself. Amna Nawaz: As you reported, Russia then, of course, launched its largest drone attack over the weekend. And you saw then, in Istanbul, Moscow is really sticking to its maximalist demands in those negotiations.Does all of this say to you that they are not yet, Russia is not feeling any kind of military pressure right now? Nick Schifrin: I think that's the key question, of course, that Ukraine is interested in and Washington is interested.The evidence is exactly what you just said, that there's nothing on the ground that is forcing Putin to change his calculus, to change his behavior. If anything, we have seen signs that Russian forces believe that they can keep going, thanks largely to Chinese investments in Russia's defense industrial base.So this kind of attack individually has no sign that Russia will have to stop any time soon. And, tonight, in fact, they are warning of a \u2014 quote \u2014 \"disproportionate response.\"But, nonetheless, some analysts do believe that they are trying to get under Putin's skin, so to speak. And this kind of attack is just, frankly, almost humiliating. It's just very public in a way that Ukraine is hoping long term does affect Russia's ability to launch the war. Amna Nawaz: Fascinating reporting.Nick Schifrin, thank you, as always. Nick Schifrin: Thank you.

(AP) \u2014 Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee. State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big \u2014 and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities \u2014 are being hollowed out. \u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. READ MORE: Health and Human Services to lay off 10,000 workers, close agencies in major restructuring But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed. Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people. The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That\u2019s one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments. \u201cIt means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d Keeping communities healthy saves lives \u2014 and money Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio. Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date. \u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said. The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated. The Mecklenburg County department, with \u201cProtecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too. \u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70. Disease prevention is unseen \u2014 and ignored Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health. \u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments. Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department\u2019s budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources. At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening. \u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d Chaos in Washington puts \u2018lives at risk\u2019 In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing. A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support. The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony. A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d \u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing. In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off. In Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak. Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations. The cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go. So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S. \u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings. She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines. \u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said. The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning. With health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California\u2019s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions. But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation \u2014 some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable. \u201cWe\u2019re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County\u2019s health director. \u201cWhat really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. \u2026 We were still pretty trim, but we weren\u2019t just, like, bones.\u201d In Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 \u2014 slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs. In Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu. The cuts are not over. The Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC\u2019s budget, enough to cut the agency\u2019s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities. Michael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States. \u201cWithout the appropriate funding, we can\u2019t properly address these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.\u201d Ungar reported from Charlotte and Louisville, Kentucky, and Smith reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

(AP) \u2014 Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee. State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big \u2014 and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities \u2014 are being hollowed out. \u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. READ MORE: Health and Human Services to lay off 10,000 workers, close agencies in major restructuring But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed. Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people. The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That\u2019s one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments. \u201cIt means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d Keeping communities healthy saves lives \u2014 and money Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio. Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date. \u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said. The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated. The Mecklenburg County department, with \u201cProtecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too. \u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70. Disease prevention is unseen \u2014 and ignored Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health. \u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments. Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department\u2019s budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources. At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks.

The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. But the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups. \u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it could have been.\u201d Kennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor. A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults. \u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\u201d Watch the segment in the player above. That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots. Childhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data. Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization. A CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea. But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review. The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \u201cincredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests \u2026 about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.

Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. John Yang: A new study has found a link between preteens use of social media and future depression. The study was conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco and published this week in the American Medical Journal's association journal JAMA. The study said more time spent on social media may contribute to increased depressive symptoms over time. Ali Rogin spoke with the lead researcher, Dr. Jason Nagata. Ali Rogin: Dr. Nagata, thank you so much for joining us. Social media children, lots of questions, few answers. What did your study find? Jason Nagata: We followed 12,000 preteens over three years and we actually found big rises in social media use. So during that period, social media on average increased from seven minutes a day to over 70 minutes a day. So a tenfold increase.And in our analysis, we actually found that rises in social media from year to year among these 9 then 10 then 11-year olds were actually associated with future depressive symptoms in the following year. So I think there's a big kind of unknown in the field right now.Chicken or the egg? Does social media precede depression or is it maybe just reflection of underlying symptoms? And I think that our study does show a little bit more stronger evidence that social media is a risk factor for future depression in these kids. Ali Rogin: So what you're saying is that you found the correlation here to be with social media use leading to more depressive symptoms, not the other way around. You're saying that depression doesn't necessarily indicate use of social media? Jason Nagata: Yes. In our study, were able to follow these same 12,000 kids year to year. So were able to look at both their depression and their social media use every single year. And so we could look at patterns in their use. And we found that those kids who had big spikes in their social media use from year to year then subsequently had bigger spikes in their depression.But those kids who started off with increases in depression didn't necessarily use social media more. So it is indicating a little bit more of directionality that social media could be a risk factor for future depression. Ali Rogin: And talk to us about the size and the scope of this study. This sounds massive. How did you track this many children and has that been done before? Jason Nagata: So, yeah, the data comes from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. It is a national study that follows these 12,000 kids from over 21 different states, study sites across the U.S. and it's funded by the National Institutes of Health and is I think one of the largest studies on child development and social media and brain health ever. Ali Rogin: You are a physician, I know you're also a parent. And I wonder, seeing these results, what does it make you hope policymakers consider when thinking about social media's impact on children? Jason Nagata: I think one really important thing for policymakers to know is that technically the minimum age requirement for social media is 13 years. But this study essentially represented underage use of social media and we found that even among 11 to 12 year olds, over two-thirds had social media accounts and on average they had three or more different accounts. So these are all kids who had to put in fake dates of birth in order to get access to these sites.And I think it's just a reminder that there's not really robust age verification. So any kid, no matter their age, as long as they can put in a fake date of birth currently is able to very easily access these sites. And many of the kids did report that they had secret accounts that their parents didn't know about.So I think one thing for policymakers to really understand is that the landscape right now is very easy for kids to get on and there aren't very strong securities for privacy and protection for kids. Ali Rogin: That's such a fascinating ancillary piece of information that you found in looking at this data. I do want to ask though, what is your advice for parents with the understanding that this data brings us to. Jason Nagata: Yeah, we actually looked at parent actions for rules and monitoring in the study and we actually found that the biggest predictors of kids screen use was actually their parents screen use. And as a new parent I think it's really important to practice what you preach. So if you're going to tell your kids to put down their phones to important that you role model good behaviors otherwise your kids aren't going to follow the rules.The other two times that it might be really high yield to limit screen use is bedtime to try to promote good sleep and also around meal time to prevent overeating because we know kids tend to overeat while they're distracted in front of screens and also encourage in person connections and conversations around the dinner table. Ali Rogin: Limiting social media around our kids. Something I think most parents, including myself, should, should heed. Dr. Jason Nagata with the University of California, San Francisco. Thank you so much for joining us. Jason Nagata: Thanks so much for having me.

What to know about the latest U.S. changes Health Updated on Jun 3, 2025 3:14 PM EDT \u2014 Published on May 21, 2025 4:31 PM EDT The FDA and CDC will no longer recommend annual COVID vaccinations for healthy people younger than age 65, overturning past official U.S. health policy. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased to announce that as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,\u201d said Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in a video statement released via X on May 27. The FDA announced in May that adults over age 65 and anyone over 6 months with one or more chronic or underlying health conditions, such as asthma, cancer, diabetes or pregnancy, were still recommended to get an updated shot. The CDC later clarified separately that children and pregnant people may still choose to get COVID shots, even though the U.S. health agencies no longer explicitly say they should. The shift was a marked departure from previous guidance, which recommended an annual COVID vaccine for everyone 6 months and older. The FDA\u2019s new blueprint estimated 100 to 200 million people would be eligible under the new guidelines. WATCH: FDA commissioner defends changes to COVID vaccine recommendations To gain approval for COVID vaccines for other groups in the future, pharmaceutical companies would need to conduct new randomized clinical trials for younger healthy populations, according to Makary and Dr. Vinayak Prasad, who directs the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \u201cThe FDA will approve vaccines for high-risk persons and, at the same time, demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk,\u201d Makary and Prasad wrote May 20 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Requiring trials \u201cwill provide information that is desperately craved by health care providers and the American people,\u201d Makary and Prasad wrote. But other experts are worried about hindering the nation\u2019s ability to develop timely vaccines against future pathogens while withholding vaccine doses from healthy people who want further protection now. The new guidance from both the FDA and CDC preempts a scheduled meeting of a CDC advisory panel in June, where experts would typically meet to discuss the vaccine recommendations. Here\u2019s what the recent changes could mean for you. Under the new recommendations, who should get a COVID vaccine? Healthy adults under the age of 65 and children aged 6 months or older are not recommended to receive the updated COVID vaccines going forward, according to the FDA. FDA officials under the current Trump administration said Tuesday the virus has infected many Americans \u201cmultiple times\u201d and claimed that there has been \u201ca reduction in the evidence standard for dose after dose,\u201d Prasad said. There are some exceptions for people with underlying conditions, including: Asthma Cancer Diabetes Pregnancy Depression Chronic lung diseases HIV In his announcement, Kennedy said future COVID vaccines would not be recommended for \u201chealthy, pregnant women.\u201d What did the CDC say about vaccines for kids and pregnant people? The CDC now recommends that parents ask their pediatrician if the COVID vaccine is appropriate for their individual children. This would apply to children who are ages 6 months to 17 years old and who do not have known health complications. \u201cShared clinical decision-making vaccinations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s website. After conflicting messages from the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Susan Kressley, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a written statement that she was \u201crelieved\u201d with the CDC\u2019s updated recommendation. \u201cAmerican families deserve better. They deserve clear messages from all involved in their health, that are based on facts so they can continue to benefit from the success story of vaccines,\u201d Kressley said in the statement. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that it was \u201cconcerned\u201d and \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the Trump administration\u2019s exclusion of pregnant people from receiving updated COVID vaccines. Pregnancy has been shown to raise the risks of developing severe COVID. \u201cFollowing this announcement, we are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit,\u201d ACOG President Dr. Steven J. Fleischman said in a written statement. \u201cWe are concerned about access implications, and what this recommendation will mean for insurance coverage of the COVID vaccine for those who do choose to get vaccinated during pregnancy. And as ob-gyns, we are very concerned about the potential deterioration of vaccine confidence in the future.\u201d What do these COVID shot changes mean for families and care workers? While vaccine coverage would remain the same for people over age 65 or anyone six months or older with underlying risk factors, the people who share their lives or close quarters may not get the same protection. Healthy people who live in the same household or health care and child care providers who have no chronic conditions would not qualify to receive updated doses under these recommendations. These restrictions may result in continued declines in COVID vaccine uptake. Historically, the U.S. has \u201cnot been great at a targeted and tailored approach\u201d to vaccine access, said Abram Wagner, an assistant professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan. \u201cThe more you put restrictions into place, it just filters down that it\u2019s more and more difficult to get the vaccine.\u201d Why did the FDA say COVID vaccine changes were necessary? FDA officials pointed to similar recommendations in other nations, including Canada, Denmark and Australia, as validation for this policy change. \u201cIt would almost seem as if the current U.S. strategy, which is urging every single baby and teenager and child and healthy American and high-risk American, encouraging every single one to get a booster every year, that is the outlier, contrary approach,\u201d said Makary during a livestreamed question-and-answer session. Prasad agreed, adding, \u201cNow, we are back in line with the rest of the world.\u201d Overall, Bill Hanage, professor of epidemiology at T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University, said it is \u201cquite reasonable\u201d to say that not everyone will benefit equally from receiving the COVID vaccine. However, he said the countries FDA officials pointed to \u201ctypically have health systems that in this country would be considered socialized.\u201d Where does the Trump administration stand on vaccines? Kennedy was the founder and chairman of an anti-vaccine advocacy organization for years. Though Kennedy affirmed support for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in a Senate hearing on Tuesday, when asked last week whether he supported vaccinating his own child, Kennedy said he does not think people should take medical advice from him. At his confirmation hearings, senators on both sides of the aisle expressed concern about Kennedy\u2019s stance and the importance of live-saving vaccines. Public trust in vaccines and vaccination uptake have declined in the U.S. in recent years.

Follow @LauraSanthanam @LauraSanthanam\nThe FDA and CDC will no longer recommend annual COVID vaccinations for healthy people younger than age 65, overturning past official U.S. health policy. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased to announce that as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,\u201d said Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in a video statement released via X on May 27. The FDA announced in May that adults over age 65 and anyone over 6 months with one or more chronic or underlying health conditions, such as asthma, cancer, diabetes or pregnancy, were still recommended to get an updated shot. The CDC later clarified separately that children and pregnant people may still choose to get COVID shots, even though the U.S. health agencies no longer explicitly say they should. The shift was a marked departure from previous guidance, which recommended an annual COVID vaccine for everyone 6 months and older. The FDA\u2019s new blueprint estimated 100 to 200 million people would be eligible under the new guidelines. WATCH: FDA commissioner defends changes to COVID vaccine recommendations To gain approval for COVID vaccines for other groups in the future, pharmaceutical companies would need to conduct new randomized clinical trials for younger healthy populations, according to Makary and Dr. Vinayak Prasad, who directs the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \u201cThe FDA will approve vaccines for high-risk persons and, at the same time, demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk,\u201d Makary and Prasad wrote May 20 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Requiring trials \u201cwill provide information that is desperately craved by health care providers and the American people,\u201d Makary and Prasad wrote. But other experts are worried about hindering the nation\u2019s ability to develop timely vaccines against future pathogens while withholding vaccine doses from healthy people who want further protection now. The new guidance from both the FDA and CDC preempts a scheduled meeting of a CDC advisory panel in June, where experts would typically meet to discuss the vaccine recommendations. Here\u2019s what the recent changes could mean for you. Under the new recommendations, who should get a COVID vaccine? Healthy adults under the age of 65 and children aged 6 months or older are not recommended to receive the updated COVID vaccines going forward, according to the FDA. FDA officials under the current Trump administration said Tuesday the virus has infected many Americans \u201cmultiple times\u201d and claimed that there has been \u201ca reduction in the evidence standard for dose after dose,\u201d Prasad said. There are some exceptions for people with underlying conditions, including: Asthma Cancer Diabetes Pregnancy Depression Chronic lung diseases HIV In his announcement, Kennedy said future COVID vaccines would not be recommended for \u201chealthy, pregnant women.\u201d What did the CDC say about vaccines for kids and pregnant people? The CDC now recommends that parents ask their pediatrician if the COVID vaccine is appropriate for their individual children. This would apply to children who are ages 6 months to 17 years old and who do not have known health complications. \u201cShared clinical decision-making vaccinations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s website. After conflicting messages from the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Susan Kressley, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a written statement that she was \u201crelieved\u201d with the CDC\u2019s updated recommendation. \u201cAmerican families deserve better. They deserve clear messages from all involved in their health, that are based on facts so they can continue to benefit from the success story of vaccines,\u201d Kressley said in the statement. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that it was \u201cconcerned\u201d and \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the Trump administration\u2019s exclusion of pregnant people from receiving updated COVID vaccines. Pregnancy has been shown to raise the risks of developing severe COVID. \u201cFollowing this announcement, we are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit,\u201d ACOG President Dr. Steven J. Fleischman said in a written statement. \u201cWe are concerned about access implications, and what this recommendation will mean for insurance coverage of the COVID vaccine for those who do choose to get vaccinated during pregnancy. And as ob-gyns, we are very concerned about the potential deterioration of vaccine confidence in the future.\u201d What do these COVID shot changes mean for families and care workers? While vaccine coverage would remain the same for people over age 65 or anyone six months or older with underlying risk factors, the people who share their lives or close quarters may not get the same protection. Healthy people who live in the same household or health care and child care providers who have no chronic conditions would not qualify to receive updated doses under these recommendations. These restrictions may result in continued declines in COVID vaccine uptake. Historically, the U.S. has \u201cnot been great at a targeted and tailored approach\u201d to vaccine access, said Abram Wagner, an assistant professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan. \u201cThe more you put restrictions into place, it just filters down that it\u2019s more and more difficult to get the vaccine.\u201d Why did the FDA say COVID vaccine changes were necessary? FDA officials pointed to similar recommendations in other nations, including Canada, Denmark and Australia, as validation for this policy change. \u201cIt would almost seem as if the current U.S. strategy, which is urging every single baby and teenager and child and healthy American and high-risk American, encouraging every single one to get a booster every year, that is the outlier, contrary approach,\u201d said Makary during a livestreamed question-and-answer session. Prasad agreed, adding, \u201cNow, we are back in line with the rest of the world.\u201d Overall, Bill Hanage, professor of epidemiology at T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University, said it is \u201cquite reasonable\u201d to say that not everyone will benefit equally from receiving the COVID vaccine. However, he said the countries FDA officials pointed to \u201ctypically have health systems that in this country would be considered socialized.\u201d Where does the Trump administration stand on vaccines? Kennedy was the founder and chairman of an anti-vaccine advocacy organization for years. Though Kennedy affirmed support for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in a Senate hearing on Tuesday, when asked last week whether he supported vaccinating his own child, Kennedy said he does not think people should take medical advice from him. At his confirmation hearings, senators on both sides of the aisle expressed concern about Kennedy\u2019s stance and the importance of live-saving vaccines. Public trust in vaccines and vaccination uptake have declined in the U.S. in recent years. Prasad called this trend in attitudes \u201ca backlash\u201d that has led to \u201creduced rates of important, vital vaccine programs.\u201d That includes the MMR vaccine, \u201cwhich has been clearly established as safe and highly effective,\u201d Makary and Prasad wrote in NEJM.

Experts are wondering why Health May 19, 2025 5:00 PM EDT Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped. Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration\u2019s deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections? \u201cWe just don\u2019t know why there haven\u2019t been cases,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \u201cI think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren\u2019t being detected.\u201d The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S. In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses. The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in Nevada, Ohio and Wyoming. California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation\u2019s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14. The possible natural reason bird flu cases are down Video by PBS News Hour During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus. That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases. It\u2019s unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases. What\u2019s more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently. New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago. \u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement. Are government cuts affecting bird flu monitoring? Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. But Osterholm and some other experts think it\u2019s likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding. Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said. And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA\u2019s Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said \u201ctargeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.\u201d She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward. \u201cI can\u2019t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,\u201d she said. CDC says the risk to the general public remains low The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds. Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past. Still, research is continuing. Texas A&M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July. Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms. \u201cWe have had very good participation,\u201d Douphrate said. \u201cThey have been very willing.\u201d Similar surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024. Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S. Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu \u2014 or whether the virus can spill over into people. Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus.

Experts are alarmed over the large-scale staff reductions, travel and training restrictions and grant cut-offs since President Donald Trump took office at both the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which prepares for and responds to hurricanes, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which tracks and forecasts them. \u201cMy nightmare is a major catastrophic storm hitting an area that is reeling from the impact of all of this nonsense from the Trump administration and people will die. And that could happen in Florida, that could happen in Texas, that could happen in South Carolina,\u201d said Susan Cutter, the director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. Representatives of both NOAA and FEMA say the agencies are prepared. Experts: DOGE cuts diminish FEMA About 2,000 full-time staff have left FEMA since Trump took office in January, a loss of roughly one-third of the agency\u2019s full-time workforce, amid Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) mandated cuts. Scholars who study emergency management are concerned by both the reduction in capacity and the \u201cbrain drain\u201d of experienced staff. \u201cThere\u2019s really been a brain drain within FEMA in addition to the loss of overall employees,\u201d said Samantha Montano, who teaches emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. She noted that many who left were in critical management positions. The agency is run by an acting chief, David Richardson, a former Marine Corps officer who served overseas and worked as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction. He does not appear to have any experience in managing disasters. Emergency management requires knowing where to get things, who to call, how things work and how to get it done quickly \u2014 which comes from experience and establishing relationships with state officials, Montano and Cutter said. What\u2019s happening reminds former Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Craig Fugate of 2005, the year Hurricane Katrina devastated Louisiana and exposed inexperienced and poorly prepared governments at all levels, especially the then-FEMA chief who came from a horse-rearing association. Fugate said he\u2019s especially worried about top experienced disaster people leaving FEMA. FEMA canceled various emergency management trainings this spring, moved others online and restricted travel to events such as the National Hurricane Conference. Some trainings have resumed. \u201cGiven the reduction in staffing, being unable to do trainings, participate in conferences, there\u2019s potential that the federal government\u2019s ability is diminished,\u201d said former Florida Emergency Management chief Bryan Koon, now president of the disaster preparedness firm IEM. FEMA has also cut disaster resilience programs. Making areas more survivable saves up to $13 for every dollar spent, said Lori Peek, director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado. The federal government promises to be ready for hurricane season, which runs through November. \u201cFEMA is shifting from bloated DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\u201d Associate FEMA Administrator Geoff Harbaugh said in a email. \u201cFEMA is fully activated in preparation for hurricane season.\u201d FEMA\u2019s relationship with states Richardson promised to push more responsibilities to the states. He warned that the agency will only do what the law requires and shift more costs to states. But Koon noted that states haven\u2019t budgeted for FEMA\u2019s changes, adding: \u201cThe biggest issue right now is just the uncertainty.\u201d Some states \u2014 which coordinate disaster operations \u2014 are experienced in catastrophes, have well trained staff and will do fine, such as Texas and Florida, Fugate said.

Give Now By \u2014 Seth Borenstein, Associated Press Seth Borenstein, Associated Press @borenbears By \u2014 Gabriela Aoun Angueira, Associated Press Gabriela Aoun Angueira, Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With predictions for a busy hurricane season beginning Sunday, experts in storms and disasters are worried about something potentially as chaotic as the swirling winds: Massive cuts to the federal system that forecasts, tracks and responds to hurricanes. Experts are alarmed over the large-scale staff reductions, travel and training restrictions and grant cut-offs since President Donald Trump took office at both the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which prepares for and responds to hurricanes, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which tracks and forecasts them. \u201cMy nightmare is a major catastrophic storm hitting an area that is reeling from the impact of all of this nonsense from the Trump administration and people will die. And that could happen in Florida, that could happen in Texas, that could happen in South Carolina,\u201d said Susan Cutter, the director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. Representatives of both NOAA and FEMA say the agencies are prepared. Experts: DOGE cuts diminish FEMA About 2,000 full-time staff have left FEMA since Trump took office in January, a loss of roughly one-third of the agency\u2019s full-time workforce, amid Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) mandated cuts. Scholars who study emergency management are concerned by both the reduction in capacity and the \u201cbrain drain\u201d of experienced staff. \u201cThere\u2019s really been a brain drain within FEMA in addition to the loss of overall employees,\u201d said Samantha Montano, who teaches emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. She noted that many who left were in critical management positions. The agency is run by an acting chief, David Richardson, a former Marine Corps officer who served overseas and worked as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction. He does not appear to have any experience in managing disasters. Emergency management requires knowing where to get things, who to call, how things work and how to get it done quickly \u2014 which comes from experience and establishing relationships with state officials, Montano and Cutter said. What\u2019s happening reminds former Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Craig Fugate of 2005, the year Hurricane Katrina devastated Louisiana and exposed inexperienced and poorly prepared governments at all levels, especially the then-FEMA chief who came from a horse-rearing association. Fugate said he\u2019s especially worried about top experienced disaster people leaving FEMA. FEMA canceled various emergency management trainings this spring, moved others online and restricted travel to events such as the National Hurricane Conference. Some trainings have resumed. \u201cGiven the reduction in staffing, being unable to do trainings, participate in conferences, there\u2019s potential that the federal government\u2019s ability is diminished,\u201d said former Florida Emergency Management chief Bryan Koon, now president of the disaster preparedness firm IEM. FEMA has also cut disaster resilience programs. Making areas more survivable saves up to $13 for every dollar spent, said Lori Peek, director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado. The federal government promises to be ready for hurricane season, which runs through November. \u201cFEMA is shifting from bloated DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\u201d Associate FEMA Administrator Geoff Harbaugh said in a email. \u201cFEMA is fully activated in preparation for hurricane season.\u201d FEMA\u2019s relationship with states Richardson promised to push more responsibilities to the states. He warned that the agency will only do what the law requires and shift more costs to states. But Koon noted that states haven\u2019t budgeted for FEMA\u2019s changes, adding: \u201cThe biggest issue right now is just the uncertainty.\u201d Some states \u2014 which coordinate disaster operations \u2014 are experienced in catastrophes, have well trained staff and will do fine, such as Texas and Florida, Fugate said. But it\u2019s the poorer states that worry the experts. The feds often pick up the entire bill in big disasters and most of it in smaller ones. In the Trump administration, disaster declarations have been denied or delayed. When disaster declarations were issued for nine states last week, some had been pending for two months and others were only partially approved. \u201cWe\u2019ve just relied on FEMA for so much for so long and not knowing who\u2019s going to fill the gap and how we\u2019re going to fill it is really scary,\u201d said University at Albany emergency management professor Jeannette Sutton.

There\u2019s an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it\u2019s even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office. \u201cHigher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\u201d said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn\u2019t part of the calculations but said they made sense. \u201cSo higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\u201d READ MORE: This Louisiana community preps for hurricane season as questions linger about federal storm response With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \u201cwe will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\u201d emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research. And for the first time there\u2019s a chance \u2014 albeit slight \u2014 that before the end of the decade, the world\u2019s annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said. There\u2019s an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured. WATCH: What the dismissal of hundreds of scientists means for a flagship climate report The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists. Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance \u2014 about 1% \u2014 that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \u201cshocking.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not something anyone wants to see, but that\u2019s what the science is telling us,\u201d Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement. Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement\u2019s threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated. WATCH: How a warming Arctic may be eroding Indigenous history in Alaska \u201cWith the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\u201d said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter. Ice in the Arctic \u2014 which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world \u2014 will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said. What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn\u2019t go back down much, if at all. \u201cRecord temperatures immediately become the new normal,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency\u2019s report looked at the availability of minerals and metals that may be small in quantity \u2014 but large in impact when it comes to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy. READ MORE: Mining is necessary for the green transition. Here\u2019s why experts say we need to do it better It found that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the average market share of the three top producing countries rose to 86 percent in 2024 from 82 percent in 2020. China is the leading refiner for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals studied in the report, and has an average share of around 75 percent. Indonesia showed strong growth in nickel, a key component in making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency\u2019s report looked at the availability of minerals and metals that may be small in quantity \u2014 but large in impact when it comes to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy. READ MORE: Mining is necessary for the green transition. Here\u2019s why experts say we need to do it better It found that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the average market share of the three top producing countries rose to 86 percent in 2024 from 82 percent in 2020. China is the leading refiner for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals studied in the report, and has an average share of around 75 percent. Indonesia showed strong growth in nickel, a key component in making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.

John Yang speaks with Elizabeth Koebele, an associate professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was among the recipients of that message. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. John Yang: Late last month, hundreds of volunteers, scientists and experts across the country were told by the Trump administration that they were no longer needed to compile the next national climate assessment. That's a report mandated by Congress to periodically catalog the ways climate change is affecting the nation. It's considered the government's flagship document on the topic.The sixth edition is to be released by 2028, but the message said that its scope is currently being reevaluated. Elizabeth Koebele was among the recipients of that message. She's an associate professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and was leading the team studying the Southwest.Elizabeth, what's the purpose of this document and how is it used?Elizabeth Koebele, Former Chapter Leader, 6th National Climate Assessment: It's a congressionally mandated report, and it's produced every four years under the direction of the U.S. Global Change Research Program or the USGCRP.And what it does is it really analyzes the impacts of global change on the United States with a focus on how such changes might put things that Americans value most at risk, whether that's our national security, our community safety, our resources, those sorts of things. It's really a synthesis of the newest and most relevant research on global change.And it's divided into chapters that focus on things like systems such as water or specific regions like the Southwest, which I was leading. John Yang: And there are no policy prescription in this or recommendations in this. Elizabeth Koebele: You're right. It's meant to be a nonpartisan report that's policy relevant, but not policy prescriptive and this means it synthesizes information on global climate change that can help decision makers across federal, regional, state, local levels make the best decisions for their sectors and their communities.So there are no recommendations for specific decisions, but it does gather the state of the art information on these changes and on potential mitigation and adaptation actions so that we're providing the best information to these decision makers for their communities. John Yang: In addition to helping these decision makers. What's its contribution to overall climate research? Elizabeth Koebele: I think the National Climate Assessment points out important knowledge gaps in our research and can potentially provide directions to scientists, whether in academic positions or whether in federal agencies that can help build knowledge to make our country more resilient to global change.It can guide their work in developing programs and policies aimed at everything from natural resource management to national security, and overall enhance our understanding of how climate change puts things that we value most at risk. John Yang: President Trump has said that he thinks the stated effects of climate change are overstated. The administration dismantling a lot of climate change research. Given that, what do you think it means when the administration says that it's reevaluating the scope of this document? Elizabeth Koebele: Unfortunately, the authors that were released from the assessment haven't gotten any further information at this time about that reassessment of the scope. The report is congressionally mandated, so it could potentially be the case that the Trump administration will select a new set of authors which for us starting this assessment process and took almost a year to select and onboard all of the authors and get them trained and started working on the assessment.So that would need to happen pretty quickly in order to meet the assessment deadline. But right now we're really waiting to see what the administration says and what guidance that can provide on how to get a report out on the mandated timeline. John Yang: Overall, how does the administration's approach to climate change, how do you think that's going to affect climate change research? Elizabeth Koebele: I think that we're already seeing the effects of climate change on so many sectors in so many communities in the U.S. and it's really important for us to have the state of the art research on how climate's affecting these different communities, how climate's affecting things we value in order to protect Americans across the United States, to protect our security, to protect our economy.So I do hope that we are able to move some sort of report forward in order to provide information to decision makers who can help achieve these things. John Yang: Could this be done without the support of the administration, without the support of the government? Elizabeth Koebele: One thing that I think is really important about the national climate assessment is that the report goes through a really rigorous process of review at several stages. And these reviews are done by the public, by federal agencies. And all of the chapters in the NCAA are really required to uphold very high standards of transparency by predicting providing what we call traceable accounts of our sort of assessment process in addition to our findings.And it takes a lot of infrastructure, coordination, resources to support that kind of thorough policy, relevant, up to date, transparent assessment. So while I do think it's possible that we may still be able to get some of this information out through other assessments, I do think that this is a really critical government function to support this report because the findings are so relevant and important to Americans across the country. John Yang: Elizabeth Koebele of the University of Nevada, Reno, thank you very much. Elizabeth Koebele: Thanks very much for having me.

Scientists say it could someday treat millions Science May 16, 2025 6:21 PM EDT A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him. Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he\u2019s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare. WATCH: A Brief But Spectacular take on the future of CRISPR \u201cThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some. Knowing KJ\u2019s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him. \u201cWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Nicole said. \u201cWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,\u201d her husband added. Within six months, the team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ\u2019s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA \u201cletter\u201d \u2014 also known as a base \u2014 to the correct type. Known as \u201cbase editing,\u201d it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes. It\u2019s \u201cvery exciting\u201d that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.\u201d In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells. While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, \u201che slept through the entire thing,\u201d recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP. After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 \u00bd-month old also takes less medication. Considering his poor prognosis earlier, \u201cany time we see even the smallest milestone that he\u2019s meeting \u2013 like a little wave or rolling over \u2013 that\u2019s a big moment for us,\u201d his mother said. Still, researchers caution that it\u2019s only been a few months. They\u2019ll need to watch him for years. \u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,\u201d Ahrens-Nicklas said. \u201cBut every day, he\u2019s showing us signs that he\u2019s growing and thriving.\u201d Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients. Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide. Musunuru said his team\u2019s work \u2014 funded in part by the National Institutes of Health \u2014 showed that creating a custom treatment doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was \u201cnot far off\u201d from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said. \u201cAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,\u201d Musunuru said. Scientists also won\u2019t have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research \u201csets the stage\u201d for treating other rare conditions. Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn\u2019t involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances. \u201cOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time\u201d for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. \u201cThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years.

The most poised and mature of the final three, Sarvadnya \u2014 who\u2019s from Visalia, California \u2014 ends his career as the runner-up. He\u2019s 14 and in the eighth grade, which means he has aged out of the competition. It\u2019s not a bad way to go out, considering that Faizan became just the fifth runner-up in a century to come back and win, and the first since Sean Conley in 2001.

Give Now By \u2014 Associated Press Associated Press\nOXON HILL, Md. (AP) \u2014 Faizan Zaki\u2019s enthusiasm for spelling nearly got the better of him. Ultimately, his joyful approach made him the Scripps National Spelling Bee champion. The favorite entering the bee after his runner-up finish last year \u2014 during which he never misspelled a word in a conventional spelling round, only to lose a lightning-round tiebreaker that he didn\u2019t practice for \u2014 the shaggy-haired Faizan wore the burden of expectations lightly, sauntering to the microphone in a black hoodie and spelling his words with casual glee.

U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs extended the block she imposed last week with a temporary restraining order, which allows the Ivy League school to continue enrolling international students as a lawsuit proceeds. Harvard sued the federal government on Friday after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked its ability to host foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cHarvard will continue to take steps to protect the rights of our international students and scholars, members of our community who are vital to the University\u2019s academic mission and community \u2014 and whose presence here benefits our country immeasurably,\u201d a university spokesman said in a statement. READ MORE: Trump asks agencies to cut $100 million from Harvard\u2019s federal contracts On Wednesday, the Trump administration introduced a new effort to revoke Harvard\u2019s certification to enroll foreign students. In a letter sent by the acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, Todd Lyons, the government gave Harvard 30 days to respond to the alleged grounds for withdrawal, which include accusations that Harvard coordinated with foreign entities and failed to respond sufficiently to antisemitism on campus. The developments unfolded in a courtroom not far from the Harvard campus, where speakers at Thursday\u2019s commencement ceremony stressed the importance of maintaining a diverse and international student body. The dispute over international enrollment at Harvard is the latest escalation in a battle between the White House and the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest college. In April, Noem sent a letter to the school, demanding a range of records related to foreign students, including discipline records and anything related to \u201cdangerous or violent activity.\u201d Noem said it was in response to accusations of antisemitism on Harvard\u2019s campus. WATCH: Kevin O\u2019Leary on Trump\u2019s trade war and battle with Harvard Harvard says it complied. But on May 22, Noem sent a letter saying the school\u2019s response fell short. She said Harvard was being pulled from the federal program that allows colleges to sponsor international students to get U.S. visas. It took effect immediately and prevented Harvard from hosting foreign students in the upcoming school year. In its lawsuit, Harvard argued the government failed to follow administrative procedures and regulations for removing schools from eligibility to host international students, which include giving schools the opportunity to appeal and a 30-day window to respond.

Noem\u2019s earlier letter to Harvard notified the school that its eligibility was revoked immediately. It did not cite any regulations or statutes that Harvard allegedly violated. The Wednesday letter accuses Harvard of violating regulations around reporting requirements and violating an executive order regarding combatting antisemitism. Already, despite the restraining order, the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of \u201cprofound fear, concern, and confusion,\u201d the university\u2019s director of immigration services said in a court filing on Wednesday. WATCH: China criticizes Trump administration\u2019s move to ban Harvard\u2019s foreign students In a court filing, immigration services director Maureen Martin said that countless international students had asked about transferring. Martin said that international Harvard students arriving in Boston were sent to additional screening by Customs and Border Protection agents, and that international students seeking to obtain their visas were being denied or facing delays at consulates and embassies.

Now, that program is at risk. As a teen, Sparks knew he wanted to go to college and become a teacher. But growing up in rural Kentucky in a low-income household without role models who had attended college, he didn\u2019t know where to start. He found the help he needed in the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) initiative. Through the program, Sparks connected with mentors who helped him learn about financial aid, how to fill out a FAFSA form and how to look through a college course catalog. States, colleges, school districts and community organizations apply for federal money to support this work with students like him each year. Sparks graduated from high school \u2014 something his grandfather, who helped raise him, never did \u2014 attended college and went on to earn multiple graduate degrees, including his doctoral degree. \u201cThere\u2019s almost an unofficial playbook about how to make it through college financially, academically \u2014 all these things,\u201d said Sparks, who now teaches statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles and helps young Kentuckians find their path toward higher education. \u201cAnd without those resources, I had no idea about how to make that happen.\u201d Nationwide, more than 568,000 low-income students were enrolled in the GEAR UP program in the 2022-23 school year, according to the National Council for Community and Education Partnerships. But under the Trump administration\u2019s 2026 proposed budget for the Department of Education, this program would be eliminated. \u201c\u201cThe GEAR Up Program has accomplished what it set out to do \u2013 help students prepare and enroll in college,\u201d said Ellen Keast, a Department of Education spokesperson, in a written statement to PBS News. \u201cThrough access to federal student aid, states and institutions of higher education have the ability to continue these programs.\u201d The Department of Education distributes grants and loans like GEAR UP to the nation\u2019s schools and students for a wide variety of support programs, for elementary to college students and beyond. But the department has become a target for the Trump administration\u2019s goal of slimming the federal government. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. Nearly 2,000 employees were laid off that month, including those responsible for fielding complaints about federal student loans, training state and district officials on how to secure and comply with competitive federal grants, and monitoring data for trends in graduation rates and student need nationwide. On Thursday, a federal judge blocked Trump\u2019s order with a preliminary injunction following a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts by multiple school districts and education groups, U.S. District Judge Myong Joun ordered the federal agency to reinstate its fired workers. A department spokesperson told PBS News that the administration plans to immediately challenge the judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cPresident Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind. This ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families,\u201d Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Department of Education, said in a written statement. Some workers who have been fired outright or have been placed on administrative leave say the cuts make it harder to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent on education in the ways Congress intended and will make it harder for local communities and states to support students or plan for the future. Education research scientist Joseph Murphy was on a team of six people that tracked data tied to federal grants designed to help the nation\u2019s students and communities with the highest needs. They collected and analyzed data from all U.S. states and territories and assisted with quality control, making sure services, such as how many elementary students needed an aide to help them read, were counted the same way across the country. Murphy sees the elimination of his team as \u201ca complete purge of anything data-related.\u201d \u201cThis is an open war on data \u2013 on anybody who has truth and facts and figures to back up what they\u2019re saying, to prove the folks that were saying that the education system is a mess, to prove them wrong,\u201d he said. People do not really understand what the federal government does and what cuts to the Education Department or its services mean, Murphy said. Different states and school districts rely on federal dollars by varying degrees. For decades, the government has relied on data to determine where needs are greatest and if those dollars generated results. Murphy is unsure whether that data can be collected for the upcoming academic year or if anyone will be in place to understand and evaluate it. Without reliable data to track federal funding and their associated outcomes, Murphy does not know how those decisions will be made \u2014 if at all. Taken together, Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ford School of Public Policy, said these changes will erode the ability to determine how the nation overall is performing in the classroom, what should be done differently and how to reach those goals. \u201cPresident Trump and his supporters do not think we should have a national vision for education, that there shouldn\u2019t be a body that\u2019s empowered to do things like collect data on performance of students,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Increasingly, we end up flying blind.\u201d What the Education Department does The Department of Education became a Cabinet-level department in 1979. For decades, Congress has passed laws to govern how those dollars would be distributed to communities. Moynihan said while the department does not provide teachers, it sets standards and collects data to track if those standards are being met across the country, monitoring for disparities. \u201cWhile regulations can be cumbersome, they\u2019re there to make sure people\u2019s tax dollars are used according to the will of Congress and that everyone is a good steward,\u201d said David Downey, a former management analyst at the department who trained more than 100,000 people on how to apply for and manage federal grants, including the GEAR UP program. Since the Reagan administration, presidents have threatened to get rid of the Department of Education, but hadn\u2019t because \u201cwe collectively assumed this was a congressional responsibility,\u201d Moynihan said. Today, the Trump administration argues that states can do a better job than the department of serving the needs of students and families. But in South Bend, Indiana, school administrator Chad Addie says a federal grant has changed the face of education in his city over the last four years. The GEAR UP initiative allowed educators and business leaders to introduce more than 2,300 students to emerging job and college opportunities in Addie\u2019s district alone. Looking at the students this program helps daily, Addie said the work is far from over. \u201cThere are students right now who are counting on us because this is their moment in high school, this is their moment in middle school, and it\u2019s important that we\u2019re responsive in this moment for those students,\u201d Addie said. What comes next? Murphy\u2019s administrative leave is scheduled to end in June, and he does not know what he is going to do next. He is very concerned about the students, educators and school districts across the country that will need to scramble to fill budget holes to avoid laying off teachers or losing services without those federal dollars. When Murphy was put on administrative leave, he was unable to access his work email and had to turn over his badge and office computer. Many department employees lost their email access so quickly, they were unable to notify colleagues in state offices and school districts who they had been working with. Months later, no one has contacted him about transitioning his work to a different person or office. Following the federal judge\u2019s injunction against the Trump administration to stop its efforts to eliminate the Department of Education, federal human resources officials said in court documents that they had contacted all employees through personal e-mail about notice and copies of the May 22 court order. Murphy said no department officials had contacted him with updates about his employment status. \u201cBut did anyone expect them to?\u201d Murphy asked. For Downey, the court\u2019s decision \u201cis a win for ED staff, but it might take a while for folks to see and feel it.\u201d That includes him. Filing for early retirement and the department\u2019s fate uncertain, Downey said his paperwork must be received by June 9. \u201cThe clock is ticking against many of us even with the good news.\u201d In California, Superintendent Mike Matsuda leads Anaheim Union High School District, where roughly 4 in 5 students qualify for free or reduced meals, he said. He says his biggest challenge right now \u201cis the ambiguity and the uncertainty around budgeting.\u201d The district, home to 25,000 students, risks losing a tenth of its $425 million annual budget if federal funding for services such as professional development and English-language instruction goes away. Matsuda said this crunch comes at a strategically terrible time, when high school students are entering a job market disrupted by rapidly evolving technology, including artificial intelligence. Anticipating what these changes could mean for students whose families do not have money to fill in the gaps left by possible funding cuts, Sparks said if federal programs like GEAR UP are zeroed, \u201cthe opportunities go away.\u201d \u201cWhen those programs are gone, that route is not even gravel road. They have to pave their own route. When you hit a bump in the road, you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the end or if you should keep going,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cChildren coming from homes that are impoverished should not be penalized more for not having that social safety net.\u201d Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

Follow @LauraSanthanam @LauraSanthanam\nOne federal grant program changed the trajectory of Joshua Sparks\u2019 life. Now, that program is at risk. As a teen, Sparks knew he wanted to go to college and become a teacher. But growing up in rural Kentucky in a low-income household without role models who had attended college, he didn\u2019t know where to start. He found the help he needed in the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) initiative. Through the program, Sparks connected with mentors who helped him learn about financial aid, how to fill out a FAFSA form and how to look through a college course catalog. States, colleges, school districts and community organizations apply for federal money to support this work with students like him each year. Sparks graduated from high school \u2014 something his grandfather, who helped raise him, never did \u2014 attended college and went on to earn multiple graduate degrees, including his doctoral degree. \u201cThere\u2019s almost an unofficial playbook about how to make it through college financially, academically \u2014 all these things,\u201d said Sparks, who now teaches statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles and helps young Kentuckians find their path toward higher education. \u201cAnd without those resources, I had no idea about how to make that happen.\u201d Nationwide, more than 568,000 low-income students were enrolled in the GEAR UP program in the 2022-23 school year, according to the National Council for Community and Education Partnerships. But under the Trump administration\u2019s 2026 proposed budget for the Department of Education, this program would be eliminated. \u201c\u201cThe GEAR Up Program has accomplished what it set out to do \u2013 help students prepare and enroll in college,\u201d said Ellen Keast, a Department of Education spokesperson, in a written statement to PBS News. \u201cThrough access to federal student aid, states and institutions of higher education have the ability to continue these programs.\u201d The Department of Education distributes grants and loans like GEAR UP to the nation\u2019s schools and students for a wide variety of support programs, for elementary to college students and beyond. But the department has become a target for the Trump administration\u2019s goal of slimming the federal government. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. Nearly 2,000 employees were laid off that month, including those responsible for fielding complaints about federal student loans, training state and district officials on how to secure and comply with competitive federal grants, and monitoring data for trends in graduation rates and student need nationwide. On Thursday, a federal judge blocked Trump\u2019s order with a preliminary injunction following a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts by multiple school districts and education groups, U.S. District Judge Myong Joun ordered the federal agency to reinstate its fired workers. A department spokesperson told PBS News that the administration plans to immediately challenge the judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cPresident Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind. This ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families,\u201d Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Department of Education, said in a written statement.

In a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston, Harvard said the government\u2019s action violates the First Amendment and will have an \u201cimmediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\u201d \u201cWith the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard\u2019s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\u201d Harvard said in its suit. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.\u201d The school said it plans to file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the move. The move has thrown campus into disarray days before graduation, Harvard said in the suit. International students who run labs, teach courses, assist professors and participate in Harvard sports are now left deciding whether to transfer or risk losing legal status to stay in the country, according to the filing. The impact is heaviest at graduate schools such as the Harvard Kennedy School, where almost half the student body comes from abroad, and Harvard Business School, which is about one-third international. Along with its impact on current students, the move blocks thousands of students who were planning to come for summer and fall classes. Harvard said it immediately puts the school at a disadvantage as it competes for the world\u2019s top students. Even if it regains the ability to host students, \u201cfuture applicants may shy away from applying out of fear of further reprisals from the government,\u201d the suit said. If the government\u2019s action stands, Harvard said, the university would be unable to offer admission to new international students for at least the next two academic years. Schools that have that certification withdrawn by the federal government are ineligible to reapply until one year afterward, Harvard said. Harvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Most are graduate students and they come from more than 100 countries. The department announced the action Thursday, accusing Harvard of creating an unsafe campus environment by allowing \u201canti-American, pro-terrorist agitators\u201d to assault Jewish students on campus. It also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, contending the school had hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024. Harvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism, He said Harvard would not budge on its \u201cits core, legally-protected principles\u201d over fears of retaliation. Harvard has said it will respond at a later time to allegations first raised by House Republicans about coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. The threat to Harvard\u2019s international enrollment stems from an April 16 request from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who demanded that Harvard provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation. Noem said Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it produces a trove of records on foreign students within 72 hours. Her updated request demands all records, including audio or video footage, of foreign students participating in protests or dangerous activity on campus.

WATCH: Trump signs order for plan to shut down Education Department U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from carrying out two plans announced in March that sought to work toward Trump\u2019s goal to dismantle the department.

The injunction was requested in a lawsuit filed by the Somerville and Easthampton school districts in Massachusetts and the American Federation of Teachers, along with other education groups. In their lawsuit, the groups said the layoffs amounted to an illegal shutdown of the Education Department. They said it left the department unable to carry out responsibilities required by Congress, including duties to support special education, distribute financial aid and enforce civil rights laws.

The administration said restructuring the agency \u201cmay impact certain services until the reorganization is finished\u201d but it\u2019s committed to fulfilling its statutory requirements.

Just two years later, more than half of all states have laws in place, with more likely to act soon. Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids. READ MORE: Why Oklahoma is pushing for all-day cellphone restrictions in class Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly\u2019s Education Committee, on May 13 called phones \u201ca cancer on our kids\u201d that are \u201cdriving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\u201d Republicans express similar sentiments. \u201cThis is a not just an academic bill,\u201d Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia\u2019s bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \u201cThis is a mental health bill. It\u2019s a public safety bill.\u201d So far, 26 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 17 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen signed a law banning phones throughout the school day. Earlier Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons. More action is coming as bills await a governor\u2019s signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire. Increasing focus on banning phones throughout the school day When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there\u2019s another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools. Ten states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans. WATCH: How a middle school is successfully keeping students off their phones during class North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \u201ca huge win.\u201d \u201cTeachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\u201d Armstrong said. Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch. The \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group\u2019s political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans. Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd\u2019s senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls. \u201cThat\u2019s often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\u201d Hoffman said. Other states want school districts to set their own rules But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy. And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules. Where policymakers have moved ahead, there\u2019s a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn\u2019t a student\u2019s first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork. There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina\u2019s original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia\u2019s new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication. Some parents and students oppose the rules But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting. \u201cIt was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\u201d said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia\u2019s law at a news conference in March. Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency. In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it\u2019s also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana\u2019s law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use. \u201cIt is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\u201d Villescas wrote in an online petition. Most states provide no funding to carry out laws A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill. \u201cProviding some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201dThat said, most states have not.\u201d Associated Press writers Becky Bohrer in Juneau, Alaska; Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut; Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota; and Kate Payne in Tallahassee, Florida; contributed to this report.

Watch in our video player above. McMahon insisted that she runs the Education Department, not Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, when questioned by Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., during her testimony before the House Appropriations Committee. Pointing out that 1,300 employees were fired and another 600 took a buyout, McMahon said \u201ca good majority\u201d of those removals \u201chappened before I came on board.\u201d Pocan later pressed McMahon about why 74 people were later asked to return to their jobs after having been dismissed. McMahon defended the practice, saying she had participated in a similar restructuring in the private sector. \u201cYou hope that you\u2019re just cutting fat,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cSometimes, you cut in the muscle.\u201d But, Pocan argued, that the practice could have been prevented by working to \u201cplan ahead\u201d and not firing people that would eventually be asked to re-join the team. WATCH: What\u2019s next for the Department of Education after Trump begins effort to eliminate it McMahon was also asked to provide information about how the Trump administration was facilitating student loan collections, including for borrowers struggling to stay on track. Blaming the previous administration for \u201cdisastrous messaging about loan forgiveness,\u201d Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., expressed concern as he questioned McMahon that \u201cindividuals across the country are at risk of damaging their own credit ratings and going into default.\u201d \u201cThis kind of financial damage can be devastating to countless constituents across the country,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, the Trump administration began sending loans in default to collections, which could result in the withholding of tax refunds or other federal payments for those impacted.

Give Now By \u2014 News Desk News Desk\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon testified Wednesday on the White House\u2019s budget request for the agency that President Donald Trump has ordered to be dismantled. Watch in our video player above. McMahon insisted that she runs the Education Department, not Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, when questioned by Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., during her testimony before the House Appropriations Committee. Pointing out that 1,300 employees were fired and another 600 took a buyout, McMahon said \u201ca good majority\u201d of those removals \u201chappened before I came on board.\u201d Pocan later pressed McMahon about why 74 people were later asked to return to their jobs after having been dismissed. McMahon defended the practice, saying she had participated in a similar restructuring in the private sector. \u201cYou hope that you\u2019re just cutting fat,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cSometimes, you cut in the muscle.\u201d But, Pocan argued, that the practice could have been prevented by working to \u201cplan ahead\u201d and not firing people that would eventually be asked to re-join the team. WATCH: What\u2019s next for the Department of Education after Trump begins effort to eliminate it McMahon was also asked to provide information about how the Trump administration was facilitating student loan collections, including for borrowers struggling to stay on track. Blaming the previous administration for \u201cdisastrous messaging about loan forgiveness,\u201d Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., expressed concern as he questioned McMahon that \u201cindividuals across the country are at risk of damaging their own credit ratings and going into default.\u201d \u201cThis kind of financial damage can be devastating to countless constituents across the country,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, the Trump administration began sending loans in default to collections, which could result in the withholding of tax refunds or other federal payments for those impacted. If loans remain in default by later this summer, the Education Department could begin the process of garnishing paychecks. More than 5 million borrowers across the country are in default. McMahon said she sent letters to borrowers on May 5. Since then, working with the Treasury Department on collections, \u201cwe have now collected almost $100 million in back loans.

Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. John Yang: The Trump administration's feud with major American universities escalated this week. The federal antisemitism task force notified Harvard that $450 million of the school's research grants are being cut, and that's on top of the $2.2 billion that had previously frozen.Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez spoke with one of the affected researchers, Joan Brugge, the director of Harvard's Ludwig Cancer Center. Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: Dr. Brugge, you've been working for years on breast cancer research. Tell me, what type of research exactly are you doing and the type of progress that you've made? Dr. Joan Brugge, Director, Harvard Ludwig Cancer Center: In my lab, the ultimate goal of our research efforts is to find better ways to detect and destroy cancer in its tracks. And the breast cancer research project that is funded by a National Cancer Institute grant that is currently frozen specifically aims to identify and profile the earliest precursors or harbingers of breast cancer before these precursors become cancer.The goal then is to develop methods to detect these early precursors and then design treatments that prevent them from becoming cancer. Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: So that means, say if someone had one of those, what's known as a BRCA gene, that you could help stop that in its tracks? Joan Brugge: Yes, this would allow us to monitor the development of or the expansion of these early precursors. And even before we had treatments for them, we could be able to tell when they're starting to expand. And that would be a real cue, that would be the cue for those women to have the prophylactic breast cancer mastectomies. Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: How important ultimately are federal grants in the work that you do? Joan Brugge: I would say federal grants are the most important contributors to our research effort. There just isn't enough money from foundations or partnerships with companies that, to cover the amount of research that is \u2014 that there's opportunities to pursue with termination of, say, for instance, the grant to our lab. We would have to \u2014 we'd have to \u2014 we wouldn't have the money to fund salaries for the postdoctoral fellows or trainees and research scientists that are doing the work.We lose the money necessary to buy supplies for these studies and to pay for the technologies. And this would severely impede progress towards our goal. Especially when we're so close, we've actually identified these cells that we think are the earliest precursors of cancer. We wouldn't be able to develop the methods so that this work would have impact in the community.I never imagined that there would be across the board cut in research that could have such important implications for the general well-being of the United States. Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: If research like yours is ultimately cut off, what effect would it have on everyday Americans and the work that you and others do at Harvard? Joan Brugge: There would be a really significant delay advancing all of the research findings that we've made to date. And so this would slow down the development of therapies, depending on how long and how broadly these cuts are applied.But there are a lot of other consequences. Like the reduction in research funding would reduce the pipeline of disease impacting discoveries from U.S. academic institutions to pharmaceutical companies that then translate the discoveries into treatments and cures for diseases.So industry relies on these discoveries. We would also lose our competitive edge and leadership in the world. Laboratories in other countries would have a significant competitive edge if the discoveries are made outside the United States.There's also obviously economic implications not only from the loss of revenue from the treatments, but also from the enormous research income that comes to companies who generate the reagents, supplies and services for academic research. And a major concern is that we're going to lose our best and brightest scientific investigators, the young trainees, to other countries. Some people aren't going to want to pursue careers in biomedicine with this uncertainty in research funding. Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: Dr. Joan Brugge, thank you for your time. Joan Brugge: You're welcome. Thank you. John Yang: Late this week, the government terminated the grant sustaining Brugge's work. Harvard searching for alternate funding.

It\u2019s actually more than 700 years old Education May 15, 2025 4:46 PM EDT BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Harvard University for decades assumed it had a cheap copy of the Magna Carta in its collection, a stained and faded document it had purchased for less than $30. But two researchers have concluded it has something much more valuable \u2014 a rare version from 1300 issued by Britain\u2019s King Edward I. The original Magna Carta established in 1215 the principle that the king is subject to law, and it has formed the basis of constitutions globally. There are four copies of the original and, until now, there were believed to be only six copies of the 1300 version. READ MORE: Trump administration cuts $450 million more in grants to Harvard \u201cMy reaction was one of amazement and, in a way, awe that I should have managed to find a previously unknown Magna Carta,\u201d said David Carpenter, a professor of medieval history at King\u2019s College London. He was searching the Harvard Law School Library website in December 2023 when he found the digitized document. \u201cFirst, I\u2019d found one of the most rare documents and most significant documents in world constitutional history,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cBut secondly, of course, it was astonishment that Harvard had been sitting on it for all these years without realizing what it was.\u201d Confirming the document\u2019s authenticity Carpenter teamed up with Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval history at Britain\u2019s University of East Anglia, to confirm the authenticity of Harvard\u2019s document. Comparing it to the other six copies from 1300, Carpenter found the dimensions matched up. He and Vincent then turned to images Harvard librarians created using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging. The technology helps scholars see details on faded documents that are not visible to the human eye. That allowed them to compare the texts word-for-word, as well as the handwriting, which include a large capital \u2018E\u2019 at the start in \u2018Edwardus\u2019 and elongated letters in the first line. After the 1215 original printed by King John, five other editions were written in the following decades \u2014 until 1300, the last time the full document was set out and authorized by the king\u2019s seal. The 1300 version of Magna Carta is \u201cdifferent from the previous versions in a whole series of small ways and the changes are found in every single one,\u201d Carpenter said. Harvard had to meet a high bar to prove authenticity, Carpenter said, and it did so \u201cwith flying colors.\u201d Its tattered and faded copy of the Magna Carta is worth millions of dollars, Carpenter estimated \u2014 though Harvard has no plans to sell it. A 1297 version of the Magna Carta sold at auction in 2007 for $21.3 million. A document with a colorful history The other mystery behind the document was the journey it took to Harvard. That task was left to Vincent, who was able to trace it all the way back to the former parliamentary borough of Appleby in Westmorland, England. The Harvard Law School library purchased its copy in 1946 from a London book dealer for $27.50. At the time, it was wrongly dated as being made in 1327. Vincent determined the document was sent to a British auction house in 1945 by a World War I flying ace who also played a role defending Malta in World War II. The war hero, Forster Maynard, inherited the archives from Thomas and John Clarkson, who were leading campaigners against the slave trade. One of them, Thomas Clarkson, became friends with William Lowther, hereditary lord of the manor of Appleby, and he possibly gave it to Clarkson. \u201cThere\u2019s a chain of connection there, as it were, a smoking gun, but there isn\u2019t any clear proof as yet that this is the Appleby Magna Carta. But it seems to me very likely that it is,\u201d Vincent said. He said he would like to find a letter or other documentation showing the Magna Carta was given to Thomas Clarkson. Making Magna Carta relevant for a new generation Vincent and Carpenter plan to visit Harvard in June to see its Magna Carta firsthand \u2014 and they say the document is as relevant as ever at a time when Harvard is clashing with the Trump administration over how much authority the federal government should have over its leadership, admissions and activism on campus. \u201cIt turns up at Harvard at precisely the moment where Harvard is under attack as a private institution by a state authority that seems to want to tell Harvard what to do,\u201d Vincent said.

        "Summary": "'Big, beautiful bill' would result in 10.9 million people losing health insurance, primarily Medicaid.",
        "Content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans\u2019 tax bill would lead to nearly 11 million people losing health insurance, providing a key source of savings to help finance President Trump\u2019s tax cuts, according to projections that nonpartisan congressional scorekeepers published Wednesday.\nThe official projections from the Congressional Budget Office give Democrats ammunition to attack Republicans for taking insurance from low-income voters to pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich. Most Republicans say the bill only takes insurance from those without jobs who are able to work and that pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, and frail older adults will not be affected.\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), for example, said the CBO score shows the \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d of the bill.\nOverall, the bill increases the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over a decade, thanks to its extension of Trump\u2019s tax cuts and the enactment of new ones. Extending lower tax rates alone costs $2.2 trillion over a decade, for example. The bill includes cuts to federal spending on health coverage of more than $1 trillion.\nAbout 7.8 million people would lose Medicaid coverage, while much of the rest of the losses would stem from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges. Among those losing coverage would be 1.4 million immigrants and others who don\u2019t have, or can\u2019t prove, a legal status that would give them access to insurance. The bill imposes new restrictions on health insurance targeted at states that use their own funds to cover undocumented immigrants.\nHospitals, which are in an especially vulnerable position, will use the CBO projections to fight for changes in the Senate that curb enrollment losses.\nTaken together, the estimates show that the bill could represent the largest cuts to federal health care programs in history. The CBO report doesn\u2019t account for another looming change to health care: enhanced premium tax credits that help people buy ACA coverage are set to expire at the end of the year. The bill does not renew them. The Trump administration has separately estimated that 4.4 million would lose coverage without the tax credits.\nSenators will no doubt make changes to the House bill, and some are worried about Medicaid cuts, though the bill\u2019s imposition of work requirements remains popular even among those with concerns. They are not expected to write a new bill from scratch, due to time constraints. Republicans aim to pass the bill before July 4, but the real deadline might be when the government reaches its borrowing limit, expected sometime around August.\nThe health care portions of the bill can be placed in two big buckets: Medicaid cuts and reforms to the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\nThe addition of work requirements to the Medicaid program is responsible for about $344 billion of the savings in the bill, the most of any health care provision. The bill would require people up to age 64 who are without dependents or disabilities to work at least 80 hours a month in order to keep coverage. They would need to document twice a year that they\u2019re working. They could also maintain coverage if they perform community service or are enrolled in educational programs.\nThat savings figure is up from earlier estimates because Republicans decided to start the work requirements earlier, by Dec. 31, 2026. When the CBO had last scored that provision, the measure took effect in 2029, after the next presidential election. Even still, Medicaid enrollees probably would not have to deal with work requirements until after the midterms.\nThe CBO had done preliminary \u201cscores\u201d of the bill, which projected the budget impact of measures and their effect on enrollment. But the CBO didn\u2019t have time to analyze measures that were added last minute, and they hadn\u2019t yet accounted for how pieces of the bill interact.\nTwo measures aimed at curbing states\u2019 ability to increase federal funding of their Medicaid programs would together save $162 billion. The measures include new limits on states\u2019 provider taxes and on state-directed payment programs.\nThe bill would also save $145.7 billion through limits on Medicaid enrollment flexibilities, including delaying a rule to streamline enrollment and requiring the eligibility of expansion enrollees to be re-evaluated more frequently.\nIn a smaller bucket, the bill includes reforms to drug middlemen, which amount to $640 million in government savings. It would limit how pharmacy benefit managers can receive money from drugmakers, impose transparency requirements, and prevent spread pricing in Medicaid.\nThe bill also would boost payments to doctors by $8.9 billion over a decade by partially basing their Medicare payment rates on medical inflation. A measure to expand the exemption from Medicare price negotiation to orphan drugs with multiple indications would increase spending $4.9 billion. There\u2019s also a provision pausing a Biden-era rule, unpopular among Republicans, to require staffing levels at nursing homes that the CBO estimates would save $23 billion over 10 years.\nChelsea Cirruzzo contributed reporting.\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the savings attributed to changes to pharmacy benefit managers.",

This makes sense, given the agency leadership\u2019s focus on eradicating chronic disease. But the budget also proposes abolishing the CDC\u2019s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, instead folding it into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity that will also bring other centers under its umbrella.\nBut shifting work on chronic diseases to AHA may create more problems than it solves, Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told STAT\u2019s Liz Cooney. \u201cThat other agency does not exist right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know where the programs would pop up again when, and who will do the work.\u201d Read more from Liz on what the budget says about the future of chronic disease prevention work.\nCMS rescinds Biden\u2019s EMTALA guidance on pregnant patients\nFederal health officials have rescinded guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 that aimed to ensure hospitals in states with strict abortion bans would still provide appropriate emergency care like abortion to pregnant people if necessary.\nThe Biden administration\u2019s guidance was issued weeks after the Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to an abortion in the Dobbs case and, in a separate decision, dismissed a case focused on whether or not EMTALA \u2014 the federal legislation that establishes the right to emergency medical care regardless of one\u2019s ability to pay \u2014 includes emergency abortion care. Then-Secretary Xavier Becerra emphasized in a letter on the guidance that a clinician\u2019s legal and professional duty to provide such treatment should preempt any local restrictions.\nCMS said that it will continue to enforce EMTALA, and will work to \u201crectify any perceived legal confusion and instability\u201d the guidance had created. But experts have long said that the source of confusion lies with state bans on abortions, which often offer vague criteria for which life-threatening emergencies may lead to an exemption.

A study published in Nature Medicine today offers new evidence that this person-to-person variation has to do with metabolic features that could inform personalized diabetes prevention and treatment plans.\nA team led by Stanford researchers recruited 55 adults, nearly half of whom had prediabetes while most others had normal sugar levels, and had them wear continuous glucose monitors as they ate same-sized portions of meals delivered to their homes, with the foods including rice, bread, shredded potatoes, pasta, beans, grapes, and a mix of berries. The authors found that high glucose spikes after pasta were often linked to insulin resistance, a person\u2019s body not responding to the hormone, whereas participants with especially strong responses to potatoes included people who had beta cell dysfunction, meaning insulin-producing cells either struggled to produce the hormone or to release it. Subjects with spikes after eating bread were more likely to have high blood pressure. The authors also found that an oft-recommended strategy of eating fat, protein, or fiber before a carb-rich food did blunt glucose levels, but only in people who were responsive to insulin. \u2014 Jonathan Wosen\nEveryone\u2019s using these tests for cancer \u2014 but the data aren\u2019t there\nTests searching for tumor DNA in the blood are surging in popularity, mainly because they can clue clinicians into what\u2019s happening with a patient\u2019s cancer long before any changes appear on more traditional tools like MRI or CT scans. The tests can show if cancer patients will recur months before any lesions are visible, and some tests\u2019 results can give information about how a cancer will or is responding to a certain therapy.\nIt sounds good, right? These tests are commercially available and covered by Medicare. But there\u2019s one problem: Experts don\u2019t know if these tests actually help patients. STAT\u2019s Angus Chen spoke to cancer researchers about the technology, and all of them were enthusiastic about the technology\u2019s promise, but not ready to say these tests are useful in guiding better clinical decisions.\n\u201cResearch is trying to keep up with the pace of clinical use. It\u2019s a really exciting technology, but it\u2019s difficult to interpret and actually use test results,\u201d oncologist Stacey Cohen told Angus. Read more about how the hype might not match the research.\nHow incarceration affects mortality \u2014 for people both inside and out\nIt\u2019s long been understood that incarceration has long-term effects on health and mortality. But a study controlling for both individual and area-level factors has new numbers on the connection. People who were incarcerated in 2008 had a 39% higher risk of dying and more than three times the risk of dying from an overdose by 2019 than people who weren\u2019t, according to the study, published yesterday in JAMA Network Open. And the risk of incarceration doesn\u2019t just affect the people inside \u2014 researchers also found that county incarceration rates were associated with increased all-cause mortality risks for nonincarcerated residents. (That increased risk for nonincarcerated people was not there when it came to overdose mortality.)\nThe results come from an analysis of more than 3.2 million people whose information from a 2008 Census interview was connected to mortality data through 2019. Most other studies are limited in that their control group is based on the general population, rather than people in the same area from the same dataset, the authors write. The results show how urgently improved health care during and after incarceration is needed, they add, specifically pointing to community-based primary care as a potential solution.\nIn related news on incarceration and health, a federal judge has ruled that the federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care including hormones and social accommodations to trans incarcerated people, blocking an executive order prohibiting such care. The AP has more.\nAmerica can\u2019t afford to lose international physicians\nWhen the Trump administration put a pause on student visa interviews last week, thousands of J-1 physician visa holders poised to start their residency programs this summer were thrown into limbo. In a new First Opinion essay, orthopedic surgeon and former HHS secretary Tom Price argues that the country cannot afford to lose these doctors.\nThe government\u2019s own projections show that the U.S. will be short 124,000 physicians by 2027. The country has long benefited from attracting smart, medically-minded people from all over the world. Now, Congress needs to step up and create more flexible visa programs for international medical students to stay in America for work.

        "Content": "Chronic disease isn\u2019t going away, but a national center devoted to its prevention may be, a prospect that is alarming agency insiders and public health officials across the country.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 budget for 2026, released Friday, proposed $14 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the chronic disease epidemic, but it would also abolish the CDC\u2019s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.\n\u201cIf this center is eliminated, state and local departments lose core prevention funds. And they lose the workforce for schools, chronic disease prevention, data collection, surveillance systems,\u201d a senior official at the CDC chronic disease center told STAT on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \u201cIf folks care about kids, schools rely on this.\u201d\nFederal health leaders want to fold the chronic disease center into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity within HHS that will also bring other centers under its umbrella: the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The proposal asserts these moves will strengthen the response to chronic illness.\n\u201cAHA will administer $14.0 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the chronic disease epidemic,\u201d the proposal reads. \u201cIt will prioritize prevention \u2014 a missing piece in the American health system \u2014 primary care, maternal and child health, mental health, substance use prevention and treatment, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, workforce development, and policy, research, and oversight.\u201d\nThat leaves the current chronic disease center in limbo, its budget diminished, its workforce disbanded by layoffs contested in court, and its location to be determined as its surviving programs are scattered. The president\u2019s funding requests tend to undergo big changes before Congress passes a budget, but for now, public health experts are expressing puzzlement about how this proposal might harmonize with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s Make America Healthy Again agenda.\n\u201cIt looks pretty devastating for chronic disease when they\u2019re saying that they\u2019re really interested in prioritizing chronic disease,\u201d Philip Huang, a physician and director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, told STAT. \u201cAnd then that MAHA report that came out \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a very limited agenda that they\u2019re talking about in terms of how to address chronic disease.\u201d\nMoving prevention to AHA may give rise to more problems than it solves, Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told STAT. Part of that is uncertainty about which programs may survive.\n\u201cThat other agency does not exist right now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not just shifting the work. That would be something that has to get built up. So we\u2019re losing the people who do the work right now. We don\u2019t really know where the programs would pop up again when, and who will do the work.\u201d\nA spokesperson from HHS defended the decision, saying complex, duplicative health programs have led to fragmented efforts that dilute taxpayer resources and their impact on Americans. Some CDC programs will continue under AHA, the message emailed Tuesday also said, adding, \u201cWe must end this wasteful and inefficient model of health programming in favor of strategic, coordinated approaches. The creation of AHA does not eliminate priorities or functions; instead, it unites previously independent programs to work together to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d\nNot visible on the AHA agenda: the CDC\u2019s program to encourage smoking cessation, which has already fallen to the budget ax, a decision that makes no sense to Huang, who, years ago in his role as chronic disease director for Texas, traveled the state to urge restaurants to go smoke-free.\n\u201cFor them to have eliminated the Office on Smoking and Health is absolutely insane if you say you\u2019re trying to address chronic disease,\u201d he said. Among preventable causes of chronic disease, \u201ctobacco is the most blatant.\u201d\nThe CDC official also called smoking cessation one of public health\u2019s most effective interventions, \u201clike smallpox elimination for chronic disease.\u201d\nA new generation of young people, exposed to pitches selling e-cigarettes and tobacco pouches, might hear messages only from advertisers and not campaigns foundational to preventing heart disease, stroke, and cancer, the CDC official added.\nHuang was struck by Kennedy\u2019s answer when asked to name the leading preventable cause of death among Americans.\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s saying are the primary drivers of chronic disease are ultra-processed foods, environmental toxins, technology, and medications, including vaccines,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThey may be factors, but we know a lot of what causes these chronic diseases. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of disease, and he couldn\u2019t even identify that during his hearing.\u201d\nConservative voices have been calling for the CDC to return to its roots, narrowing its scope to infectious diseases like the one that inspired its creation and its location in the southeastern United States: malaria.\nSince its founding in 1946, the CDC\u2019s expertise and activities have grown deeper and wider, as the \u201cprevention\u201d in its name implies, to include a multitude of diseases, studying their origin, treatment, prevention, and prevalence. The agency\u2019s knowledge, standards, and investigations are shared around the world and in all U.S. states and territories.\nThe list of noncommunicable diseases is long, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, maternal mortality, obesity, mental illness, epilepsy, and dementia. So is the tally of causes in addition to tobacco: high blood pressure, unhealthy diet, limited physical activity, poor access to cancer screening.\nIf the CDC\u2019s footprint shrinks to communicable disease outbreaks, the chronic disease center\u2019s program will be splintered. The pain would be felt far from headquarters in Atlanta, the CDC official said. That\u2019s because 80% of the dollars funding the center at CDC now flow to state, territorial, and local health departments.\n\u201cPrevention as a whole is being deprioritized, so that will put pressure on clinics in the health care delivery system to do what they\u2019re not doing now: prevention outside the clinic, in neighborhoods, to prevent heart disease, diabetes, cancer.\u201d\nThe budget plan would provide $500 million \u201cto tackle priority activities to Make America Healthy Again,\u201d of which $260 million would fight chronic illness by addressing nutrition and environmental impacts.\nThat would include $119 million for a new Prevention Innovation Program, which the proposal said would improve the health of Americans through reliable broadband technology integration, \u201censuring access to nutrition services and physical activity venues, and reducing dependence on medication.\u201d\nA May 22 letter from 29 U.S. senators in response to President Trump\u2019s budget proposal urged lawmakers to protect robust funding for the CDC as a whole while singling out its chronic disease center.\n\u201cThe elimination of the CDC\u2019s chronic disease prevention office also contradicts the Administration\u2019s stated goal of addressing the chronic disease epidemic in our country,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThese cuts will not make Americans healthy.\u201d\nOne of the national center\u2019s major roles is to provide the comprehensive data collection and analysis to public health departments across the country, a division of labor that allows small staffs to do more.\nJason Orcena, public health commissioner for Union County, Ohio, said there\u2019s a valuable synergy between the CDC and his office, which serves 70,000 people in a county that includes both suburban and rural areas with differing health needs.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a heavy reliance on those national surveillance tools to help frame the work we do locally as part of our local community health assessments and community health improvement plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things the center and CDC in general does and the state does as well. We rely on them through that economy of scale to have truly experts in these areas because I can\u2019t afford to have someone be an expert in all things.\u201d\nAsked what disease or condition concerns him the most, Orcena said, \u201cthe one I don\u2019t know about yet.\u201d\nGeorges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, pointed out that there are 3,300 departments across the country, some with hundreds of employees and some with just two.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the gap filler for people to make sure that even within the traditional medical system, things don\u2019t fall through the cracks,\u201d he said about individual public health systems. \u201cIf you start seeing a new cancer developing, that\u2019s going to be picked up by the chronic disease center.\u201d\nCase in point: HIV was initially recognized after a rare cancer related to the infection began showing up in men who had sex with men, later linked to the disease that became an epidemic.\n\u201cThis is the division that\u2019s going to figure that out. It\u2019s not NIH,\u201d Benjamin said about the chronic disease center at CDC.\nAt the state and local level, public health officials are facing confusing messages on funding for individual projects. Earlier this year they weathered the loss of money to pay for Covid-19 programs, many of which had pivoted to cover health needs beyond Covid.\nBecause chronic disease has long been underfunded and underappreciated, partnerships between local health departments and a national system is crucial, NACCHO\u2019s Casalotti said.\n\u201cBringing all these parts together could move us towards a place so we can focus more on these diseases,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, what they\u2019re seeing and experiencing is actually pulling back from this work, not necessarily pushing it forward. And so I think that\u2019s where the field needs to go: We need to be pushing forward together.\u201d\nSTAT\u2019s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

        "Content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it would revoke guidance to the nation\u2019s hospitals that directed them to provide emergency abortions for women when they are necessary to stabilize their medical condition.\nThat guidance was issued to hospitals in 2022, weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court upended national abortion rights in the U.S. It was an effort by the Biden administration to preserve abortion access for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies and needed an abortion to prevent organ loss or severe hemorrhaging, among other serious complications.\nThe Biden administration had argued that hospitals \u2014 including states with near-total bans \u2014 needed to provide emergency abortions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. That law requires emergency rooms that receive Medicare dollars to provide an exam and stabilizing treatment for all patients. Nearly all emergency rooms in the U.S. rely on Medicare funds.\nThe Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it would no longer enforce that policy The move prompted concerns from some doctors and abortion rights advocates that women will not get emergency abortions in states with strict bans.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration would rather women die in emergency rooms than receive life-saving abortions,\u201d Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. \u201cIn pulling back guidance, this administration is feeding the fear and confusion that already exists at hospitals in every state where abortion is banned. Hospitals need more guidance, not less, to stop them from turning away patients experiencing pregnancy crises.\u201d\nAnti-abortion advocates praised the move, however. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the Biden-era policy had been a way to expand abortion access in states where it was banned.\n\u201cDemocrats have created confusion on this fact to justify their extremely unpopular agenda for all-trimester abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cIn situations where every minute counts, their lies lead to delayed care and put women in needless, unacceptable danger.\u201d\nAn Associated Press investigation last year found that, even with the Biden administration\u2019s guidance, dozens of pregnant women were being turned away from emergency rooms, including some who needed emergency abortions.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which investigates hospitals that are not in compliance, said in a statement that it will continue to enforce the federal law that, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d\nBut CMS added that it would also \u201crectify any perceived legal confusion and instability created by the former administration\u2019s actions.\u201d\nThe Biden administration sued Idaho over its abortion law that initially only allowed abortions to save the life of the mother. The federal government had argued before the U.S. Supreme Court last year that Idaho\u2019s law was in conflict with the federal law, which requires stabilizing treatment that prevents a patient\u2019s condition from worsening.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court issued a procedural ruling in the case last year that left key questions unanswered about whether doctors in abortion ban states can terminate pregnancies when a woman is at risk of serious infection, organ loss or hemorrhage.\n\u2014 Amanda Seitz",

        "Summary": "It is squarely unethical to treat healthy pregnant women differently than other groups that are similarly at elevated risk of serious Covid illness, writes one bioethicist.",
        "Content": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy\u2019s proposal to end the government\u2019s existing Covid vaccine recommendation for healthy pregnant women, if enacted, will be a major setback to decades\u2019 worth of efforts to advance the health of pregnant people and their babies.\nIt also profoundly unethical.\nPregnant people are consistently left behind in biomedical R&D in ways that are deeply harmful to the health of both mother and child. In the decade before the Covid pandemic, consensus reports emerged denouncing this pregnancy evidence gap and providing road maps for how to ethically generate evidence during pregnancy within the confines of existing research regulations. I co-led one of these efforts, the PREVENT project, initiated in response to the Zika epidemic and completed in fall 2019. PREVENT specifically focused on how to ethically include pregnant women in the development and deployment of new vaccines for emerging pandemic threats.\nIn the early days of the Covid pandemic, many colleagues and I had hope that this time would be different, not only because reports provided road maps for ethical inclusion but also because Operation Warp Speed indemnified vaccine developers from litigation, eliminating legal risk that some viewed as the last remaining obstacle to conducting research with pregnant women.\nNothing changed, however. Vaccine developers made no serious effort to generate pregnancy-specific data. As a consequence, many countries, including the U.S., initially excluded pregnant women from the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, over the strenuous objection of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other relevant professional organizations. They argued that pregnant women and their newborns were at increased risk from Covid and that there was no plausible biological reason to think the vaccines were harmful.\nEventually, it became clear that pregnant people infected with Covid were being hospitalized at alarming rates; that their pregnancies were threatened by preterm labor, stillbirths, and other conditions; and that their newborns, also at elevated risk, could be protected by maternal antibodies. Although the U.S. was quicker than many other countries to reverse its position and designated pregnant women as a high-risk, high-priority group, damage was already done. We will never know how many preventable hospitalizations and maternal and neonatal deaths occurred because of the delay in including pregnant women in the vaccine rollout \u2014 a delay that also created a persistent cloud of doubt.\nBut the good news is that the Covid vaccine joined the flu vaccine as routinely recommended in pregnancy, to protect both the pregnant woman and her newborn.\nThat is, until now. Kennedy\u2019s position is throwing back into chaos the hard-fought progress of the pandemic years, once again jeopardizing the health of pregnant people and babies alike. I am not aware of any evidence shifts that could justify this reversal. Millions of pregnant women have received Covid mRNA vaccines in the past four and a half years, without any concerning safety signals. Although it is possible that those who have had Covid or been vaccinated in the past have a level of antibodies that might provide them with some protection against their otherwise elevated risk of serious disease, they would likely still be better protected if vaccinated.\nMoreover, even those who have experienced previous Covid infection will be able to better protect their infants if they are vaccinated during pregnancy. That\u2019s because mothers protect their young infants against Covid and many other infectious diseases through antibodies that are transferred through the placenta. The more antibody a mother has, the more her infant can receive. Covid vaccination produces a rapid rise in Covid antibody, which means that mothers vaccinated while pregnant can provide their infants with much more of this protective antibody than if they are not vaccinated during this critical window.\nIt is squarely unethical to treat healthy pregnant people differently than other groups that are similarly at elevated risk of serious Covid illness. It appears that the federal government will continue to recommend Covid vaccine for people with asthma or diabetes. How can they justify not doing so for women who are pregnant, when pregnancy, like asthma and diabetes, is an established risk factor for bad Covid outcomes?\nIt is squarely unethical to deny infants the protection that maternal vaccination can afford them. Covid-19 in pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirth and preterm birth. Babies less than 6 months old are at greater risk of serious disease but are too young to be vaccinated themselves. The only way to protect babies from these risks to their health and lives is to vaccinate their mothers while they are pregnant.\nAnd it is squarely unethical to require randomized clinical trials as a condition of recommending Covid vaccines in pregnancy. One of the foundational tenants of research ethics is that it is never ethically permissible to withhold an intervention of established benefit from research participants, but that is exactly what a vaccine trial in pregnancy with a placebo arm \u2014 what Kennedy\u2019s HHS is calling \u201cgold standard\u201d science \u2014 entails.\nCovid vaccines in pregnancy offer an established benefit to pregnant women and their babies. The only ethical path is for the CDC recommendation that was in place before Kennedy announced his position to remain in effect. To do otherwise \u2014 even to move from an affirmative recommendation to one that permits pregnant people to choose vaccination in consultation with their health care providers \u2014 will undermine decades of work to build much needed confidence among pregnant women, their partners, and those who provide care for them.\nCurrently, the CDC website is providing the public with conflicting information. There is narrative on the website that continues to correctly characterize how Covid infection can harm mothers and babies and why Covid vaccine is safe in pregnancy. At the same time, the entry for pregnant women and the Covid vaccine on the CDC\u2019s Adult Immunization Schedule is \u201cno guidance/not applicable.\u201d The CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which hopefully will be asked to opine on this issue, is scheduled to meet at the end of June.\nFor this critical preventive intervention, the benefits to both mothers and their babies far exceed any risks. In the end, each pregnant woman will make her own decision about whether to be vaccinated. Conflicting messages from professional societies and federal public health agencies about the clinical value of being vaccinated will not make that decision any easier and will do more harm than good.\nRuth Faden is the Philip Franklin Wagley professor of biomedical ethics and founder of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics.

It\u2019s June 3 \u2014 a significant day in the fictional \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d town of Stars Hollow, and just another day of June/late spring/Pride for those of us in the real world. But there\u2019s plenty of news today, so let\u2019s get into it.\nHow Thailand took ownership of its HIV/AIDS response\nIn countries around the world, the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts to HIV/AIDS funding like PEPFAR have left health officials scrambling for ways to deliver preventative care and life-saving treatments. In more than a dozen countries, the U.S. accounted for the majority of HIV/AIDS financing, sparking a global health crisis. But in Thailand, even before the abrupt withdrawal of support, the country managed to fund 91% of its own response.\nOf all the developing countries that relied on PEPFAR, Thailand is the \u201cbest example\u201d of how local health officials have taken ownership of their HIV/AIDS response, said Jaime Azcona, director of equitable financing at the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. In his latest story, STAT contributor and former intern Simar Bajaj writes about how Thailand can serve as an example of how low- and middle-income countries can develop a more sustainable response. Read more about the most important factors and the rocky road ahead for most countries.\nAnti-LGBTQ+ incidents related to health care have increased\nThere were 932 anti-LGBTQ+ incidents of harassment, vandalism, or assault across the U.S. between May 1, 2024 and May 1, 2025, according to the GLAAD ALERT Desk, which tracks trends in extremism. That\u2019s a 20% drop since the previous year. But incidents related to LGBTQ+ health care actually rose in that time \u2014 there were 154 incidents targeting providers, patients, or using anti-trans health care tropes. That\u2019s a 62% increase from the previous year, and a whopping 295% increase from May 2022-2023, according to GLAAD.\nOne of these incidents included action by the conservative advocacy group American Parents Coalition, in which billboard trucks were parked outside children\u2019s hospitals in multiple states with messages falsely claiming the clinics were harming children by offering gender-affirming care. In the same week, a neo-Nazi group left dozens of flyers on lawns in a Connecticut community, targeting Jewish clinicians who provided gender-affirming care. The flyers identified specific clinicians, reading \u201cA child mutilator lives amongst us.\u201d\nGLAAD calls the numbers \u201cfar too high\u201d but also \u201cunsurprising,\u201d given the dramatic increase in political rhetoric and legislation targeting queer and trans people since the beginning of the Trump administration.\nEating disorder research is being cut despite MAHA\u2019s chronic disease focus\nIn the first major report from the president\u2019s Make America Healthy Again Commission, disordered eating is mentioned just once, in passing, in connection with the benefits of family meals. Amid dozens of references to obesity and a major focus on what foods American children consume, there are zero mentions of specific conditions like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder.\nWhile the Trump administration has repeatedly pledged to combat chronic disease, scientific research on eating disorders is being disproportionately affected by ongoing federal grant terminations, according to experts in the field. The consequences could be stark. \u201cI\u2019m extremely worried that we\u2019re just going to continue with the status quo now, where some people get better and most don\u2019t,\u201d Cheri Levinson, director of the EAT Lab at the University of Louisville, Kentucky, told me. Read my latest story on how the future of eating disorder research and treatment could be in jeopardy.\nMMR vaccination rates have fallen since the pandemic\nA new study of more than 2,000 counties across the country shows that 78% have reported drops in their vaccination rates for measles, mumps, and rubella over the last five years. On average, county-level vaccination rates dropped from 93.92% to 91.26% pre- to post-pandemic, according to the research, published yesterday in JAMA. (A vaccination rate of 95% is the typical public health goal, as that\u2019s the level necessary for herd immunity.) Only four out of 33 included states reported an increase in the median county-level vaccination rate: California, Connecticut, Maine, and New York.\nThe data comes in the wake of the largest measles outbreak the country has seen in decades. Two unvaccinated children in Texas have died, yet the state is currently poised to make it even easier for parents to enroll their kids in school without standard vaccinations like the MMR shot.\nQ&A: Mass. health commissioner articulates the pain states are feeling\nAcross the country, some state health officials have publicly toed the Trump party line when speaking about the administration\u2019s dismantling of public health infrastructure, including $11.4 billion in funds clawed back from local and state public health departments. \u201cAs the federal government continues to cut waste and enhance efficiency, we are confident these changes will not impact our ability to serve Tennesseans,\u201d the Tennessee Department of Health told STAT in March, when asked about the cutting of Covid-related federal funding.\nBut that\u2019s not the strategy taken by Robert Goldstein, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. To Goldstein, these threats are being felt across the country. \u201cThe needs that this department has are the same as the Texas department\u2019s or the North Dakota department\u2019s,\u201d he said, when he sat down with STAT\u2019s Eric Boodman earlier this spring. \u201cBut as a state health officer of a Democratic-leaning state with a Democratic administration and a Democratic state house and a congressional delegation of all Democrats, it is easier for me to articulate the pain we\u2019re feeling.\u201d\nGoldstein spoke with Eric about the challenges of this moment, and how funding cuts will hit each state differently. Read the conversation here.\nThe secret ingredient making vapes popular with teens\nNeotame is an artificial sweetener that\u2019s 7,000 to 13,000 times sweeter than traditional sugar. It\u2019s in ice cream, lip gloss, and even sparking water. Now, researchers have found it\u2019s also in many flavored vapes, which they warn make these products extra appealing to teens and kids.\nA study published yesterday, also in JAMA, found neotame in all 11 of the popular disposable vape brands it tested, including Elf Bar, Breeze, and Mr. Fog. All of these wildly-named products are technically illegal in the U.S., STAT\u2019s Sarah Todd reminds us, but they\u2019re still widely available at gas stations, convenience stores, and online. The study did not find neotame in the four e-cigarettes it tested that are authorized for sale by the FDA, nor in Juul, which has an application pending with the FDA.\nRead more from Sarah about the thorny questions this research raises about the FDA\u2019s authority and the Trump administration\u2019s plans for cracking down on illegal vaping.\nWhat we\u2019re reading\nI covered my body in health trackers for six months.

It\u2019s unclear how many more grants have likely been cut since then. The team has yet to comb through data on grants terminated from the National Science Foundation or those from targeted universities.\nThese losses are a small portion of the $9.5 billion in grants across science that have been cut. But a few million dollars could make up a large chunk of all eating disorder research in the U.S., said Ariel Beccia, a post-doc on the Harvard team.\n\u201cThe impact is always going to be felt more when there isn\u2019t as much money to go around in the first place,\u201d said Christine Peat, a licensed psychologist and president of the Eating Disorder Coalition. \u201cThe pool is just shallow.\u201d\nWhen asked about the scant references to eating disorders in the MAHA report, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard wrote in a statement to STAT that the report \u201canalyzes key drivers of the childhood chronic disease crisis \u2014 including poor diet.\u201d She added, \u201cSecretary Kennedy believes this report provides the framework for reversing the many preventable illnesses \u2014 including eating disorders \u2014 plaguing America\u2019s children.\u201d\nEating disorder research has always been underfunded \u2014 about $55 million in NIH categorical grants went to eating disorder research in 2023, according to the agency website. That encompasses everything from investigating biological underpinnings, tracking epidemiology, and testing new treatments for anorexia, bulimia, binge-eating, and other eating disorders. The grants also included studies on obesity and weight loss.\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly why so many eating disorder grants have been caught up in the Trump administration\u2019s cuts. Beccia\u2019s study focused on eating disorders during the pandemic, so she suspects she was part of the wave of terminated Covid-19 research. (And now she and her colleagues are caught up in the Trump administration\u2019s blitz on Harvard.) Many studies focused on marginalized populations that are at higher risk for eating disorders, including LGBTQ+ communities and people of color.\n\u201cThe field, rightly so, in recent years has really pushed to have a focus on the non-stereotypical eating disorder presentation,\u201d said Peat.\nBut expanding research populations is not just about inclusivity or diversity, said Tiffany Brown, the principal investigator at Auburn University\u2019s Appearance Concerns, Eating, Prevention & Treatment (ACCEPT) Lab. Focusing research on small, specific communities can help experts to better understand how treatment can be more personalized \u2014 something that is desperately needed for patients with eating disorders.\nExisting treatments, usually based in cognitive behavioral therapy, are only modestly effective. High proportions of patients drop out of both inpatient and outpatient care, and rates of remission (which does not have one set definition) range between 40% and 60% for anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating disorder.\nLevinson and her team are working on a new approach to treatment that uses machine learning and patients\u2019 symptom data to predict what methods might work best. \u201cWe\u2019re doing what people would do in community-based care, but we\u2019re doing it in a way that is informed by data, so we\u2019re actually hitting the right targets,\u201d Levinson said. Factors like worry, depression, and an overemphasis on weight or shape all contribute to eating disorders, but a patient\u2019s data, based off of questionnaires, can show which factors are most relevant for therapy.\nThe main grant for that trial is intact, but one of Levinson\u2019s team members lost funding for a related trial looking at the treatment of the strictly medical side of eating disorders. That researcher, like many in treatment trials, also served as a therapist for all the patients. Levinson has been able to cobble together short-term funding to keep him on the project, but it won\u2019t last forever.\nBrown, the Auburn researcher, was recruiting participants for a two-phase clinical trial on integrating LGBTQ affirmative treatment into eating disorder cognitive behavioral therapy when she learned that the grant was canceled. The notice came just days before the first participant\u2019s introductory therapy session.\n\u201cIt would have been a $5.5 million grant in total over the five-year span,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest grant I\u2019ve certainly ever had. It was life-changing in terms of our lab and what we could do.\u201d\nBrown had two full-time research coordinators on her now-canceled grant. She\u2019s already had to let go of one, and knows that eventually, she\u2019ll have to lose the other. The timeline for the work she wants to get done building and testing new treatment approaches for eating disorders will likely double without federal funding.\n\u201cI don\u2019t plan to stop doing this kind of work. I also don\u2019t plan on getting it funded through public funding anytime soon,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe hard part will be what pace it\u2019s going to go at.\u201d\nCancellations and delays happening now could have ripple effects on eating disorder research for years to come. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could have written this grant several years ago,\u201d Brown said about her canceled study. The treatment her team wants to test is based on the very epidemiological work tracking eating disorders among queer communities that Beccia and her colleagues do \u2014 which has also been canceled.\nIn the meantime, researchers are trying to recoup NIH funding, submit proposals for new grants, while also applying to as many funding opportunities through private foundations as possible. And even though they\u2019re all vying for a limited amount of dollars, \u201cI have not had any sense of competition,\u201d Beccia said. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s been people encouraging others to apply to the same grants they\u2019re applying to.\u201d\nPeat has also seen that camaraderie shine through. On a Thursday in mid-May, she traveled to Capitol Hill along with 140 other advocates to take part in 100 different congressional meetings on their budget priorities for the next year. They all had two modest requests: $5 million to continue federal training for clinicians on eating disorder screening and intervention procedures, plus $750,000 in research grants focused on the early detection of eating disorders among women and girls.\nDespite a spreading feeling of disenfranchisement in the field, Peat said that there was a hopeful mood among the advocates that day. She\u2019s optimistic that the funding they asked for will come through.\nBut the question remains how much, if at all, the MAHA movement may focus on addressing eating disorders. \u201cI view the whole MAHA movement with major, major suspicion and concern,\u201d Beccia said. She knows that eating disorders are serious chronic health conditions. What has yet to be shown is if Kennedy and his cadre care about them.",

        "Summary": "Massachusetts health commissioner Robbie Goldstein says threats to public health funding are being felt nationwide",
        "Content": "Look at Robert Goldstein\u2019s CV, and you\u2019ll see a small catalog of ideas the Trump administration has been working against.\nHe\u2019s an infectious disease specialist; Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said that the government ought to \u201cgive infectious disease a break.\u201d He founded the Massachusetts General Hospital Transgender Health Program; on the day of his second inauguration, Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring the very existence of trans people to be a \u201cgender ideology\u201d based on a \u201cfalse claim.\u201d And since 2021, Goldstein has been working on public health infrastructure \u2014 first, as an adviser to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and then as the commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health \u2014 which the Trump administration has been furiously trying to dismantle.\nThat means living in limbo. Take the $11.4 billion that the Trump administration clawed back from local and state public health departments in March, which had been allocated during the Covid pandemic in 2021 to help shore up the architecture that helps prevent disease. A coalition of 23 states, including Massachusetts, sued, winning first an emergency restraining order that briefly blocked the cuts, and then a court order further protecting that federal funding, such that agencies could, for now, continue programs such as infectious disease monitoring and overdose prevention. But that\u2019s just one example among many. For instance, Goldstein is watching the Republican budget for 2026, which involves shuttering or reorganizing the federal offices that provide grants his agency relies on.\nSome state health officials have publicly toed the Trump party line. \u201cAs the federal government continues to cut waste and enhance efficiency, we are confident these changes will not impact our ability to serve Tennesseans,\u201d the Tennessee Department of Health told STAT in March, when asked about the cutting of Covid-related federal funding.\nTo Goldstein, though, these threats are being felt across the country. \u201cThe needs that this department has are the same as the Texas department\u2019s or the North Dakota department\u2019s,\u201d he said, when he sat down with STAT earlier this spring. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a blue-state issue. It\u2019s not just a red-state issue. It\u2019s not just a purple-state issue. It\u2019s an every-state issue. But as a state health officer of a Democratic-leaning state with a Democratic administration and a Democratic state house and a congressional delegation of all Democrats, it is easier for me to articulate the pain we\u2019re feeling.\u201d\nThis conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nWhat is most challenging about this moment?\nWhat\u2019s most challenging is that the attacks are coming from all angles. We have the potential to lose a large source of funding for state public health \u2014 and we\u2019re seeing funding cuts to other institutions that support public health. Department of Education cuts are just as much public health cuts as they are education cuts. If kids don\u2019t have a school where they have a school nurse, where they have resources available to support mental and physical health, public health is going to have to pick up those pieces. But we\u2019re not getting more money to do that.\nLately, I\u2019ve been describing public health as the safety net of the safety net. When we hear about billions cut from Medicaid or the Department of Transportation or Housing and Urban Development, people are going to look to public health. When you don\u2019t get health care through Medicaid, you are going to turn to community-based organizations that are doing blood pressure monitoring. That\u2019s funded by us. When you don\u2019t have SNAP benefits and you have to go to the food pantry \u2014 that\u2019s funded by DPH. We are holding the whole system. That is what public health does, and we often do it silently. People don\u2019t even know we\u2019re there. But as safety nets begin to break, ours is going to start to weigh down more and more.\nWhere will you feel that strain first?\nWe\u2019re seeing attacks on public health in terms of what is truth. Things that have been bedrock for public health for decades are now being challenged by the federal Secretary of Health and Human Services. Vaccines have been the best public health intervention of the last 100 years. I say that with great respect for the seatbelt and the car seat and labelling on cigarettes. Vaccines have saved more lives. To question the safety and the effectiveness of vaccines in 2025 is challenging 100 years of science. That is devastating, because if you let doubt creep in on something that is so proven, and known to be effective, it can bring doubt into everything else.\nIt all comes back to trust. It is the thing that public health needs to get our work done. Trust is built with knowledge, with science and evidence \u2014 and that\u2019s being attacked by the Trump administration, with NIH grants being canceled and the whole research infrastructure coming down.\nTrust is also built with persistence. The federal government has historically given states the ability to be persistently focused. What we\u2019re having to do now is potentially pulling out of these communities. That will damage trust. People will say, \u201cHow can I believe that you\u2019re going to be there two years from now, why would I trust you on this intervention if in the middle of the last one, you just walked out of our community?\u201d\nIn early April, amid mass layoffs, the Trump administration effectively eliminated both the National Asthma Control Program and the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. Federal officials have said the lead program will continue in a different form, though have not answered questions about how or when that might be up and running. If those cuts stand, how will that affect your department?\nMassachusetts has for five decades supported lead remediation and lead poisoning interventions for children all across the state. That\u2019s in our state statute. We have state funding to do it. I don\u2019t think that whatever happens at the federal level is going to impact the Massachusetts lead program.\nIn other areas, it\u2019s more challenging. Asthma, for example. We receive federal funding for our asthma program. That funding allows us to get into vulnerable communities, to do the necessary education, to link people to care. We don\u2019t have state funding to replace all of that. If that program truly is cut, there will come a time relatively soon where the Massachusetts program will need to pare back on what it\u2019s doing, which means the people of Massachusetts are going to feel the impact.\nIt sounds like Massachusetts has a modicum of protection from these cuts that some states don\u2019t.\nIf you look at our Department of Public Health, we\u2019re a little over 50% funded by the state, and around 40% funded by the federal government. In almost every other state, it\u2019s the reverse, where a larger percentage comes from the federal government, a smaller percentage from their state. And most states are very far in the reverse, like 80% or 70% comes from the federal government, and only 20 or 30% from the state.\nHow is this administration affecting gender-affirming care in Massachusetts now?\nIt\u2019s important for us to reframe this conversation. The Trump administration is making it sound like there are armies of trans kids walking down the streets seeking gender-affirming care. Even here in Massachusetts, where we\u2019ve got a very welcoming environment, we\u2019re talking about a couple of thousand kids across a state of 7 million people. This is not the enormous issue that the Trump administration is trying to make it out to be. This is about patients and providers having a conversation about what is right for the patient, and bringing evidence-based interventions into the clinical space.\nWe are anticipating what the next move would be, but we don\u2019t have to change anything at the moment, because right now, it is legal for every provider to provide gender-affirming care to the adolescent or child who walks in. We want to make sure people know that. Very early on in the second Trump administration, I sat in front of the CEOs of all of the hospitals across Massachusetts, and made it very clear: Keep your doors open. Continue to provide this care. Call us if you\u2019re seeing any issues. Our message is, continue to provide the care that we know is life saving and is necessary for these kids.\nDo you think the fear in some marginalized communities \u2014 fear of immigration enforcement, for instance, or of attacks on trans care \u2014 will affect infectious disease surveillance and treatment?\nIt\u2019s going to be hard to tease out the root causes of changes. We\u2019re likely to see funding cuts in HIV and STI monitoring, and that\u2019s going to have real impacts. We also should be realistic: At least here in Massachusetts, a lot of new HIV and tuberculosis diagnoses are in people who were born in other countries. The rhetoric of the Trump administration is going to prevent those folks from coming into a site of care because they may be worried about ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] or they may be worried about how information will be documented and shared with the federal government. That\u2019s going to have impacts on our ability to identify, treat, and prevent cases.\nHow will you prioritize what to fund, given the potential cuts?\nThat\u2019s a really tough and complicated decision. What\u2019s more important, lead screening and prevention or HIV case management or a school-based health program that addresses suicidal ideation in adolescents? I don\u2019t know the answer to that. But at some point, those are the types of decisions we\u2019re going to have to make if funding gets pulled.",

        "Summary": "An artificial sweetener called neotame was found in disposable vapes popular with teens.",
        "Content": "Ice cream, lip gloss, and sparkling water are just a few of the products that can contain neotame \u2014 an artificial sweetener that\u2019s 7,000-13,000 times sweeter than sugar. Now researchers have found it\u2019s also in many flavored disposable e-cigarettes, which they warn gives them extra appeal to teens and kids.\nThe study, published Monday in JAMA, found neotame in all 11 of the popular disposable vape brands it tested, including Elf Bar, Breeze, and Mr. Fog. Neotame was also detected in vapes marketed as \u201czero-nicotine\u201d or that used nicotine analogs. All of these vapes are technically illegal in the U.S., but remain widely available at many gas stations and convenience stores as well as online. The study did not find neotame in the four e-cigarettes it tested that are authorized for sale by the Food and Drug Administration, nor in Juul, which has an application pending with the FDA.\nThe U.S. market is awash in illegal e-cigarettes in fruity flavors like \u201cKillar Kustard Blueberry,\u201d which make up 86% of retail sales in the U.S., according to anti-tobacco use nonprofit Truth Initiative. The vast majority of these products are imported from China, which banned the domestic sale of flavored vapes in 2022, spurring companies there to turn their focus to the U.S. and other foreign countries. The FDA has authorized just 34 tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes so far, which account for 14% of retail sales. The Supreme Court last month upheld the FDA\u2019s refusal to authorize flavored vapes over concerns about the products\u2019 allure to young people.\n\u201cWe think that the presence of neotame is really a determining factor in the attractiveness and preference for these products,\u201d said Sven Jordt, one of the study\u2019s authors and an associate professor in pharmacology and cancer biology at Duke University School of Medicine. That\u2019s particularly true for children and teens, he said, who crave intensely sweet tastes much more than do adults.\nWhile vaping rates have fallen among U.S. youth, e-cigarettes are still used by 5.9% of middle- and high-school students, making them the most popular tobacco product among that age group, according to a 2024 government survey. The survey also found that flavored, disposable vapes are the types of e-cigarettes most favored by that age group. Public health experts are particularly concerned about vaping among youth because nicotine harms developing brains, and because the habit may put them at higher risk for smoking cigarettes later on or developing other addictions.\nResearchers also warn of an additional problem with neotame in e-cigarettes: The sweetener is only FDA-approved for use in food. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how safe they are if you inhale them into your lungs,\u201d said Jordt. Many cigarettes, for example, contain added sugar, which helps mask the bitter flavors in tobacco smoke. But when that sugar is burned, it increases the levels of toxic chemicals that people inhale.\nNicotine pouches like Zyn and chewing tobacco also contain sweeteners, which other researchers have argued allows them to be classified as \u201cunflavored\u201d while still imparting a distinctive taste. The Tobacco Control Act does not mention sweetness levels in its definition of flavors.\nMitch Zeller, a former head of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said the study raises a separate thorny question: Does the FDA actually have the authority to regulate some of these products?\nNicotine analog products use compounds that have a different chemical formula than nicotine, but are quite similar. The nicotine content in the analog products tested in the study was zero. A number of health organizations and advocacy groups have raised concerns that brands like Spree Bar are using nicotine analogs in an effort to evade regulation, under the argument that they\u2019re not technically tobacco products as defined in the Tobacco Control Act.\nThe Trump administration has said it plans to crack down on illegal vapes, and recently announced the seizure of $34 million worth of the products in Chicago. Discussing the seizure in public remarks in late May, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary warned, \u201cI personally have observed kids from good families who have become addicted to vaping,\u201d and said that products imported from China \u201cmay have risks we have yet to understand as a medical profession.\u201d\nBut both Zeller and Jordt noted that the shuttering the Office of Smoking and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cuts to the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products are at odds with the goal of a strong government response to illegal vapes.\n\u201cWhile the research highlights important questions from a toxicological and abuse liability standpoint, the sheer size of the illicit e-cigarette market needs addressing,\u201d Cristine Delnevo, director of the Rutgers Institute for Nicotine and Tobacco Studies, said via email. The FDA needs to authorize the e-cigarettes that meet it standards, she said, and take enforcement actions against the ones that don\u2019t.\nSTAT\u2019s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

        "Content": "Get your daily dose of health and medicine every weekday with STAT\u2019s free newsletter Morning Rounds. Sign up here.\nGood morning! We\u2019re excited to announce a few new additions to the STAT team, including two D.C. reporters: Chelsea Cirruzzo and Daniel Payne. You\u2019ve already seen some of Daniel\u2019s great reporting since he started this spring. And we\u2019re excited to have Chelsea on board beginning this week.\nAnd it\u2019s already a busy one. Members of the STAT biotech team have been reporting nonstop out of the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago. I hope you\u2019re following along.\nFrom start-up founder to DOGE\u2019s invisible health care czar\nYou probably haven\u2019t heard of the man at the center of the Trump administration\u2019s massive, relentless cuts to government-funded scientific research and disease prevention. Brad Smith (above) has been a leading figure within the U.S. DOGE Service, after being part of Trump 1.0\u2019s Operation Warp Speed during the pandemic.\nSTAT\u2019s Tara Bannow profiled Smith in her latest story, based on interviews with more than 30 people, including his former colleagues and employees, as well as friends, family members, and former classmates. Multiple people called him \u201cthe smartest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d His mom told Tara he\u2019s worked upwards of 18 hours a day for his whole career.\nThe conversations revealed a person singularly and unapologetically focused on hitting ambitious growth and profit targets, sometimes at the expense of workers\u2019 mental health and patients\u2019 well-being. \u201cI do think that you don\u2019t become so successful without being a little bit ruthless,\u201d a former executive at CareBridge, a company Smith founded, said of him. Read more from Tara about how Brad Smith got to the top, and where he might be going next.\nNew HHS document details deep NIH cuts\nNow that you know who Smith is, we\u2019ve got more details about what some of his cost-cutting efforts could look like: A summary of President Trump\u2019s budget request for the 2026 fiscal year, released Friday by HHS, provides the closest look yet at how the administration hopes to reshape the NIH and other federal agencies.\nThe \u201cbudget in brief\u201d document doubles down on a previous request to slash NIH\u2019s discretionary budget to $27.5 billion, an $18 billion or nearly 40% reduction. It also details plans to consolidate the agency\u2019s 27 institutes and centers into just eight. HHS claims that restructuring NIH will make it run more efficiently. But many researchers and biopharma leaders have been sharply critical of the proposed changes, arguing they could jeopardize U.S. leadership in biomedicine. Read more about the specifics from STAT\u2019s Jonathan Wosen and Daniel Payne.\n$9.8 billion\nThat\u2019s how much our dental costs would be if the rest of the country follows Utah and Florida in banning the addition of fluoride to water, according to a study published Friday in JAMA Health Forum. In five years, the researchers estimated, 7.5% more U.S. children ages 0-19 would get cavities, affecting 25.4 million additional teeth and costing around $9.8 billion. Read more from STAT\u2019s Anil Oza on what the future may hold.\nHow mRNA became a government target\nLast week, HHS confirmed it was canceling a more than $700 million contract with Moderna to develop, test, and license mRNA vaccines for flu strains that could cause future pandemics. It was the latest in a series of moves signaling the administration\u2019s growing disdain for messenger RNA \u2014 a basic building block of biology that was once harnessed by Trump officials to create Covid shots in record time. Now, Republican lawmakers and federal health officials alike are shunning Nobel-winning technology.\nSome of the attacks levied at mRNA are about the technology itself, while others stem from general vaccine skepticism and frustrations with vaccine mandates during the pandemic. But, as the STAT dynamic duo of Lizzy Lawrence and Isabella Cueto report, the impact is the same: Waning political support of mRNA is leading to waning investor support. Some public health experts worry the field will flounder, leaving Americans without vaccines in the event of another pandemic.\nRead more from Lizzy and Isa about the ongoing mRNA war, and what shots might be fired next.\nAnother Covid vaccine approval with restrictions attached\nThe FDA approved Moderna\u2019s new Covid-19 vaccine late Friday, though it placed restrictions on its use that the company\u2019s existing Covid shot, Spikevax, does not currently face.\nJust as it did earlier this month with Novavax\u2019s Covid vaccine, the agency said the new Moderna shot, called mNexspike, is licensed for use only in people aged 65 and older and people aged 12 to 64 who have at least one medical condition that puts them at increased risk of becoming seriously ill if they contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus. (Such conditions include diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or COPD, and obesity.) Spikevax\u2019s license simply allows its use in people aged 12 years and older.\nRead more from STAT\u2019s Helen Branswell on what it means. And if the administration\u2019s strategy on Covid vaccines is confusing to you, check out a story Lizzy wrote Sunday about a television interview with FDA commissioner Marty Makary. But a warning: you may find more contradictions than answers. On CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Makary called the CDC\u2019s independent vaccine advisory panel a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d that \u201crubber-stamps\u201d every vaccine. Later, he cited the panel\u2019s proposed risk-based approach as justification for the administration\u2019s policy changes the past few weeks.\nRethinking the culture of clinical detachment\nKate Solpari spent so much time in hospitals growing up that she invented a game to play during morning rounds: contorting her face into increasingly ridiculous expressions to see which doctors actually looked up from their charts. As she writes in a new First Opinion essay, she was looking for someone who could see both her and her medical condition. There were two doctors who did, and they changed her life.\nIn medicine, there is a belief that emotional distance is essential. This idea is not without merit, Solpari writes. Still, she would like to imagine a medical system that embraces emotional investment as a strength rather than a liability. The two doctors who changed her life \u2014 by both treating her condition and nurturing her independence and curiosity \u2014 serve as inspirations for Solpari now, as she prepares for her first year of medical school.

The law, which was enacted in 2019, was designed to ensure that pharmacy benefit managers maintain access to a large number of pharmacies and do not steer patients to favored outlets, among other things. But a trade group for pharmacy benefit managers filed a challenge and last year, a U.S. appeals court struck down key parts of the law, ruling it was preempted by federal law. The court also decided the Oklahoma law went beyond a similar law in Arkansas, which reins in pharmacy benefit managers by governing reimbursement rates paid to pharmacies. Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready petitioned the Supreme Court to review the appeals court decision, but the solicitor general agreed with the appeals court on three provisions of the state law that the trade group had challenged.\nCVS and Express Scripts filed separate lawsuits seeking to overturn an Arkansas state law set to go into effect next year that would ban pharmacy benefit managers from owning pharmacies, Reuters reports. The lawsuits (here is one and here is the other) claims the law puts an unconstitutional restriction on interstate commerce by burdening out-of-state companies. The companies, which are among the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit managers, both seek a declaration that the law is unconstitutional and an order barring its enforcement. The first-in-the-nation law, which goes into effect in January, prohibits pharmacy benefit managers from operating both retail and mail-order pharmacies, a move designed to eliminate a conflict of interest that has been blamed for boosting the price of medicines and forcing independent pharmacies to close. At issue is an ongoing concern that the largest pharmacy benefit managers \u2014 which are controlled by CVS Health, Cigna, and UnitedHealth Group \u2014 favor their own pharmacy operations. Critics say that by doing so, these companies not only dominate the design of health plans for tens of millions of Americans, but also distort the distribution and pricing for prescription medicines.\nThis article is exclusive to STAT+ subscribers\nUnlock this article \u2014 plus in-depth analysis, newsletters, premium events, and news alerts.\nAlready have an account?

        "Content": "Hello, everyone, and how are you today? We are doing just fine, thank you, especially since the middle of the week is already upon us. After all, we have made it this far so we have decided to hang on for another couple of days. And why not? Given the likely alternatives, this seems to be a reasonable decision.

But now, the time has come to get cracking. Here are a few items of interest to help you get started. We hope you have a lovely day, and do keep in touch. Feedback, tips, and suggestions are always welcome. \u2026\nAmid ongoing controversy over pharmaceutical advertising, one lawmaker wants to know how the U.S. government will enforce regulations after the Food and Drug Administration let go numerous employees from the office that oversees prescription drug promotions, STAT writes. In a May 27 letter to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) noted that four key leaders of the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion recently departed, and the entire Division of Promotion Policy, Research, and Operations \u2014 a unit within the office that developed guidance on pharmaceutical advertising \u2014 also was reportedly laid off. Durbin noted that, about one month ago, Makary said on the Megyn Kelly Show that the FDA is \u201clooking at the information in those ads. Is it complete and informative? So we\u2019re taking a hard look at that\u2026 We don\u2019t have any plans to ban direct-to-consumer advertising, but there are some thing we can do to make sure that the information being presented \u2026 in those ads \u2026 is a complete picture.\u201d\nDrug developers are not expected to come back to the U.S. equity markets in full force until next year \u2014 lagging other industries as biotechnology has delivered only subpar investor returns, Bloomberg News tells us. Only five biotech companies raising more than $50 million have gone public so far this year, following last year\u2019s already stunted number of 18 initial public offerings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The debuts are far from the frenzy of activity during the pandemic when roughly 150 companies from the sector went public over a two-year stretch starting in 2020. The last biotech IPO of note was the $98 million debut of Aardvark Therapeutics, which is focused on obesity, in mid-February. Its share performance is indicative of how new listings in the sector have been underwhelming compared to the overall market. The stock is down over a third from its $16 debut price.\nThis article is exclusive to STAT+ subscribers\nUnlock this article \u2014 plus in-depth analysis, newsletters, premium events, and news alerts.\nAlready have an account?

        "Summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he has unilaterally struck the recommendation that healthy children and healthy pregnant people get Covid booster shots.",
        "Content": "Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday that he has unilaterally struck the recommendation that healthy children and healthy pregnant people get Covid-19 shots \u2014 a move that experts say is unprecedented.\nKennedy made the announcement on the social media site X, flanked by Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Marty Makary, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Kennedy signed a directive outlining the change \u2014 a document STAT has viewed \u2014 on May 19. It\u2019s not clear why he waited over a week to announce it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s common sense, and it\u2019s good science,\u201d said Bhattacharya, whose agency has no involvement in the regulation of vaccines, or in decisions on who should get them. Kennedy cited no new evidence to support the decision to rescind the recommendations, nor did he indicate why he circumvented the normal procedure for vaccine recommendations.\nAbsent from the video was anyone from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which sets policy for who should get approved vaccines based on the advice of its expert panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The CDC is currently without an acting director.\nSeveral sources have told STAT neither the CDC nor the ACIP was consulted on or alerted to the announcement before the video announcement was posted to Kennedy\u2019s X account.\nAs of Tuesday evening, the CDC\u2019s website still listed Covid vaccines in the pediatric vaccination schedule, the instructions for health care providers of which vaccines children and pregnant people ought to get, and at which time.\n\u201cBased on a review of the recommendation of the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I have determined that the known risks associated with the use of Covid-19 vaccines in healthy U.S. children ages six months to 17 years do not outweigh the purported benefits of the vaccine,\u201d the directive states. \u201cAccordingly the HHS Secretarial Directives ratifying the CDC recommendations for use of Covid-19 vaccines for children ages six months to 17 years and (sic) are rescinded.\u201d\nThe directive further states the decision to rescind the recommendation for use of the vaccine in pregnant people was based on advice from the FDA, suggesting there is a lack of \u201chigh-quality data demonstrating safety of the mRNA vaccines during pregnancy combined with the uncertainty of the benefits of vaccination pose potential risks to the mother and the developing baby.\u201d\nThe FDA\u2019s advice did not result from consultation with the agency\u2019s expert vaccine panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which was not asked to advise on this issue when it met last week.\nThe CDC hasn\u2019t published any information on RFK Jr.\u2019s changes, including what conditions would make a pregnant person or child healthy or unhealthy.\nIt is extraordinary that a health secretary would remove vaccines from a CDC vaccination schedule without undergoing a consultation process, and without asking the advice of the ACIP, said Dorit Reiss, a law professor at UC Law San Francisco who follows vaccination policy closely.\n\u201cThere is a process and it hasn\u2019t been followed,\u201d Reiss told STAT in an interview. She suggested the lack of process could make the decision vulnerable to being overturned, if it is challenged in court, a view shared by Richard Hughes, an expert on vaccines policy law at the firm Epstein Becker Green. A court would demand that such a change in policy was the result of a deliberative process, Reiss said.\n\u201cAdministrative decisions actually have to be made on the basis of something, not just because the agency feels like it,\u201d Reiss said. \u201cA one-minute video on Twitter is not a thorough explanation.\u201d\nKathryn Edwards, a vaccines expert who is a former member of the ACIP and a professor emeritus at Vanderbilt University, was also critical of Kennedy\u2019s move. \u201cHe\u2019s overstepped his bounds,\u201d she said.\nReiss noted that in a New England Journal of Medicine article last week announcing a new approach to use of Covid booster shots, Makary and Vinay Prasad, who oversees the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, listed pregnancy as one of the medical conditions that warrants Covid vaccination.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists expressed dismay about the policy announcement, saying it will put pregnant people and their babies at increased risk from Covid.\n\u201cIt is very clear that Covid infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cThe Covid vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants.\u201d\nThe organization cited CDC data that showed in 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, the vast majority of babies who were hospitalized for Covid infection had been born to unvaccinated mothers.\n\u201cFollowing this announcement, we are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit,\u201d ACOG said. \u201cWe are concerned about access implications, and what this recommendation will mean for insurance coverage of the Covid vaccine for those who do choose to get vaccinated during pregnancy.\u201d\nKennedy\u2019s decision to remove booster shots from the schedule of recommended vaccines does not make them entirely unavailable, but it could affect whether insurers cover them. Under the Affordable Care Act, most health plans have to cover vaccines recommended by ACIP at no cost to patients. This included the Covid vaccines.\nSome insurers may decide not to cover Covid vaccines for pregnant women and children, Reiss said, suggesting the result will likely be a patchwork, with some insurance companies retaining coverage and others dropping it.\nIf a person has to pay out of pocket for a Covid booster, the price tag is steep, especially for young children. The pharmacy chain CVS charges $198.99 per dose. When young children who have never been vaccinated against Covid get their primary series, they must get two doses, if they are getting the Moderna vaccine, and three doses, if they are getting the Pfizer shot.\nReiss also said that even for parents who want to vaccinate their children, and pregnant people who want to get boosters, there may be confusion on the part of health professionals who give vaccines as to whether vaccination is permitted.\nMichael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, noted that Kennedy\u2019s decision is in contradiction to a promise he made during his Senate confirmation process that he would not take vaccines away from people who want them.\nThe decision comes at a time when the ACIP has been in the process of reviewing who should get Covid vaccines. A subcommittee of the group that focuses on Covid vaccination policy indicated last month that it intends to recommend that the current universal vaccination recommendation be replaced with one that urges people at high risk of severe illness if they contract Covid to continue to be vaccinated. The full committee is expected to vote on the proposed change when it meets in late June.\n\u201cIt seems like an end run around the normal process, around the normal transparency where you get outside expert input, and perhaps also around the scientists and the agency as we don\u2019t hear anything of what the reasoning was for this decision,\u201d said Jesse Goodman, a former FDA chief scientist who is now director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship. \u201cAll the existing data shows that these vaccines can help protect children and they can help protect pregnant women and they can help protect even infants after they\u2019re born if pregnant women are vaccinated. So I\u2019m pretty taken aback by this.\u201d\nA vaccine researcher who has served on ACIP but who asked not to be named said Kennedy\u2019s move to pre-empt the committee\u2019s vote on the issue was a violation of the pledge he made during his Senate confirmation hearing not to interfere with the ACIP.\n\u201cKennedy promised that ACIP would be left alone. Updating the schedule of recommended vaccines without ACIP advice breaks the pledge completely. RFK is making a fool out of Senator [Bill] Cassidy,\u201d the individual said, referring to the Republican senator \u2014 a pro-vaccines physician \u2014 who extracted a series of promises from Kennedy in exchange for supporting his nomination.\nIn a break from precedent, The American Academy of Pediatrics was not consulted on the decision, according to Sean O\u2019Leary, who chairs its committee on infectious diseases. Normally the AAP aligns its recommendations with ACIP, but \u201cnow that HHS has made this decision, we may have to rethink how we harmonize with the federal government,\u201d he said.\nHe added: \u201cACIP goes through all the data, makes evidence-based decisions based on the data they use, what\u2019s called the evidence to recommendations framework. This recommendation essentially completely ignores that.\u201d\nThough final details of the recommendation the ACIP will vote on haven\u2019t yet been made public, it appears the Covid vaccine subcommittee will suggest that people over age 65; people at high risk because of medical conditions \u2014 including pregnant people; and very young children should still be urged to be vaccinated. It is likely the new recommendation \u2014 if approved by the full committee and the CDC director \u2014 would stipulate that other people could be vaccinated against Covid if they wish.\nThis story has been updated with a directive from Kennedy ordering the change in recommendations.\nAnil Oza and Bob Herman contributed reporting.",

        "Summary": "\u201cIn trying to lead before the system could follow, 23andMe outpaced the very guardrails that might have legitimized it\u201d: A former 23andMe employee offers three pieces of advice to the&#8230;",
        "Content": "My first week at 23andMe, the Wall Street Journal declared the company was worth \u201cnearly $0.\u201d By the time I left, a little more than a year later, the company had filed for bankruptcy.\nAs a board-certified genetic counselor, I believe that genetic information can empower healthier decisions. I joined 23andMe because I believed in the company\u2019s mission: giving people access to their genetic information. I still do. But belief alone couldn\u2019t save 23andMe, and only time will tell if 23andMe\u2019s bankruptcy is a harbinger of consumer genomics\u2019 death altogether.\nOn May 20, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals \u2014 a U.S.-based biotechnology company best known for drugs like Dupixent and Eylea \u2014 was approved as the lead bidder to acquire substantially all of 23andMe\u2019s assets, including its vast database of de-identified genetic and survey data from roughly 12 million customers. A backup bidder \u2014 TTAM Research Institute, a new entity led by 23andMe co-founder and former CEO Anne Wojcicki \u2014 remains on standby. Until the deal closes later this year, the future of this data remains uncertain.\nFor those of us who believed in the promise of consumer genomics, it\u2019s a sobering moment.\nThe approval of Regeneron to acquire 23andMe\u2019s assets offers a chance to reflect on what went wrong, and what we need to get right in the future. Here are three critical things I hope future leaders in this space will take to heart.\n1. 23andMe was never meant to be HIPAA-compliant\nMany observers have pointed out 23andMe\u2019s HIPAA status \u2014specifically, its lack thereof \u2014 as a potential threat to customer privacy. But they often failed to note something key: 23andMe was not a HIPAA-covered entity by design. HIPAA applies only to traditional health care entities like hospitals and insurers, not consumer platforms within the internet economy. HIPAA doesn\u2019t apply to 23andMe in the same way FCC broadcasting rules don\u2019t apply to Netflix. As a 23andMe consumer, you have access to your personal genetic information without HIPAA regulations dictating the experience.\nHIPAA allows broad internal data sharing across connected health care entities. As a patient, I can\u2019t prevent my dermatologist from seeing my gynecology notes and lab results in their full form, without anonymity. That\u2019s helpful for care coordination, but not always ideal for privacy.\nBy contrast, 23andMe users have full control over who sees their identifiable results. You could use a pseudonym. You could choose whether to share your results with your doctor. You could delete your account. Becoming HIPAA-compliant would have required 23andMe to overhaul its infrastructure and business model, likely increasing costs and reducing access. Paradoxically, HIPAA compliance may have meant less privacy and autonomy for users.\nHIPAA sets a privacy floor, not a ceiling. Unfortunately, data within HIPAA-covered entities can also be hacked. In my view, 23andMe\u2019s downfall wasn\u2019t due to the company not being a HIPAA-covered entity. Instead, we all placed too much trust in the combination of cybersecurity practices, privacy policies, and consumer privacy laws.\n2. The company underestimated the importance of deep, sustained partnerships with clinicians\n23andMe revolutionized access to personal health data. But it underestimated how much buy-in it would need from health care providers. Instead of consistently integrating meaningful clinical collaborations within its growth strategy, the company prioritized rapid consumer expansion and research/biopharma partnerships. The company had brilliant internal advocates for clinician education and engagement, but their efforts were often sidelined in favor of higher-growth initiatives. This left both consumers and clinicians with a persistent knowledge gap.\nIn my decade of genetic counseling experience, the overwhelming sentiment from my peers toward 23andMe was frustration. Genetic counselors consistently found themselves correcting patients\u2019 misperceptions: They believed they\u2019d had a comprehensive, diagnostic genetic test, rather than the population health screening test that is the 23andMe Personal Genome Service. And while genetic counselors understood 23andMe\u2019s limitations, many non-genetics providers didn\u2019t know its benefits. At medical conferences, I spoke with countless doctors and nurse practitioners who were shocked to learn that 23andMe even offered FDA-authorized health reports. Most were only aware of 23andMe\u2019s ancestry testing.\nWhat the company missed is that public health information, even when consumer-generated, can\u2019t be implemented properly without broad clinician buy-in. That\u2019s true with genomics, too. Patients turn to their primary care provider when deciding whether to test, and how to act on results. A successful consumer genomics company will need to bridge that gap.\n3. The fall of 23andMe reveals a fault line in how we define, govern, and trust health information in the modern world\n23andMe didn\u2019t fail because people just stopped caring about their DNA.\nTo be clear, the company needed a better recurring revenue strategy. A one-and-done business model was never going to be sustainable. Consumer health platforms must continually attract new users while keeping existing ones engaged with meaningful, high-touch services. Periodic health and wellness reports weren\u2019t enough to compete with platforms like Apple Fitness, Oura, or Noom, which drive daily use through personalized biometric feedback.\n23andMe launched a new category before the infrastructure existed to support it. Most clinicians lacked the genomic training to incorporate results into patient care. Regulatory frameworks hadn\u2019t yet adapted to direct-to-consumer testing. And consumers had only limited access to genetic counselors \u2014 the very professionals trained to help interpret genetic test results and apply them responsibly.\nWhile 23andMe hired genetic counselors to help design its product and scale delivery ethically, the broader clinical community remained skeptical that consumers could meaningfully engage with genetic insights outside traditional care settings. This created a flywheel of friction: Clinician skepticism slowed adoption, limiting integration, which in turn reinforced 23andMe\u2019s outsider status in health care. Meanwhile, the company faced Silicon Valley\u2019s relentless pressure to grow \u2014 delivering more insights, more frequently, in a digital health landscape that rewards speed, scale, and novelty over caution. In trying to lead before the system could follow, 23andMe outpaced the very guardrails that might have legitimized it.\nThe real lesson here is bigger than any one company. We\u2019re living in a world where health data flows through phones, wearables, and consumer platforms \u2014 often outside the scope of traditional laws. Companies like 23andMe force us to ask: Who owns health data? Who uses it? And what happens when platforms collapse?\nRecent news has made these questions more urgent. The federal government has launched new initiatives to collect lab and genomic data from veterans and indigenous patients, with low-income, elderly, and disabled Americans as near-term additional targets. At the same time, protections like those within the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) could plausibly face political scrutiny as part of a broader effort to deregulate health care, dismantle administrative agencies, or minimize federal oversight. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a world in which de-identified genetic data is combined with behavioral analytics to shape insurance access, voter targeting, or public surveillance.\nWhat comes next may not resemble 23andMe at all. Regeneron may choose to preserve the consumer-facing product, but it could just as easily shutter it in favor of leveraging the existing database to accelerate drug development. That\u2019s not inherently unethical, but it raises questions about consent, equitable access, and who benefits from decades of consumer contributions. Will drugs built on this data be affordable? Will they serve the populations who provided the data in the first place?\nThe connections between biotech leaders also deserve examination. Dr. Huda Zoghbi, a renowned geneticist, sits on Regeneron\u2019s Board of Directors and also chairs the Board of the Breakthrough Prize \u2014 a science prize co-founded by Anne Wojcicki and Mark Zuckerberg, among others. These circles are small, and as the lines between private capital, public trust, and scientific authority blur, oversight matters more than ever.\nWe need a better framework for the future of health data \u2014 one that extends beyond HIPAA, centers informed consent, and enforces public accountability even when platforms collapse. We need transparency about how that data is used. And we need public oversight of platforms that traffic in health information, even if they don\u2019t call themselves health care providers.\n23andMe didn\u2019t get everything right. But its collapse shouldn\u2019t mean we completely abandon consumer genomics. It should be our reason to rebuild it, better.\nKatie Sagaser, M.S., is a licensed, certified genetic counselor who has worked across clinical, start-up, and industry settings to expand access to innovative genomic technologies.

        "Summary": "'Big, beautiful bill' would result in 10.9 million people losing health insurance, primarily Medicaid.",
        "Content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans\u2019 tax bill would lead to nearly 11 million people losing health insurance, providing a key source of savings to help finance President Trump\u2019s tax cuts, according to projections that nonpartisan congressional scorekeepers published Wednesday.\nThe official projections from the Congressional Budget Office give Democrats ammunition to attack Republicans for taking insurance from low-income voters to pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich. Most Republicans say the bill only takes insurance from those without jobs who are able to work and that pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, and frail older adults will not be affected.\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), for example, said the CBO score shows the \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d of the bill.\nOverall, the bill increases the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over a decade, thanks to its extension of Trump\u2019s tax cuts and the enactment of new ones. Extending lower tax rates alone costs $2.2 trillion over a decade, for example. The bill includes cuts to federal spending on health coverage of more than $1 trillion.\nAbout 7.8 million people would lose Medicaid coverage, while much of the rest of the losses would stem from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges. Among those losing coverage would be 1.4 million immigrants and others who don\u2019t have, or can\u2019t prove, a legal status that would give them access to insurance. The bill imposes new restrictions on health insurance targeted at states that use their own funds to cover undocumented immigrants.\nHospitals, which are in an especially vulnerable position, will use the CBO projections to fight for changes in the Senate that curb enrollment losses.\nTaken together, the estimates show that the bill could represent the largest cuts to federal health care programs in history. The CBO report doesn\u2019t account for another looming change to health care: enhanced premium tax credits that help people buy ACA coverage are set to expire at the end of the year. The bill does not renew them. The Trump administration has separately estimated that 4.4 million would lose coverage without the tax credits.\nSenators will no doubt make changes to the House bill, and some are worried about Medicaid cuts, though the bill\u2019s imposition of work requirements remains popular even among those with concerns. They are not expected to write a new bill from scratch, due to time constraints. Republicans aim to pass the bill before July 4, but the real deadline might be when the government reaches its borrowing limit, expected sometime around August.\nThe health care portions of the bill can be placed in two big buckets: Medicaid cuts and reforms to the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\nThe addition of work requirements to the Medicaid program is responsible for about $344 billion of the savings in the bill, the most of any health care provision. The bill would require people up to age 64 who are without dependents or disabilities to work at least 80 hours a month in order to keep coverage. They would need to document twice a year that they\u2019re working. They could also maintain coverage if they perform community service or are enrolled in educational programs.\nThat savings figure is up from earlier estimates because Republicans decided to start the work requirements earlier, by Dec. 31, 2026. When the CBO had last scored that provision, the measure took effect in 2029, after the next presidential election. Even still, Medicaid enrollees probably would not have to deal with work requirements until after the midterms.\nThe CBO had done preliminary \u201cscores\u201d of the bill, which projected the budget impact of measures and their effect on enrollment. But the CBO didn\u2019t have time to analyze measures that were added last minute, and they hadn\u2019t yet accounted for how pieces of the bill interact.\nTwo measures aimed at curbing states\u2019 ability to increase federal funding of their Medicaid programs would together save $162 billion. The measures include new limits on states\u2019 provider taxes and on state-directed payment programs.\nThe bill would also save $145.7 billion through limits on Medicaid enrollment flexibilities, including delaying a rule to streamline enrollment and requiring the eligibility of expansion enrollees to be re-evaluated more frequently.\nIn a smaller bucket, the bill includes reforms to drug middlemen, which amount to $640 million in government savings. It would limit how pharmacy benefit managers can receive money from drugmakers, impose transparency requirements, and prevent spread pricing in Medicaid.\nThe bill also would boost payments to doctors by $8.9 billion over a decade by partially basing their Medicare payment rates on medical inflation. A measure to expand the exemption from Medicare price negotiation to orphan drugs with multiple indications would increase spending $4.9 billion. There\u2019s also a provision pausing a Biden-era rule, unpopular among Republicans, to require staffing levels at nursing homes that the CBO estimates would save $23 billion over 10 years.\nChelsea Cirruzzo contributed reporting.\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the savings attributed to changes to pharmacy benefit managers.",

        "Content": "Chronic disease isn\u2019t going away, but a national center devoted to its prevention may be, a prospect that is alarming agency insiders and public health officials across the country.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 budget for 2026, released Friday, proposed $14 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the chronic disease epidemic, but it would also abolish the CDC\u2019s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.\n\u201cIf this center is eliminated, state and local departments lose core prevention funds. And they lose the workforce for schools, chronic disease prevention, data collection, surveillance systems,\u201d a senior official at the CDC chronic disease center told STAT on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \u201cIf folks care about kids, schools rely on this.\u201d\nFederal health leaders want to fold the chronic disease center into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity within HHS that will also bring other centers under its umbrella: the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The proposal asserts these moves will strengthen the response to chronic illness.\n\u201cAHA will administer $14.0 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the chronic disease epidemic,\u201d the proposal reads. \u201cIt will prioritize prevention \u2014 a missing piece in the American health system \u2014 primary care, maternal and child health, mental health, substance use prevention and treatment, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, workforce development, and policy, research, and oversight.\u201d\nThat leaves the current chronic disease center in limbo, its budget diminished, its workforce disbanded by layoffs contested in court, and its location to be determined as its surviving programs are scattered. The president\u2019s funding requests tend to undergo big changes before Congress passes a budget, but for now, public health experts are expressing puzzlement about how this proposal might harmonize with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s Make America Healthy Again agenda.\n\u201cIt looks pretty devastating for chronic disease when they\u2019re saying that they\u2019re really interested in prioritizing chronic disease,\u201d Philip Huang, a physician and director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, told STAT. \u201cAnd then that MAHA report that came out \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a very limited agenda that they\u2019re talking about in terms of how to address chronic disease.\u201d\nMoving prevention to AHA may give rise to more problems than it solves, Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told STAT. Part of that is uncertainty about which programs may survive.\n\u201cThat other agency does not exist right now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not just shifting the work. That would be something that has to get built up. So we\u2019re losing the people who do the work right now. We don\u2019t really know where the programs would pop up again when, and who will do the work.\u201d\nA spokesperson from HHS defended the decision, saying complex, duplicative health programs have led to fragmented efforts that dilute taxpayer resources and their impact on Americans. Some CDC programs will continue under AHA, the message emailed Tuesday also said, adding, \u201cWe must end this wasteful and inefficient model of health programming in favor of strategic, coordinated approaches. The creation of AHA does not eliminate priorities or functions; instead, it unites previously independent programs to work together to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d\nNot visible on the AHA agenda: the CDC\u2019s program to encourage smoking cessation, which has already fallen to the budget ax, a decision that makes no sense to Huang, who, years ago in his role as chronic disease director for Texas, traveled the state to urge restaurants to go smoke-free.\n\u201cFor them to have eliminated the Office on Smoking and Health is absolutely insane if you say you\u2019re trying to address chronic disease,\u201d he said. Among preventable causes of chronic disease, \u201ctobacco is the most blatant.\u201d\nThe CDC official also called smoking cessation one of public health\u2019s most effective interventions, \u201clike smallpox elimination for chronic disease.\u201d\nA new generation of young people, exposed to pitches selling e-cigarettes and tobacco pouches, might hear messages only from advertisers and not campaigns foundational to preventing heart disease, stroke, and cancer, the CDC official added.\nHuang was struck by Kennedy\u2019s answer when asked to name the leading preventable cause of death among Americans.\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s saying are the primary drivers of chronic disease are ultra-processed foods, environmental toxins, technology, and medications, including vaccines,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThey may be factors, but we know a lot of what causes these chronic diseases. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of disease, and he couldn\u2019t even identify that during his hearing.\u201d\nConservative voices have been calling for the CDC to return to its roots, narrowing its scope to infectious diseases like the one that inspired its creation and its location in the southeastern United States: malaria.\nSince its founding in 1946, the CDC\u2019s expertise and activities have grown deeper and wider, as the \u201cprevention\u201d in its name implies, to include a multitude of diseases, studying their origin, treatment, prevention, and prevalence. The agency\u2019s knowledge, standards, and investigations are shared around the world and in all U.S. states and territories.\nThe list of noncommunicable diseases is long, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, maternal mortality, obesity, mental illness, epilepsy, and dementia. So is the tally of causes in addition to tobacco: high blood pressure, unhealthy diet, limited physical activity, poor access to cancer screening.\nIf the CDC\u2019s footprint shrinks to communicable disease outbreaks, the chronic disease center\u2019s program will be splintered. The pain would be felt far from headquarters in Atlanta, the CDC official said. That\u2019s because 80% of the dollars funding the center at CDC now flow to state, territorial, and local health departments.\n\u201cPrevention as a whole is being deprioritized, so that will put pressure on clinics in the health care delivery system to do what they\u2019re not doing now: prevention outside the clinic, in neighborhoods, to prevent heart disease, diabetes, cancer.\u201d\nThe budget plan would provide $500 million \u201cto tackle priority activities to Make America Healthy Again,\u201d of which $260 million would fight chronic illness by addressing nutrition and environmental impacts.\nThat would include $119 million for a new Prevention Innovation Program, which the proposal said would improve the health of Americans through reliable broadband technology integration, \u201censuring access to nutrition services and physical activity venues, and reducing dependence on medication.\u201d\nA May 22 letter from 29 U.S. senators in response to President Trump\u2019s budget proposal urged lawmakers to protect robust funding for the CDC as a whole while singling out its chronic disease center.\n\u201cThe elimination of the CDC\u2019s chronic disease prevention office also contradicts the Administration\u2019s stated goal of addressing the chronic disease epidemic in our country,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThese cuts will not make Americans healthy.\u201d\nOne of the national center\u2019s major roles is to provide the comprehensive data collection and analysis to public health departments across the country, a division of labor that allows small staffs to do more.\nJason Orcena, public health commissioner for Union County, Ohio, said there\u2019s a valuable synergy between the CDC and his office, which serves 70,000 people in a county that includes both suburban and rural areas with differing health needs.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a heavy reliance on those national surveillance tools to help frame the work we do locally as part of our local community health assessments and community health improvement plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things the center and CDC in general does and the state does as well. We rely on them through that economy of scale to have truly experts in these areas because I can\u2019t afford to have someone be an expert in all things.\u201d\nAsked what disease or condition concerns him the most, Orcena said, \u201cthe one I don\u2019t know about yet.\u201d\nGeorges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, pointed out that there are 3,300 departments across the country, some with hundreds of employees and some with just two.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the gap filler for people to make sure that even within the traditional medical system, things don\u2019t fall through the cracks,\u201d he said about individual public health systems. \u201cIf you start seeing a new cancer developing, that\u2019s going to be picked up by the chronic disease center.\u201d\nCase in point: HIV was initially recognized after a rare cancer related to the infection began showing up in men who had sex with men, later linked to the disease that became an epidemic.\n\u201cThis is the division that\u2019s going to figure that out. It\u2019s not NIH,\u201d Benjamin said about the chronic disease center at CDC.\nAt the state and local level, public health officials are facing confusing messages on funding for individual projects. Earlier this year they weathered the loss of money to pay for Covid-19 programs, many of which had pivoted to cover health needs beyond Covid.\nBecause chronic disease has long been underfunded and underappreciated, partnerships between local health departments and a national system is crucial, NACCHO\u2019s Casalotti said.\n\u201cBringing all these parts together could move us towards a place so we can focus more on these diseases,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, what they\u2019re seeing and experiencing is actually pulling back from this work, not necessarily pushing it forward. And so I think that\u2019s where the field needs to go: We need to be pushing forward together.\u201d\nSTAT\u2019s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

        "Summary": "During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised that he would not interfere with established immunization schedules. His recent actions say otherwise.",
        "Content": "As health lawyers with a combined 70 years in the field \u2014 one of us served on the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices while the other served as an executive of a major pharmaceutical company during the Covid pandemic \u2014 we understand the boundaries of our expertise. We wouldn\u2019t attempt to construe vaccine science or dissuade patients from making vaccination decisions in consultation with their health care professionals. Nor would we be the right people to undertake the type of deep scientific review that lies at the heart of immunization policy development. To put it mildly, most lawyers (us included) are not public health experts, and we would never pretend we were.\nThis is precisely why Health and Human Services Secretary (and longtime lawyer) Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s recent actions around the Covid vaccine are such a matter of concern. Flanked by his National Institutes of Health director and Food and Drug Administration commissioner in a bizarre video that notably excluded CDC immunization experts, he declared that pregnant women and children should not be vaccinated against Covid-19. This statement came just a week after he told members of Congress they shouldn\u2019t listen to him for medical advice. We agree.\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised that he would not interfere with established immunization schedules. Yet in a matter of days, he has lurched from refusing to recommend vaccinating against measles to, without evidence, attempting to alter the national vaccine schedule for pregnant women, babies, and children. These are the very parts of the U.S. population whose health and well-being are perhaps uppermost in the mind of public health and for whom evidence-based decision-making is of the utmost policy importance.\nFor more than six decades, HHS secretaries have relied on the CDC and its ACIP advisory body to make scientific recommendations regarding national immunization policy. So established is this reliance that Congress has empowered the ACIP, under CDC direction, to make the evidence-based recommendations on which health insurers and state Medicaid and CHIP programs must rely when it comes to coverage of immunizations without cost sharing. The work of the CDC and ACIP has been indispensable to U.S. immunization policy; indeed, during the two pandemics that have threatened the population over the past quarter-century, successive presidential administrations, including the first Trump administration, consulted and trusted ACIP and the CDC.\nFor this reason, the secretary\u2019s evidence-free pronouncements without the benefit of the advice and recommendations of his own experts amounts to an act of irrational agency action at its most dangerous, since it could lead to unwarranted declines in immunization, particularly if insurers refuse to pay for vaccinations.\nIt may well be that it is time to carefully reevaluate the evidence regarding the use of Covid vaccines in the maternal and child population. It may well be that for these groups, under normal conditions, the routine Covid immunization schedule should change.\nBut whether to remove Covid from the routine immunization schedule for pregnant women and children is such a consequential decision that the notion that this would happen as a result of a sudden pronouncement by the HHS secretary is both absurd and dangerous. This is especially true when the secretary is someone who has made no secret of his anti-vaccine bias and when the individuals he purports to have consulted are not the scientists charged under law with responsibility for advising on vaccination policy.\nSo, we agree: Parents and pregnant women shouldn\u2019t take Kennedy\u2019s medical advice. Neither should insurers.\nSara Rosenbaum is professor emerita at the George Washington University and a former member of the ACIP.

        "Content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it would revoke guidance to the nation\u2019s hospitals that directed them to provide emergency abortions for women when they are necessary to stabilize their medical condition.\nThat guidance was issued to hospitals in 2022, weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court upended national abortion rights in the U.S. It was an effort by the Biden administration to preserve abortion access for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies and needed an abortion to prevent organ loss or severe hemorrhaging, among other serious complications.\nThe Biden administration had argued that hospitals \u2014 including states with near-total bans \u2014 needed to provide emergency abortions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. That law requires emergency rooms that receive Medicare dollars to provide an exam and stabilizing treatment for all patients. Nearly all emergency rooms in the U.S. rely on Medicare funds.\nThe Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it would no longer enforce that policy The move prompted concerns from some doctors and abortion rights advocates that women will not get emergency abortions in states with strict bans.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration would rather women die in emergency rooms than receive life-saving abortions,\u201d Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. \u201cIn pulling back guidance, this administration is feeding the fear and confusion that already exists at hospitals in every state where abortion is banned. Hospitals need more guidance, not less, to stop them from turning away patients experiencing pregnancy crises.\u201d\nAnti-abortion advocates praised the move, however. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the Biden-era policy had been a way to expand abortion access in states where it was banned.\n\u201cDemocrats have created confusion on this fact to justify their extremely unpopular agenda for all-trimester abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cIn situations where every minute counts, their lies lead to delayed care and put women in needless, unacceptable danger.\u201d\nAn Associated Press investigation last year found that, even with the Biden administration\u2019s guidance, dozens of pregnant women were being turned away from emergency rooms, including some who needed emergency abortions.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which investigates hospitals that are not in compliance, said in a statement that it will continue to enforce the federal law that, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d\nBut CMS added that it would also \u201crectify any perceived legal confusion and instability created by the former administration\u2019s actions.\u201d\nThe Biden administration sued Idaho over its abortion law that initially only allowed abortions to save the life of the mother. The federal government had argued before the U.S. Supreme Court last year that Idaho\u2019s law was in conflict with the federal law, which requires stabilizing treatment that prevents a patient\u2019s condition from worsening.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court issued a procedural ruling in the case last year that left key questions unanswered about whether doctors in abortion ban states can terminate pregnancies when a woman is at risk of serious infection, organ loss or hemorrhage.\n\u2014 Amanda Seitz",

        "Summary": "Massachusetts health commissioner Robbie Goldstein says threats to public health funding are being felt nationwide",
        "Content": "Look at Robert Goldstein\u2019s CV, and you\u2019ll see a small catalog of ideas the Trump administration has been working against.\nHe\u2019s an infectious disease specialist; Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said that the government ought to \u201cgive infectious disease a break.\u201d He founded the Massachusetts General Hospital Transgender Health Program; on the day of his second inauguration, Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring the very existence of trans people to be a \u201cgender ideology\u201d based on a \u201cfalse claim.\u201d And since 2021, Goldstein has been working on public health infrastructure \u2014 first, as an adviser to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and then as the commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health \u2014 which the Trump administration has been furiously trying to dismantle.\nThat means living in limbo. Take the $11.4 billion that the Trump administration clawed back from local and state public health departments in March, which had been allocated during the Covid pandemic in 2021 to help shore up the architecture that helps prevent disease. A coalition of 23 states, including Massachusetts, sued, winning first an emergency restraining order that briefly blocked the cuts, and then a court order further protecting that federal funding, such that agencies could, for now, continue programs such as infectious disease monitoring and overdose prevention. But that\u2019s just one example among many. For instance, Goldstein is watching the Republican budget for 2026, which involves shuttering or reorganizing the federal offices that provide grants his agency relies on.\nSome state health officials have publicly toed the Trump party line. \u201cAs the federal government continues to cut waste and enhance efficiency, we are confident these changes will not impact our ability to serve Tennesseans,\u201d the Tennessee Department of Health told STAT in March, when asked about the cutting of Covid-related federal funding.\nTo Goldstein, though, these threats are being felt across the country. \u201cThe needs that this department has are the same as the Texas department\u2019s or the North Dakota department\u2019s,\u201d he said, when he sat down with STAT earlier this spring. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a blue-state issue. It\u2019s not just a red-state issue. It\u2019s not just a purple-state issue. It\u2019s an every-state issue. But as a state health officer of a Democratic-leaning state with a Democratic administration and a Democratic state house and a congressional delegation of all Democrats, it is easier for me to articulate the pain we\u2019re feeling.\u201d\nThis conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nWhat is most challenging about this moment?\nWhat\u2019s most challenging is that the attacks are coming from all angles. We have the potential to lose a large source of funding for state public health \u2014 and we\u2019re seeing funding cuts to other institutions that support public health. Department of Education cuts are just as much public health cuts as they are education cuts. If kids don\u2019t have a school where they have a school nurse, where they have resources available to support mental and physical health, public health is going to have to pick up those pieces. But we\u2019re not getting more money to do that.\nLately, I\u2019ve been describing public health as the safety net of the safety net. When we hear about billions cut from Medicaid or the Department of Transportation or Housing and Urban Development, people are going to look to public health. When you don\u2019t get health care through Medicaid, you are going to turn to community-based organizations that are doing blood pressure monitoring. That\u2019s funded by us. When you don\u2019t have SNAP benefits and you have to go to the food pantry \u2014 that\u2019s funded by DPH. We are holding the whole system. That is what public health does, and we often do it silently. People don\u2019t even know we\u2019re there. But as safety nets begin to break, ours is going to start to weigh down more and more.\nWhere will you feel that strain first?\nWe\u2019re seeing attacks on public health in terms of what is truth. Things that have been bedrock for public health for decades are now being challenged by the federal Secretary of Health and Human Services. Vaccines have been the best public health intervention of the last 100 years. I say that with great respect for the seatbelt and the car seat and labelling on cigarettes. Vaccines have saved more lives. To question the safety and the effectiveness of vaccines in 2025 is challenging 100 years of science. That is devastating, because if you let doubt creep in on something that is so proven, and known to be effective, it can bring doubt into everything else.\nIt all comes back to trust. It is the thing that public health needs to get our work done. Trust is built with knowledge, with science and evidence \u2014 and that\u2019s being attacked by the Trump administration, with NIH grants being canceled and the whole research infrastructure coming down.\nTrust is also built with persistence. The federal government has historically given states the ability to be persistently focused. What we\u2019re having to do now is potentially pulling out of these communities. That will damage trust. People will say, \u201cHow can I believe that you\u2019re going to be there two years from now, why would I trust you on this intervention if in the middle of the last one, you just walked out of our community?\u201d\nIn early April, amid mass layoffs, the Trump administration effectively eliminated both the National Asthma Control Program and the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. Federal officials have said the lead program will continue in a different form, though have not answered questions about how or when that might be up and running. If those cuts stand, how will that affect your department?\nMassachusetts has for five decades supported lead remediation and lead poisoning interventions for children all across the state. That\u2019s in our state statute. We have state funding to do it. I don\u2019t think that whatever happens at the federal level is going to impact the Massachusetts lead program.\nIn other areas, it\u2019s more challenging. Asthma, for example. We receive federal funding for our asthma program. That funding allows us to get into vulnerable communities, to do the necessary education, to link people to care. We don\u2019t have state funding to replace all of that. If that program truly is cut, there will come a time relatively soon where the Massachusetts program will need to pare back on what it\u2019s doing, which means the people of Massachusetts are going to feel the impact.\nIt sounds like Massachusetts has a modicum of protection from these cuts that some states don\u2019t.\nIf you look at our Department of Public Health, we\u2019re a little over 50% funded by the state, and around 40% funded by the federal government. In almost every other state, it\u2019s the reverse, where a larger percentage comes from the federal government, a smaller percentage from their state. And most states are very far in the reverse, like 80% or 70% comes from the federal government, and only 20 or 30% from the state.\nHow is this administration affecting gender-affirming care in Massachusetts now?\nIt\u2019s important for us to reframe this conversation. The Trump administration is making it sound like there are armies of trans kids walking down the streets seeking gender-affirming care. Even here in Massachusetts, where we\u2019ve got a very welcoming environment, we\u2019re talking about a couple of thousand kids across a state of 7 million people. This is not the enormous issue that the Trump administration is trying to make it out to be. This is about patients and providers having a conversation about what is right for the patient, and bringing evidence-based interventions into the clinical space.\nWe are anticipating what the next move would be, but we don\u2019t have to change anything at the moment, because right now, it is legal for every provider to provide gender-affirming care to the adolescent or child who walks in. We want to make sure people know that. Very early on in the second Trump administration, I sat in front of the CEOs of all of the hospitals across Massachusetts, and made it very clear: Keep your doors open. Continue to provide this care. Call us if you\u2019re seeing any issues. Our message is, continue to provide the care that we know is life saving and is necessary for these kids.\nDo you think the fear in some marginalized communities \u2014 fear of immigration enforcement, for instance, or of attacks on trans care \u2014 will affect infectious disease surveillance and treatment?\nIt\u2019s going to be hard to tease out the root causes of changes. We\u2019re likely to see funding cuts in HIV and STI monitoring, and that\u2019s going to have real impacts. We also should be realistic: At least here in Massachusetts, a lot of new HIV and tuberculosis diagnoses are in people who were born in other countries. The rhetoric of the Trump administration is going to prevent those folks from coming into a site of care because they may be worried about ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] or they may be worried about how information will be documented and shared with the federal government. That\u2019s going to have impacts on our ability to identify, treat, and prevent cases.\nHow will you prioritize what to fund, given the potential cuts?\nThat\u2019s a really tough and complicated decision. What\u2019s more important, lead screening and prevention or HIV case management or a school-based health program that addresses suicidal ideation in adolescents? I don\u2019t know the answer to that. But at some point, those are the types of decisions we\u2019re going to have to make if funding gets pulled.",

        "Summary": "Experts on eating disorders like anorexia worry that research funding cuts mean patients won't get the care they need.",
        "Content": "In the first major report from the president\u2019s Make America Healthy Again Commission, disordered eating is mentioned just once, in passing, in connection with the benefits of family meals. Amid dozens of references to obesity and a major focus on what foods American children consume, there are zero mentions of specific conditions like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder.\nIt\u2019s a notable omission in a document purporting to explain how today\u2019s children are the \u201csickest generation.\u201d Eating disorders have been on the rise for decades, especially among young women and girls. And they can be deadly \u2014 a recently published analysis found that people with anorexia are at five times higher risk of death than the general population. Adolescents with other chronic conditions are at particularly high risk of developing eating disorders, and of dying from them if they do.\nWhile the Trump administration has repeatedly pledged to combat chronic disease, scientific research on eating disorders is being disproportionately affected by ongoing federal grant terminations, according to experts in the field. Researchers and clinicians fear that patients will be left struggling if this work to improve existing care slows or falters.\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely worried that we\u2019re just going to continue with the status quo now, where some people get better and most don\u2019t,\u201d said Cheri Levinson, director of the EAT Lab at the University of Louisville Kentucky, where nearly $300,000 in NIH grants were recently terminated.\nBy late April, at least seven eating disorder grants had been terminated by the National Institutes of Health, totaling almost $2.7 million in forfeited funds, according to a team at Harvard\u2019s Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders (STRIPED) that\u2019s been tracking the lost funding. It\u2019s unclear how many more grants have likely been cut since then. The team has yet to comb through data on grants terminated from the National Science Foundation or those from targeted universities.\nThese losses are a small portion of the $9.5 billion in grants across science that have been cut. But a few million dollars could make up a large chunk of all eating disorder research in the U.S., said Ariel Beccia, a post-doc on the Harvard team.\n\u201cThe impact is always going to be felt more when there isn\u2019t as much money to go around in the first place,\u201d said Christine Peat, a licensed psychologist and president of the Eating Disorder Coalition. \u201cThe pool is just shallow.\u201d\nWhen asked about the scant references to eating disorders in the MAHA report, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard wrote in a statement to STAT that the report \u201canalyzes key drivers of the childhood chronic disease crisis \u2014 including poor diet.\u201d She added, \u201cSecretary Kennedy believes this report provides the framework for reversing the many preventable illnesses \u2014 including eating disorders \u2014 plaguing America\u2019s children.\u201d\nEating disorder research has always been underfunded \u2014 about $55 million in NIH categorical grants went to eating disorder research in 2023, according to the agency website. That encompasses everything from investigating biological underpinnings, tracking epidemiology, and testing new treatments for anorexia, bulimia, binge-eating, and other eating disorders. The grants also included studies on obesity and weight loss.\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly why so many eating disorder grants have been caught up in the Trump administration\u2019s cuts. Beccia\u2019s study focused on eating disorders during the pandemic, so she suspects she was part of the wave of terminated Covid-19 research. (And now she and her colleagues are caught up in the Trump administration\u2019s blitz on Harvard.) Many studies focused on marginalized populations that are at higher risk for eating disorders, including LGBTQ+ communities and people of color.\n\u201cThe field, rightly so, in recent years has really pushed to have a focus on the non-stereotypical eating disorder presentation,\u201d said Peat.\nBut expanding research populations is not just about inclusivity or diversity, said Tiffany Brown, the principal investigator at Auburn University\u2019s Appearance Concerns, Eating, Prevention & Treatment (ACCEPT) Lab. Focusing research on small, specific communities can help experts to better understand how treatment can be more personalized \u2014 something that is desperately needed for patients with eating disorders.\nExisting treatments, usually based in cognitive behavioral therapy, are only modestly effective. High proportions of patients drop out of both inpatient and outpatient care, and rates of remission (which does not have one set definition) range between 40% and 60% for anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating disorder.\nLevinson and her team are working on a new approach to treatment that uses machine learning and patients\u2019 symptom data to predict what methods might work best. \u201cWe\u2019re doing what people would do in community-based care, but we\u2019re doing it in a way that is informed by data, so we\u2019re actually hitting the right targets,\u201d Levinson said. Factors like worry, depression, and an overemphasis on weight or shape all contribute to eating disorders, but a patient\u2019s data, based off of questionnaires, can show which factors are most relevant for therapy.\nThe main grant for that trial is intact, but one of Levinson\u2019s team members lost funding for a related trial looking at the treatment of the strictly medical side of eating disorders. That researcher, like many in treatment trials, also served as a therapist for all the patients. Levinson has been able to cobble together short-term funding to keep him on the project, but it won\u2019t last forever.\nBrown, the Auburn researcher, was recruiting participants for a two-phase clinical trial on integrating LGBTQ affirmative treatment into eating disorder cognitive behavioral therapy when she learned that the grant was canceled. The notice came just days before the first participant\u2019s introductory therapy session.\n\u201cIt would have been a $5.5 million grant in total over the five-year span,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest grant I\u2019ve certainly ever had. It was life-changing in terms of our lab and what we could do.\u201d\nBrown had two full-time research coordinators on her now-canceled grant. She\u2019s already had to let go of one, and knows that eventually, she\u2019ll have to lose the other. The timeline for the work she wants to get done building and testing new treatment approaches for eating disorders will likely double without federal funding.\n\u201cI don\u2019t plan to stop doing this kind of work. I also don\u2019t plan on getting it funded through public funding anytime soon,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe hard part will be what pace it\u2019s going to go at.\u201d\nCancellations and delays happening now could have ripple effects on eating disorder research for years to come. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could have written this grant several years ago,\u201d Brown said about her canceled study. The treatment her team wants to test is based on the very epidemiological work tracking eating disorders among queer communities that Beccia and her colleagues do \u2014 which has also been canceled.\nIn the meantime, researchers are trying to recoup NIH funding, submit proposals for new grants, while also applying to as many funding opportunities through private foundations as possible. And even though they\u2019re all vying for a limited amount of dollars, \u201cI have not had any sense of competition,\u201d Beccia said. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s been people encouraging others to apply to the same grants they\u2019re applying to.\u201d\nPeat has also seen that camaraderie shine through. On a Thursday in mid-May, she traveled to Capitol Hill along with 140 other advocates to take part in 100 different congressional meetings on their budget priorities for the next year. They all had two modest requests: $5 million to continue federal training for clinicians on eating disorder screening and intervention procedures, plus $750,000 in research grants focused on the early detection of eating disorders among women and girls.\nDespite a spreading feeling of disenfranchisement in the field, Peat said that there was a hopeful mood among the advocates that day. She\u2019s optimistic that the funding they asked for will come through.\nBut the question remains how much, if at all, the MAHA movement may focus on addressing eating disorders. \u201cI view the whole MAHA movement with major, major suspicion and concern,\u201d Beccia said. She knows that eating disorders are serious chronic health conditions. What has yet to be shown is if Kennedy and his cadre care about them.",

        "Content": "The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday released a summary of President Trump\u2019s budget request for the 2026 fiscal year that provides the most detailed look yet at how his administration hopes to reshape the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies.\nThe \u201cbudget in brief\u201d document doubles down on a previous request to slash NIH\u2019s discretionary budget to $27.5 billion, an $18 billion or nearly 40% reduction. It also details plans to consolidate the agency\u2019s 27 institutes and centers into just eight. But while those plans were disclosed in previous documents that were leaked or shared publicly by the administration, Friday\u2019s budget summary spells out more clearly precisely where these cuts would come from \u2014 and just how deep they will be.\nThe president\u2019s proposal would leave just three of the NIH\u2019s current institutes intact: the National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the National Institute of Aging. But that doesn\u2019t mean these institutes would be spared. If enacted, Trump\u2019s request would slash the budgets of NCI from $7.2 billion to $4.5 billion, NIAID from around $6.6 billion to $4.2 billion, and NIA from $4.4 billion to $2.7 billion.\nThis article is exclusive to STAT+ subscribers\nUnlock this article \u2014 plus daily intelligence on Capitol Hill and the life sciences industry \u2014 by subscribing to STAT+.\nAlready have an account?

        "Content": "The U.S. is facing two major threats to long-term care, and either could topple our precarious system. These developments should worry Congress and anyone who supports an aging loved one or a family member with disabilities.\nThe first threat is the ongoing immigration crackdown. Immigrants comprise 28% of the entire long-term care workforce along with one in three home care workers, providing vital frontline care to older adults and people with disabilities. Recent estimates suggest that 15% of immigrant workers at home care agencies are undocumented; however, even lawful permanent residents have been caught up in recent deportation efforts.\nThese workers fill critical gaps in a sector that has been plagued by worker shortages for decades, a situation that has grown more dire since the Covid-19 pandemic. Our research suggests that the threat of deportation will only worsen these shortages, hurting people who need care and their family members. Policies that separate immigrant caregivers from their communities threaten both vulnerable Americans and the frontline workers who sustain them. For the nation\u2019s long-term care system, these policies represent an existential threat.\nThis article is exclusive to STAT+ subscribers\nUnlock this article \u2014 plus in-depth analysis, newsletters, premium events, and news alerts.\nAlready have an account?

We saw firsthand how deliberate listening and unlikely alliances could mitigate some of the most harmful consequences of disinformation.\nIn North Dakota, this approach contributed to a coalition of health advocates, conservative ranchers, local faith leaders, business executives, and community organizers defeating nine anti-vaccine bills over the past three years, while amending the few that passed to avoid negatively impacting community wellness. These bills proposed expanding exemptions, reducing mandates, and, in one instance, even criminalizing health professionals administering vaccines. We didn\u2019t defeat them by shouting across the aisle but by sitting down and listening.\nThis article is exclusive to STAT+ subscribers\nUnlock this article \u2014 plus in-depth analysis, newsletters, premium events, and news alerts.\nAlready have an account?

Sign up to get it delivered in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday.\nGood morning health tech readers!\nToday, updates on AI projects from FDA, CMS, and NIH. Plus: We hear there\u2019s a National Coordinator for Health IT in place. And: FDA clears a novel device for predicting breast cancer onset.\nReach me: [email protected]\nAnd the National Coordinator for Health IT is\u2026\nWe heard from multiple sources plugged into the world of health IT that Thomas Keane had his first day as Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy and National Coordinator for Health Information Technology yesterday. The federal health department staff directory appears to confirm Keane\u2019s new role. After we sent the newsletter, a spokesman confirmed the role and provided a link to Keane\u2019s newly posted bio.\nKeane is a radiologist who previously served as an advisor to ONC. Traditionally, this position has been the health department\u2019s top health IT regulator, overseeing policies around interoperability and electronic health records.\nNow, given the reorganization at HHS, the role is in flux. Under the Biden administration, ONC\u2019s purview was expanded, and it became the Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy. But according to HHS\u2019 newly released budget request documents, ASTP/ONC will now report to the HHS chief technology officer who will also oversee cybersecurity. (More on this document below.) What this means for the future of ONC\u2019s regulatory power and funding is unclear.\n\u2018Rushed\u2019 FDA AI takes flight\nThe Food and Drug Administration yesterday announced a broad rollout of Elsa, an agency-wide generative AI tool meant to help staff work more efficiently. Earlier in the day, STAT\u2019s Brittany Trang broke the news that Elsa was coming. Her story includes way more detail about development behind the scenes including a sense among agency employees that the rollout is being rushed.\nMedicare\u2019s ambitious tech push\nMehmet Oz\u2019s Medicare agency is plotting a very ambitious tech modernization agenda. Among those driving the effort: Amy Gleason of the U.S. DOGE Service and Arda Kara, a senior advisor for technology at CMS. In a new story I spoke to them a bit about their plans, which are in early development.\nA big takeaway: They want to move fast to launch something to show concrete progress in 2025. They also told me about some high-level ideas under consideration, their approach to deciding what to tackle first, and about how they want to stimulate innovation in the private sector.\nOn cue, the day I published the story, CMS issued a document spelling out how it plans to spend its 2026 budget, if approved by Congress, including several details on tech modernization plans (See pages 105 to 111):\n- Reengineering claims systems and using AI and automation to transform claims processing. \u201cThese technologies will drive greater efficiency, enhance payment integrity and enable a more scalable and resilient system architecture,\u201d CMS writes.\n- Launching an AI lab that \u201cwill support the deployment of AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots across support centers and deliver workforce training in prompt engineering and applied AI.\u201d\n- Consolidating many CMS data repositories, which CMS says \u201cenables seamless data sharing across the healthcare ecosystem, provides a foundation for advanced analytics and AI applications, improves data quality and consistency, and enhances program integrity through comprehensive data visibility.\u201d\nMany big ideas. If you want to chat about any of them, please reach out. And read my whole story on CMS modernization here.\nEye-catching tech details in the HHS budget document\nIt wasn\u2019t just CMS: The entire federal health department published budget request documents on Friday spelling out priorities. A few health tech details caught my eye.\n- FDA: Under accomplishments of the office of the commissioner from 2024 that are in line with current priorities, FDA cites the Digital Health Advisory Committee meeting hosted in November, which focused on regulating generative AI. A key staff member who drove this effort left the agency this year, and there are questions about what would become of the committee itself, and whether any readout would be published from the meeting. I read its inclusion in the budget document as a signal that the work may continue. (Pages 66 to 67 of FDA\u2019s budget justification.)\n- Health IT: In addition to hints about ASTP/ONC, federal health department also explained that it will continue TEFCA, the national health data sharing framework. (Page 41 of the HHS Budget in Brief document.)\n- NIH: As STAT reported Friday, the documents detail the scope of budget cuts coming to NIH. As a bonus item, I wanted to flag this interesting request for information on responsibly developing generative AI tools for research.\n23andMe auction, Hims & Hers Europe expansion\n- Just a few weeks after Regeneron announced it would buy 23andMe out of bankruptcy, Anne Wojcicki, founder of the consumer genetics company, asked a judge to reopen the auction, saying she\u2019d lined up a Fortune 500 company to help her buy it. There aren\u2019t too many companies it could plausibly be. If you know, tell us.\n- Digital chronic disease management company Omada priced its IPO at between $18 and $20 per share which could value the company at up to $1.1 billion. I\u2019d expect to see the company list any day now. Hinge Health, another digital health company, successfully went public a few weeks ago.\n- Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health today announced an agreement to acquire European digital health company ZAVA. The acquisition will expand Hims & Hers\u2019 footprint in the United Kingdom and give it access to patients in Germany, France, and Ireland.\n- Clairity, Inc. announced it had received a de novo authorization from FDA for Clairity Breast, a novel, image-based prognostic platform designed to predict five-year breast cancer risk from a routine screening mammogram.\u201d\n- Following a string of announcements, Viz.ai has another: It\u2019s partnering with Novartis to \u201cdevelop AI-powered workflows for prostate and breast cancer.\u201d\n- It\u2019s been a while since we heard from IBM, but the company just announced new work with Roche to provide glucose predictions for users of the company\u2019s Accu-Chek SmartGuide continuous glucose monitoring sensor. Yes, the press release mentions watsonx.",

And if implemented well, it could mark the beginning of a desperately needed transformation in how we bring trustworthy innovation to the regulation of medical product development.\nMedical product development is not just expensive and slow, it\u2019s broken. Fewer than 10% of drug candidates succeed. It can take over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single therapy to market. Devices fare slightly better, but even then, years of effort can end in silence.\nNow, add the pressure of looming patent cliffs, the threat of price negotiations, and renewed pushes for \u201cmost-favored nation\u201d drug pricing policies through the executive order President Trump has signed, which would peg U.S. prices to those paid in the lowest-cost countries.

        "Summary": "The Trump administration's rule change will create &ldquo;fear and confusion&rdquo; at hospitals across the country, critics noted.",
        "Content": "The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it is rescinding a Biden-era guidance requiring emergency rooms across the country to provide abortion services to people facing health emergencies relating to pregnancy complications.\nThat guidance, issued in 2022 shortly after the Supreme Court upended federal abortion protections established in Roe v. Wade, was based on a federal law that applies to U.S. hospitals with ERs that rely on Medicare funds. The law, entitled the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), requires those hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment to patients in all emergency situations.\nWhile many believe EMTALA inherently applies to abortion care, the Biden administration\u2019s guidance attempted to make that clearer, stating that, where a person\u2019s health or life could be jeopardized due to issues relating to their pregnancy, hospitals must provide patients with abortions, where applicable \u2014 including in states with complete bans on the procedure.\nOver the past few years, several abortion-restrictive states have attempted to challenge the guidance. A lawsuit in Texas, for example, was successful at doing so after lower courts deemed the state in compliance with EMTALA exceptions and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge from the Biden administration in late 2024.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced they were rescinding the 2022 guidance, stating that it does \u201cnot reflect the policy\u201d of the Trump administration. CMS said that it would still adhere to EMTALA standards, with abortion rights advocates noting that, under the stipulations of the law itself, those should still include emergency abortions where they are necessary.\n\u201cThe obligation to provide emergency care comes from a federal statute \u2026 and as much as they might like to, President Trump and [HHS] Secretary Kennedy can not erase 40 years of law with this press release,\u201d said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s (ACLU) Reproductive Freedom Project, speaking to The Hill about the administration\u2019s action.\nOther abortion rights advocates and organizations spoke out against the Trump White House\u2019s decision to make it less clear whether EMTALA includes emergencies relating to reproductive health.\nThe move \u201cshows a callous disregard for the law and people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute.\nNancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, noted that the move would make things more perplexing for doctors (and thus, more dangerous for patients), stating:\nIn pulling back guidance, this administration is feeding the fear and confusion that already exists at hospitals in every state where abortion is banned. Hospitals need more guidance right now, not less.\nJamila Perritt, a Washington, D.C.-based OB/GYN and president and CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health, also criticized the move.\n\u201cThis action sends a clear message: the lives and health of pregnant people are not worth protecting,\u201d Perritt said. \u201cComplying with this law can mean the difference between life and death for pregnant people, forcing providers like me to choose between caring for someone in their time of need and turning my back on them to comply with cruel and dangerous laws.\u201d\nPerritt emphasized that EMTALA should still be interpreted as covering emergency abortions.\n\u201cIt is important to remember that EMTALA is still the law of the land,\u201d Perritt added. \u201cAs a doctor, I have a moral and ethical obligation to provide emergency care to those in need, including EMTALA\u2019s mandate to provide abortion care when it is necessary and stabilizing treatment.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Dismantling a key HHS agency, gutting important programs, and cuts to Medicaid will roll back decades of progress.",
        "Content": "On May 30, the Trump administration released its most comprehensive look yet at its proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The proposal heightened concerns that the disability community and advocacy groups have voiced in recent months regarding the administration\u2019s plan to eliminate the Administration for Community Living (ACL) and related grant programs.\nIf these programs are not funded, experts warn that an increasing number of disabled and aging Americans could be institutionalized with little oversight to ensure their rights are protected against abuse and neglect. The National Disability Rights Network (NDRN) called the plan to eliminate the programs \u201ca direct and deliberate attack on people with disabilities, their families, and the systems that protect their rights, health, and independence.\u201d\nAlison Barkoff, who served as ACL\u2019s acting administrator and assistant secretary for aging during the Biden administration, is now director of George Washington University\u2019s health law and policy program. \u201cThe dismantling of ACL combined with the elimination of programs and these big Medicaid cuts are literally going to roll back decades of progress,\u201d Barkoff told Truthout. \u201cIn terms of people with disabilities, the default [could become] people in institutions that are very unsafe with huge rights violations.\u201d\nA subsidiary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), ACL houses and funds the state councils on developmental disabilities, university centers for excellence in developmental disabilities, and the nation\u2019s network of protection and advocacy (P&A) agencies. It also provides grants to centers for independent living, administers employment programs for disabled people, and offers other services to help ensure disabled people and older adults can live and participate in their communities, a requirement of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and a 1999 Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C. That decision held that under the ADA, segregating persons with disabilities in institutions constitutes discrimination. One in five older adults and almost a quarter of the nation\u2019s more than 70 million disabled people depend on ACL programs, according to Barkoff\u2019s testimony before the Senate at a forum held in May.\nPlans to shutter ACL and shift some of its programs to other HHS agencies were first announced on March 27 to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s earlier executive order on so-called \u201cworkforce optimization\u201d and \u201celiminating waste [and] bloat.\u201d HHS said that the \u201cdramatic restructuring\u201d would save the department $1.8 billion per year and shrink the department\u2019s workforce by 10,000 employees, resulting in a total decrease from 82,000 full-time employees to only 62,000 when combined with other efforts to downsize \u2014 a reduction of almost 25 percent.\nMore details of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to eliminate ACL became public when a draft budget proposal from the Office of Management and Budget, dated April 10, was leaked. The new budget documents published on May 30 now confirm that the administration wants to eliminate ACL and much of its work as part of a $163 billion cut in federal spending. While the proposed budget slashes vital services for disabled and aging Americans, it promises over $1 trillion for military spending and anti-immigrant and border infrastructure.\nThese moves are also part of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s agenda to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d which Kennedy claims is focused on fighting chronic illness and reducing federal spending. However, funding for chronic disease treatment and research has also been slashed in the Trump administration\u2019s May 30 budget proposal. Experts also warn that rolling back programs like those provided by ACL could result in increased spending, as it is more expensive to house people in institutions than to provide services that allow them to live in community.\nWhile these efforts do not seem to align with the administration\u2019s stated goals, ramping up institutionalization, particularly for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, does align with the administration\u2019s dangerous and dehumanizing rhetoric about disabled people and Trump\u2019s long-held obsession with eugenics. Dom Kelly, founder, president and CEO of New Disabled South, a nonprofit disability advocacy organization in the U.S. South, told Truthout, \u201cIt\u2019s ableism at its core.\u201d\nAlready, many ACL programs are struggling to operate because HHS has delayed distributing funding authorized by Congress in March and has fired about half of ACL\u2019s staff, including those responsible for budget and grants, making it almost impossible for the remaining staff to fund and implement programs.\nOne of the most alarming aspects of the proposed defunding of ACL is its effect on P&As. There are 57 P&As \u2014 one in every state, every territory, and Washington, D.C. \u2014 and most receive almost all of their funding from the federal budget. If that funding is cut, the organizations will not be able to carry out their federally mandated functions to provide legal and advocacy services to disabled people and monitor and investigate abuse and neglect in institutions and group facilities housing disabled and older individuals, such as hospitals, prisons, jails, group homes, and nursing homes.\nImportantly, under federal law, P&As are the only organizations with the authority to access all areas of facilities housing people with disabilities that would otherwise be accessible only to residents and to have unaccompanied access to residents themselves to communicate with them privately. This allows the organizations to expose and address abuse and neglect, even if an individual has not sought out the agency.\n\u201cThe critical role of the P&As is that they go into so many of these facilities and investigate and reveal so much of the abuse and neglect that happens in these places,\u201d Kelly told Truthout. \u201cThey\u2019re one of our only layers of oversight that allows for some of these injustices to be uncovered and fought.\u201d\nP&As were created in 1978 under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, which was signed into law three years prior. The legislation came on the heels of a historic civil rights lawsuit challenging living conditions at Willowbrook State School in New York, a state-funded institution where adults and children with intellectual and developmental disabilities were beaten, experimented on, and deprived of fundamental rights to food, appropriate medication and access to hygiene facilities.\nWhile there has been a hard-fought shift toward community living since Willowbrook, tens of thousands of disabled people and older adults remain in institutions nationwide. This includes more than 16,000 people with intellectual or developmental disabilities housed in state-operated institutions and over 1.2 million people in nursing homes. While nursing homes are often thought of as places for aging adults, more than 200,000 nursing home residents are disabled individuals under the age of 65.\nNationwide, almost 700,000 people are on waiting lists to access home- and community-based services (HCBS) waivers that would allow some to transition out of institutional settings. Between 2016 and 2023, people sat on waiting lists for an average of 36 months before receiving waivers through the Medicaid program, which provides services for disabled adults and children in their own homes. Since 1999, dozens of lawsuits have also been filed against state and local governments alleging continued segregation and institutionalization of disabled people in violation of the ADA and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Olmstead v. L.C.\nLegal protections for disabled people have also been strengthened since Willowbrook, but research suggests that cases of abuse and neglect persist in institutional settings. In 2022, the last year for which complete data is available, the National Adult Maltreatment Reporting System investigated over 120,000 reports of alleged maltreatment of older or disabled adults living in residential care facilities. Cases of maltreatment included the use of force or violence, deprivation of necessities, sexual abuse, financial exploitation and emotional abuse, such as verbal insults or humiliation.\nMatthew Borus, a professor at Binghamton University who studies disability and nursing homes, told Truthout that dehumanizing treatment is commonplace in some facilities. Nursing home residents that Borus interviewed for his research have reported being shoved by staff, committed to a psychiatric facility as a form of punishment, and having their call button put out of reach to prevent them from calling for assistance. \u201cA lot of the folks I\u2019ve talked to have talked about how they feel like the management of the nursing home treats them essentially as bodies in beds, rather than as people participating in a community,\u201d he told Truthout.\n\u201cPeople think about [Willowbrook] and think, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve moved beyond that. We don\u2019t have these kinds of institutions.\u2019 But actually, there are still state-run institutions, and while it may not be the kind of horrific circumstances that people used to live in at Willowbrook, it is, in today\u2019s environment, still tantamount to abuse and neglect,\u201d Kelly told Truthout. Fulfilling the promise of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling in Olmstead v. L.C. would require reinforcing ACL and funding more HCBS waivers to get people off waiting lists and out of institutions.\nInstead, Barkoff warns that a return to Willowbrook-like conditions could be on the horizon if Congress moves to approve Trump\u2019s proposed budget and eliminate ACL and its network of P&As. \u201cWe will not only have a lot of people who might die, [but also] people certainly experiencing things like restraints and seclusion, having their rights violated,\u201d she told Truthout. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard to put systems and supports in place to help people live the lives that they want in the community [and] if these programs were eliminated, I do fear that we will be going backwards to a time where people with disabilities will be primarily in congregate settings [and] not be able to be part of their own communities and will face huge risks of abuse and neglect.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Sweeping cuts made by the Trump administration have already left the government unprepared for climate disasters.",
        "Content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reportedly told staff that he was not aware that the U.S. has a hurricane season \u2014 despite leading the agency primarily responsible for responding to disasters in the U.S.\nFEMA chief David Richardson made the comment during a meeting on Monday, according to four sources who spoke to Reuters. Staffers said it was unclear whether his comment was meant as a joke.\nThe comment was made the day after hurricane season began in the Atlantic Ocean, with the season officially ending in November. Some researchers suggest that the hurricane season is lengthening, however, as the climate crisis drives earlier and later storms, while also making storms stronger than they would be otherwise.\nIndeed, forecasters for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have predicted above-normal hurricane activity for 2025. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people are killed by hurricanes each year in the U.S.\nIn a statement after the report was published, the Department of Homeland Security framed Richardson\u2019s comment as a joke. But the statement didn\u2019t outright deny the comment, calling the report \u201cmeanspirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy.\u201d\n\u201c[T]here is no uncertainty about what FEMA will be doing this Hurricane Season,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFEMA is laser focused on disaster response, and protecting the American people.\u201d\nHowever, Richardson\u2019s comments \u2014 as well as President Donald Trump\u2019s flip-flopping on whether he wants to abolish FEMA itself \u2014 have reportedly spurred confusion and alarm, leaving even staff concerned over the government\u2019s ability to respond to hurricanes and other disasters.\nTrump has suggested that he wants to get rid of or severely shrink FEMA, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has publicly announced plans to do so. Though the administration hasn\u2019t fully eliminated the agency yet, FEMA has reportedly drastically reduced trainings for state and local emergency hurricane response, potentially leaving communities across the U.S. shorthanded when a hurricane strikes this year.\nAt the same time, the administration\u2019s drastic cuts to the National Weather Service have left the agency majorly short staffed, meaning that the government\u2019s ability to predict and track storms is jeopardized.\nFurther, during the staff meeting on Monday, Richardson reportedly told staff that the agency was scrapping his plan for hurricane response, which he said was almost done. Instead, the agency was going to use last year\u2019s hurricane response plan \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t be possible, staff said, with the administration\u2019s cuts to the agency.\nRichardson\u2019s appointment has also raised concerns over his ability to lead FEMA, especially through multiple staffing crises. The official has already racked up numerous gaffes in just a few weeks as FEMA director.\nDuring a town hall meeting with staff on the administration\u2019s plan for \u201cFEMA 2.0,\u201d for instance, Richardson bizarrely talked about his girlfriend with \u201chuge red hair\u201d educating him on the size of Texas, and went off on tangents about fruits while trying to discuss the future of the agency. He also speculated on the number of laws governing FEMA, while referencing crucial information he had just learned about FEMA \u201clast week.\u201d\nCritics said a FEMA director shouldn\u2019t be making jokes about something as serious as hurricane preparedness, especially when he\u2019s only been in his role for a few weeks and has zero prior experience in emergency management.\n\u201cSuffice to say, disaster response is no joke,\u201d said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, which has oversight of FEMA. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what or when hurricane season is, you\u2019re not qualified to run FEMA. Get someone knowledgeable in there.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "In this moment, organized labor can both intervene to defend people and articulate a different vision for higher ed.",
        "Content": "A shining light within the U.S. labor movement over the past several years has been the rising wave of unionization and militancy among graduate workers, whose labor helps prop up the entire system of U.S. higher education. Tens of thousands of graduate workers have unionized over the past half-decade at institutions like Stanford, UChicago, MIT, Duke, Minnesota, and many more. According to one study, as of January 2024, around 38 percent of graduate student employees were represented by unions, with over 150,000 graduate workers across 81 units.\nGrad workers across the U.S. have also engaged in militant protests and strikes not just over recognition and contract fights, but also to oppose attacks on the Palestine solidarity movement. Many graduate unions see their mission as not merely to secure gains around bread-and-butter issues, but to fight for social justice and to defend liberatory values of higher education in the face of the neoliberalization and militarization of universities.\nAt the same time, graduate workers are facing intensified challenges under a Trump administration that is attacking higher education, cutting federal funding, looking to gut the National Labor Relations Board and intensifying attacks against immigrants and Palestine solidarity activists. While campus repression isn\u2019t new, with precedents under the Biden administration, there are clear signs that attacks are escalating. And university administration efforts to undermine grad unions long predate Trump.\nWhat\u2019s behind the rise of graduate worker militancy? How should we understand this moment in the graduate worker movement? How should graduate workers respond to attacks? Truthout spoke with representatives from three graduate worker unions to discuss these questions.\nJess Fournier is a Ph.D. candidate and graduate teaching assistant in the Feminist Studies Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz and an organizer with UAW 4811, which represents 48,000 workers across the University of California system. Janvi Madhani is a Ph.D. candidate and graduate worker in physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University and the national liaison and political action coordinator of TRU-UE 197, which won union recognition in 2023. Shreya (last name withheld by request to avoid retaliation) is a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan and an organizer and steward with GEO 3550, one of the first graduate unions to form in the U.S. back in the early 1970s.\nDerek Seidman: How do you understand the rise of graduate worker unionization and militancy over the past several years?\nShreya (UMichigan): The conditions that grad workers face today necessitate militancy and power. Our universities are getting so neoliberalized, and this has put grad workers in increasingly precarious conditions. There\u2019s a selling out of our universities to major donors and a decline in the liberatory values of higher education.\nGrad workers face a lot of the same attacks that students face, but we also face attacks as workers. Grad workers across the country also talk to each other a lot. I talk to comrades at other universities every single week. We\u2019ve gotten better at networking and sharing our struggles.\nJess Fournier (UC Santa Cruz): I think it reflects a general trend in labor militancy in the U.S., like with campaigns at Starbucks and Amazon. COVID-19 also really impacted people\u2019s lives and working conditions. The cost of living, especially rent, has also been a big driver of unionization and militancy. It\u2019s just so unsustainable. You\u2019re not paid enough to live where you work.\nAnother reason is the cross-pollination among grad workers during the last five years. Folks at Santa Cruz, University of Michigan, Dartmouth, Boston University, CUNY, Princeton \u2014 we\u2019re all in touch with each other and learning from each other\u2019s experiences.\nJanvi Madhani (Johns Hopkins): A large part of the growth of this militancy stems from the recognition that U.S. universities act as profit-maximizing hedge funds and outposts of U.S. imperialism. They develop war-profiteering technologies and research and they\u2019re financially entangled with an international system that seeks to maintain U.S. imperial interests.\nWithin this context, our research as graduate students is responsible for producing the science, technology and intellectual theories that end up influencing these global systems. We\u2019re struggling not only against the exploitation of our own labor but also against the exploitation of our research to support and even justify policing, militarization and genocide.\nWhat are the biggest challenges the grad worker movement is facing now?\nFournier: Even before Trump, universities were planning austerity programs and trying to winnow away the number of unionized workers. The Trump administration will exacerbate this. Administrators are trying to break the back of organized workers and offload the teaching functions to the most precarious workers who have the least protections. They\u2019re increasing reliance on AI, even as it degrades the quality of education, as a way to automate grading work now done by academic workers who can potentially strike.\nWe\u2019re learning how to organize more effectively, but the employer is also learning. There was tremendous repression across the country against Palestine solidarity encampments. At Santa Cruz, the intense repression we saw against our 2024 strike was radically different from our strike in 2022. It was sort of a bellwether. All the different attacks happening now are tied together. Our universities are not standing up for workers, and in cases like Columbia, really capitulating.\nShreya: There aren\u2019t any fights the grad worker movement is facing now that we haven\u2019t always been facing. There are new manifestations of issues that began far before the Trump administration. Following our 2023 strike, UMichigan has been implementing austerity measures in retaliation for our militancy and has increasingly been using AI to replace grad labor.\nThe Regents and the university laid the foundation for the Trump administration by criminalizing pro-Palestinian activism through an aggressive campaign of repression. The crackdown against student immigrants is a broadening of the repression of pro-Palestine activists. The university has done very little to respond to the federal funding cuts or attacks on immigrants. They\u2019ve just thrown their hands up and say they can\u2019t do anything, which isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s an excuse to not do anything.\nMadhani: Universities are also not helpless in fighting back against the federal government. When we make demands to divest from Israel or fund grad workers, these are material demands we know they can fulfill. To protect their endowments, these institutions are allowing extrajudicial kidnappings of their own students and meeting ridiculous demands posed by the federal government. They\u2019re cowering and capitulating, even when they have the resources to fight back.\nAt Hopkins, they\u2019re increasing budgets for policing and surveillance, but then saying they don\u2019t have money to support funding. It\u2019s truly just a crisis of priorities, not a lack of financial wealth or institutional resources. One of the biggest challenges grad workers are facing is restructuring the entire purpose of universities.\nHow should grad worker unions respond to this moment?\nFournier: The labor movement needs to have a loud, full-throated, no-capitulation response. Many universities are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s keep quiet,\u2019 but unions need to do the exact opposite. We need a vision that encompasses all different types of workers at the university. The grad worker movement is well positioned to build a broader coalition among higher ed workers \u2014 lecturers, adjuncts, food service, janitorial, administrative staff \u2014 which could have a wall-to-wall orientation within common demands. We need that level of organization.\nInternational workers on university campuses are really scared. We recently had a campus Know Your Rights training and we\u2019re working on getting Know Your Rights trainings in every department. Grad unions need to make the kinds of demands of our employer that will protect everyone. The building trades have been very supportive of Kilmar Abrego Garc\u00eda. That\u2019s what we all need to be doing.\nWe need to be showing how these issues are all connected. This is a moment where organized labor can actually intervene to defend people but also articulate a different vision. We should think about what our leverage actually is and build our capacity to strike over these demands on employers.\nMadhani: Our responsibility is not just to other grad workers, but also to the larger Hopkins community. We\u2019ve sent the university a list of demands around things like enforcing a sanctuary campus and an end to campus militarization. We\u2019re demanding the deletion of surveillance records of protesters and of incriminating data that the university could hand over to the federal government.\nHopkins has done a really incredible job at student repression. The fight for Palestinian liberation on campus has been a mask-off moment for many students and workers. Members of our bargaining committee were systematically targeted, identified through surveillance, and denied union representation in disciplinary proceedings for participating in the encampment.\nHopkins also put up AI smart surveillance towers, which had a chilling effect on campus. But instead of demoralizing students, it radicalized people. Our union organized a campaign to take the towers down. We also held an internal vote on making our financial practices as a local compliant with BDS. It passed with 72 percent support despite the administration\u2019s attempts to intimidate us.\nWe are very aware that this is not just a fight for fair wages, but that as workers at a university like Johns Hopkins, which has been long manufacturing the methods and tools to suppress popular movements both on campus and globally, we have a responsibility to use our leverage in a socially responsible way.\nShreya: We\u2019re intentionally focusing our attention on our workplace. We recognize that the university could act right now. The University of Michigan has a lot of power and a massive endowment. We\u2019ve been thinking about how to pressure the university to act.\nThat leads me back to militancy, meaning a really principled and steadfast response to the situation rooted in careful deliberation among grad workers. We\u2019ve been holding many department meetings where we talk together about what\u2019s happening, formulate demands for the university, and discuss how to win those demands.\nWhat are the most important lessons you\u2019d share with other grad workers?\nFournier: For us at UCSC, it\u2019s been important to have a cohesive, militant form of organization at the department level. Those are the people you work with every day. If you actually want to be able to strike strong and strike long, you need that level of organization with your direct coworkers.\nCollective decision-making structures are really important. We need to encourage people to take ownership of the direction of their union. You need a culture of people deliberating together. The locus of where you actually have power is in building with your direct coworkers in your workplace. That\u2019s the biggest lesson that I\u2019ve learned \u2014 create those spaces for people to connect with their direct coworkers and institute a culture of people making decisions together.\nWe\u2019re also really focused on building up our network of stewards, not as a representative position, but as people who regularly check in with everyone in their department or lab. It\u2019s this middle layer of organization that keeps people engaged.\nShreya: Building and sustaining a powerful graduate worker union has to be rooted in bottom-up, worker-to-worker organizing in our workplaces. This means forming organizing committees within your department or lab, talking with your coworkers to process your situation together and cohering around clear demands.\nIt\u2019s not easy. It requires a lot of patience and capacity for collective reflection and strategic thinking about how the boss is trying to disorganize us and how to respond. All of that is really hard, which is why I emphasize talking to your coworkers. Any moment that I\u2019ve felt confused or hopeless, talking to my coworkers has always helped. A strong grad worker union is rooted in relationships.\nMany grad workers are isolated and overworked, so it\u2019s important to build communication and social infrastructure. You could just literally walk around your office and talk to your coworkers. I do that all the time. You could set up a group chat or organize a casual lunch. That\u2019s a great starting point.\nSome departments are stronger than others, and you can leverage that. If you\u2019re struggling, start with one or two departments with widely felt demands or strong social networks. If those departments can become organized, they can become models for other departments to get organized.\nMadhani: This model of organizing by department with your most proximal coworkers has worked really well for us. That infrastructure has carried us through contract enforcement and now in this more escalatory current phase.\nIt\u2019s our job as worker leaders to militantly organize our peers and steer our movements in the direction of collective liberation. That means taking on radical fights that go beyond bread-and-butter issues, maintaining strong member-led unionism, and not replicating the power imbalances that made us unionize in the first place. I\u2019m personally really proud of how we brought a radical fight for abolition to the bargaining table despite fears that police abolition is not typically understood as a union issue.\nWe\u2019ve also learned a lot from other grad locals. I still remember some of the initial conversations we had with our UE siblings. MIT has been a pioneer in the new wave of higher education organizing, and they passed on really helpful guidance. Michigan helped us formulate our BDS fight. The UCs talked to us about building strike power. It\u2019s a very large collective project of grad labor.\nFinally, what keeps you inspired and hopeful?\nMadhani: I see grad workers really embracing radical change, not just incremental reforms. People desire a better world and know the current failings of our systems. There\u2019s a real understanding of what\u2019s at stake that\u2019s driving our movement right now. Even those who aren\u2019t facing immediate risk understand the urgency of collective organizing that goes beyond any one person\u2019s individual interests and is rooted on the basis of fighting for each other. I think that\u2019s a really beautiful form of collective power.\nShreya: What really keeps me excited is just the experience of solidarity between grad workers. Going to our rally defending international grad workers, taking action together, was very energizing for me. We\u2019ve had small wins at the department level, such as departments agreeing to have regular town halls about immigration or funding issues. These are small victories, but they show that we can force change. We\u2019re so powerful together. Moments like this, where there\u2019s so much fear and chaos, can be really disorganizing, which is exactly what the boss wants. The more I stay grounded in the power we have as workers, the more hopeful I feel.\nFournier: The way my coworkers rise to the occasion under very difficult circumstances inspires me. I\u2019ve seen people do amazing things and make incredible sacrifices of their time and energy. I\u2019ve seen people take risks. Our statewide Spring 2024 strike wasn\u2019t for material demands for ourselves, but because our coworkers have been targeted for defending Palestine. Seeing that kind of sacrifice and people\u2019s willingness to keep fighting makes me believe we\u2019re going to win. It\u2019s going to be hard, but I think of the Mike Davis quote: \u201cFight with hope, fight without hope, but fight absolutely.\u201d I see people doing that every day, fighting and caring for one another, and that is a really beautiful thing.\nNote: These interviews were conducted separately and subsequently edited into a roundtable format.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "Protests over ICE raids are continuing across the United States as agents arrest immigrants at courthouses, from their workplaces, on the way to school and more. Immigration and human rights advocate Adriana Jasso with Uni\u00f3n del Barrio describes protests that met a massive raid in San Diego at a popular restaurant, the targeting of farmworkers, and how her organization has been conducting ICE patrols to alert the community.\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez.\nWe look now how protests over immigration raids and arrests are continuing around the country. In Milford, Massachusetts, this weekend, students walked out of school Monday to show support for Marcelo Gomes da Silva, an 18-year-old high school honor student detained Saturday by ICE agents in three unmarked vehicles as he drove his volleyball teammates to practice at 7:45 in the morning. Marcelo was born in Brazil, had lived in the Milford area since he was 5 years old. He was also a member of the school band and was scheduled to perform the next day at the school\u2019s graduation ceremony. So, on Sunday, many students marched in their gowns from their graduation to join hundreds of others at a protest outside Milford\u2019s town hall. That\u2019s Massachusetts.\nLet\u2019s go across the country now to San Diego, where outrage is growing after 20 armed and masked ICE agents in full tactical gear raided a popular Italian restaurant Friday. The agents handcuffed the staff, demanded IDs, arrested four workers. Local residents reacted angrily to the raid, attempted to block ICE vehicles from leaving the scene. ICE agents responded by throwing flash-bang smoke grenades at the crowd.\nJust two examples of communities expressing outrage over ICE raids. This comes as immigrant communities are also pushing back on the raids and arrests. In San Diego, the Uni\u00f3n del Barrio is conducting community patrols of ICE agents in their neighborhood. This is a clip from a patrol in May. They speak in English and Spanish.\nUNI\u00d3N DEL BARRIO MEMBER 1: [Estamos aqu\u00ed, vigilando la (calle) 39 y] Hemlock. Parece unos veh\u00edculos sospechosos. [translated: We\u2019re here, watching 39th (Street) and Hemlock. Looks like some suspicious vehicles.]\nUNI\u00d3N DEL BARRIO MEMBER 2: Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1n. They\u2019re in front of us. [translated: Here they are. They\u2019re in front of us.]\nUNI\u00d3N DEL BARRIO MEMBER 3: S\u00ed, s\u00ed, los vemos. Estamos al frente de ustedes. \u00bfQu\u00e9 veh\u00edculos, m\u00e1s o menos? [translated: Yes, yes, we see them. We are in front of you. What vehicles, more or less?]\nUNI\u00d3N DEL BARRIO MEMBER 2: Son tres veh\u00edculos. [translated: There are three vehicles.]\nAMY GOODMAN: One of the people helping on these patrols by Uni\u00f3n del Barrio is Adriana Jasso, who will join us in a minute. This is a clip of her on another patrol, using a bullhorn to alert the community that ICE agents are on site. She speaks in Spanish.\nUNI\u00d3N DEL BARRIO MEMBER 4: Aqui tenemos al ICE. S\u00ed era, s\u00ed era. [translated: Here we have ICE. Yes, it was (ICE). Yes, it was.]\nADRIANA JASSO: Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 ICE. Este es un veh\u00edculo de ICE. Un veh\u00edculo de ICE que est\u00e1 haciendo inteligencia a nuestra comunidades. [translated: Here is ICE. This is an ICE vehicle. An ICE vehicle that is doing intelligence on our communities.]\nAMY GOODMAN: For more, we\u2019re joined in San Diego by Adriana Jasso, immigration and human rights advocate with the longtime group Uni\u00f3n del Barrio.\nWelcome to Democracy Now!, Adriana. It\u2019s great to have you with us. So, we are describing these different stories. Can you tell us first what happened on Friday at this Italian eatery? It was just opening up. Armed, heavily armed, ICE agents, various immigration parts of the government move in. And tell us what happened, and then how the community is responding.\nADRIANA JASSO: Thank you, Amy, for the invitation. It\u2019s a pleasure to be with you.\nYes, on Friday evening, around 5 p.m., as members of the community of South Park, which is a middle-class community in \u2014 one of the many communities in San Diego was getting ready for dinner, and this particular restaurant has been popular for many years by local families and people who are just about to enjoy an evening of family time. And on Friday, HSI, the investigative branch of CBP, of DHS, came to that location and requested for customers to exit the restaurant, as well as put under arrest and detention to every person working and serving a function in the restaurant.\nAMY GOODMAN: And could you tell us, Adriana, in terms of this move toward actual raids, rather than just going in to arrest individual peoples, which the Trump administration started, but now raids in the community, how frequently have these begun to crop up?\nADRIANA JASSO: Yes, thank you, Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez.\nWe have seen an increase in the level of fear, intimidation and terror that our communities are experiencing. We have had a clear escalation of work raids, and including this latest one at this restaurant. At the end of March, a construction site was raided in the East County of El Cajon. And the images and the level of escalation and aggression and excessive use of force, intimidation and terror that some of the images showed in South Park do not compare to what we saw and witnessed in the city of El Cajon, wherein over 80 agents exercised an operation at a work site that lasted six-and-a-half hours, and they detained over 200 workers, with a conclusion of taking into custody 17 of those over 100 workers that they detained for over six hours.\nAMY GOODMAN: And what about the situation of farmworkers? The whole nation, not just California, depends on the work of farmworkers in California, many of them immigrant workers. What\u2019s the situation, that you\u2019ve been able to tell of, in the fields?\nADRIANA JASSO: Specifically to the community in the county of Bakersfield and the Central Valley, where most of the food comes from and is cared for and harvested by the hands and the labor of migrant workers and workers of Latino, Mexicano descent, as well as Central America, we have had two major work raids or targeting farmworkers in the Bakersfield, early \u2014 mid-December, and a second one that had an impact took place in the farmworkers community in the Orange County, as well, in the Orange County about a month ago. This has been the escalation of targeting, and this came from Border Patrol, another branch of CBP, where over a hundred workers were detained, the first operation, and the second one, over 20 workers were detained. What is particular to highlight is that many of the workers were able to exercise and defend themselves from the excessive use of force and the abusive psychological harm that border agents and ICE agents were trying to inflict at the time of the interaction with the workers.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, if you can talk, Adriana Jasso, about how the community is organizing? We\u2019re seeing communities where a sudden arrest happens, and just the community rises up, from Missouri to Massachusetts. But you\u2019ve been organizing for years. How are you moving on now? What are you \u2014 what are people doing in their organizing as Stephen Miller talks about ramping up to 3,000 arrests each day?\nADRIANA JASSO: We understand and have adhered to our historical responsibility to fight back, to resist and to denounce and take the moral imperative to say that the legal framework, due process, constitutional rights, civil rights, human rights, that were protection to our communities and to the working class of the West and every and other places in the country, this administration has made sure to erase and to try to attack and violate every human right, every constitutional right. Uni\u00f3n del Barrio stands in very much the assessment and the understanding that we have the responsibility to defend our communities. We are organizing night and date, weekend, weekdays, every single possible energy and time that we are able to put into community work and say that we have the right and the responsibility to defend ourselves.\nYou had a chance to see the community patrols that we have in place from L.A., from Riverside, from San Diego, from Escondido, and we\u2019re developing relationships to implement this model in Santa, Barbara and San Francisco, and also potentially looking at growing in places like Utah, New York, Chicago. We are having those conversations because we know and we understand that the moral imperative to fight back, to resist and to not ask for permission or apologize for the right to exist. These are exciting times, yet they are difficult times, painful times. But this also could be an opportunity for the movement to gain the strength to stand up and face a fascistic, harmful government that has done away with the fundamental human rights and constitutional rights that we as communities deserve.\nAMY GOODMAN: Adriana Jasso, I want to thank you for being with us, immigration and human rights advocate based in San Diego, California, a member of Uni\u00f3n del Barrio.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "This year, Pride Month arrives at an especially dire moment for the LGBTQ+ community. Under the second Trump administration, homophobic vitriol and violence are on the rise. On Elon Musk\u2019s X platform, a \u201cdeepfake\u201d video of Donald Trump canceling Pride Month has gone viral. And even as Pride celebrations continue as planned (in many places without as many corporate contributions), the attacks against LGBTQ+ people, especially transgender people, seem to be on steroids. After all, since taking office a second time, Trump has issued executive orders that ban transgender women in sports and transgender troops in the military, while limiting federal recognition to two genders. And his executive actions are only the spear tip of a significantly larger legislative attempt to target and scapegoat transgender people, who make up just over one percent of the U.S. population.\nBelieve it or not, so far this year, 701 anti-trans bills have been introduced in American legislative bodies at both the state and federal levels. More than $215 million was spent on anti-trans television advertisements during the 2024 election season alone. Now, Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d barely passed by the House and at present in the Senate \u2014 which would gut Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and other lifesaving safety-net programs \u2014 takes explicit aim at gender-affirming care for Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) patients. If the Senate passes it, the result will be devastating for trans people, who are already twice as likely as the general population to be unemployed and unhoused and four times as likely to live in extreme poverty. It should be no surprise, then, that almost half of transgender adults in this country have already relocated or are considering relocating to more trans-affirming places.\nWhile executive orders, budget cuts, and other attacks threaten all trans and nonbinary people, the most vulnerable are, of course, at greatest risk, including the poor, people of color, the young, the disabled, and the incarcerated. In a recent report, the ACLU offers a horrific insight into this reality:\n\u201cSome of the most immediate impacts will likely be felt by the more than 2,000 transgender people currently held in federal custody. [One] order specifically calls on the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ignore the guidelines of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and enforce a blanket policy forcing transgender women into men\u2019s prisons and detention centers against their will. This puts them at a severely heightened risk of sexual assault and abuse by other incarcerated persons and prison staff. The order also mandates that BOP withdraw critical health care from trans people in federal prison.\u201d\nThe overwhelming majority of anti-trans bills target trans and nonbinary children, youth, and young adults by taking away their sense of safety and belonging in healthcare locations, libraries, schools, sports, and so much more, while only accelerating anti-trans bullying and hate. In fact, according to a study from the Trevor Project, \u201cWhen states pass anti-transgender laws\u2026 suicide attempts among trans and nonbinary youth ages 13 to 17 increased from 7% to 72%.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to note that none of this is happening simply because Donald Trump himself is a bigot or because the Republican Party is just deeply cruel. It\u2019s happening because there is a highly connected, well-funded, and strategically positioned Christian nationalist movement pushing forward anti-trans policy and its accompanying social violence.\nBut in the struggle against religious extremism and political oppression, trans people know what losing strategies look like. Preemptive compliance from the institutions we have often relied upon \u2014 including healthcare providers, colleges, and philanthropic foundations \u2014 has been a losing strategy. Submission to divide-and-conquer rule, theological idolatry, and biblical distortion, as well as silence from supporters and allies, also loses the day.\nGiven the position of exclusion and criminalization in society, however, trans people also know how to fight and it\u2019s a massive fight that we need to wage right now. Trans people, who have always had to live with their backs against the wall, are now being joined by those from all walks of life. Indeed, as Trump and the Christian nationalist movement attack everything from decent healthcare to decent housing, more and more people are poised to enter a struggle for survival. In the fight for dignity and democracy, trans people have much to teach everybody.\nA History of Resistance\nTransgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive people have long resisted unjust laws, as well as mistreatment and oppression from those in power. The Compton Cafeteria riot in August 1966 sparked transgender activism in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin District, years before the Stonewall Uprising. Police violence was common in San Francisco then, and the staff at Compton Cafeteria called the police on poor trans women and drag queens who were harassed, subjected to genitalia checks, and subsequently arrested for crossdressing, which was illegal at the time. Tired of the constant oppression, violence, and harassment, trans women resisted arrest, sparking resistance throughout the Tenderloin district. This led to a picket-line presence at the caf\u00e9, as the establishment continued to ban drag queens and trans women.\nEvidence of this early trans resistance was nearly erased from historical memory. Thanks to the work of transgender historian Susan Stryker and other activists and organizers, however, the important legacy of such organizing was confirmed to have indeed occurred.\nThree years later, across the country in New York City, the Stonewall Uprising was led primarily by poor people, particularly poor, gender-expansive folks of color, who faced continual police harassment, violence, and discrimination. The Stonewall Inn, a dingy bar reputedly owned by organized crime and frequented by those in the poor gay and trans community in New York\u2019s West Village, was raided by the police in June 1969. The liberation movement that followed saw heroic activism, organizing, and community care by poor, unhoused trans women who resisted constant erasure and violence from the government (and even from within the gay rights movement). Some of those leaders, including Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, Maxine Feldman, Bobbie Lea Bennett, and Miss Major Griffin Gracy, were as much a part of the movement to end poverty as they were of the gay rights movement.\nBoth Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera were poor, unhoused trans women and sex workers, as well as organizers advocating for deep social transformation. In 1970, they founded S.T.A.R. (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries) House where they worked to meet the material and community needs of poor trans youth. They held monthly political education meetings, offering support for queer folks who were arrested and couldn\u2019t pay bail. They provided both jail and street support in tough times, while working to organize poor trans folks into a larger movement for transformational change.\nThe story of S.T.A.R. House is replete with lessons for anyone committed to resisting political violence, systemic immiseration, and authoritarian-style rule. In their melding of community-care and political activism, Johnson and Rivera successfully modeled ways to organize and build power in the shadow of extreme state repression. They insisted that everyone in their community had a right to live with dignity and that even the most marginalized among them should have a role in all movements for collective liberation. Through their work, they developed and protected a new generation of queer grassroots leaders, at a time when no one else was willing to do so. Theirs was a political ethic rooted in a deep understanding of the classic movement slogan: \u201cWhen you lift from the bottom, everybody rises.\u201d\nToday, 2025 Pride organizers are doubling down on that radical history of protest and resistance. In fact, NYC Pride has made \u201cprotest\u201d its theme of the year. As Kazz Alexander, its co-chair, explained:\n\u201cThe challenges we face today, particularly in this political climate, require us to stand together in solidarity. We must support one another, because when the most marginalized among us are granted their rights, all of us benefit. Pride is not merely a celebration of identity \u2014 it is a powerful statement of resistance, affirming that justice and equity will ultimately prevail for those who live and love on the margins.\u201d\nUnholy Attacks on Children, the Poor, and the Vulnerable\nIt could not be more important to invoke this powerful lineage of protest and resistance today, not just for the trans and nonbinary community but for everyone. In the Trump years, the slew of homophobic and transphobic attacks has been inseparable from the rise of Christian nationalism and religious extremism. In many ways, the contemporary legislative, executive, and judicial attacks on trans and nonbinary people closely parallel a decades-long strategy of the Christian right to politicize abortion access, an issue previously not considered political by a majority of Americans, including a majority of Christians.\nAn eerie argument about \u201cdefending innocent children\u201d is being deployed by Christian nationalists in their war on gender-affirming care, despite overwhelming medical evidence that such care saves young people\u2019s lives. In fact, denying such care is part of a growing Christian nationalist mission to remake this country as an extremist Christian dominion, starting with our children.\nFor example, Oklahoma Senate Bill 129, introduced in 2023 to ban gender-affirming care to anyone under the age of 26, was named the \u201cMillstone Act.\u201d That title reflected an unsettling, even violent interpretation of Matthew 18:6 in the Bible, falsely asserting that gender-affirming care harms children and insinuating that anyone providing it should have \u201ca large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.\u201d\nIn January, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee for Religious Liberty released its annual report, \u201cThe State of Religious Liberty in the United States.\u201d It identified five areas of critical concern: immigration, antisemitism, in vitro fertilization mandates, parental choice in education, and scaling back \u201cgender ideology\u201d laws. It directly took up the rhetoric and politics of the soon-to-be-in-office Trump administration on trans rights and more.\nIndeed, there is nothing innate or organic about the rise of anti-trans and anti-queer hate in the United States. As the research of Translash Media has made clear, organizations like the National Christian Foundation, the DeVos Family, and the Council for National Policy have been instrumental in funding, developing, and workshopping anti-trans and anti-queer sentiment, policies, and theology. Fundamentalist Protestant organizations like Focus on the Family, the Family Policy Alliance, and the Family Research Council have also been crucial to the launching of the anti-trans movement within the last decade, including the drafting of the first anti-trans legislation at a Summit on Protecting Children from Sexualization conference in 2019.\nSuch Christian nationalist-fueled attacks aren\u2019t just about hurting the queer community. They are also a key way of wielding supposedly \u201ctraditional\u201d values and identities to discipline dissent and nonconformity in Christian ranks as well, while sowing distrust of \u201cthe other\u201d in this all-American world of ours. All of this, of course, played out in the 2024 elections, when trans rights were weaponized into a hot-button and divisive issue by the Trump campaign (with only the most half-hearted pushback from the Biden-Harris crew), despite the trans community being such a microscopic minority of the population.\nWhat the Bible Really Says About Gender Justice\nChristian nationalists like to weaponize the Bible as a primary way of justifying their attacks on trans and nonbinary people. And yet, like all Christian nationalist theology, theirs is heretical when it comes to actual Christian scriptures and the subject of Jesus\u2019s teachings.\nAfter all, the creation story in Genesis is fully inclusive of God\u2019s greatness \u2014 from the creation of light and darkness to the nonbinary sunrises and sunsets in between. It should be a reminder that all of us are created in God\u2019s image. While the anti-trans crew has sought to use the biblical phrase \u201cmale and female God created them\u201d from Genesis 1:27 in defense of exclusionary violence, some of the oldest interpretations of that text hold that God created the first human beings to contain both \u201cmaleness\u201d and \u201cfemaleness\u201d inside one body. Indeed, the Bible repeatedly names third-gender people as important.\nIn Isaiah 56:3-5, for instance, God affirms not only the sanctity but the spiritual importance of people who exist outside of the gender binary, in essence promising LGBTQ+ people, \u201can everlasting name, a name better than sons and daughters.\u201d The Book of Esther, for instance, identifies no fewer than ten gender non-conforming people, some of whom are identified as playing a role in assisting Esther\u2019s defense of her people against imperial violence. The Jewish Talmud reflects a similar affirmation of gender diversity, legally recognizing no fewer than seven genders.\nThis inclusivity carries through to the New Testament and the stories about Jesus as well. In Matthew 19:12, Jesus teaches that there are human beings who exist outside of the gender binary from birth. Acts 8:26-39 explicitly lifts up the spiritual leadership of gender non-conforming people of African descent in the story of the Ethiopian eunuch. In our time, that eunuch would have been far more welcome at the Stonewall Inn than at the Family Research Council\u2019s annual summit.\nThere are numerous other biblical examples of gender diversity and of Jesus\u2019s celebration of and identification with gender non-conforming people. The point is that if Christian nationalists insist on using the Bible to underwrite their social and political violence, those of us who call ourselves Christians must be willing to defend LGBTQ+ people with fervor and theological rigor.\nThis is a \u201cKairos moment\u201d for faith communities that affirm the dignity and rights of LGBTQ+ people \u2014 especially trans and nonbinary people. Christian nationalism\u2019s spiritual and political attacks on LGBTQ+ people are also an attack on our deep belief in God\u2019s inclusive love. Isn\u2019t it time, especially in the age of Donald Trump, to leverage our public witness, our pastoral presence, our theological voice, and the power of our institutions in defense of the surviving and thriving of all people?\nFor too long, religion has been used to attack LGBTQ+ people. Today, Christian nationalists are amassing power by claiming a monopoly on morality. But beneath theological distortions and manipulations exists an untarnished gospel that teaches love, inclusion, diversity, and justice. We must be brave enough to proclaim this gospel for all to hear.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "Elon Musk struck a pose like a Nazi, then took a chainsaw to the federal government, terrorizing federal workers, gutting life-saving aid programs, and shredding public services. Now, Musk claims to have returned his attention to his companies, after political blowback \u2014 fueled in no small part by the Tesla Takedown Movement \u2014 caused major financial losses for Tesla. So, where does that leave federal programs and the workers fighting to keep them alive? To unpack the fallout and assess where things stand, I spoke with professor and author Eric Blanc. Blanc writes the newsletter Labor Politics and is the author of We Are the Union: How Worker-to-Worker Organizing is Revitalizing Labor and Winning Big. He teaches labor studies at Rutgers University and serves as an organizer trainer for the Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nKelly Hayes: A lot of people who are politically engaged are aware that of DOGE as a destructive force that has been involved in a lot of cuts and layoffs, but amid the barrage of harmful policies coming out of this administration, a lot of details get lost in the shuffle \u2014 and I think this is definitely true when it comes to the struggle between federal workers and the Trump administration. In March, Trump signed an executive order stripping more than 800,000 federal workers of their collective bargaining rights, claiming it was a matter of national security, while accusing \u201ccertain federal unions\u201d of waging war on his agenda. The administration has also moved to reinstate Schedule F \u2014 rebranded as \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d \u2014 a move that threatens job protections for tens of thousands of federal employees. We\u2019ve also seen a push to slash the VA workforce by 15%, while the Department of Homeland Security has unilaterally scrapped its labor contract with TSA workers. Can you talk about what the current terrain looks like and what public sector workers are up against right now?\nEric Blanc: The current barrage of attacks initiated by Trump and Musk constitutes what\u2019s probably the most serious attack ever on the public sector of the United States and potentially of the labor movement as a whole. The scale of what they\u2019re attempting to do and the damage that they\u2019ve already done is more or less unprecedented, where you\u2019re just trying to use a sledgehammer against the entire federal workforce and some of the biggest unions in the country.\nAnd we don\u2019t know all of the damage that\u2019s already been done. This is one of these stories that the full repercussions of exactly all of the cuts that they\u2019ve made and are attempting to make, we\u2019re going to be feeling these impacts for decades. But what we can say is that they\u2019ve successfully terrorized millions of workers. There\u2019s over two million federal workers in this country. Tens of thousands of them have been laid off. Hundreds of thousands are facing potential layoff, and whether they end up getting laid off will depend to a large extent on the extent of the pushback in the streets, and also some of the legal battles that remain very up in the air. But no matter what happens, even in the best case scenario that we\u2019re able to stop the worst of the looming cuts, what we can say is that the capacity of federal services has been dramatically undercut.\nJust to give one example, senior citizens are already facing far longer wait times for getting their social security claims processed. And so this is just a service that almost everybody depends on, and the cuts that have already been implemented, together with the general chaos that the administration has imposed on the federal workforce has already started impacting not just the federal workers, but the broader American public.\nAnd I think that\u2019s one of the things that gets lost a bit in some of the conversations when we talk about the attacks on federal workers. It\u2019s not just that we\u2019re talking about millions of workers who are being forced to work under the gun right now, and who tomorrow don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to have a job, and who\u2019s collective bargaining rights have been stripped away, or who are fighting not to lose those rights. These attacks on federal workers are impacting almost every American. So social security is one obvious example, but the attacks on basic food and health and environmental regulations, those impact everyone. Corporations are going to try to get away with murder like they did in the pre-regulation era because whatever they can do to make a profit, well, they\u2019ll do it. If it means polluting your water, if it means polluting the air, of course they\u2019re going to try to do that if there\u2019s no regulations to stop them. And so it\u2019s a very dangerous terrain we\u2019re on.\nAnd the federal workforce, I would say that the overall mood is still of chaos and terror, frankly. There has been a growing pushback. So, I think that\u2019s hopeful and we can talk about that.\nIn February, you wrote a post on X that stated, \u201cIf Musk illegally busts federal employee unions with little public outcry or broad labor fightback, every employer will take note [and] try to copycat. Remember: Reagan\u2019s 1981 firing of federal PATCO air traffic controllers sparked an employer offensive in all industries vs all unions.\u201d Can you talk about that historical parallel and how this administration\u2019s attacks on federal workers could affect unions and workers more broadly?\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the 1981 PATCO firings of striking air traffic controllers, as you mentioned, were also federal workers. So it is significant that in both cases, the tip of the spear, as it were, of the bosses\u2019 offensive has been against federal workers. In part, that\u2019s because these are some of the last bastions of union strength in the country. In the private sector, you have only 6% of the workforce in unions. And so when you talk about undermining the strength of organized labor, well, you have to go after the public sector, where density is much higher.\nIn 1981, Reagan fired over 10,000 striking air traffic controllers. And what that did is it sent a signal to the entire employer class that they could go on the offensive against all unions and frankly against all workers.\nAnd we had over the next decade, and frankly in many ways up to the present, was employers reneging on the types of stable protected jobs that had been more of the norm, at least for more numbers of workers in the post-war period, the types of jobs that still, frankly you have in some parts of the federal sector where you can have a decent livelihood and you don\u2019t have to be worried about getting fired at will every day like you do in the private sector. Those types of jobs became fewer and farther between because the bosses after 1981 started unilaterally busting unions. They started unilaterally breaking labor law in a way that just hadn\u2019t been seen until then. What you have now is a world in which bosses understand that the costs of breaking labor law are minimal, so they routinely do whatever they want, knowing that they\u2019re just going to get a slap on the wrist, and that practice continues up through the present.\nThe danger with the Trump attacks on the federal sector is that this could further ratchet up an employer offensive where it\u2019s not just that they want to get rid of unions, which at this point in the private sector they already have largely succeeded in doing, but that they can take a page from Musk\u2019s playbook. And what Musk has done at Twitter, what he\u2019s done at Tesla, and what he\u2019s tried to do in the federal sector, is to not just bust unions, but to essentially cut the workforce in half and make everybody else work double for less or the same pay, and with no security, and to terrorize workers into submitting to arbitrary dictates.\nAnd this is like the fantasy of every employer. Every employer would love to be able to do that, whether they have a union or not. You can read the business press, and so many of these employers are complaining about workers\u2019 leverage during the early pandemic, when workers felt like they could make demands upon management, that they could try to interfere in internal processes, and just get another job if they didn\u2019t like this one. So with the Great Resignation, and all of that pushback and tumult, employers have really felt like their prerogatives of control have been undermined over the last few years.\nAnd if there\u2019s not a huge amount of backlash, even higher than we\u2019ve already seen against the terrorization of the federal workforce, other employers are going to assess that they can try to get away with the Musk playbook in their companies as well. And we\u2019re already seeing that to a certain extent in the tech sector, but there\u2019s no reason that we shouldn\u2019t expect other companies to try to move down that same road, unless there\u2019s enough of a public outcry that they\u2019re scared of getting the boot like Elon Musk is getting the boot right now.\nSo it\u2019s a bit of an open question whether they\u2019re going to try it, and that\u2019s why the stakes of what is happening around DOGE and Elon Musk are pretty high, I think, for everybody, and not just the federal workforce.\nIn what ways have federal employees resisted Trump\u2019s actions and what lessons can the rest of us take from these actions?\nI think the extent of bottom-up resistance in the federal workforce has been amazing, given that the unions themselves in these sectors are very risk-averse and have very little organizing tradition, and frankly, up through the present have mostly focused on litigation. And so the resistance against Trump has mostly had to come from below.\nThe leading force for fighting back in the federal sector and for connecting with the community has been a new organization called the Federal Unionist Network, which is a rank and file-led organization that unites federal workers across all of the different agencies and unions. And the FUN, which is its acronym, has organized various days of action. It was integral to getting tens of thousands of federal workers out on the streets on April 5th for the big Hands Off actions. The FUN actively took the lead in convincing the official federal unions, the established unions and the labor movement as a whole, the AFL-CIO and other national unions to mobilize for April 5th because a lot of them were not, until the very last minute, even planning on letting their members and others know about these actions.\nAnd so the FUN took the lead on saying, look, we are not going to win this alone. We\u2019re not going to win this just with workers filing lawsuits in different agencies, we\u2019re not even going to win it just through workers\u2019 agency by agency trying to push back. We need to have a broad united pushback of federal workers working in conjunction with the community, because this is one of the lessons of labor movements in general, but particularly in the public sectors \u2014 the way you win is by leveraging public support. Going on strike in the public sector doesn\u2019t have the same weight on its own. You can\u2019t halt profits. So, really what striking does is it creates a public crisis and outpouring that can be directed against managers and politicians. And the leverage therefore of federal workers is overwhelmingly how do you get average Americans, who aren\u2019t necessarily in unions, certainly not in federal unions, to understand that the battle of federal workers to protect their jobs and their services impacts every working class American, middle class American.\nSo, from social security to these environmental regulations to just basic things like can you fly in safely to Newark Airport, that depends on a well-funded unionized workforce in the federal sector. And that\u2019s the message I think that the FUN has been getting out there, that the way we protect the services of the broad majority of Americans is through defending unions. So that\u2019s one thing connecting unions to the broader public service fight back.\nAnd then I just think the other major point is we can\u2019t rely on the courts. The courts may have partially slowed some of the worst of Trump and Musk\u2019s attacks, but it\u2019s crazy to think that the Supreme Court is ultimately going to be a defender of democracy, public services, and these workers \u2014 and we\u2019ve already seen a lot of crucial litigation go the wrong way. So, for instance, the executive order that Trump imposed taking away union rights got cleared just a few weeks ago by the courts, it\u2019s been allowed to be implemented.\nWithin and outside the labor movement, I think there\u2019s a sort of a broader overestimation of how much of a barrier the courts are going to be against Trump and that unless we can make it clear that Americans as a whole are ready to organize by the tens of millions, potentially through disruptive actions and to raise the political costs for Republicans and any politicians that go along with these types of attacks, unless we can have that type of mass mobilization, I don\u2019t think we are going to be able to stop Trumpism. It\u2019s conceivable you could win an election, if those are allowed in two years and in 2028, but to actually stop the movement behind that and to undermine the roots of MAGA, you need to have a mass movement that can provide a compelling alternative vision for what this country should be, which is a anti-billionaire sort of pro-democracy, pro-social justice vision.\nThere\u2019s been some debate over whether Elon Musk\u2019s departure from the Trump administration really matters, since he remains an influential figure and his loyalists are still active inside DOGE. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on with Musk right now and what that means for workers, especially those still facing fallout from his leadership at DOGE?\nI think sometimes on the left, we\u2019re not so good at claiming our wins, and this is an important win, and I think it\u2019s important to own it as a win. Of course, it\u2019s true that the battle is far from over against Trumpism or against DOGE, but the fact that Musk has been pushed out is very clearly a repudiation from below of his policies. That\u2019s crucial for two reasons. One is it will slow down some of the wrecking ball operation of DOGE because Musk was driving it at such an insane speed, and without their figurehead, we are already seeing a shift in the tempo of what DOGE is doing.\nAnd that\u2019s very important because so much of the difficulty of organizing in the first weeks and months of this new administration was just the rapidity of Musk\u2019s attacks. Everything was happening so fast; every day, there was one attack after another. And it didn\u2019t give our side and workers, frankly, the ability to start organizing, because it was just an endless barrage of these attacks. And so if you can slow that down, it gives you more space to build a fight back that can win. So that\u2019s part of it.\nAnd then the second part of this is about what this means on the broader public opinion, political front. What they\u2019re doing at DOGE was never about government efficiency. We know this. It was always about imposing their control over the federal workforce, first and foremost. And then, secondly, it was about finding a scapegoat for the real anxieties of working-class Americans. Something that MAGA probably understands better than the Democratic Party is that people are hurting and they\u2019re looking for somebody to blame. And when you are an administration of and for the richest men, or if you are the richest man on the planet like Elon Musk, well, then obviously you\u2019re not going to go after the billionaires, and that requires you ideologically to find other scapegoats.\nSo, immigrants have been and remain the main scapegoat, alongside trans people, but in the last few months, they\u2019ve tried to add this additional scapegoat, which is that government bloat and the federal bureaucrats are somehow at the root of most people\u2019s problems. And Musk has been broadly reputed. Everybody understands he\u2019s unpopular, and he himself has said he might get out of politics because people are too mean. There\u2019s no world in which even Elon Musk has really been able to paint this as something other than what it is. There\u2019s not really any ambiguity about what\u2019s going on here. That signals something really important, which is that Americans actually like public services. They don\u2019t want the government to terrorize unions, and they don\u2019t want the richest people on earth unilaterally dictating government policy. And so that has been proven to be the case. So much so that the Trump administration has essentially been forced to take a partial retreat on Musk as a figure because he\u2019s too toxic.\nObviously, the battle continues. DOGE is not gone. The administration is still planning on imposing mass layoffs through Reductions In Force (RIFs). So, the big battle over the coming months that readers should keep their eyes on is that we need to do everything possible to stop these mass layoffs that are looming, not just at Veterans Affairs or Social Security, but all across the federal sector. If these are implemented, that will be far worse than anything we\u2019ve seen so far, because it will cement a decimation of public services. But we\u2019re in a better position to win that battle now that Musk has been sidelined.\nI think part of the hesitancy, for some leftists and organizers, to acknowledge the full extent of Musk\u2019s injury here is that they don\u2019t want people to stop organizing against him or punishing him for his actions. And I think this is a situation where we really need to hold multiple truths. Researchers estimate that over 96,000 adults and 200,000 children have already died because Musk put USAID \u201cthrough the woodchipper.\u201d He struck a pose like a Nazi on an international stage, and then got to work making cuts that would kill people en masse. Millions of people are likely going to die because of his actions. We\u2019re talking about a man who should never know any peace, even if he\u2019s suffering from a temporary or permanent loss of influence in the White House.\nRepublicans in Congress are also working to codify some of the DOGE cuts, which would further lock in and legitimize some of the damage Musk can\u2019t be let off the hook for these ongoing impacts, and people should continue to make him miserable \u2014 as punishment, as a deterrent to his potential return, and as a deterrent to other ultra wealthy men who might follow in his footsteps. He should be met with scorn wherever he goes, and I think that\u2019s a political project that should be maintained. But it would only take a handful of Republican defectors to derail congressional efforts to codify the DOGE cuts, and we need to keep our eyes on that, too. Which Republicans are vulnerable on this? How can they be pressured? Who among them can be made to pay a political cost for doing the wrong thing?\nI also want us to remember that this is an oligarchical administration and that Musk isn\u2019t the only major tech player we need to worry about. This administration is increasingly turning to Palantir, a company founded by Peter Thiel, to create the kind of surveillance apparatus that DOGE workers (some of whom used to work for Palantir) have been talking about, by merging government databases. We\u2019re talking about the creation of a digital panopticon, and the administration doesn\u2019t need Musk or even DOGE to do it.\nIt\u2019s also noteworthy that Musk was furious about his company xAI being excluded from a project to build what\u2019s being called the \u201cStargate AI campus\u201d in the United Arab Emirates. That deal, brokered by the administration, includes Oracle, Nvidia, Cisco, and Open AI \u2014 which is run by Musk\u2019s enemy and rival Sam Altman \u2014 and Musk threw a fit about his company not being included. But the deal wasn\u2019t changed. A few months ago, I just can\u2019t imagine the story going down that way. This was Musk\u2019s government, as much as it was Trump\u2019s, and that\u2019s not true anymore.\nSo, I think we should celebrate the fact that Musk has taken a major hit, and that everyday people and workers have inflicted that injury through advocacy and protest, and also keep swinging at him, while remembering that the fight is bigger than one man, even if he is the world\u2019s richest man.\nI think we\u2019re so used to losing and we sometimes feel like the other side is all powerful, but it turns out we actually have a lot of power and we need to be able to leverage the divisions that exist up above in order to go on the offensive and win our demands. So I think that what\u2019s happening with Musk is proof that we\u2019re at least moving in the right direction.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigrants has fueled legislation to restrict access to the ballot in more than two dozen states.",
        "Content": "Part of the Series\nVoting Wrongs\nAs part of a broader push to both vilify immigrants and suppress voting rights, Republicans in Congress and multiple states are pushing legislation requiring voters to produce documents, such as passports and birth certificates, to prove their citizenship before registering to participate in elections. Experts are warning that proof of citizenship bills would disenfranchise millions of people as President Donald Trump and his followers test the political viability of various voter suppression tactics ahead of the midterms, including legislation that would restrict ballot access and empower partisan politicians to interfere with election administration in a number of states.\nCitizenship is required by law to vote in state and federal elections, and experts have repeatedly found that votes cast by noncitizens are extremely rare. Those facts did not stop House Republicans, along with four Democrats, from passing the SAVE Act, which would require voters to produce documents, such as passports and birth certificates, to register for federal elections \u2013 a burden that could be particularly onerous on people who have discrepancies such as name changes between pieces of documentation. At least 160 similar bills have been introduced at the state level in 2025, making proof of citizenship one of the \u201cmost significant trends\u201d in lawmaking, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nWhile dozens have already proved unworkable and died in committee, the Voting Rights Lab is currently tracking 58 proof of citizenship bills across 26 states. Bills introduced in Arizona and New York would protect voters from citizenship requirements, but the vast majority restrict access to the ballot, and a handful would have a mixed or unclear impact, according to the Voting Rights Lab. Two states, Wyoming and Indiana, have already passed proof of citizenship laws this year, but the document requirements are not as limited and strict as those proposed in other red states.\nPro-democracy groups say proof of citizenship bills face pushback from voters wary of unnecessary red tape, pointing to the fact that such bills have stalled in states, such as Florida, Michigan, and Texas. They suggest the SAVE Act passed by House Republicans could prove deeply unpopular and potentially generate chaos in the 2026 midterms if it becomes law. Research shows that an estimated 21 million people do not have documents, such as passports or birth certificates, readily available, including 3.8 million who don\u2019t have those documents at all, often because they were stolen, lost, or destroyed.\nFor example, a proof of citizenship bill that has floundered in the Florida legislature would require even voters who have been registered for years to produce documents proving their citizenship, according to Amy Keith, executive director of Common Cause Florida, a nonpartisan watchdog group.\n\u201cThe bill did not discuss what Floridians could do if their birth certificate, you know, had a different name on it because they changed their name when they got married, or if they had lost their documents in a hurricane or another emergency,\u201d Keith told reporters on May 29. \u201cIt also attacked the IDs that voters could use when going to the polls; it would have removed student IDs, retirement home IDs, public assistance IDs, and others.\u201d\nIn Texas, Republicans have faced testimony from seniors, disabled voters, and rural residents who said the proof of citizenship requirements would make it more difficult to vote. Meanwhile lawmakers struggled to explain how their proof of citizenship proposals would be funded and implemented at election offices, according to Anthony Gutierrez, the executive director of Common Cause in Texas.\nGutierrez said bills introduced in both chambers of the Texas legislature were poorly written, leaving lawmakers confused about which documents would meet the new identification requirements as anxious voters peppered them with questions and concerns.\n\u201cIn the Senate and the House when we had committee hearings, the bill authors failed spectacularly to explain how it would be implemented \u2026 without inconveniencing a ton of voters of all different categories,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cThe bill author in the House, over and over was answering questions just incorrectly about her own bill.\u201d\nDespite a strong Republican majority, the Florida legislature has struggled to agree on a budget, let alone new voting rules. Gutierrez said the Texas GOP focused its political capital on passing a highly controversial private school voucher law, and the proof of citizenship bills remain stalled in committee, at least for now. However, Trump has attempted to ram through a topline voter suppression agenda with an executive order issued in late March alongside a flurry of proclamations designed to massively expand his own power.\nTrump\u2019s order essentially attempts to institute the SAVE Act by presidential decree rather than through Congress and orders federal election officials to require documents such as passports for voter registration. The order would also empower Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Department of Homeland Security to investigate and potentially interfere with election results. Democrats and voting rights groups challenged the order in court, and last month a federal judge issued a temporary injunction blocking implementation of Trump\u2019s executive order.\nThe Trump administration did not appeal the injunction, but taken together, Trump\u2019s order and the SAVE act serve a broader purpose of promoting bogus narratives about noncitizens voting illegally to sway elections. Such narratives are central to the racist \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory that animates the far right, including parts of Trump\u2019s base.\nThe attacks on voting rights have a long history, but have escalated since Trump lied about his loss in the 2020 election \u2013 a lie most Republicans professed to believe, even years after this loss. In addition to pushing legislation that erects barriers to the ballot, Republicans have aggressively pursued punitive legislation and policies in the name of \u201celection integrity\u201d that empower partisans and law enforcement to investigate far-fetched claims of fraud \u2014 and in some cases, blatantly intimidate election volunteers and voters in the process. After the 2024 elections, Republican candidates in states, such as Pennsylvania and North Carolina, fought in court to throw out thousands of mail ballots when election results did not go their way.\nDan Vicuna, the senior policy director for voting and fair representation at Common Cause, said bills introduced across the country in tandem with attacks on voting rights at the federal level are designed to create bureaucratic hurdles to voter registration, throw away lawfully cast mail-in ballots, and make it exceedingly difficult to use the ballot initiative process to pass reforms. These modern suppression efforts are the legislative ancestors of laws that banned women from voting, or kept Black voters from the polls with taxes and literacy tests in the Jim Crow era, Vicuna said.\n\u201cAs democracy advocates defeated these measures one by one, the devious campaign to upend democracy has gotten more creative in terms of tactics and narrative,\u201d Vicuna said. \u201cVote-suppressing politicians have developed neutral sounding voting restrictions that disproportionately impact communities they dislike.\u201d\nFor example, in North Carolina, lawmakers are considering a bill that would criminalize voter registration campaigns by making the use of official registration paperwork by volunteers a criminal misdemeanor. In Texas, lawmakers pushed to give the state\u2019s attorney general new powers to investigate allegations of election fraud without permission from local prosecutors. The legislation was introduced to empower Attorney General Ken Paxton, who aggressively enforces election restrictions and has sent armed police to raid the homes of elderly Latinx activists and get-out-the-vote volunteers. Lawmakers deadlocked ahead of a deadline on Saturday to complete a final version of the legislation, which now appears unlikely to pass, according to Vote Beat.\n\u201cThe ultimate goal of these laws is to ensure that the public cannot hold those elected officials accountable on election day,\u201d Vicuna said.\nOther policies that undermine voting rights \u2014 such as new laws that would cut back on the number of polling places, empowering partisan poll watchers to more easily chase conspiracy theories and challenge results \u2014 are already in place across a number of states.\nMeanwhile, blue states have worked to expand early voting and mail-in voting while making registration easier. A law in Illinois, for example, allows election officials to count mail ballots received up to two weeks after Election Day to account for any delays in delivery. The Supreme Court announced this week that it would hear a Republican challenge to the law arguing that all ballots must be counted on Election Day, a common legal tactic for throwing out mail ballots.\nIn Congress, Democrats have responded to the SAVE Act with their own bill, the Vote at Home Act, which would ensure that citizens can automatically register to vote at state motor vehicle offices, receive ballots in the mail ahead of elections, and have expanded options for voting by mail or casting a ballot in person. However, Democrats will need to win some elections before making their voting rights proposals a reality.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "\u201cHope Greta and her friends can swim!\u201d Senator Graham wrote on social media.",
        "Content": "Senior Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) openly fantasized about sinking a civilian ship staffed with activists aiming to deliver humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel is targeting and killing Palestinians trying to reach food and water.\nIn a post on X on Sunday, Graham shared an article about the ship bound for Gaza, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. The article reports that Greta Thunberg is on the ship, with the climate activist vowing to deliver the aid \u201cno matter what odds we are against.\u201d\nIn a heinous comment, Graham said: \u201cHope Greta and her friends can swim!\u201d\nThe post is a clear incitement of violence from the senator \u2014 who has a reputation for being a warmonger, especially with regards to the Middle East \u2014 against a civilian ship attempting to peacefully break Israel\u2019s humanitarian aid blockade to deliver much-needed supplies to a starving population. In that vein, it is also a clear call for Israel to continue blocking aid to Gaza, which experts have repeatedly said is a war crime.\n\u201cThis is [what happens] when you sell your soul to Zionism,\u201d said Palestinian journalist Abubaker Abed in a reply to Graham. \u201cWhat a cowardly and despicable creature you are to wish death upon a girl! One day, all of you will collapse like smelly mosquitoes. You are a cancer to the earth.\u201d\n\u201cStrange for a U.S. Senator to wish for what would be a terrorist attack on a civilian aid vessel,\u201d said Dylan Williams, vice president for government affairs for the Center for International Policy.\nGraham\u2019s comment is especially disturbing considering that a previous Freedom Flotilla ship with 16 activists on board was indeed bombed last month off of the coast of Malta. The group said that the Israeli military was responsible for the attack. Nobody was hurt, but the ship was severely damaged, and the aid mission failed. Thunberg was supposed to be on that ship, but wasn\u2019t.\nThunberg acknowledged the danger of the mission in a press conference before the activists set sail.\n\u201cWe are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying, because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And, no matter how dangerous this mission is, it\u2019s not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the livestreamed genocide.\u201d\nThe ship is staffed by 12 volunteers from several different countries, according to the group, carrying aid like baby formula, basic foods, and sanitary and medical supplies. Along with Thunberg, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Liam Cunningham and French member of Parliament Rima Hassan are on the ship.\nUN experts have called for the safe passage of the ship to deliver \u201cdesperately needed\u201d aid.\n\u201cAid is desperately needed for the people of Gaza to forestall annihilation, and this initiative is a symbolic and powerful effort to deliver it. Israel should remember that the world is watching closely and refrain from any act of hostility against the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and its passengers,\u201d experts said in a statement on Monday.\nIsrael has been allowing a small trickle of aid into Gaza for the past two weeks, after a nearly three-month total aid blockade on the region. However, Israel is still severely obstructing aid delivery by humanitarian groups, blocking the vast majority from reaching Palestinians.\nMeanwhile, Israel\u2019s supposed aid operation with the U.S. has led only to more death so far. The operation, carried out by the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and guarded by U.S. military contractors, has lured dozens of Palestinians to their deaths as Israeli forces open fire on crowds gathering in hopes of obtaining the paltry aid packages. This includes 31 Palestinians killed and over 170 wounded by Israeli forces on Sunday.\nEven before it was set up, that operation was boycotted and shunned by every humanitarian group operating in Gaza, who say that the only way to stave off yet more starvation and death in Gaza is for Israel to allow aid into Gaza through established routes. The UN warned on Friday that Gaza is the \u201chungriest place on earth\u201d and that 100 percent of the population is facing a risk of famine.\nThe U.S.-Israeli operation \u201cis a deliberate strategy \u2014 aimed at masking atrocities, displacing the displaced, bombing the bombarded, burning Palestinians alive and maiming survivors,\u201d said UN Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese in a statement Friday. \u201cAll camouflaged behind the language of aid, to divert international attention from legal accountability, in Israel\u2019s attempt to dismantle the very principles upon which humanitarian law was built.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "The cuts are part of a broader gutting of federal programs aimed at furthering environmental justice.",
        "Content": "Thomasville, Georgia, has a water problem. Its treatment system is far out of date, posing serious health and environmental risks.\n\u201cWe have wastewater infrastructure that is old,\u201d said Sheryl Sealy, the assistant city manager for this city of 18,881 near the Florida border, about 45 minutes from Tallahassee. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we do the work to replace this.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s expensive to replace. The system is especially bad in underserved parts of the city, Sealy said.\nIn September, Thomasville applied to get some help from the federal government, and just under four months later, the city and its partners were awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make the long-overdue wastewater improvements, build a resilience hub and health clinic, and upgrade homes in several historic neighborhoods.\n\u201cThe grant itself was really a godsend for us,\u201d Sealy said.\nIn early April, as the EPA canceled grants for similar projects across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track. Then on May 1, the city received a termination notice.\n\u201cWe felt, you know, a little taken off guard when the bottom did let out for us,\u201d said Sealy.\nThomasville isn\u2019t alone.\nUnder the Trump administration, the EPA has canceled or interrupted hundreds of grants aimed at improving health and severe weather preparedness because the agency \u201cdetermined that the grant applications no longer support administration priorities,\u201d according to an emailed statement to Grist.\nThe cuts are part of a broader gutting of federal programs aimed at furthering environmental justice, an umbrella term for the effort to help communities that have been hardest hit by pollution and other environmental issues, which often include low-income communities and communities of color.\nIn Thomasville\u2019s case, the city has a history of heavy industry that has led to poor air quality. Air pollution, health concerns, and high poverty qualified the surrounding county for the Biden administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative, which prioritized funding for disadvantaged communities. Thomasville has some of the highest exposure risks in Georgia to toxic air pollutants that can cause respiratory, reproductive, and developmental health problems, according to the Environmental Defense Fund\u2019s Climate Vulnerability Index. The city\u2019s wastewater woes don\u2019t only mean the potential for sewage backups in homes and spills into local waterways but also the risk of upper respiratory problems, according to Zealan Hoover, a former Biden administration EPA official who is now advising the advocacy groups Environmental Protection Network and Lawyers for Good Government.\n\u201cThese projects were selected because they have a really clear path to alleviating the health challenges facing this community,\u201d he said.\nCritics argue there\u2019s a disconnect between the Trump administration\u2019s attack on the concept of environmental justice and the realities of what the funds are paying for.\n\u201cWhat is it about building a new health clinic and upgrading wastewater infrastructure \u2026 that\u2019s inconsistent with administration policy?\u201d Democratic Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at a recent hearing.\nZeldin repeatedly responded by discussing the agency\u2019s review process intended to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders, particularly those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, but Ossoff cut him off, pushing for a specific answer about Thomasville\u2019s grant. \u201cIs a new health clinic for Thomasville, Georgia, woke?\u201d he asked.\nThomasville\u2019s Sealy said she understands that the federal government has to make hard funding decisions \u2014 that\u2019s true locally too \u2014 but losing this grant has left her city in the lurch. In addition to the planned work on the wastewater collection system, the city needs to update its treatment plant to meet EPA standards. That overhaul will likely cost $60 million to $70 million, she said.\n\u201cHow do you fund that?\u201d Sealy asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t fund that on the backs of the people who pay our rates.\u201d\nThe funding cuts have left cities across Georgia \u2014 including Athens, Norcross, and Savannah \u2014 as well as nonprofit groups, in a state of uncertainty: some grants terminated, some suspended then reinstated, some still unclear. This puts city officials in an impossible position, unable to wait or to move forward, according to Athens-Clarke County Sustainability Director Mike Wharton.\n\u201cDo you commit to new programs? Do you commit to services?\u201d he said. \u201cHere you are sitting in limbo for months.\u201d\nLike Thomasville, Athens was also awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant. The city was going to use the money for backup generators, solar power, and battery storage at its public safety complex \u2014 ensuring 911, police, the jail, a domestic violence shelter, and other services could all operate during a power outage. That grant has been terminated.\nThe problem, Wharton said, goes beyond that money not coming in; the city had already spent time, resources, and money to get the grant.\n\u201cWe spent $60,000 in local funding hiring people to write the grants,\u201d he said. \u201cOver a period of 14 months we invested over 700 hours of local personnel time. So we diverted our services to focus on these things.\u201d\nThese frustrations are playing out for grant recipients throughout the state and country, according to Hoover. He said it\u2019s not just confusing \u2014 it\u2019s expensive.\n\u201cThey are causing project costs to skyrocket because they keep freezing and unfreezing and refreezing projects,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the big drivers of cost overruns in any infrastructure project, public or private, is having to demobilize and remobilize your teams.\u201d\nThomasville and Athens officials both said they\u2019re appealing their grant terminations, which require them to submit a formal letter outlining the reasons for their appeal and requesting the agency reconsider the decision. They\u2019re also reaching out to their elected officials, hoping that pressure from their senators and members of Congress can get them the federal money they were promised.\nOther cities and nonprofits, as well as a group of Democratic state attorneys general, have sued, arguing that terminating their grants without following proper procedures is illegal. But that\u2019s a difficult step for many localities to take.\n\u201cSuing the federal government to assert your legal rights is very daunting, even if the law is on your side,\u201d Hoover said.\nThis article originally appeared in Grist.\nGrist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

        "Summary": "The provision will make it so only the well-to-do would be in a good position to launch legal challenges against Trump.",
        "Content": "A single paragraph buried deep in a spending bill that passed the GOP-controlled House of Representatives earlier this month is causing growing concern among democracy watchdogs who warn the provision will make it so only the well-to-do would be in a good position to launch legal challenges against a Trump administration that has shown over and over again its disdain and disregard for oversight or judicial restraint of any kind.\nComing just about half-way through what President Donald Trump has dubbed the Republican Party\u2019s so-called \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d \u2014 which progressive critics point out is a giant giveaway to the nation\u2019s wealthiest at the expense of the working class and the common good \u2014 the language in question is slight, but could have far-reaching impacts.\nOn Saturday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted in a detailed social media thread how the provision \u201chasn\u2019t gotten nearly enough scrutiny\u201d from lawmakers or the public.\nA recent piece by USA Today columnist Chris Brennan put it this way:\nOne paragraph, on pages 562 and 563 of the 1,116-page bill, raised alarms for reasons that have nothing to do with America\u2019s budget or safety-net programs or debt. That paragraph invokes a federal rule for civil court procedures, requiring anyone seeking an injunction or temporary restraining order to block an action by the Trump administration to post a financial bond.\nWant to challenge Trump? Pay up, the provision said in a way that could make it financially prohibitive for Americans to contest Trump\u2019s actions in court.\nHRW details how the provision, if included in the final legislation, \u201cwould make it more expensive to fight Trump\u2019s policies in court by invoking a federal rule that effectively punishes anyone willing to stand up against the administration.\u201d\nAnyone seeking a legal action that would involve an injunction request against a presidential order or policy, the group said, would to face a much larger barrier because Republicans would make it so that anyone challenging Trump in court in this way would \u201chave to pay up in the form of a posted bond \u2014 something many people can\u2019t afford to do. That means only the wealthy will be able to even attempt to challenge the most powerful man in the country.\u201d\nErwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, was among the first to highlight the buried provision, calling it both \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cterrible\u201d in a May 19 essay in which he argued that the ultimate effect of the provision is to shield members of the administration from contempt of court orders through the extraordinary limit on those who can bring challenges in the first place. Chemerinsky writes:\nBy its very terms this provision is meant to limit the power of federal courts to use their contempt power. It does so by relying on a relatively rarely used provision of the Rules that govern civil cases in federal court. Rule 65(c) says that judges may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order \u201conly if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\u201d\nBut federal courts understandably rarely require that a bond be posted by those who are restraining unconstitutional federal, state, or local government actions. Those seeking such court orders generally do not have the resources to post a bond, and insisting on it would immunize unconstitutional government conduct from judicial review. It always has been understood that courts can choose to set the bond at zero.\nGiven his critique, Chemerinsky argued, \u201cThere is no way to understand this except as a way to keep the Trump administration from being restrained when it violates the Constitution or otherwise breaks the law. The House and the Senate should reject this effort to limit judicial power.\u201d\nHuman Rights Watch appeared to agree with the profound dangers to the rule of law if the provision survives to Trump\u2019s desk for signature.\n\u201cThis is yet another sign of Trump\u2019s brazen attempts to stop the judicial branch from holding him accountable,\u201d the group warned. \u201cThis is what autocrats do. Consolidate power, increase the penalty for objecting, ultimately making it more difficult \u2014 eventually impossible \u2014 to challenge them.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Conservative think tanks are building a body of &ldquo;research&rdquo; meant to question the safety of the abortion pill.",
        "Content": "Using flawed studies and scientific journal publications, abortion opponents are building a body of research meant to question the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, a key target for the movement.\nThe effort comes as federal officials have expressed a willingness to revisit the drug\u2019s approval \u2014 and potentially impose new restrictions on a medication used in the vast majority of abortions.\nMainstream medical researchers have criticized the studies, highlighting flaws in their methodology and \u2014 in the case of one paper published by the conservative think tank Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) \u2014 lack of transparency about the data used to suggest mifepristone is unsafe. The vast body of research shows that the drugs used in medication abortion, mifepristone and misoprostol, are safe and effective in terminating a pregnancy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a proliferation of anti-abortion propaganda right now. I think it is a coordinated attack on mifepristone,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco who studies medication abortion.\nReleased in April, the EPPC paper suggests that mifepristone results in serious adverse events for 1 in 10 patients \u2014 substantially higher than the widely accepted figure of .3 percent complication rate most research has attributed to the pill. The paper appears to count what other researchers say are non-threatening events, such as requiring follow-up care to complete the abortion, or visiting an emergency room within 45 days of an abortion \u2014 even if the patient did not end up requiring emergency care \u2014 as serious adverse effects. That paper also did not go through peer review, a standard process for scientific research in which other scholars review a study\u2019s findings and methodology before it can be published.\nAnother paper, a commentary piece published this week in the journal BioTech, challenges the commonly cited statistic that mifepristone has a lower complication rate than acetaminophen, or Tylenol, tracing the history of the comparison and arguing that it is mathematically flawed. The paper\u2019s author, Cameron Loutitt, is a biomedical engineer by training and director of life sciences at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a research arm of the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America.\n\u201cMy hope is that this paper sparks action in my peers in the research and medical community to more critically evaluate these unfounded claims regarding abortion drug safety,\u201d Loutitt said in a statement.\nDays later, a group of researchers from the institute published another study, this one arguing that emergency rooms are likely to identify medication abortions as miscarriages, which they say increases the risk of needing hospital care.\nA miscarriage and a medication abortion are medically indistinguishable, and patients will sometimes visit an emergency room to ensure the drugs worked, or if they suspect possible complications. In places where abortion is illegal, patients may also tell health care providers they experienced a miscarriage to minimize their legal risk. Studies like the Lozier Institute paper suggest complications from medication abortions are being undercounted.\nThat study was rejected by another journal on April 12 before being published this week, noted Upadhyay, who had served as a peer reviewer in that rejection process. A similar paper written by many of the same researchers behind the Lozier Institute\u2019s was retracted a year ago by the journal that published it, along with two others suggesting mifepristone was unsafe.\n\u201cThey keep trying to publish the same junk science,\u201d Upadhyay said.\nJames Studnicki, the Charlotte Lozier Institute\u2019s director of data analytics, who led the second of its new anti-abortion papers and the study retracted last year, did not respond to a request for comment. But a spokesperson for the institute said the organization is challenging last year\u2019s retraction through an arbitration process. This March, Studnicki said in a statement that the retraction placed \u201cpolitics over publication ethics.\u201d\nThese studies and papers all fall outside the scientific consensus. More than 100 studies over decades of research have found that mifepristone \u2014 and the medication abortion regimen as a whole \u2014 has a low complication rate and is very safe to use for abortions. Papers like these aren\u2019t new, and their scientific accuracy has long been questioned. But the bevy of new reports and analyses comes at a moment when abortion opponents may have more influence in shaping public policy.\nMifepristone restrictions are a top priority for the anti-abortion movement. About two-thirds of all abortions in the United States are now done using medication. Even in states with abortion bans, pregnant people have increasingly turned to abortion medication, which they receive from health providers in states with laws protecting abortion.\nNationwide, about 1 in 5 abortions are now performed using telehealth; almost half of those are for people in states with bans or restrictions. Mifepristone is currently approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before a Senate committee that he has directed the Food and Drug Administration to review the approval of mifepristone, citing the EPPC paper specifically. Jim O\u2019Neill, who is nominated for a deputy secretary role, has also said he is in favor of a \u201csafety review\u201d of the drug \u2014 a move that could result in new restrictions on how it is prescribed.\nMeanwhile, physicians and researchers are highlighting the rigor of the FDA approval process.\n\u201cFDA approval of mifepristone must reflect the rigorous clinical evidence that has proven unequivocally that it is safe and effective for use in medication,\u201d 13 reproductive medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said in a statement after Kennedy indicated the drug may undergo a new FDA review. \u201cMifepristone has been used for decades for abortion and miscarriage management by millions of patients, and complications are exceedingly rare, minor, and most often easily treatable.\u201d\nThe International Institute for Reproductive Loss, an anti-abortion nonprofit, has explicitly prioritized the publication of research that supports restrictions on medication abortion. Presenting at an anti-abortion conference last September, that organization\u2019s science director, Priscilla Coleman, highlighted strategies that she said could help result in the retraction of studies showing mifepristone\u2019s safety, such as finding \u201cagenda-driven, poorly developed and conducted studies published in peer-reviewed journals\u201d and writing to journal editors. Coleman did not respond to a request for comment.\nThough no scientific consensus has changed, anti-abortion lawmakers have rallied around the suggestion that complications are common. In a private Zoom meeting reported on by Politico, abortion opponents cited the EPPC paper as a potential tool to justify further restrictions on mifepristone \u2014 even while acknowledging that the report is \u201cnot a study in the traditional sense\u201d and \u201cnot conclusive proof of anything.\u201d\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, cited the EPPC paper in a letter to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who had only a day before the report\u2019s publication indicated openness to reviewing mifepristone\u2019s approval if new evidence emerged.\n\u201cThe time to act is now. It is time to revisit and restore the FDA\u2019s longstanding safety measures governing mifepristone,\u201d Hawley wrote. His office did not reply to a request for further comment.\n\u201cThey\u2019re producing this terrible \u2018science\u2019 because they don\u2019t have any real science that backs them up. And all they\u2019ve gotten from the administration is, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019ll study it,\u2019\u201d said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who has advised state legislatures on crafting abortion-protetctive laws.\nThrough the courts and Trump administration, abortion opponents have pushed to reverse a 2021 FDA decision allowing mifepristone to be distributed via telehealth. In addition to calling for the in-person requirement to be reinstated, abortion opponents are asking for restrictions such as the dispensation of the drug to require three in-person visits, and for mifepristone to only be approved for use only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Many have also argued the drug should be taken off the market entirely.\nThe Trump administration said on the campaign trail that it would leave abortion policy up to the states. So far, there has been little indication from the federal government that such changes are imminent.\n\u201cPills are kind of just spreading, as we predicted, without almost any restriction and so far the anti-abortion movement hasn\u2019t figured out what to do,\u201d Cohen said.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "When it comes to critical minerals, Trump wants to keep the US in, China out and everyone else down.",
        "Content": "The clean energy transition that the Biden administration touted as the focus of its industrial policy required large amounts of mineral inputs. Batteries for electric vehicles depend on lithium, solar panels contain gallium and molybdenum, and powerful magnets in wind turbines can\u2019t be built without rare earth elements. Biden\u2019s landmark legislation, such as the 2022 Inflation Adjustment Act, effectively resurrected industrial policy in the United States but this time on the basis of a shift away from fossil fuels.\nDonald Trump, since taking office in early 2025, has swung U.S. policy back again toward oil, gas, and coal. But the Trump administration is no less interested in securing access to minerals. After all, the same \u201ccritical minerals\u201d necessary for the Green transition are coveted by the Pentagon for use in nearly all high-tech weapon systems. The United States depends on foreign sourcing for nearly all of these mineral inputs. And the country that controls the lion\u2019s share of these resources \u2014 as well as the processing of them \u2014 is China. The Pentagon is particularly uncomfortable with China\u2019s potential to hold major U.S. weapons systems hostage.\nTwo regions that have figured prominently in Donald Trump\u2019s mineral ambitions are Ukraine and Greenland. These two areas, one a country at war and the other a semi-autonomous possession of Denmark, couldn\u2019t be more different. Greenland is the world\u2019s largest island. Covered mostly with ice, it has a population of fewer than 60,000 people. Ukraine has a smaller land mass but is a major industrialized country and a top agricultural producer, with a current population of about 37 million people.\nFrom Donald Trump\u2019s point of view, the two regions share a key attribute: they are, in the lexicon of Wall Street, assets ripe for a takeover. Ukraine has been weakened by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion and has come to rely heavily on U.S. military assistance and intelligence. Greenland, without a military of its own, has been angling for independence from Denmark.\nDuring his first 100 days in office, Trump spoke of acquiring Greenland and didn\u2019t rule out a military intervention. With Ukraine, the U.S. president complained that the country was taking U.S. weapons without giving back anything in return. In one of his classic transactional moves, Trump proposed that Ukraine pay its \u201cdebt\u201d with the mineral resources beneath its soil.\nTrump\u2019s interest in both regions is not purely mineral.\n\u201cWhen President Trump has said several times now that the United States is going to get Greenland one way or another, it\u2019s not always clear what the primary driver is,\u201d explains Klaus Dodds, \u201cAt times, for example, we\u2019ve been told it\u2019s on the basis of international security. On other occasions, minerals and energy security have been explicitly cited. Actually, what perhaps was underpinning all of this was a desire to make sure that China never established any kind of economic, political, infrastructural foothold in Greenland.\u201d\nAs for Ukraine, the agreement over minerals that was finally reached at the end of April didn\u2019t ultimately contain a provision requiring Ukraine to pay down its \u201cdebt\u201d with minerals. Rather, it spelled out in vague detail how the sale of the country\u2019s minerals \u2014 and other natural resources like fossil fuels \u2014 would go toward economic development under the joint supervision of the United States and Ukraine. The Trump administration also hoped the deal would be a preliminary step in reaching a ceasefire in the fighting between Russia and Ukraine.\nFrom Ukraine\u2019s point of view, however, the agreement has some problematic elements. \u201cThere is nothing in this agreement regarding the contribution of the United States in the form of investment in a fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine,\u201d explains Volodymyr Vlasiuk. \u201cAlso, there is nothing in this agreement about Ukraine capturing the maximum value of the minerals extracted in the territory of Ukraine.\u201d\nAs both president and businessman, Donald Trump is using the power of his company (the United States) to strong-arm weaker partners into lopsided agreements. In Greenland\u2019s case, he is even considering a hostile takeover. As Dodds and Vlasiuk explained at a Global Just Transition webinar in early May, U.S. policy has as much to do with the acquisition of valuable minerals as it does with the U.S. effort to achieve a geopolitical edge, primarily over China.\nU.S. Policy Toward Greenland\nThe United States has a longstanding military relationship with Greenland that dates to 1941 when, after Nazi Germany occupied Denmark, Washington sent troops to the island to construct air bases and weather stations. A decade late, a 1951 treaty gave Washington the formal right to build military bases there and move around freely as long as it gave notice to both Greenland and Denmark. The United States currently maintains the Pituffik airbase \u2014 previously Thule \u2014 that serves as an early-warning system for missile attacks. After a jet bomber carrying four nuclear bombs crashed onto the ice in the northern part of Greenland in 1968, it was revealed that the United States was also using the Thule base as part of its nuclear strategy, with tacit Danish consent.\nGeopolitics and minerals were a dual priority from the beginning. \u201cDuring the Second World War and in the early years of the Cold War, the United States was well aware of the strategic resource potential of Greenland,\u201d Klaus Dodds points out. \u201cAnd that partly explains why Harry Truman offered to purchase the island in 1946. At that time, the interest was largely in cryolite, which was essential to the manufacture of aluminum.\u201d\nA mining operation in Ivituut, the largest source of naturally occurring cryolite, sent 86,000 tons of the mineral to the United States and Canada in 1942. The mine closed in the mid-1980s. Much of the wealth from the sale of cryolite ended up in Denmark, which remains a point of tension between the island and the Danish government.\nBut that conflict pales in comparison to the disruption that Donald Trump has caused, first with his stated desire during his first term to buy the island, and then with his continued threats to acquire Greenland when he returned to power in 2025. In both cases, he has been rebuffed by both Denmark and Greenland.\nAgain, minerals seem to be of great interest to Trump, in this case the promise of critical minerals, including rare earth elements. According to a Danish study, the island has 31 of the 34 minerals identified by the EU as critical.\nBut accessing those minerals will not be easy. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history of mining and extraction in Greenland,\u201d Dodds explains. \u201cIf President Trump thinks that critical minerals or rare earths are going to be exploited at some point during his second administration, he\u2019s likely to be disappointed. Mining, particularly in remote, challenging areas, is a long-term project. And Greenland is a textbook example of why these things are challenging, why they\u2019re often expensive, and why also politics can complicate things.\u201d\nGreenland offers a number of physical challenges. It is very cold, and sites might be accessible only part of the year, depending on location. The mines are likely to be remote, and there isn\u2019t much in the way of infrastructure to access those mines. There is a skills shortage as well on the island.\nThen there\u2019s the bureaucracy. \u201cIf you look at the experience of licensing, which the government of Greenland is very much in control of, the vast majority of companies and entities that have taken up some kind of license have ended up being disappointed,\u201d Dodds adds. \u201cThat\u2019s true of oil and gas. That\u2019s also true of other minerals.\u201d\nGreenland currently only has two operational mines. Companies have invested in other mines, and some have spectacularly failed, like the effort of the Australian outfit Energy Transition Minerals that, with Chinese investors, plowed $100 million into a rare earth element mine. Because these minerals are often intermingled with uranium, community opposition to the environmental consequences of this particular enterprise led the government to pull the plug. The company is now suing either to get approval to resume operations or to get compensation to the tune of four times Greenland\u2019s annual GDP.\nMany Greenlanders want independence from Denmark, a trend that Trump seems to want to exploit. \u201cIf Greenland were to become independent, many Europeans will worry that the United States will try to shape that independence or make sure that it becomes an independent island state under very, very close U.S. supervision,\u201d Dodds points out. Meanwhile, Greenland retains a lot of autonomy short of independence, \u201cand government ministers there have continued to stress that Greenland is open for business and that openness does not necessarily preclude Beijing. So, I predict that American pressure on Greenland and Denmark will continue.\u201d\nU.S. Policy Toward Ukraine\nDonald Trump spent a lot of time on his presidential campaign complaining about all the weapons the Biden administration was supplying Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. As president, Trump became fixated on getting Ukraine to pay off the \u201cdebt\u201d it had supposedly accumulated from these deliveries of arms. When apprised of Ukraine\u2019s mineral wealth, he began to push Ukraine to sign a deal that would deliver to the United States at least some of the profits from those extracted minerals.\nUkraine holds as much as 5 percent of the world\u2019s supply of critical raw materials, though what is known about Ukraine\u2019s mineral wealth comes largely from Soviet-era geological exploration. It\u2019s one of the top five countries in terms of its graphite deposits, and it contains one-third of Europe\u2019s lithium. It also has significant amounts of titanium and rare earth elements. According to Forbes Ukraine, the total value of this mineral wealth is nearly $15 trillion.\n\u201cWe have to be very careful about such a figure,\u201d Volodymyr Vlasiuk pointed out. \u201cThis is the whole value of all the deposits of all the minerals in Ukraine. The value of critical minerals is much less than this.\u201d\nVlasiuk divides these critical minerals into three categories: for batteries (lithium, graphite, manganese), for semiconductors (gallium, germanium, metallic silicon), and for strategic construction (titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium). Ukraine has a significant portion of these materials: in the case of both lithium and graphite, for instance, Ukraine has roughly 4-5 percent of the world reserves.\nAll these minerals add up to a lot of potential money. The first group, Vlasiuk estimates, is worth about $200 billion, the second about $44 billion, and the last about $12 billion. Together, that adds up to about $250 billion \u2014 a considerable figure, but considerably less than $15 trillion. Also, some of the deposits are in the Russian-occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces.\nThree factors make Ukraine\u2019s deposits appealing, not just to the United States but to the European Union and to China. The resources are available in good quantities and of sufficient quality for industrial processing. Because of Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 transportation, energy \u2014 the deposits are relatively easy to access (at least, those not in the occupied territories). \u201cWe can get easy access to these deposits, maybe by constructing 5-10 kilometers of road or adding a few kilometers to the electricity grid,\u201d Vlasiuk added. \u201cThis is in contrast, for instance, to Siberia or Greenland.\u201d\nFinally, Ukraine offers minerals at a competitive cost and the mining projects will be economically efficient.\nBut processed materials are worth a great deal more than raw materials. If Ukraine produces semi-finished products with these minerals, it could boost the total value to $678 billion, Vlasiuk estimates. Meanwhile, finished products would yield nearly $1.4 trillion. Ukraine is already involved in the production of electrolytes, separators, and graphite rods for electric smelting furnaces, and could supply the nearby European Union. \u201cSo, it\u2019s very important to capture the value added through this downstream process,\u201d he concludes.\nBut much depends on the recent agreement signed with Washington and the resulting United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund. The Ukrainian parliament approved the deal unanimously \u2014 but only after the objectionable sections of earlier proposals were removed. In this final version, the United States has committed to investing capital in Ukraine to build up the extractive sector \u2014 including gas and oil \u2014 and all revenues for the first decade will be reinvested in Ukraine. The United States, meanwhile, gets preferential access to what\u2019s produced.\nThe Role of China\nBehind all of this maneuvering lies China. The United States has two primary concerns: the control that China exerts over the critical minerals supply chain and the spread of its geopolitical influence in places like Ukraine and Greenland.\n\u201cPresident Trump has been very clear that he thinks the United States faces an existential threat in the form of China,\u201d Klaus Dodds notes. \u201cTrump absolutely wants to keep China out of Greenland. Remember, Greenland did flirt with Chinese investment. There was talk at one stage about China investing in airports there and maybe even purchasing an abandoned naval station.\u201d\nShift the focus away from minerals and toward seafood and China suddenly becomes a lot more significant. \u201cChina has next to no physical presence In Greenland, full stop,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut the most important export of Greenland is seafood, and China is the key market. If Greenland wants to become an independent country at some point, and I believe it does, then it\u2019s got to do two things. One is to find a replacement for the block grant, which is an annual transfer of about 500 million euros from Denmark. Second, you don\u2019t want to alienate unnecessarily your biggest consumer of seafood.\u201d\nChina is also a key partner for Ukraine. \u201cChina is the second biggest external trade partner after the European Union,\u201d Volodymyr Vlasiuk reports. \u201cAfter Russia disappeared from our radar, China became a major consumer of Ukrainian foodstuffs \u2014 wheat, corn, sunflower oil.\u201d China has in the past offered loans to Ukraine, such as a $3 billion \u201cloan for corn\u201d deal in 2012 and a $15 billion loan for construction in 2015. During the current war, however, China has focused on partnering with Russia, though it also remains poised to be part of Ukrainian reconstruction once the war ends.\n\u201cChina\u2019s a powerful country, and this creation of trade barriers by Mr. Trump is not a very good step,\u201d Vlasiuk continues. \u201cFrom the economic point of view, nobody benefits from this, including the United States. Such barriers make it difficult for countries to benefit from world trade, to achieve an economic impact from globalization.\u201d\nHe adds that \u201cit\u2019s quite obvious that the United States and the European Union have lost time while China has made a very impressive step forward to reach these deposits and to take the control of global supply chains. China continues to look around the world for more deposits. It is very active in the Africa and the Middle East. And, of course, there is closer cooperation between China and Russia. There are a lot of Chinese workers in Russia. China is profiting a lot from buying Russian natural resources at a cheap price. Putin wants China to invest in the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, but so far China has refused. But I am sure that China will use this war to reach deposits in Russia, which will make China even more powerful in controlling the value chain of these critical minerals.\u201d\nMore Geopolitics\nChina is not the only geopolitical consideration. For Donald Trump, the acquisition of territory is an obsession. Trump considers Greenland to be integral to the U.S. sphere of influence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth recalling that this is a president who likes maps, globes, charts,\u201d Klaus Dodds points out. \u201cAs everybody knows, the Mercator projection makes Greenland look even bigger than it is. It\u2019s three times the size of Texas, but it\u2019s probably not quite as big as Donald Trump thinks it is. Trump wants to be immortalized in U.S. history as the president who made America bigger: the Trump Purchase, if you will.\u201d\nThe Cold War pitted two superpowers in a race for resources around the world, particularly in the Global South. Today, this tension is being replayed by the United States and China. \u201cTo a certain extent, there\u2019s a certain sort of deja vu to all of this,\u201d Dodds continues. \u201cThe names change, but the impulse remains the same: to create \u2018supply chain resilience,\u2019 which is the term we use nowadays. With the Kennedy administration, for instance, when it came to places like Ghana, bauxite loomed large, for aluminum smelting, which was also linked to dam construction because of the enormous amount of power and cooling required. Today, it\u2019s the Democratic Republic of Congo where there is a scramble for influence that involves China, the European Union, the United States, and also regional actors such as Rwanda.\u201d\nOn the Ukrainian side, geopolitics boils down to defeating Russia and moving closer to the European Union. The mineral agreement \u201cgives Trump the instrument to continue to support Ukraine with military equipment,\u201d Volodymyr Vlasiuk points out. \u201cWithout this cooperation, the risk would increase of a cessation of U.S. military aid.\u201d\nBut the agreement could contain some potential pitfalls for Ukraine. The United States could still try to condition future military assistance on the delivery of an equal amount of mineral wealth as a quid pro quo. Or Washington could focus on the extraction of primary materials and discourage Ukraine from processing the ore or producing finished products, thus depriving the country of considerable value. \u201cIn terms of the operation of this fund, Ukraine and the Ukrainian people should benefit as the owners of these deposits and derive the maximum value added in Ukraine,\u201d Vlasiuk maintains.\nAlso, he continues, \u201cit\u2019s very important that this agreement should not create any barriers for Ukrainian access to European Union. Our European Union colleagues would also like to make a win-win project in the exploration and processing of these deposits. But with this agreement, the Americans would like to take a dominant position in order to choose the most attractable deposits for future processing. So, we have a very difficult job ahead of us. We need to be careful. We would like the West and East to cooperate and for there not to be a split between democratic and not-so-democratic countries, especially in such an explosive form as on our territory. But it\u2019s not our choice.\u201d\nEnvironmental and Labor Considerations\nAlthough most pictures of Greenland feature sparkling ice, polar bears, and imposing mountain range, the Arctic is not pristine.\n\u201cWhen you look at ice cores taken from the Greenlandic ice sheet, what you discover is a record of traces of lead and other pollutants going back to the Roman era,\u201d Klaus Dodds reports. \u201cGreenland has borne the brunt in one form or another of past centuries of extraction and use of various minerals, which are trapped in Greenlandic ice. Because of melting, these pollutants are making their way through the island and into the neighboring sea.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s the more recent history of mining. \u201cThere were lead and zinc mines in Greenland going back 50 or 60 years,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd they are still causing pollution-like consequences, particularly in certain parts of southern Greenland. There is a legacy of toxic mining. People haven\u2019t forgotten this, and they\u2019re living with those consequences because in some cases those mines were not that far away from communities. So, there was a very public shift, a visceral reaction against uranium extraction in the aftermath of a longer history of unhappiness over the toxic consequences of mining.\u201d\nOn the labor question, Greenland has a small population. Any significant mining operation will require foreign laborers. \u201cThis is not unique to Greenland, but it does create anxieties about importing the labor force,\u201d Dodds notes. \u201cWhere are these people going to be staying? How are they going to be supported?\u201d\nThe European Union\u2019s environmental standards apply to Greenland (through Denmark). But they also exert influence on Ukraine, which hopes to accede to the EU as quickly as possible.\n\u201cThe development of mining and processing of critical minerals is not friendly to the environment,\u201d Volodymyr Vlasiuk points out. \u201cEspecially, for example, the processing of lithium ore in the form of spodumene concentrate. In our business plan, we mention that pollution is the costlier part of the project. But now, after seven years, we have discovered that there are much more effective technologies that ensure that this processing is less dangerous for the environment. We want to cooperate with more technologically developed countries so that they will invest as much as possible in the technology that reduces this pollution in Ukraine.\u201d\nVlasiuk adds that Ukrainians are often well aware of environmental consequences and have mounted protests accordingly. \u201cSo, it\u2019s very important to have political support and local support and to explain the benefits and that the pollution will not be dangerous for either health or social stability.\u201d Ukraine, he notes, also has a skilled labor force and specialists who can do the work.\nCorporate Interest\nWith the exception of mining corporations owned by the state\u2014in China, Vietnam, Tanzania, Chile\u2014private corporations are responsible for the bulk of mineral extraction around the world: BHP Group (Australia), Rio Tinto (Australia-UK), Glencore (UK), Vale (Brazil), Freeport-McMoRan (U.S.).\n\u201cGreenland in the recent past has had no shortage of companies interested in both minerals and oil and gas,\u201d Klaus Dodds says. \u201cExploration licensing over the last 20-odd years has been genuinely a multinational affair: North American companies, Australian, European.\u201d Some of those companies have included Green Rock, Amaroq, and Critical Minerals Corporation. Most recently, the government inked a deal with a Danish-French consortium to mine anorthosite, a substitute for bauxite.\n\u201cIn 2021,\u201d Dodds continues, \u201cwhen the elected government of Greenland moved away from uranium mining, it left some companies rather exposed and, in at least one case, profoundly irritated by the loss of millions of dollars spent on drilling and investment.\u201d\nCorporations are also not the most reliable sources on the value of their enterprises. \u201cThis is not an island that has been lacking when it comes to mapping, surveying, and resource valuation,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn many parts of the world, and Greenland is absolutely typical, there is a tendency on the part of commercial enterprises to engage in boosterism. When you read various estimates about what the rare earth value might be of Greenland, you might alight upon figures of $30 billion, $70 billion. I would treat this with a degree of healthy skepticism. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that companies have tried to talk up the value of their licenses and their investment.\u201d\nOutside corporations are also lining up to have the opportunity to access Ukraine\u2019s mineral wealth \u2014 particularly because of the accessibility of these deposits. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll not give you the concrete names of the companies,\u201d Volodymyr Vlasiuk says, \u201cbut I can say that companies from the United States, Germany, and Japan are interested a lot in investing in Ukraine deposits. In 2013-4, both Shell and Chevron entered Ukraine to explore and extract shale gas.\u201d The Chinese, meanwhile, have been interested in Ukrainian coal.\nWhat hasn\u2019t happened yet, according to Vlasiuk, is Russian exploitation of mineral resources in the occupied territories. However, in January, Russian forces occupied Shevchenko in the Donbas, home to one of Ukraine\u2019s largest lithium deposits.\nIn terms of the new U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement, it will be the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) that will serve as the U.S. partner along with Ukraine\u2019s State Organization Agency on Support of Public-Private Partnership. \u201cAs I understand, this financial corporation as a state entity can also invest and will have very close contact to other U.S. investors,\u201d Vlasiuk concludes.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Slashed and paused funding, mass firings and information purges have destabilized crucial infrastructure for survivors.",
        "Content": "Over the last four decades, the United States has built a web of federal policies and funding to address domestic and intimate partner violence, a pervasive health and safety crisis.\nIn just 130 days, the Trump administration has put that safety net in jeopardy.\nFunding pauses, cuts, firings and information purges have destabilized the infrastructure that helps victims of abuse. At the same time, federal teams dedicated to preventing sexual violence are being decimated. Departments in charge of administering grants that fund shelters for those fleeing assault have been deemed \u201cduplicative, DEI or simply unnecessary.\u201d\nThe first budget recommendation proposed by the administration of a man found liable for sexual abuse suggests eliminating the team tackling rape prevention and education. It takes a limited view of who is worthy of help to flee abuse. These changes limit how federal funds can be used to support survivors and emphasize criminal consequences for perpetrators over a more holistic view of justice.\nThe federal government has long recognized domestic violence and violence between romantic partners as a critical public health and safety issue. Four out of every 10 women say they\u2019ve experienced violence at the hands of an intimate partner, according to a survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among men, a quarter reported being victims. Intimate partner violence can be deadly, particularly for women: More than half of all women homicide victims are killed by a current or former partner, according to a CDC study.\nIn 1994, Congress recognized violence against women as a national crisis and passed a law that supercharged the government\u2019s funding and attention to the issue. They haven\u2019t solved the problem \u2014 but lawmakers and advocates say the Violence Against Women Act and its predecessor, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, have been essential to the protection of victims and the decline in violent crime.\nTightening the Purse Strings\nFederal grant programs are the lifeblood of domestic violence services programs \u2014 and they have been threatened since the day Trump returned to office.\nHis executive orders on gender and \u201cillegal\u201d diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility led to lists of banned words. Federal departments raced to sanitize their communications, eradicating decades of research and data.\nMeanwhile, the Office of Management and Budget issued a short-lived freeze on funding distributions pending evaluation of programs for compliance with executive orders. Nonprofits that relied on federal funds to provide services to victims of domestic violence scrambled for legal advice: Was their budget at risk because they had a pride flag on their website? Did they also have to erase all mentions of banned words?\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline, which is largely funded by appropriations from the Department of Health and Human Services, removed resources for LGBTQ+ survivors from its website. The majority of state domestic violence coalitions, the umbrella organizations that support direct service providers, took their websites offline \u2014 though when asked if it was related to Trump\u2019s actions, most declined to answer on the record.\nSo far, there has only been one reported case of a grant from the Office on Violence Against Women being revoked, but hundreds of grants already issued by the Office of Justice Programs were abruptly canceled because they no longer aligned with the administration\u2019s priorities. Even while some of the cuts were reversed, the moves created uncertainty that makes it impossible for victims services organizations to plan, increasing the stresses of work that is already difficult and traumatic.\nThen it was not just current funding, but future provisions that came under fire. The Office on Violence Against Women removed all open notices of funding opportunities from its website on February 6. New versions weren\u2019t released for three months, disrupting the grant cycle that must conclude by September 30, the end of the government\u2019s financial year. Revised notices included major changes to department priorities and a longer list of activities ineligible for funding.\nThe U.S. attorney general has the authority to prioritize areas for grantmaking. Notices posted before Trump took office didn\u2019t have any; now applications are given bonus points in the review round if they \u201ccombat human trafficking and transnational crime, particularly crimes linked to illegal immigration and cartel operations\u201d or seek to improve services in small towns, rural areas or tribal nations.\nThe section defining what is ineligible for funding has ballooned. In addition to complying with executive orders on gender and DEI, the new restrictions put forth a more limited view of interventions around domestic violence. Activities that \u201cframe domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses (e.g., prioritizing criminal justice reform or social justice theories over victim safety and offender accountability)\u201d are banned, as well as activities that \u201cdiscourage collaboration with law enforcement.\u201d Initiatives that \u201cprioritize illegal aliens over U.S. citizens\u201d are also not allowed.\nRita Smith, an international expert on violence against women, is publicly raising the alarm about these changes. As the Office on Violence Against Women announces new grants on LinkedIn, Smith reshares them to her large network with a warning.\n\u201cI think if people apply for these grants and they get them, it may open them up to the kind of scrutiny that they\u2019re not used to getting from the Department of Justice,\u201d Smith said in an interview. She\u2019s worried that organizations will be subject to intrusive data collection or information gathering, especially around the immigration status of their clients.\nSmith used to work in direct services, and now has a more administrative role in the movement against domestic violence. \u201cWe never required anyone to show us their immigration papers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for documentation if people said they were in danger. If they processed through the intake questions that we had, and we determined that they were in danger, we gave them shelter.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask them for a green card. We didn\u2019t ask them for visas. We just brought them in to make them safe.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s priorities conflict with some recent moves to better reach diverse populations. The 2022 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act created a funding scheme for culturally specific service providers, which are tailored to the needs of Asian, Black, Native American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander or Latinx survivors. But how are those organizations supposed to operate when DEI is banned? How can nonprofits supporting LGBTQ+ survivors do their work without acknowledging the trans community? Guidance remains piecemeal and oftentimes unofficial \u2014 no one knows exactly how to bulletproof their organization.\nSmith sees the new restriction on funding as a way to redefine who is a victim in the eyes of the federal government. The requirements are so onerous that it can make it hard for nonprofits to serve their purpose: helping people escape violence.\nSome organizations have made the decision to refuse federal funds because it comes with conditions antithetical to their mission. But the gaps left will be hard to fill.\nWith CDC Cuts, Federal Prevention Efforts Decimated\nWhen the Trump administration fired nearly every federal employee within the CDC\u2019s Division of Violence Prevention, it did away with the only team at the federal level working specifically on domestic and intimate partner violence prevention.\nThe program they oversaw \u2014 called DELTA, or Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancements and Leadership Through Alliances \u2014 was first created in 2002 to harness federally funded research and expertise on the causes of intimate partner violence, along with the connections of state and local domestic violence groups, so fewer people become victims in the first place.\nGetting that work off the ground asked already strained groups trying to serve victims to shift some of their energy to prevention work, but staff at the CDC at the time, and until April, remained committed to what one laid-off worker referred to as the \u201ccultural norms change\u201d that\u2019s a key part of preventing domestic and intimate partner violence.\nUnder DELTA, which currently funds 13 state-based domestic violence networks, the CDC helps state groups implement prevention programs and measures how successful they are at preventing violence.\n\u201cIf you remember taking a class on healthy relationships, or seeing PSA about domestic violence, or anything like that in your school or communities \u2014 those are some examples of our prevention work,\u201d said one former federal worker within the Division of Violence Prevention who was part of the administration\u2019s \u201creduction in force.\u201d They declined to be named out of fear of losing their remaining federal benefits.\n\u201cPeople, I think, sometimes take it for granted, because it\u2019s just something that\u2019s there. But those kinds of things are going to go away, and no one is going to be there to teach our kids about healthy relationships or help communities reshape the norms around what\u2019s acceptable in how we treat one another.\u201d\n\u201cAll of that stuff will be gone.\u201d\nThe administration has not clawed back funding for the current budget year from the 13 DELTA states, but staff in those states are doing without the expertise of staff at the CDC. The Trump administration has proposed slashing DELTA altogether next year, alongside the other programs under the Division of Violence Prevention, calling the spending \u201cduplicative, DEI, or simply unnecessary.\u201d\nThe Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which receives nearly half a million dollars in funding through DELTA, said the funding cut would be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d DELTA \u201cis the only dedicated federal funding source for the primary prevention of domestic violence and a critical tool for driving real, lasting change,\u201d said Jennifer Beittel, a spokesperson for the group.\nHema Sarang-Sieminski, the executive director of Jane Doe Inc., the Massachusetts sexual assault and domestic violence coalition, said their CDC grant managers were all laid off. She found their advice and expertise invaluable; the team created resources for working with LGBTQ+ survivors and culturally specific communities. Jane Doe Inc.\u2019s grant was for five years, and Sarang-Sieminski just reapplied, as required for year two. It\u2019s unclear what support her organization will have moving forward.\nOf the 61 million women nationwide who say they\u2019ve experienced violence at the hands of a romantic partner, 16 million reported first experiencing it before they turned 18. The administration\u2019s staffing cuts and proposed budget cuts would also hit the CDC\u2019s team focused on teen dating violence.\nThat team developed a program called \u201cDating Matters,\u201d the first comprehensive teen dating violence prevention effort in the United States using funding appropriated by Congress. The funding came after several high-profile cases of dating violence, in particular the 2005 death of Rhode Island student Lindsay Ann Burke, whose boyfriend was convicted of her murder. Her parents became advocates for teen dating violence education efforts, arguing that their daughter may not have had enough information about the dynamics of abusive relationships before her death.\nOne longitudinal study on 6th through 8th graders across four cities that adopted the CDC\u2019s Dating Matters model for middle school found that by the 11th grade, the program had no only reduced dating violence, but also sexual violence, harrassment, substance use and delinquency. In 2024, the team published a guide specifically for LGBTQ+ youth, who face higher rates of dating and sexual violence.\nIn January, after Trump took office, those resources were deleted to comply with the executive order on \u201cradical gender ideology.\u201d By April, the whole team had been laid off.\nAn update and rebrand of the Dating Matters program was slated to publish later this year, but it\u2019s unclear who will carry it to the finish line.\n\u201cDating Matters consumed a lot of my life and it was destroyed for no reason whatsoever,\u201d said Sarah DeGue, senior scientist in the Division of Violence Prevention, who led the CDC\u2019s Dating Matters program for the last decade. \u201cAmerican teens are in the midst of a mental health crisis. \u2026 This is the absolute worst possible time to eliminate effective programs and resources that teach kids healthy relationship skills.\u201d\nDeGue was part of the administration\u2019s so-called \u201creduction in force.\u201d Since leaving the CDC, she has started her own consulting firm focused on violence prevention and is uploading deleted resources to her firm\u2019s website.\nThe former CDC employee who declined to make their name public said they hope lawmakers can intervene to protect the work. \u201cI believe that there are still people in Congress, in our government at that level who care\u2026 But not the Trump administration. I don\u2019t believe that at all.\u201d\nStrategies of Resistance\nIn his first term, Trump only floated cuts to the Office on Violence Against Women and didn\u2019t follow through. Now, groups are acutely aware of how many people will suffer \u2014 and die \u2014 without the funding that makes their services possible.\nTwo prominent lawsuits are challenging the constitutionality of these specific cuts. The American Bar Association won a preliminary injunction in a case alleging its five grants from the Office on Violence Against Women were canceled as retaliation for suing the administration. The $2 million of outstanding grants were to employ seven people to provide training to legal practitioners working with survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.\nFORGE, the only domestic violence services nonprofit dedicated solely to assisting transgender and nonbinary survivors, relies on the federal government for 90 percent of its operating budget. In February, it joined other LGBTQ+ organizations in suing the Trump administration over the constitutionality of the executive order about gender. In April, the Office of Justice Programs canceled FORGE\u2019s grants \u2014 over $500,000 in total \u2014to produce a toolkit for providers working with trans victims of crime and a project addressing anti-trans hate .\nArguments in FORGE\u2019s case were held on May 22 in a California district court. An order is expected soon.\nThe federal funding freeze in January spooked Jane Doe Inc., Sarang-Sieminski said. Worried about conflicting with executive orders, the nonprofit took its website down. But after two days, it put the site back online.\nReflecting on their core mission of racial equity is what changed the staff\u2019s minds, Sarang-Sieminski said. The site still has sections tailored to LGBTQ+ and immigrant survivors and speaks about building a more equitable world. \u201cIt\u2019s so through and through who we are that we felt like there\u2019s nothing that we really could possibly take down that would protect us in any meaningful way,\u201d she said. Taking down the website would \u201conly do further harm to communities who are counting on us to speak up and to be present and available when others refuse to.\u201d\n\u201cWhat keeps me up at night is thinking about the stories we will tell about this time looking back,\u201d Sarang-Sieminski said. \u201cThis is liberatory work, and what we want to see is a world where we can all thrive. And to me that means not leaving folks behind and standing up for our fundamental principles around this work.\u201d Half of the organization\u2019s funding is dependent on federal grants, but she doesn\u2019t want that to \u201ccloud our judgment around our values.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Democratic Reps. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin and Debbie Dingell of Michigan, and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, will join a coalition of intimate partner and sexual violence groups for a day of action on Capitol Hill to discuss the importance of federal funding. Both Moore and Dingell have led several letters to the administration pushing back on funding delays and staffing cuts.\n\u201cI am horrified,\u201d said Moore, who has detailed her experience as a victim of domestic violence. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not intentional, but it\u2019s very dangerous as a survivor of domestic violence \u2014 a survivor in the days where there was no crisis line to call, \u2026 no information to be able to stand up for yourself. There was no shelter to go to.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much progress in the last decade,\u201d Dingell said. \u201cWe\u2019re going backwards, and it really scares me.\u201d\nDomestic violence services remain operational throughout the United States.

        "Summary": "The Palestinian town of Umm al-Fahm is on the frontlines of the struggle against Israeli state terror and genocide.",
        "Content": "As images of burned children, starving families, and bombed hospitals in Gaza become the constant soundtrack of daily life, the Palestinian communities that survived the Nakba and stayed in the lands that were occupied by Israel in 1948 (hence called \u201c\u201948 Palestinians\u201d), are filled with anger, frustration, and a sense of hollowness and disempowerment. Against the general paralysis, Umm al-Fahm, the main Palestinian city in \u201cthe Northern Triangle region,\u201d stands out.\nPalestinian activists in the town, united around the local \u201cpopular committee,\u201d keep trying to break the barriers of repression and fear that have taken hold in their community since October 7. The last attempt was on Saturday, May 24.\nThe popular committee in Umm al-Fahm called for a national demonstration backed by the Higher Follow-Up Committee of the Arab Public \u2014 the united leadership of \u201948 Palestinian communities \u2014 alongside the Committee for Solidarity with the Administrative Detainee Raja Eghbarieh.\nThe invitation for the demonstration came under three slogans: \u201cWe stand with our people! No to ethnic cleansing and genocide! Freedom to the teacher Raja and all other detainees!\u201d\nEven as the demonstration was licensed, the police did not let it end peacefully. As we gathered in Dawar al-\u2018Uyun, plainclothed \u201cdetectives\u201d started to attack demonstrators and tear down some banners that they did not like. I noticed specifically that they objected to such banners as \u201cNo to Genocide\u201d and \u201cNo to Ethnic Cleansing.\u201d\nThis practice, where the police decide to censor the banners in a demonstration, is typical of the current blatant hostility of the police under the command of extreme right-wing National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Even as the demonstrators do not initiate any confrontation, the local police want to prove their militancy to their higher command. They claim that some banners \u201cmight disturb public order\u201d and attack the people who carry them.\nWhen we wanted to start marching, the police blocked the road. There were some pushes and shoves, and people began circumventing the police. Finally, the police understood that it would not be simple to stop the demonstration, and \u201cremembered\u201d that our march was originally permitted.\nOne of the conditions of licensing demonstrations these days is that the Palestinian flag cannot be raised. As we were marching, the police noticed that some demonstrators were holding (not raising) the flags. They broke up the crowd violently and tore them from the hands of those holding them. In the chaos that ensued, they violently arrested a demonstrator.\nUmm al-Fahm on the Frontlines\nIt is no surprise that Umm al-Fahm is where \u201948 Palestinians most consistently try to organize protests against the genocide in Gaza. Descending from a long history of struggle, Umm al-Fahm is where Abnaa al-Balad, the radical left Palestinian movement, was born in 1969. The city has also been the center and unassailable fortress of the \u201cNorthern\u201d Islamic Movement, which Israel outlawed in 2015. Naji al-Ali, the revolutionary Palestinian cartoonist, once wrote that \u201cUmm al-Fahm is the nom de guerre of Palestine.\u201d\nIn the early 2020s, \u201848 Palestinian communities were subjected to the terror of extortionist criminal gangs groomed by the Israeli internal intelligence service, the Shabak. The people of Umm al-Fahm responded with a rare example of popular mobilization against organized crime and societal violence in the community. New youth initiatives united with old political leaderships to organize mass demonstrations against the police\u2019s complicity with the criminal gangs. The same \u201cFahmawi\u201d unified movement reached new peaks during what we call \u201cHabbat al-Karameh,\u201d or the \u201cuprising of dignity\u201d of May 2021, also called the \u201cUnity Intifada.\u201d The mass protest that started with the struggle against ethnic cleansing in Jerusalem\u2019s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood quickly developed into a unified struggle across all of historic Palestine from the river to the sea.\nThe first demonstration of \u201948 Palestinians against the genocide in Gaza was held in Umm al-Fahm on October 19, 2023 \u2014 we tried the day before in Haifa, but were immediately repressed. The Umm al-Fahm police used this anti-war demonstration to frame two prominent leaders of the youth movement against criminality, Muhammad Taher Jabareen, and the attorney Ahmad Khalifah. They were arrested, tortured, and indicted for \u201cincitement to terrorism.\u201d Ahmad and Muhammad spent four and eight months in prison, respectively, and now remain under partial house arrest while they await sentencing.\nThe Spirit of Struggle Returns to the Streets\nOver the last year and a half, as Israel\u2019s war crimes continue to escalate, the Popular Committee of Umm al-Fahm continues to initiate street protests to try to pull the public out of the state of terror, hoping to turn despair into action. Most of these protests take place, almost weekly, in the central circle near the entrance to the city, in front of the new municipality building. Usually, there are dozens of participants from the city and the surrounding villages.\nWe have a group of activists in Haifa that keeps trying to demonstrate against the genocide, but we are regularly attacked and dispersed by the police, so we have made a habit of joining the demonstrations in Umm al-Fahm. We meet there with activists from other regions within \u201848, all coming to encourage the most consistent effort at organizing anti-genocide activity by \u201948 Palestinians. Some of those who regularly join are radical activists from the Jewish society in Palestine, who are used to volunteering as \u201chuman shields\u201d in the West Bank, trying to protect Palestinians against attacks by the occupying army and the settlers.\nFor more than half a year after October 7, it was totally impossible for Palestinians to receive a license for any kind of anti-war demonstration. As time passed, the Umm al-Fahm popular committee succeeded in getting one, and over the last year, the High Follow-Up Committee held several \u201cnational marches\u201d in Umm al-Fahm, in which hundreds of demonstrators participated.\nLast January, the Follow-Up Committee wanted to organize a demonstration in Sakhnin, the center of the Galilee, but they could not get a license.\nAfter Israel broke the ceasefire with Gaza with ever more deadly attacks, the Popular Committee decided to move a step further, calling for the next anti-war demo to be held at the entrance of Umm al-Fahm near Route 65, connecting Tel Aviv with the Eastern Galilee. The street, also known as Wadi \u2018Ara road, was shut down by Palestinian demonstrators on many important occasions in the past. While shutting down roads is not uncommon in demonstrations in Israel and is usually \u201ccontained\u201d by the police, the possibility that Palestinians would engage in such actions is seen by the regime as a \u201csecurity threat.\u201d\nOn April 5, instead of the usual dozens who attend most anti-war demonstrations, hundreds gathered near the main road. The police were surprised, declaring that the gathering was illegal, but they did not have the force to disperse it. The main road was not blocked, but it resulted in a tense standoff. It felt like the spirit of struggle had returned to the streets.\nAfter midnight on April 9, Israeli police and the Shabak forces stormed the house of Raja Eghbarieh, 63, the leader of Abnaa al-Balad in Umm al-Fahm, and the most prominent historical leader of that movement. After a week-long interrogation by the Shabak, and after they could not prove any offence, he was transferred to administrative detention \u2014 imprisonment without charge or trial.\nAt the beginning of the war, hundreds of \u201948 Palestinians were arrested. Most of them were charged with \u201cincitement to terror\u201d based on social media posts that were sympathetic to the people of Gaza. As \u201csecurity prisoners,\u201d they were thrown, together with thousands of their fellow prisoners from the West Bank, to the occupation\u2019s notorious dungeons. At the instruction of the extreme rightwing government and the anti-Palestinian public hysteria, these prisons became ruthless torture centers in a way that is historically unprecedented. While at the beginning of the war, there were many indictments and few administrative detentions in \u201948, the Shabak has recently expanded the usage of administrative detention.\nFor Palestinians from the West Bank, the number of administrative detainees went up from the hundreds to the thousands after October 7. We do not know the real numbers in \u201848 Palestine, as most of the detainees\u2019 families are terrorized into silence and fear that any publicity would invite retribution on their loved ones. Yet the number of known cases continues to increase by the dozen.\nThe detention of Eghbarieh is considered a significant escalation for \u201848 Palestinians, as it is clearly aimed at the Palestinian political leadership. With his detention, the ghost of administrative detention finally had a name and a face that could be published. This helped to organize the struggle. The demonstrations that followed in Umm al-Fahm were not only against the genocide in Gaza, but also against administrative detention.\nThe next time that the popular committee called for a demonstration near the Wadi \u2018Ara Road on the main entrance to Umm al-Fahm on May 10, the police decided not to let it happen. They threatened the organizers that if they pressed on with the demonstration, every single participant would be arrested. It was clear that this time the police would be there in great force, and the consequences could be severe. The organizers decided to cancel the demonstration at the last minute.\nThere was another inner circle demonstration on May 17, and then the latest national march on May 24. The confrontation at the May 24 demonstration, which marched as planned despite police provocations and a last-minute attempt to block it, was another step in the consistent efforts to break the silence that has prevented solidarity with Gaza.\nWill the Rest of the Country Take Heart?\nAlongside the genocide in Gaza and the increasingly violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, Israel has also intensified its policy of demolishing Arab houses, infrastructure, and commercial buildings inside the \u201cGreen Line\u201d. Tens of thousands of homes, all over the country, are under demolition orders. In the Naqab, where there are hundreds of unrecognized Palestinian Bedouin \u201cconcentrations,\u201d demolition of Palestinian homes is the main priority of the regime, as the police initiate high publicity campaigns to destroy whole villages.\nThe \u201cwar\u201d atmosphere and the general terrorization of the population has impeded resistance to the demolitions. But on Thursday, May 29, there was an unprecedented general strike of the Palestinian population in the Naqab. On the morning of the general strike, thousands gathered in the regional capital of Bir al-Sabe\u2019 for a spirited demonstration in front of the government offices responsible for land confiscation and ethnic cleansing in the region.\nOn the same night, in the town of Arraba al-Batof at the center of the Galilee, hundreds responded to the call of the local popular committee and gathered to defend the home of one of the residents from a pending demolition. The house was saved, at least for now.\nFinally, after a long political and legal struggle, a broad coalition of movements and NGOs, the Communist Party most prominent among them, received a license to march in Haifa against the war for the first time since October 7. The demonstration is set to take place today, May 31, and the organizers expect wide participation.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "The coalition behind the lawsuit challenging Trump welcomed the ruling and slammed the assault on the federal workforce.",
        "Content": "The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday night kept in place a block on President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts for massive firings and agency restructuring across the federal government, saying a far-reaching executive order signed in February went way beyond his constitutional authority and that the potential harm caused by the terminations warrants the hold while legal challenges continue to play out in the courts.\n\u201cThe Executive Order at issue here far exceeds the President\u2019s supervisory powers under the Constitution,\u201d the appeals court wrote in its 2-1 decision.\nThe majority decision, written by Senior Circuit Judge William Fletcher, noted that while \u201cthe President enjoys significant removal power with respect to the appointed officers of federal agencies,\u201d the kind of far-reaching approach represented by Trump\u2019s executive order \u201chas long been subject to Congressional approval.\u201d\nAccording to the Associated Press:\nThe Republican administration had sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued by U.S. Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco in a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities, including San Francisco and Chicago, and the group Democracy Forward.\nThe Justice Department has also previously appealed her ruling to the Supreme Court, one of a string of emergency appeals arguing federal judges had overstepped their authority.\nIn a statement late Friday, the coalition behind the lawsuit that challenged Trump\u2019s order \u2014 which includes nationwide labor unions and non-profit groups as well as cities and counties in California, Illinois, Maryland, Texas, and Washington \u2014 welcomed the ruling as it once again slammed Trump\u2019s assault on the nation\u2019s federal workforce and the rule of law.\nThe 9th Circuit\u2019s decision, the coalition said, \u201crightfully maintains the block on the Trump-Vance administration\u2019s unlawful, disruptive, and destructive reorganization of the federal government.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s actions, the statement continued, \u201chave already thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services to people and communities across our nation. Each of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government \u2013 laying off federal employees en masse and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that. We are gratified by the court\u2019s decision today to allow the pause of these harmful actions to endure while our case proceeds.\u201d\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s reckless attempt to dismantle our government without congressional approval threatens vital services Americans depend on every day \u2014 from caring for veterans and safeguarding public health, to protecting our environment and maintaining national security,\u201d said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union, the nation\u2019s largest federal worker union and a party to the suit, in response to the ruling. \u201cThis illegal power grab would gut federal agencies, disrupt communities nationwide, and put critical public services at risk. AFGE is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with this coalition to protect not just the patriotic public servants we represent, but the integrity of American government and the essential services that our nation deserves.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "A new book offers an inside look at incarceration at Rikers Island, from intake to release.",
        "Content": "Since 1964, the predominant site of city time for men in New York City has been the C-76 building, short for its original city budgetary designation as \u201cCapital Project Number 76.\u201d Alongside its numeric designation, C-76 was first dubbed the New York City Reception and Classification Center, then the Correctional Institution for Men, and is known today as the Eric M. Taylor Center (EMTC). Among COs and inmates, it is usually called \u201cthe Six building\u201d or simply \u201cthe Six.\u201d The grounds of this low-slung facility sprawl horizontally across thirty acres on the southwest side of the island, near the primary staff parking lot and the mouth of the bridge connecting Rikers to East Elmhurst, Queens. Its facade is brick dappled with shades of beige and brown and punctuated by steel-framed windows, slatted with seven panes of grubby glass that open obliquely, like vents, with the laborious rotations of an inmate-operated hand crank. C-76 is comprised of three sections, the North Side and the South Side, which opened in 1964, and the Annex, which opened in 1970. The North Side contains two floors of traditional cell blocks, four in total, boasting 136 cells. This is the kind of special accommodation afforded to \u201cprotective custody\u201d inmates like Lil Wayne, who spent eight months there in 2010.\nThe vast majority of the building\u2019s approximately 1,850 beds, however, are spread across twenty-eight rectangular dormitories, massive open rooms with stationary single beds, connected to the main building only on one side. This so-called chevron design gives the building the distinct aerial shape of three Ks, with two joined back-to-back by the number eight. These dormitories are identified by a number from one through twelve, denoting distinct three-story structures emanating from the building, along with the level (lower, main, or upper). 12-Main, for instance, is stacked between 12-Lower and 12-Upper, and overlooks 11-Lower, 11-Main, and 11-Upper across a disused courtyard. From many dormitories and passageways of C-76, prisoners may gaze at the Manhattan skyline, the comings and goings of nearby LaGuardia Airport, and the vanishing point where the Buono Bridge connects Rikers to the freedom of the outside world.\nC-76 is a building of long corridors of polished tile, concrete, and glazed block, connecting dormitories with a high-school-style cafeteria, cage-lined infirmary, institutional chapel, visiting area, mailroom, disused recreation gymnasium, basement barber shop, and other spaces for sustaining and reproducing the jail. The hallways are streaked with a red line on either side, creating a narrow passage close to the wall, to which inmates are supposed to confine themselves. When moving in supervised groups, they are instructed to cling to the right-hand side of the hall, a behavior that quickly becomes second nature. Multiple checkpoints, complete with metal detectors and sometimes locked doors, stretch the passage from one end of the jail to the other, though these are often abandoned and most inmates are free to roam the halls without restraints or accompaniment, provided they can account for their destination if asked.\n\u201cIf you grow up in the projects and the public school system and then go to Rikers Island, it almost feels like no big deal. It feels like, oh, we know this setting. I\u2019m willing to bet that the same architect designed all three things,\u201d explains hip-hop artist Fat Joe in Rikers: An Oral History. Fat Joe would absolutely win that bet, at least when it comes to C-76: its architecture firm, Brown & Guenther, also designed a number of public schools and housing projects in the Bronx and throughout the city. This is also a common sentiment expressed by those familiar with the island. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I worked in a jail setting that I realized the \u2026 colors on the walls were the same colors used in the hallways and stairwells in the projects,\u201d writes former Rikers CO C. Ren\u00e9 West. \u201cA color I would call institutional gray, drab yellow, or drab yellow and orange colors. The floor areas in jails are very similar to the lobby areas in many of the project apartment buildings; and the inmate\u2019s housing areas have the same tiles on the floor.\u201d Working as CO, West came to suspect that the message this architecture sent to inmates from New York City\u2019s housing projects was, \u201cWelcome home.\u201d\nThe lion\u2019s share of city time at C-76 plays out in its dormitories. The dormitories of its Annex, typical of the facility, measure 72.5 by 50 feet, and feature space for sixty-four beds. At the entrance to the dormitory sits a narrow hallway gated on both sides by heavy doors meshed with weathered iron. The so-called A gate leads outside, while the \u201cB gate\u201d leads into the house. This hallway contains a storage closet and the COs\u2019 private bathroom, both of which are usually locked. Situated on one side of the entrance hallway is the day room, a small metal- and plexiglass-enclosed common area open in the daytime, where inmates can watch television, play games, eat meals, or, in some dorms, simply sit at a proper table and chair. On the other side is the bathroom. In some houses, semi-opaque plexiglass and metal grating provide only partial privacy for the inmates\u2019 bathroom, showers and all. At the mouth of this hallway is the COs\u2019 station, commonly called \u201cthe Bubble,\u201d an enclosure best compared to a toll booth. There the so-called A officer engages with inmates from behind plexiglass, fielding requests for razors, ibuprofen, toilet paper, and permission to leave the dormitory, along with episodic romantic attention, while the \u201cB officer\u201d holds court at a small table set up just in front, on the floor of the dorm.\nBeyond the Bubble and into the depths of the dormitory stretches Broadway, a six-foot-wide corridor bisecting C-76\u2019s rectangular barracks. On either side of Broadway sit rows of rusted iron bed frames, four to each side, situated roughly three feet apart and bolted to the floor. Their harsh surface is evenly dotted with ventilation (or drainage) holes; a low lip around its perimeter keeps the mattress in place. Narrow aisles branching off Broadway create sections of eight beds apiece, with roughly five feet in the middle, which often becomes social space with an explicit sense of community, including hostility to outsiders. In some houses, a low divider provides a modicum of privacy between the heads and feet of respective beds, but there is in any case little privacy to be had in the dormitories where city time is served. \u201cHere is the somber monotony of a world created to lock up everything with security, suspicion and certitude,\u201d wrote former Rikers chaplain Pierre Raphael, \u201cto put everything in boxes and pigeonholes, far removed from every kind of fantasy or initiative.\u201d\nC-74: The Robert N. Davoren Center\nDavid spent most of his time at C-74, the Robert N. Davoren Center (RNDC), which has primarily functioned since its 1972 opening as an adolescent facility. Though just across the street, C-74, which dwarfs C-76, stretching across fifty acres to its immediate east, might as well be a world away. Like C-76, it is a building of chevrons and long corridors, and from the outside, largely resembles C-76: three stories of nondescript brick in \u201cwarm buff color\u201d and endless rows of steel-frame louvered windows. This facility has two central wings, emanating in an obtuse V shape from a cluster of support facilities, thirteen-hundred feet in each direction. When it opened in 1972, RNDC counted 1,080 cells and a single dormitory. In the early 1980s, DOC added 300 beds in three \u201cmodule\u201d (or \u201cmod\u201d) dormitories that stretched across the chevrons, along with 108 cells.\nRNDC is generally known as \u201cthe Four building\u201d or simply \u201cthe Four.\u201d But, confusingly, the chevron-shaped wings projecting from the main hallway are known in C-74 jargon as \u201cbuildings.\u201d Thus, an inmate in C-74 may speak of \u201cthe Six building,\u201d meaning the chevron-shaped wing of C-74 bearing this number, only to have the person he is speaking to interpret this as C-76, which is another facility entirely. The same problem arises with \u201cthe Five building,\u201d as this is both a wing in C-74 and a nickname for AMKC, or C-95, another facility on Rikers. To avoid this confusion, inmates in C-74 who are acquainted with the problem will sometimes refer to the other two facilities using the \u201cC,\u201d as in \u201cC-76,\u201d rather than simply \u201cthe Six\u201d or \u201cthe Six building.\u201d\nEach \u201cbuilding\u201d in C-74 has a north side and a south side, designated by those names. They each have three floors, meaning that people in C-74 speak of housing units such as \u201c6\u2013Upper North,\u201d or \u201c6\u2013Upper South,\u201d \u201c4\u2013Main South,\u201d \u201c4\u2013Lower North,\u201d and so on. The two arms of the V-shaped main RNDC structure itself are likewise referred to as \u201cNorth Side\u201d and \u201cSouth Side,\u201d despite their intersecting at an almost- right angle. The North Side contains buildings 2, 4, and 6, and Mods 4 and 6. The South Side contains buildings 1, 3, and 5, as well as Mod 5. The 1 building was closed during David\u2019s time in C-74, and housed no inmates. The mods are essentially giant two-story trailers joined to the main hallway by a short corridor with a gate. The mods contain four dorms of approximately fifty beds \u2014 Mod 4\u2013Lower North has forty-eight beds, and Mod 4\u2013Lower South, fifty.\nMost of the spaces designed for functions other than warehousing humans can be found at the crux of the North Side and the South Side. Here, a three-way intersection is closed off by a series of gates operated by a CO in a plexiglass control booth, from which a red light can be seen flashing during C-74\u2019s daily occurrence of \u201calarms.\u201d This booth affords a view down both main hallways as well as toward the shorter hallway from which emanate the DOC staff area, social-services office, clinic, visiting floor (including a blind-turn staircase that has allegedly been the site of many stabbings and slashings over the years), Intake, and kitchen. The North Side, where David was held, affords access to the kitchen, or \u201cKK,\u201d mail room, chapel, and upstairs gym, the staircase descending to the \u201cPeace Center,\u201d downstairs gym and yard, video-visiting/remote-court center, office of the captain on duty, commissary, and mess hall. The South Side hallway affords entrances to the chaplains\u2019 offices and the law library.\nSurfaces are largely the same in C-74 as they are in C-76: the walls in the main halls are made of the same glazed block, coated in eggshell enamel. The floor is also polished concrete, and also bears a bright red line running parallel to the wall with a few feet\u2019s worth of distance between the two, across which inmates are instructed not to walk when moving to and from the housing units. The walls have a handful of uncaulked seams large enough for rats to crawl through. They bear the occasional feeble attempt at inspiration via thoroughly uninspiring murals: a child behind barbed wire reaching for an enormous butterfly, a formerly incarcerated man going to college and becoming a suit-toting professional, and even an abstract splatter-paint work. Every seventy-five feet or so on the walls of the main hallway, a warning appears, stenciled in black block letters:\nATTENTION ALL INMATES\nDONT SUBJECT YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO ARREST\nBY ASKING THEM TO SMUGGLE\nDRUGS OR CONTRABAND INTO THE FACILITY\nC-74\u2019s buildings contain cell blocks, not dorms, but otherwise strongly resemble the wings of C-76. The mods are completely different from the buildings. Entering Mod 4 from the main hall, one passes through a double door that can be locked, but rarely is, and then immediately encounters a barred black metal gate. Beyond this sits \u201cthe bridge,\u201d the empty landing-like space in front of the Bubble and between the two dorms on either side. An inmate must get the attention of the Bubble officer, usually by yelling \u201cOn the gate!\u201d or simply \u201cYo, CO!\u201d to get the gate open, as it is controlled from inside the Bubble.\nThe outer surface of the Bubble is equipped with a small black scanning device so inmates can scan their ID wristbands upon entering or exiting the dorms. The door to each dorm has a plexiglass window, perhaps two and a half feet square. Entering the dorm, one finds the day room straight across, along with the \u201cday room corner\u201d section, a stretch of perhaps ten bunks in the front of the dorm, running from the entrance to the day room along the concrete block wall separating it from the main space of the dorm. There are also two small columns here, which provide some relative degree of privacy for certain bunks and from certain angles \u2014 about as good as privacy gets in this environment.\nThe columns, like the walls of Mod 4, are clad in rough white plastic paneling, likely PVC, held together at regular intervals by flat white plastic seams and round button-like fasteners, a sort of tamper-resistant plastic rivet. This is a far cry from any surface in C-76, or the original C-74 structures. The windows, too, are remarkably different \u2014 unlike the louvered windows present elsewhere, these are actual sliding windows with heavy-duty metal screens and diamond-pattern metal grates, commonly referred to as \u201cbars.\u201d\nTurning away from the day room to look down the length of the dorm, one finds the bulk of the sleeping space: one line of bunks along the inner wall, which separates the sleeping space from the bathroom, and another along the outer wall, prized for its windows. One bed in particular, \u201cthe corner bed,\u201d sits in the far corner of the outer wall and the short end wall capping the length of the dorm. This bed is unanimously accepted as the dorm\u2019s best real estate, as it has no neighbor on one side, as well as two windows.\nOn the opposite end of the real-estate social scale are the \u201cBroadway beds\u201d: a double row of bunks running head-to-toe down the middle of the dorm, between the two lines of wall beds. \u201cSleeping on Broadway\u201d is largely reviled because one has practically no space to call one\u2019s own. The mod bathrooms offer slightly more privacy than those in EMTC, but only thanks to the inmates\u2019 creative reappropriation of the environment. Yet as a rule, personal space is all but nonexistent. This is the case because city time is a world of forced sociality, whether the inmate likes it or not.\nRemembering Our Numbers\nIt was a bout of short-stay incarceration that inspired Jamaican musician Toots Hibbert to pen the song \u201c54\u201346 That\u2019s My Number.\u201d In it, Hibbert reflects both on his own experience with incarceration and on the profound realization that, at the exact moment he is singing, someone else stands in his state-issued shoes. \u201c54\u201346 was my number,\u201d Hibbert croons, \u201cright now, someone else has that number.\u201d As our own experiences with city time recede into the past, and increasingly take on the contours of a strange and awful dream, we must emphasize that the subject matter of this book is being lived by real people as we write, and, barring the creation of a liberated society free from human cages, as you read it. Every morning the lights come on, and every night they go off. All the while, the boundless complexities of human sociality play out within the harsh confines of grubby concrete walls. Rikers Island is, after all, a 24/7 operation. Short-stay incarceration most often sends people back to the streets within a few months, but city time never stops.\nIntake\nCity time begins with intake, when the new inmate is processed into the jail. Intake is found in many institutions, including workplace training for new hires in almost every occupation and orientation for new students at universities. The particular type of orientation that takes place in jail, however, is characterized by the surrender of legally recognized freedom, the inculcation of a new set of statutes and customs to replace those in the outside world, and, above all, the violent compulsion \u2014 usually just below the surface, but sometimes overt \u2014 to accept one\u2019s place in this new order.\nSociologist Erving Goffman evoked the medieval concept of civiliter mortuus to describe the intake process as the moment of \u201ccivil death,\u201d when a person forfeits the formal rights of an ordinary citizen and becomes a prisoner. New arrivals undergo a process of \u201closs and mortification\u201d; they are stripped of their outside possessions, including their street clothing and personal grooming equipment, are issued a number that will be more significant than their name, and are issued Spartan institutional clothing and grooming supplies to replace those they use on the outside. Also lost is the emotional comfort that comes from items representing free life on the outside. \u201cThe admission procedure can be characterized as a leaving off and a taking on,\u201d Goffman writes, \u201cwith the midpoint marked by physical nakedness.\u201d The free person is thus stripped down, literally and figuratively, and established as an inmate.\nCentral to intake is what Goffman calls \u201cthe welcome,\u201d a process in which \u201cstaff or inmates, or both, go out of their way to give the recruit a clear notion of his plight.\u201d Beside the supposedly practical matters associated with intake \u2014 searching for contraband, ascertaining medical history, providing a uniform, outlining the rules, and so forth \u2014 there is an equally if not more important process of communicating to newcomers that they are now living in a place where they are insignificant and powerless. Inmates are made to understand that most of the liberties even a working-class person can enjoy on the outside are suspended, and that they should therefore follow the rules and avoid causing trouble in order to simply survive. This message has many carriers: the harsh architecture and filthy neglect of the intake pens, the humiliating process of the strip search, the endless waiting and unapologetic inefficiency of the whole process, and, of course, the verbal instructions and advice offered by COs and inmates alike.\nIn our experience, while COs may inform new arrivals of what is expected of them, mostly through threats, insults, or scarcely comprehensible commands, the inmates themselves take a more active role in orienting newcomers to the social setting where they will cohabitate. The first process is the institutional intake, the official mechanisms through which newcomers are taken into the facility, in Goffman\u2019s words, \u201cto be shaped and coded into an object that can be fed into the administrative machinery of the establishment, to be worked on smoothly by routine operations.\u201d But equally important, and largely neglected by Goffman, is what we call the social intake, in which other inmates acculturate and acclimatize the newcomer to the de facto social order structuring inmate life.\nGiven that we both had the privilege of posting bail, and thus began our city time directly from the outside, this is how our narrative is framed. From what we gather, however, the intake process is similar for those already housed on the island prior to conviction, including the forfeiture of street clothing and other small benefits of innocence in the eyes of the law, and the new inmate\u2019s subsequent processing into the distinct world of city time.\n\u201cBecause I Said So\u201d: Institutional Intake\nThe judge is clad in a black robe and ensconced in polished wood paneling, just like on television. But in real life, the scene is much shabbier. It is hard not to notice the run-down furniture, dirty windows, and wrinkled vestments of the judge sneering down from a bench propped up higher than everything else in the courtroom save for the bold, gilded words embossed above the judge\u2019s head: \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d Beside the judge\u2019s venerable bench sits an ominous door leading from the contrived civility of the courtroom to the world of human cages. Burly COs clad in unnecessary bulletproof vests patrol this portal, ferrying captive people from the jail, a world of unvarnished violence and neglect, to the courtroom, where brute force appears cloaked in the highest Enlightenment ideals.\nBy the time we crossed this threshold, we had eyed it with morbid fascination in dozens of grueling and often pointless court appearances. Passing through this door, we began our city time. We started out in a set of \u201cpens,\u201d the colloquial term for cages of different sizes, often filthy and lacking basic facilities like sinks and toilets, where prisoners languish for hours on end at nearly every step of their movement through DOC custody. Jarrod was shuttled into a small, dilapidated cell with a disused bathroom overlooking Manhattan rooftops. The CO processing him was training a trio of cadets, and used Jarrod to demonstrate the proper methods of searching a detained person for weapons. He explained that they should always be polite and respectful. \u201cSome court officers make fun of me for being polite to prisoners,\u201d he added, \u201cbut my philosophy is you say please \u2014 once.\u201d The cadets nodded eagerly.\nWe were questioned at length about our professions, medical histories, and gang affiliations. The COs processing Jarrod, a Latino man, and two Black women, joked that it was not too late for him to join a gang before he got to Rikers. \u201cNow is a good time to get covered,\u201d one of the women told him. Jarrod asked if they had a form for that. The man threw up gang signs with his hands while the two women laughed. Meanwhile, the man chewed on cherries, throwing the pits on the floor. One of the women yelled at him, saying he was feeding the mice. Picking them up would be the responsibility of inmates bused in from Rikers Island.\nThis process was a rush from one filthy pen to another, with broken toilets, clogged sinks, and nowhere to sit or lie down without great discomfort, just to wait for hours on end before being transported to another. As we lost track of time, it dawned on us that it no longer mattered. We were patted down and asked the same questions over and over again as we changed custody from one cluster of COs to another, slowly making our way to the ground floor of 100 Center Street, through a series of elevator rides in which we were commanded to face the back wall. Amid the squalor and stale air of the sunless pens, and the still more dismal gloom of detained men headed to Rikers and the state prison system, a small, home-printed sign hung over one guard station bearing the words, \u201cThe worst prison of all is fear of what other people think.\u201d\nJarrod was escorted toward the bus by an East Asian male CO. A white male CO playfully shouted, \u201cWhy are you messing with the white guy?\u201d Jarrod\u2019s escort replied, \u201cI have to, for our numbers. It can\u2019t just be Black and Latino guys in here!\u201d Such banter between COs sometimes uses the inmate as the butt of a joke, but usually ignores the inmate altogether. In transit, COs often stopped and talked among themselves as if we were inanimate objects \u2014 a sentiment further betrayed by their frequent reference to us as \u201cpackages.\u201d\nReaching the ground floor at last, we entered a short corridor leading into a foul-smelling outdoor loading dock stacked high with clear plastic trash bags containing unfinished detainee meals, allowing a narrow path alongside an idling DOC transport bus for us to board. These buses resembled heavily armored school buses, with metal grating over the windows, one row of double-seater pens along the left-hand side, and another row of single cages along the right. Jarrod traveled with a group of women from the Rose M. Singer Center, the women\u2019s jail on Rikers, who had been transported to 100 Center Street to work. \u201cHurry up and get us on the bus before a rat jump out!\u201d one commanded the CO overseeing their transfer. The overpowering smell of garbage boarded the bus along with the passengers, and never left.\nWorn and rusted metal doors and locks jangled incessantly as the bus bounced around the sinuous Lower Manhattan streets. Outside, New York City street life went on as usual, with nobody paying particular attention to what is, after all, a very common sight. Jarrod was transported in June, and the heat was stifling. The bus crawled across gridlocked Chinatown streets for upwards of fifteen minutes, making its way east to Bowery in stop-and-go traffic, only to loop around and return to the loading dock in a similar crawl. One of the COs had forgotten something. \u201cCO, turn on the air conditioning!\u201d one inmate yelled. Laughing, the CO replied that there was no air conditioner, and while the women had \u201cgrounds for a civil rights lawsuit,\u201d they would have to wait until its success in court to get their justice. The atmosphere was convivial. These were people who clearly spent a lot of time with each other.\nJarrod\u2019s bus crawled through the Lower East Side in search of the elusive \u201cbetter way\u201d across Manhattan in midday traffic. There was much grumbling by inmates and COs alike, including one woman exclaiming, \u201cWhere are all these people going at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon?\u201d \u2014 a phrase Jarrod had heard hundreds of times in his years of work as a New York City truck driver. At last the bus reached the United Nations building and entered the Midtown Tunnel to Queens. The bus then traversed a maze of industrial streets heading toward East Elmhurst. David\u2019s driver, in contrast, opted for the Manhattan Bridge and made much better time.\nA noxious smell hit Jarrod\u2019s nostrils, and one of the women on his bus exclaimed excitedly, \u201cOh, we home!\u201d an instant before the bus turned the corner and revealed the entrance to the Rikers Island Bridge. The bridge itself is a mile-long span with a slight elevation in the center that jolts passengers momentarily off their seats at the midpoint. Meanwhile, on the right sits LaGuardia Airport, so close to Rikers that its runways practically touch the island, with Citi Field, home of the Mets, looming behind it in the distance. \u201cWe\u2019re home!\u201d other women on Jarrod\u2019s bus reiterated, cheering, upon reaching the other side of the bridge.\nThe intake area at C-76 (\u201cIntake\u201d) features much of the same dirty and decrepit pens one finds throughout the chain of custody in the city\u2019s punishment system. Jarrod was uncuffed and herded into one pen with a putrid, unflushable toilet and a sleeping man whose tray of food, stripped only of its meat, was being devoured by a swarm of flies. A gentle sea breeze wafted in through windows covered in rusted iron grating and overgrown with greenery on the outside, emitting the smell of salt water, vegetation, and morning dew that permeates the island\u2019s windows to battle in vain with the odors of sweat, feet, piss, shit, burps, farts, and bleach that otherwise dominate the atmosphere.\nNext, we turned our money over by feeding it into an electronic machine that resembled a MetroCard dispenser, got photographed, and turned over our civilian clothing, including our shoes. We were then ordered to strip to our underwear and hover above a BOSS chair, which looks a bit like a drugstore blood pressure machine but can supposedly identify metal contraband stored in the anus and mouth. We were then led into a small booth, open on one side, and told to remove our underwear and squat down, exposing our anuses. The male COs who oversee strip searches at Rikers fiercely guard their masculinity by performing shock and revulsion at the sight of male penises and anuses, which must in reality be quite routine sights to them after only a few days on the job. The muscular, heavily tattooed white male CO inspecting Jarrod barked an inaudible command, which Jarrod incorrectly interpreted to mean \u201cspread your ass wider.\u201d When Jarrod did this, he learned that the CO had meant the opposite. \u201cOK! OK!\u201d he shouted, as if in great physical pain, \u201cYou\u2019re done!\u201d\nThe visual inspection of the anus does not actually reveal any contraband unless the new arrival has been very careless in stashing it, and is thus far more about the performance of guard vigilance and inmate subservience than anything practical. Sociologist Harold Garfinkle called these rituals \u201cstatus degradation ceremonies,\u201d performances in which the subordinate position of a class of people, in this case newly arrived inmates, is inscribed and repeatedly emphasized. Incidentally, these searches are notoriously futile at Rikers; we were both reproached by several men in the intake dormitory for knowingly turning ourselves in to custody without contraband stashed on (or in) our bodies. (Jarrod did not disclose that he had in fact smuggled a flashlight into the facility in a pair of reading glasses, for the purposes of reading after lights out.)\nAfter the strip search, we received \u201cgreens,\u201d ill-fitting forest green jumpsuits stamped \u201cDOC\u201d in six-inch white letters across the back, and so-called Air Patakis, flimsy, flat-bottomed Velcro shoes with no arch support. Generally speaking, Patakis run large, and all the clothes run small. Nothing really fits.\nWe got dressed and were ordered to escort ourselves to the clinic down the hall. It was an introduction to the fairly lax transport practices at C-76, where inmates are sometimes allowed to simply roam the halls unescorted. A befuddled Jarrod was dispatched to the clinic with no escort. He knocked on the door repeatedly, until someone on the other side shouted, \u201cCome back later!\u201d Confused about how to proceed, he just sat down on a nearby bench. When the door finally opened, Jarrod was greeted by a Black female CO loudly berating a crying man in a cage: \u201cHe\u2019s crying like a little boy,\u201d she taunted, \u201cand he a grown-ass man!\u201d\nThe C-76 clinic is a cramped office reminiscent of a food stamp processing center or drop-in center, worked by the same kind of civilian bureaucrat one would encounter in one of those spaces, and overseen by COs posted up near the door. We had our vitals taken, underwent a perfunctory discussion of mental health, and were asked about dietary restrictions. Almost as a joke, Jarrod remarked that he was a vegan, and to his surprise, was sent a few cubicles down to a thirty-something Jamaican dietician with a big beard and large golden necklaces, one of which was the scales of justice. In the background, a professional shoplifter debated with the nurses whether his trade was morally wrong. Hearing this, the dietician remarked to Jarrod, \u201cWho makes those rules? Who says \u2018Thou shalt not steal?\u2019\u201d He paused, before answering: \u201cThe rich! They say \u2018Thou shalt not steal\u2019 so we don\u2019t steal their things, and \u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019 so we don\u2019t kill them! They don\u2019t follow those rules, only us!\u201d He shook his head, and Jarrod followed in kind, before they both went on with the business of inmate intake at a facility where the poor are held captive at the behest of the rich. At least Jarrod was promised some vegan food.\nDavid got his first glimpse of DOC\u2019s disorganization during his initial clinic visit. He was paired with one nurse who asked him a battery of questions about medical conditions, addictions, and so on, and then asked him to step into a bathroom and provide a urine sample. When he came out, he was paired with another nurse who asked him the exact same questions. A few days later, he was sent to the clinic again, only to repeat the entire process because his blood and urine samples had apparently been misplaced.\nAfter processing in the clinic, we were returned to an intake pen. More waiting. Jarrod was, at last, issued his ID card and taken to the intake dormitory, where he received a flimsy and uneven rubber-coated mattress, two sheets, a green plastic cup, toothpaste, a toothbrush, a towel, and a small bar of soap. When David served his sentence a few years later, the DOC had switched from ID cards to ID bracelets, which he was cautioned to wear at all times. When he was finally moved from the holding pen to the intake dormitory, a CO unlocked a hallway closet as David and two other transferees waited beside him, fumbled inside for a moment, and then began throwing flaccid vinyl pillows, mattresses, sheets, and horse blankets onto the floor in front of them. One of the three had been to Rikers before; he immediately scooped up the least deflated-looking mattress and pillow. Though the other two were issued cups at this time, the CO could not find one for David. \u201cSorry, man,\u201d he said as he locked the closet, \u201cjust ask the floor officer in the morning.\u201d It ultimately took three days for David to get a cup.\nMusician and New York City counterculture leader Ed Sanders, who served city time at Hart Island in 1962 following a sit-in at the Atomic Energy Commission, recalls his own intake: \u201cWe were processed into the citadel. We were given some stiff black shoes, loose jeans, blue shirt, towels, and thick green overcoat. Never in my life had such a negative rush of immediate boredom stormed my soul.\u201d\nThe Incomprehensible Order\nOne\u2019s first time entering a massive caged dormitory filled with captive men can be quite overwhelming, and is a crucial moment for the new arrival. \u201cWhen you walk into a house on Rikers Island, it\u2019s all eyes on you\u2026. Everybody lookin\u2019 to see if they know you from somewhere \u2026 to see if you a rat, gang member,\u201d explains one formerly incarcerated YouTuber. \u201cI noticed the garbage in various corners of the huge room,\u201d recalls Marcos Perez, who served city time in the early 2010s. \u201cThe steam from the bathroom carried the odor of numerous people relieving themselves. Further in, people sitting, standing, talking, and arguing\u2026. Then the silence and attention turned toward me as I slowly walked in, looking for a bed of my own.\u201d So too did we take in this intimidating setting as much as possible, without appearing doe-eyed, before making our way to the harsh bedframe that would serve as home base for navigating an unfamiliar and threatening terrain.\nIn the days after our arrival, we received the second half of the institutional intake, in which we were instructed by demonstration how the facility was to be run. We learned that rules and policies were selectively enforced, and often just made up, depending on the day and the CO in charge. Jarrod had a very difficult time getting a copy of the Inmate Handbook, which is supposed to be made available to every new arrival. While David was later able to grab one from a stack in Intake, during Jarrod\u2019s time, they were scarce in C-76, and men who showed up to the 11-Lower dormitory with the handbook saw it confiscated as \u201ccontraband\u201d by COs who were sick of hearing that they violated inmates\u2019 rights. A common motto within the DOC describes the job as \u201ccare, custody, and control.\u201d One CO during Jarrod\u2019s time, a Black woman who spent much of the day bellowing obscenities at any inmate looking in her general direction, spelled out exactly what this means on Rikers: \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018care, custody, and control\u2019: I don\u2019t care, you\u2019re in my custody, and I\u2019m in control.\u201d\nThe COs\u2019 rule by belligerent force begins immediately and constitutes the most visceral aspect of institutional intake. Those arriving at a new house are often berated by COs for their personal hygiene, humiliated in front of other inmates with a variety of schoolyard taunts, and warned in harsh tones to do what they are told, not cause any trouble, and basically \u201cshut the fuck up,\u201d as some COs were quick to command. Questions of any kind about how the house functions are generally treated by COs as a major inconvenience, or else eyed suspiciously. COs are commonly instructed that nearly every request from an incarcerated person, including asking for basic amenities like toilet paper, is likely the beginning of a complex process of seduction that will lead the CO to ruin. When David, newly arrived, asked a CO how to sign up for a clinic visit, she responded with disgust that he was \u201ca real smart-ass\u201d and simply walked away. On a more basic level, the freedom to not care about inmates\u2019 basic needs, except when the spirit moves them, is a coveted part of Rikers COs\u2019 daily work. Accordingly, they made it clear from the onset that regardless of what was said on paper, they did not have to lift a finger to do anything for an incarcerated person, unless they damn well wanted to. This applied to daily schedules, which were hopelessly opaque. The times for elective daily activities like sick call or law library were not announced in advance, and often conflicted, with no warning or recourse. Inmates, for example, had to decide if going to sick call, their daily chance to (maybe) see a doctor, was worth possibly missing their daily trip to the yard, if it was called while they were out. And if they missed sick call because they could not hear the announcement over the impossibly loud dormitory noise, it was their fault for not paying attention, and they might have another chance to get it right tomorrow. Everything was called abruptly, as inmates who had been waiting around for hours were suddenly summoned with excited shouts, belittled for taking too long, and threatened with being left behind. This false urgency, coupled with vast stretches of dead time, whether at the behest of a CO\u2019s whim, or the jail\u2019s lumbering bureaucracy, called to mind the old military adage: \u201cHurry up and wait.\u201d\nWith no efficient system in place for addressing the dormitories, COs simply bellow commands on the spot, and become incensed when they are not immediately followed by inmates who often cannot even hear them. Meanwhile, the COs very publicly prioritize small talk among themselves, often loud and without concern for being overheard, over the needs of inmates, however pressing. \u201cAt first their carefree banter seemed to have nothing to do with me,\u201d recalls Michael Walker, \u201cbut then I got it in my head that they were ignoring me on purpose \u2014 like they wanted me to feel unimportant.\u201d\nThough DOC policy calls for daily orientation sessions to be conducted by COs for all newly arrived inmates, neither of us ever saw or even heard of such a thing at Rikers, nor had anyone we met while incarcerated there. On the contrary, most of what we learned about the institution from COs we gleaned not from their explicit instruction but by watching them operate. As Gresham Sykes argues, \u201cThe incomprehensible order or rule is a basic feature of life in prison.\u201d This was also observed over a century ago by New York City political prisoner Carlo de Fornaro, who served eight months of city time on Blackwell\u2019s Island in 1910. \u201cAs there are no written rules, and nobody informs us of all the unwritten rules on our entrance here \u2026 this apparent forgetfulness is really meant to give the warden and the keepers an unchallenged power of persecution over suspected and unruly convicts.\u201d More recently, longtime federal prisoner Michael G. Santos recalls remarking to an uncooperative guard, \u201cLiving in the unknown is just part of being a prisoner. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nWhen pressed for explanations, COs most often default to a parental \u201cbecause I said so.\u201d They do this partly because it is simply easier for COs to bark commands than explain themselves, which enables them to tailor their work to whatever is easiest and most convenient for them, inmate needs be damned. It also derives from the COs\u2019 quasi-military structure, in which those who interact with inmates mostly fall at the bottom of a harsh chain of command, and receive similarly unqualified orders on a last-minute, need-to-know basis. In this sense, COs simply extend this hierarchy to their relations with inmates, rudeness and all. But their refusal to provide information is also more fundamental. As Sykes argues, \u201cProviding explanations carries an implication that those who are ruled have a right to know \u2014 and this in turn suggests that if the explanations are not satisfactory, the rule or order will be changed.\u201d Refusing to explain themselves is both a symptom and a source of COs\u2019 unchecked power.\nThis command over daily life becomes so powerful that many COs become accustomed to dictating the very nature of reality. When Jarrod took a urine test in the clinic, the CO told him to place the cup on top of the blue trash can, and pointed to a red trash can. Jarrod hesitated for a split second, looking at the can, and then at the CO. \u201cPut it on the red trash can!\u201d the CO emphasized, as if he had said that the first time. Flummoxed, Jarrod complied, and received a look as if to say, \u201cWas that so difficult to understand?\u201d Similarly, Jarrod was dispatched to the mail room, and having not received mail for several days, hastened to make it there within a matter of minutes, only to find nobody inside. Upon his return, he was told, \u201cYou must have taken too long to get there.\u201d\nThis attitude in particular is the cornerstone of the longstanding practice among Rikers COs of covering up their own transgressions, including violence against incarcerated people, by getting their stories straight with their coworkers, and converting their lies into institutional truths through the alchemy of paperwork. A 2014 Department of Justice investigation into adolescent facilities at C-74 and C-76 found systematic embellishment of paperwork, sanctioned up and down the chain of command, to routinely cover up incarcerated people\u2019s injuries and make COs\u2019 wrongdoings, and even the formal processes in which COs must explain their uses of force, vanish through the invocation of bureaucratic word magic.\n\u201cOfficers were always told not to start shit outside their jail,\u201d recalls former Rikers CO Gary Heyward, \u201cbecause when it comes down to writing reports and coming up with lies to cover your ass, you\u2019d rather they come from officers from your jail that you have a bond with, that you trust.\u201d Former CO C. Ren\u00e9 West recounts being instructed by a senior officer on how to fabricate disciplinary write-ups, or, in the institutional language, make them \u201cmore juicy.\u201d \u201cWhen he was finished making my report \u2018more juicy,\u2019 it was a completely different scenario. A small curse like \u2018fuck you bitch\u2019 turned into a threat to kill my mother, rape me, or to visit me once he was released.\u201d\nIn his first week, David was told by an officer in the Bubble that he could not leave for his visit because there was \u201can alarm.\u201d When he asked what that meant, she frowned and impatiently told him, \u201cAsk your fellow inmates, sir.\u201d About a month into his sentence, David tried to give a small load of laundry to the institutional laundry services. The CO scowled and turned away, saying, \u201cCan\u2019t you just wash it yourself?\u201d Incidents like this are emblematic of a CO mindset based around abdicating the responsibility they are hired to take on, especially the \u201ccare\u201d portion of the department\u2019s motto, and becoming indignant when asked to fulfill it. Most new arrivals, therefore, are left to rely on other inmates.\n\u201cThis Is Jail\u201d: Social Intake\nJarrod was struck by how often inmates stated the obvious fact that they were presently located in jail. \u201cThis is jail!\u201d was a popular refrain in a number of situations. It could refer to the lingering surprise that one had transitioned from free life to being incarcerated: \u201cThis is jail!\u201d uttered incredulously. Lil Wayne notes in an early entry to his Rikers diary, \u201cI traded a coffee pack for a pack of noodles. Damn \u2026 I\u2019m really in jail!\u201d It could be an imperative, a reminder that the setting called for steely resolve: \u201cThis is jail,\u201d meaning \u201ctoughen up.\u201d It could be a simple, dismissive statement of fact, almost like a shrug: \u201cThis is jail,\u201d so what do you expect? Above all, it was the affirmation that this was a social setting with particular rules different from those of the outside world. \u201cThis is jail,\u201d and you had better behave accordingly. This sentiment figures prominently in social intake, the process by which inmates instruct the new arrival in the written \u2014 and largely unwritten \u2014 rules structuring daily life in the facility.\nFormer Rikers detainee Russell \u201cHalf \u201d Allen dramatizes his own experiences with social intake at C-74 in the novel Gladiator School. \u201cListen kid,\u201d an old-timer named Mr. Thomas tells the young Half as they exit the DOC bus on Rikers, \u201cI want you to stay focused and stay to yourself. You didn\u2019t come here to make friends. You do your time, and you get your ass home. That\u2019s the plan, you understand?\u201d\nFor those who come from neighborhoods and other social settings with considerable overlap with Rikers, or have previous experience with incarceration, learning the ropes in a new facility is a matter of parsing out minor local differences, such as the governing rules of a particular building or dormitory. For this, there is a vibrant network of communication, publicizing local knowledge throughout the facility. As one incarcerated man tells rookie CO Rakin Mohammad in the novel Across the Bridge, written by former Rikers CO Steven Dominquez, \u201cWord travels quick here, big dawg. Rikers isn\u2019t as big as you think it is, especially for a person like me who comes in and out of this bitch.\u201d\nFor inmates like David and Jarrod, whose prior knowledge of jail life was largely restricted to popular culture and anecdotes from other non-traditional inmates, much of the social world is mysterious. Yet it is urgent to learn it as quickly as possible, at the risk of making a disastrous faux pas. A codefendant of Jarrod\u2019s who was locked up at C-76 before him described it as \u201can endless hermeneutic\u201d in which almost every social interaction and daily activity comes with a set of structuring norms that are invisible, and initially bewildering, yet necessary to decipher and observe.\nJarrod\u2019s social-intake process began before he even boarded the bus. Waiting in line at the city courthouse on the day he was to begin his sentence, Jarrod sparked up a conversation with a young man who claimed to frequent the island, and who broke down his time strategy: \u201cDon\u2019t look at the calendar, don\u2019t look at the clock.\u201d Such pithy proverbs are plentiful throughout the system. Shortly thereafter Jarrod received another from an inmate with experience in both city and state facilities. He explained that the key to navigating the push and pull of macho posturing in the jail is presenting a stern front while actually practicing benevolence and kindness to those around you or, in his words, \u201cbeing nice, without looking like a bitch doing it.\u201d\nJarrod also benefited immensely from the insights of a codefendant who wrote a step-by-step guide explaining what Jarrod could expect. It began, \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that it won\u2019t be nearly as bad as you\u2019re expecting it to be. If you just stay within yourself, stay thoughtful and humble, you\u2019ll be perfectly fine.\u201d This kind of firsthand knowledge, which really only comes from word of mouth, proved invaluable in mitigating the fear that accompanies uncertainty in such a hostile setting. David was put in touch with a number of formerly incarcerated activists, including Jarrod, before his sentence began. Though all offered useful advice for serving time, David found that nothing can truly prepare a person for the first time behind bars.\nThe most important part of social intake begins in the dormitory. Among the first instructions new arrivals get from their fellow inmates is a rundown of the hygiene standards, often emphasizing the prohibition of naked showering and the necessity of covering oneself while using the toilet. These commands echo throughout the intake dormitory. Another early lesson revolves around use of the dormitory\u2019s telephones. While these are technically free for anyone to use any time they are turned on, lines of gang affiliation and other soft-power dynamics structuring dormitory life often dictate otherwise. Socks placed on phone receivers communicate the presence of these rules, and it is incumbent on the individual to figure out what they mean. The results of ignoring or disobeying them could be violence, or at least public humiliation signaling vulnerability.\nOther house rules may govern the maximum state of undress permitted in the dorm, who can touch the TV and when, who can open the windows and when, who can sleep in which bed or \u201csection,\u201d where to walk in order to avoid disrupting what little privacy is available, and even how to use the Cambro drink dispenser for ice cubes or beverages. Inmates also share information about the personalities of individual COs, which rules are enforced and by whom, what kind of tacit agreements exist between them, such as the proper protocol for smoking without getting in trouble, and scheduling information like when the house goes to commissary. Often enough, all of this is readily communicated by one or more inmates who pull the new arrival aside to tell him the ropes. If the arrivant is lucky, this will be somebody known to him from another house or the street. If not, as the reader is likely aware from popular culture, overenthusiastic interest shown by a stranger could be the sign of a predator.\nAccordingly, we were both warned to refuse any act of generosity shown by strangers upon our arrival. Leaving nothing to chance, we both insisted on offering objects for trade in exchange for the first items we wanted \u2014 writing utensils, relatively worthless commodities in the jail economy \u2014 lest we be ensnared in a web of extortion. David flat-out refused another inmate\u2019s offer to give him a couple of packs of ramen noodles until he could go to commissary. In all likelihood, with the benefit of hindsight, the people who offered these items were probably just being nice. It is much more common for sentenced men on Rikers to share food and hygiene products with each other, even with new arrivals, than might be assumed. This is not to say that extortion and other forms of predation do not exist but that most people David and Jarrod met were simply trying to make the best of a bad situation, and were willing to help others when they could.\nSince city time is often served in multiple locations, beginning with the intake dormitory and then spread across any number of houses with different de facto rules, social intake never really ends. Even a seasoned inmate arrives at a new house in need of basic information. Upon transfer, Jarrod was pulled aside by a few inmates and politely yet firmly told, \u201cThis is a work house. We keep things quiet here, and don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d This sentiment was repeated, almost verbatim, by the dormitory\u2019s COs. This was no coincidence; Jarrod soon observed how a compact had been reached, under which COs overlooked minor infractions (smoking, for instance, was constant and almost always ignored) in exchange for a quiet and orderly facility. In this house, open belligerence toward staff and other inmates, which might be a path to shotcaller status in a more chaotic dormitory, was frowned upon. People looking to make good names for themselves by causing a conflict were more likely to turn the whole dormitory against them than win its respect.\nThe first bed David picked was empty, but as soon as he put his belongings down on it, one of the men next to it let him know that he might want to move: it was a \u201chot\u201d bed, and had contraband stashed in it. David settled on a bed across the dorm next to a thirty-something Black man he did not know, and two Black men he had been with in the intake dorm the day before. Jarrod arrived in the intake dorm and soon realized he had an entire section to himself, even as the rest of the dorm was getting crowded. He later learned that shortly before his arrival, two inmates serving short \u201cskid bid\u201d sentences had quarreled in this section. One shoved the other, who fell, hit his head on the bed next to Jarrod\u2019s, and died. Before the week was out, however, the bed in question was the scene of a lively game involving bouncing a marble-like Fireball hard candy off the metal, trying to sink it into one of the frame\u2019s ventilation holes. Soon it was taken by a new arrival, and the stigma forgotten.\nThe designated intake dorm, 1-Upper, was a chaotic place because its population was always transient, meaning that no enduring power structure could ever be built. Both inmates and COs told David that incarcerated men generally spent as little as two days but no longer than two weeks in 1-Upper. David arrived there near midnight, and just picked a random bed in the near-empty dorm. There was nobody running the dorm, and nobody had much of anything, having just arrived from the street or another facility. There were no books, nothing to write with or on, and no commissary food or hygiene products, since no one had been able to go to commissary yet. The other inmates there quickly learned that David was a first-timer, and helped him learn the ropes. One guy demonstrated how to tie his sheet around his mattress properly so it would stay put. Another showed him how the phones worked and offered him a phone call.\nOnce David arrived in his first long-term dorm, and settled in next to his acquaintances from the intake dorm, some inmates immediately offered him commissary food while others explained how the phones and the bathroom worked. One man in his section, a Puerto Rican in his fifties, offered to hook him up with \u201cthe best jail job there is\u201d (in his opinion, the bakery). \u201cWrite your number down here, and I\u2019ll talk to my boss,\u201d he said. David, not yet in a jail mindset, confusedly asked the man if he meant his phone number. The man sucked his teeth and shot him an incredulous look. \u201cNo, man \u2014 your book and case number!\u201d\nThe same man also enthused over how David had chosen a good bed, because it had a view of the moon at night. After nightfall, he squinted and pointed a finger up at a white disk above the neighboring wing of the building. \u201cSee?\u201d he told David. \u201cThe full moon!\u201d\nIt was a searchlight.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "Louisiana isn\u2019t just passing bad policy. It\u2019s laying bricks in a pathway toward fascism \u2014 and elected officials are doing it in broad daylight.\nThis legislative session, lawmakers in Baton Rouge have been advancing a uniquely harsh combination of anti-immigrant bills. As someone who organizes at the intersections of immigrant justice, racial equity and decarceration, I need people to understand that what\u2019s happening here isn\u2019t about immigration. It\u2019s about control, surveillance and criminalizing compassion.\nConsider Senate Bill 15, introduced by Republican State Sen. Jay Morris. This critical bill had a hearing in the House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee on May 28. If passed, it would amend state obstruction of justice and malfeasance in office laws to criminalize any public official or private individual who commits \u201cany act intended to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with\u201d federal immigration enforcement. That could mean refusing to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That could mean advocating for a sanctuary city. That could mean doing your job with integrity \u2014 and getting charged with a felony. Public employees could face charges for refusing \u201clawful requests for cooperation\u201d from agencies like ICE, Customs and Border Protection or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The law would take effect August 1, 2025, if signed into law.\nSB 15 mirrors \u201canti-sanctuary\u201d laws in states like Florida and Texas that compel cooperation with ICE that the federal government often cannot constitutionally demand directly under the 10th Amendment\u2019s anti-commandeering doctrine.\nOr take House Bill 554, sponsored by Republican State Rep. Dixon McMakin of Baton Rouge. This bill had a hearing in the Senate Transportation, Highways, and Public Works Committee on May 29, and its path forward is now more defined. This bill would mandate a specific, yet undefined, \u201crestriction code\u201d be placed on state IDs and driver\u2019s licenses issued to lawfully present noncitizens \u2014 people legally residing here like refugees, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients or visa holders, who are already ineligible for licenses if undocumented. It also requires the state mail these individuals an official notice warning them against attempting to vote, a felony offense. This marking might as well say: \u201csecond-class human.\u201d\nFunctionally, HB 554\u2019s restriction code acts like the passbooks of apartheid South Africa or the badges forced upon marginalized groups throughout history. It is a state-mandated tool designed to mark, differentiate and control a specific population, making discrimination against them easier and reinforcing their \u201cotherness.\u201d This marking is distinct from federal REAL ID standards and targets the legally present, not for federal identification purposes, but purely based on noncitizen status.\nAnd these are just two of several bills in a slate targeting immigrants this session. Other critical bills include:\n- HB 303 (authored by State Rep. Mike Bayham): This bill, which aims to create a state task force to assist in capturing \u201cfugitives\u201d (critics argue this could broaden state involvement in immigration arrests), also had a hearing in Senate Judiciary B on May 28.\n- HB 307 (authored by State Rep. Chance Henry): Having passed the House, this bill is now awaiting formal introduction in the Senate, potentially to be considered soon. It seeks to require state agencies to report immigration status for those seeking public services.\n- HB 436 (authored by State Rep. Gabe Firment): This bill would prevent undocumented individuals from recovering noneconomic damages in personal injury cases, such as pain and suffering from a car accident \u2014 even if they were not at fault. The bill was sent to the governor for signature on May 28.\n- SB 100 (authored by State Rep. Blake Miguez): This bill would require state agencies to collect and report the immigration status of anyone applying for public services. It was considered in the Senate Finance Committee on May 27 and has since advanced to the full Senate for a vote.\nIn my role at the Louisiana Organization for Refugees and Immigrants (LORI), I\u2019ve heard from families terrified to go to work or school. As political action chair for the NAACP in Baton Rouge and across the state, I see the same story play out over and over \u2014 criminalization of existence, wrapped in the language of \u201claw and order.\u201d LORI and other advocates have been actively opposing these measures.\nLet me say this plainly: Immigration enforcement is a pillar of the carceral state. It is not broken; it is functioning exactly as designed. These bills weaponize that system further, deputizing local governments into the hands of federal repression. They turn teachers, social workers and public servants into potential enforcers under threat of state criminal charges like malfeasance if they refuse to comply. They target Black and Brown communities with surgical precision.\nThis is not about \u201cborder security.\u201d Louisiana doesn\u2019t have a border with Mexico. This is about sending a message: If you\u2019re not white, not wealthy, not silent \u2014 you are expendable. These aren\u2019t isolated acts; they reflect a national playbook pushed by anti-immigrant groups seeking to implement a harsh agenda state by state, using places like Louisiana as testing grounds.\nAnd harsh legislation is not the only thing that distinguishes Louisiana from other states on immigration: It\u2019s where ICE has incarcerated many university scholars and pro-Palestine organizers, including Mahmoud Khalil.\nI write this not just as an organizer but as a survivor. I\u2019ve known what it feels like to be discarded by the state, to be failed by every institution that was supposed to protect me. That\u2019s why I fight. That\u2019s why I speak. And that\u2019s why I will never comply with policies that ask us to betray each other to survive.\nWhen the state seeks to criminalize broadly defined \u201cinterference\u201d with federal enforcers while simultaneously marking the identity documents of legally present residents based on citizenship, it lays down bricks of control, surveillance and dehumanization \u2014 key elements of authoritarianism.\nThere is another way. One rooted in care, not cages; in sanctuary, not surveillance; in solidarity, not silence. But we won\u2019t get there by being polite. We get there by resisting. By organizing. By calling this what it is: state violence.\nLouisiana is a testing ground. If these bills are enacted here, they will be copied across the country. But if we stop them here \u2014 if we rise up, call them out and demand something better \u2014 we can set a new precedent: that community is not a crime, dignity is not negotiable, and we will not comply.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Published": "Sat, 31 May 2025 15:39:52 +0000",
        "Summary": "The Republican budget bill blocking state regulations also allocates hundreds of millions in federal funds toward AI.",
        "Content": "Pointing out right-wing hypocrisy does little to alleviate its toll. Still, one provision tucked into Republicans\u2019 sweeping tax and spending bill is particularly glaring in its ideological inconsistency: a 10-year ban on state AI regulation.\nYes, that means that the party most wont to cry federal overreach is now seeking to directly intervene in state policymaking. Of course, Republicans have always only championed states\u2019 rights when it\u2019s politically expedient to do so. And while GOP backers have said the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would prevent a confusing patchwork of AI laws from taking shape across the country, it still includes some exemptions for state laws that promote AI development. Go figure.\nThe 1,116-page legislative package \u2014 a key conduit for the GOP to enact President Donald Trump\u2019s budget goals \u2014 narrowly passed the House with a one-vote margin on May 22. It\u2019s now with the Senate, where some Republican legislators have pledged to rewrite portions of the contentious megabill. As traditional fiscal conservatives wrangle with Trump\u2019s MAGA allies, it will likely be weeks before we see another vote, though lawmakers hope to finalize the bill by the end of July to avoid a debt default.\nMuch to the tech industry\u2019s delight, the GOP\u2019s budget bill proposes allocating millions of dollars to the Pentagon for AI-powered weapons, as well as $25 million on contracts for AI systems to detect \u201cMedicare fraud.\u201d Republicans also want to allocate $500 million over 10 years to update government systems with AI. In that timespan, new state-level AI regulations would be banned, and the enforcement of dozens of preexisting state regulations would be prohibited as well. These existing rules take aim at widespread concerns like deepfake misinformation, algorithmic rent-setting tools and AI-generated explicit content, particularly of children. If enacted, the proposed AI provision could lead to \u201cunfettered abuse,\u201d a coalition of more than 140 organizations warned in a letter to Congress earlier this month. Additionally, generative AI is associated with decreased cognitive skills, and it\u2019s known to guzzle massive amounts of water, consume a great deal of energy and emit climate-warming greenhouse gases. As the technology rapidly becomes more and more advanced and pervasive, we should not be rolling back the few guardrails that currently exist.\nRepublicans have claimed that the various state laws should be usurped by a cohesive national policy. While this is a worthwhile goal, no such federal framework exists, and there\u2019s little hope that one will arrive anytime soon. On his first day in office, Trump overturned Joe Biden\u2019s executive order on AI ethics and safety, which set goals for a \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d approach to regulating generative AI and addressing its social risks. Issued in October 2023, Biden\u2019s EO outlined eight guiding principles and priorities for AI development, including calling for consumer protections and pushing to safeguard privacy and civil liberties as AI advances. But even Biden\u2019s executive order, as a set of unbinding guidelines, failed to manifest as concrete policy decisions.\nTech watchdogs and policy experts note that, despite decades of advocacy, there is still no national data privacy law. Others point to social media, which evolved and scaled with little government oversight and now proves difficult for lawmakers to rein in. \u201cThe arguments in favor of this provision only work if you believe that the federal government will soon pass broad guardrails to protect the public, or that AI will be a completely benign technology developed by companies that need no regulatory constraints,\u201d Brad Carson, president of the AI policy nonprofit Americans for Responsible Innovation, told Government Technology. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of 40 state attorneys general pushed back against the proposed AI rule, writing in a letter, \u201cImposing a broad moratorium on all state action, while Congress fails to act in this area, is irresponsible and deprives consumers of reasonable protections.\u201d\nIn December, the bipartisan House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence released a lengthy report outlining suggestions for promoting AI innovation while protecting against the technology\u2019s harms. During a House budget hearing, the chairman of the task force, Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-California), expressed frustrations that Congress had not moved forward with codifying the report\u2019s recommendations, and he cited congressional inaction as his reason for supporting the Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s AI provision. Obernolte argues that a state moratorium is needed to eliminate the regulatory burden on small tech startups trying to navigate a maze of state laws, while giving Congress time to hammer out a national framework. Experts, however, say the current state laws are hardly as cumbersome as Republicans have made them out to be and largely focus on things like transparency. For instance, California, Illinois and Maryland have enacted legislation requiring businesses to disclose when and how AI systems are being used, and in some cases might require employers to obtain an employee\u2019s consent before using AI to collect their data.\nAnd while Republicans claim that the AI rule is intended to protect small and midsize AI businesses, it\u2019s been Big Tech that\u2019s leading the deregulatory push. During a May 8 Senate hearing, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called state laws \u201cburdensome\u201d and Microsoft President Brad Smith advocated for limited regulation. (Altman, notably, embraced calls for extensive AI regulation back in 2023, telling Congress that the technology could \u201ccause significant harm to the world.\u201d) In Tech Policy Press article debunking state AI law myths, Kara Williams, a law fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and Ben Winters, director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, point out that big tech companies have repeatedly failed to honor their own promises to self-regulate. Williams and Winters argue that regulation can help innovation, not hinder it, and note that state transparency requirements typically are limited to basic information about when AI is used on a consumer. \u201cIf simple disclosures of this nature would be disastrous to any company,\u201d they write, \u201cit perhaps points to a deficiency in the product, not the regulation requiring the disclosures.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the proposed AI rule will make it across the finish line. With the Big Beautiful Bill now in the Senate for consideration, GOP critics have largely focused on fiscal issues like shaving off spending, making certain tax cuts permanent, preventing the debt ceiling from rising, and, in some cases, opposing unpopular cuts to Medicaid and food stamp benefits. Thus far, only two Republican senators, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), have publicly pushed back against the AI provision. However, it will likely face a steep uphill battle, since a guideline known as the Byrd Rule prevents \u201cextraneous matters\u201d from being included in the budget reconciliation bill.\nUltimately, it\u2019ll be up to the Senate parliamentarian to determine whether a 10-year ban on state AI laws qualifies as a budget-related item or if it must be excised. If the AI regulatory moratorium does end up on the chopping block, some Republicans say that they\u2019ll fight to push it through as a separate piece of legislation. And even before we see the final reconciliation bill, we know it\u2019ll include these things: tax cuts for the rich, more money to the military and police, and fewer benefits for everyone else.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "The president's call for a policy of &ldquo;remigration&rdquo; has been embraced by far right groups in Europe.",
        "Content": "Eight months after U.S. President Donald Trump publicly called for a policy of \u201cremigration\u201d \u2014 a term that\u2019s become a rallying cry among far-right groups in Europe and sparked comparisons to ethnic cleansing \u2014 the U.S. State Department said Thursday that it plans to create an office devoted to the project, with refugee aid resources diverted to Trump\u2019s rapidly accelerating mass deportation campaign.\nA State Department official told Axios that the proposed creation of the Office of Remigration would be part of a broad reorganization of the agency, with a division that resettled Afghan people who supported the U.S. during the 20-year occupation of Afghanistan eliminated.\nA proposal sent to Congress detailed how the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration\u2019s immigration work would be consolidated into three offices, including the Office of Remigration, to shift the bureau\u2019s focus \u201ctowards supporting the administration\u2019s efforts to return illegal aliens to their country of origin or legal status.\u201d\nThe office would be a \u201chub for immigration issues and repatriation tracking,\u201d according to the proposal.\nTrump first called for a \u201cremigration\u201d program in September 2024 ahead of the presidential election, saying he would \u201creturn Kamala [Harris]\u2019s illegal migrants to their home countries\u201d in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.\nThe comment came amid his attacks on Haitian legal residents in Springfield, Ohio and Venezuelan migrants, claiming the U.S. was under an \u201cinvasion\u201d and saying he would \u201cship them back to their country.\u201d\nHis use of the term remigration went largely unremarked on by the corporate media, said the news analysis group Media Matters at the time, but Zeteo founder Mehdi Hasan noted that Trump was \u201ccalling for the ethnic cleansing of legal immigrants in the United States.\u201d\nThe term has been embraced by far-right groups in Europe including Alternative for Germany and Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, which called for the European Union to appoint a remigration commissioner last year.\nRemigration policy has long been promoted by Austrian far-right activist Martin Sellner, who had communications with the white supremacist who killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2019. Sellner has denied involvement in the attacks.\nOn his website, Wired reported on Thursday, Sellner \u201clays out a three-phase plan to implement remigration\u201d that includes \u201cstriking similarities to Trump\u2019s current immigration policies\u201d:\nThe primary aim of this phase is \u201cstopping the invasion.\u201d The Trump administration, invoking the Alien Enemies Act in March, cited an alleged \u201cinvasion\u201d by a Venezuelan gang as a source of authority to take unprecedented steps to remove migrants from the U.S.\nSellner\u2019s website also lists a number of \u201ctools\u201d that can be used to achieve remigration, which includes \u201cstop family reunification\u201d \u2014 something Trump was doing even in his first term in office. In the first phase, Sellner also encourages governments to \u201ccreate an ultimatum and economic incentives to self-deport.\u201d The Trump administration is already purportedly offering undocumented immigrants a stipend of $1,000 if they use the CBP Home App to self deport.\nSellner adds that governments should \u201ccut humanitarian aid\u201d to force immigrants to stop entering the country. Last month, the Trump administration attempted to cut legal aid to unaccompanied migrant children, only for a court to temporarily block its efforts.\nJulia Ebner, a researcher with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and the University of Oxford, told The Guardian last year that the term \u201csounds a lot more benign than what it actually stands for. Because, particularly in the context of Germany and Austria, there is still a very strong association of the term mass deportation with the Holocaust.\u201d\nFar-right lawmakers and activists from the U.S., Germany, Ireland, and France were among more than 400 attendees at the first-ever Remigration Summit near Milan earlier this month. Jacky Eubanks, who was endorsed by Trump during her 2022 run for the Michigan House of Representatives, claimed in a speech at the summit that Europeans were the \u201cfounding stock\u201d of the U.S., disregarding the existence of indigenous people across the continent.\nThe State Department is planning to open the Office of Remigration as the administration ramps up its mass deportation operations, with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller informing immigration officials last week that federal agents should begin arresting 3,000 immigrants per day \u2014 tripling numbers from earlier this year.\nThe push has coincided with mandates for federal law enforcement agents to assist in raids and arrests and the targeting of people at formerly protected locations like courthouses.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the Trump administration take the unprecedented step of arresting non-citizens who are following the government\u2019s rules and procedures, and showing up for their court hearings,\u201d Nayna Gupta, the policy director for the American Immigration Council, told The Guardian on Thursday. \u201cThey are desperate to reach a certain number of arrests per day. And the only way they can find non-citizens easily and quickly is to go to the courthouses, where [immigrants] are doing exactly what they\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\nThe Washington Post reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement in more than 20 states have been directed to arrest people at courthouses during court proceedings.\n\u201cThe Trump administration is pressuring judges in immigration courtrooms to function more like cogs in the mass deportation machinery rather than as fair and balanced arbiters of the law,\u201d Greg Chen, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the Post. \u201cThat is not the way Americans want and understand our judicial system to work. Immigration judges should be worried about this.\u201d\nGupta said the administration is \u201cdoubling down\u201d on its \u201cillusion that they had been given a broad mandate to effectuate an aggressive immigration enforcement agenda.\u201d\nLess than a third of Americans in a March Gallup poll agreed with Trump\u2019s stated goal of removing all undocumented immigrants from the United States; those who said \u201csome\u201d undocumented immigrants should be deported said that committing violent crimes should be a prerequisite for removal.\n\u201cPublic polling is showing decreasing support for Trump\u2019s immigration agenda,\u201d said Gupta, \u201cas Americans wake up to the reality that mass deportation means arrests of our neighbors and friends, masked agents in our communities, and people afraid to go to work and show up to school, in ways that undermine our local economies.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "A report spearheaded by RFK Jr. contained fake citations and markers indicating that it had been compiled using AI.",
        "Content": "The White House\u2019s keystone health report outlining its agenda for Americans\u2019 health is riddled with artificial intelligence \u201challucinations,\u201d with fabricated citations and broken links reflective of the administration\u2019s embrace of non-scientific approaches to public health.\nAn analysis by The Washington Post uncovered numerous citations in the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report with the letters \u201coaicite\u201d attached to the URLs \u2014 a marker indicating that they were collected using artificial intelligence created by OpenAI, which operates ChatGPT.\nMeanwhile, The Washington Post, The New York Times and NOTUS uncovered numerous citations within the report, spearheaded by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that were totally fabricated. This lines up with the tendency of AI technology like ChatGPT to \u201challucinate\u201d information \u2014 a common and growing problem fueling the spread of disinformation online and among the public.\nExperts say relying on AI for a factual report that has serious implications for people\u2019s health and lives is dangerous, as AI does not \u201cknow\u201d objective truths and is subject to manipulation by its programmers. And yet, this document marks the administration\u2019s approach to the wellbeing of hundreds of millions of Americans and their children.\n\u201cThe problem with current AI is that it\u2019s not trustworthy, so it\u2019s just based on statistical associations and dependencies,\u201d Steven Piantadosi, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley, told the Post. \u201cIt has no notion of ground truth, no notion of \u2026 a rigorous logical or statistical argument. It has no notions of evidence and how strongly to weigh one kind of evidence versus another.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not an evidence-based report, and for all practical purposes, it should be junked at this point,\u201d Georges C. Benjamin, who heads the American Public Health Association, told the Post. \u201cIt cannot be used for any policymaking. It cannot even be used for any serious discussion, because you can\u2019t believe what\u2019s in it.\u201d\nThe Trump administration chalked up the fake citations to \u201cformatting issues,\u201d which would not explain fabricated citations and AI markers. The administration subsequently uploaded a version of the document with some of the fake citations replaced.\nIt\u2019s ironic that the administration would decry traditional methods of scientific research and tout the \u201cgold-standard\u201d work that the administration will do instead in a document that couldn\u2019t even accomplish the most basic fact checking and citation tasks required for quality research.\n\u201cScientific publishing is supposed to be about verification,\u201d said Ivan Oransky, who co-founded a website that tracks study retractions, per The New York Times. \u201cThere\u2019s supposed to be a set of eyes, actually several sets of eyes. And so what that tells us is that there was no good set of eyes on this.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also ironic that Kennedy threatened this week to bar government-funded scientists from publishing in major medical journals while using research published in those very journals to bolster his points in the MAHA report.\nThe report itself, experts have said, is full of disinformation, often making statements not supported by the sources it cites. It strategically omits certain explanations for poor health outcomes in the U.S. \u2014 like COVID-19, the lack of universal health care, or the fact that the leading cause of death for children is gun violence \u2014 while failing to mention legitimate solutions for others. It also cherry-picks evidence, like rising rates of mental disorders among children, while failing to note that clinicians are becoming better at recognizing and diagnosing such disorders.\nMeanwhile, some of the report\u2019s recommendations are flatly hypocritical. For instance, under its section about the spread of ultra-processed foods, the report touts the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, for its \u201cproven track record of improving children\u2019s health.\u201d\nHowever, the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping cuts to social programs via Republicans\u2019 reconciliation bill are slated to negatively impact enrollment in WIC, jeopardizing benefits used by millions of pregnant, postpartum, newborn and child beneficiaries to access healthy, fresh foods.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

Her recent piece for The Nation is headlined \u201cWorse Than McCarthyism: Universities in the Age of Trump.\u201d\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: President Trump\u2019s crackdown on academic institutions in the United States was the focus of protests and commencement speeches this week as universities like Harvard held commencement ceremonies.\nThe Trump administration has now directed federal agencies to review all remaining contracts with Harvard, after it already canceled nearly $3 billion in federal research grants for the university and moved last week to revoke its ability to enroll international students. Harvard has two separate suits pending against Trump, arguing the moves violate due process, as well as free speech protections under the First Amendment because they target the university\u2019s staff, curriculum and enrollment.\nIn his address at Harvard\u2019s commencement ceremony Thursday, Stanford University professor, doctor and novelist Abraham Verghese praised the school\u2019s defiance of Trump and spoke to students facing threats of deportation or having their visas revoked.\nDR. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: When legal immigrants and others who are lawfully in this country, including so many of your international students, worry about being wrongly detained and even deported, perhaps it\u2019s fitting that you hear from an immigrant like me. Perhaps it\u2019s fitting that you hear from someone who was born in Ethiopia when it was ruled by an emperor, someone who then lived under the harsh military leader who overthrew the emperor, someone who had at least \u2014 who had at least one his medical school classmates tortured and disappear. \u2026 More than a quarter of the physicians in this country are foreign medical graduates. \u2026 So, a part of what makes America great, if I may use that phrase, is that it allows an immigrant like me to blossom here, just as generations of other immigrants and their children have flourished and contributed in every walk of life, working to keep America great.\nAMY GOODMAN: That\u2019s the novelist and medical doctor, Ethiopian Indian American, Dr. Abraham Verghese addressing Harvard\u2019s commencement ceremony on Thursday. His latest book, The Covenant of Water.\nMeanwhile, down the road in Cambridge, the Indian American class president at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spoke about how MIT\u2019s undergraduate body and Graduate Student Union had voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with Israel. Megha Vemuri wore a red-and-white keffiyeh and said MIT students would never support a genocide, and praised them for continuing to protest despite, quote, \u201cthreats, intimidation and suppression coming from all directions, especially,\u201d she said, \u201cyour own university officials.\u201d\nMEGHA VEMURI: Last spring, MIT\u2019s undergraduate body and Graduate Student Union voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military. You called for a permanent cease fire in Gaza, and you stood in solidarity with the pro-Palestine activists on campus. You faced threats, intimidation and suppression coming from all directions, especially your own university officials. But you prevailed, because the MIT community that I know would never tolerate a genocide.\nRight now while we prepare to graduate and move forward with our lives, there are no universities left in Gaza. We are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face of the Earth, and it is a shame that MIT is a part of it. The Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with. This means that Israel\u2019s assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and abetted by our country, but our school. As scientists, engineers, academics and leaders, we have a commitment to support life, support aid efforts and call for an arms embargo and keep demanding now, as alumni, that MIT cuts the ties.\nAMY GOODMAN: That was MIT class president Megha Vemuri, now Indian American graduate of MIT.\nThis comes as Jelani Cobb, the dean of Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism \u2014 another school facing attacks by the Trump administration \u2014 writes for The New Yorker magazine this week about how, quote, \u201cAcademic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege.\u201d In his piece headlined \u201cA Tumultuous Spring Semester Finally Comes to a Close,\u201d he describes how he consulted with Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the author of No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities, along with other deans at Columbia. They spoke about government repression on college campuses in the 1950s through to the present. Schrecker told him, quote, \u201cI\u2019ve studied McCarthyism\u2019s impact on higher education for 50 years. What\u2019s happening now is worse,\u201d he quoted her saying.\nWell, we begin today with Ellen Schrecker in person, joining us in our New York studio. She\u2019s the author of Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America, No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities. Schrecker is also the author of The Right to Learn: Resisting the Right-Wing Attack on Academic Freedom. And she just wrote a piece for The Nation headlined \u201cWorse Than McCarthyism: Universities in the Age of Trump.\u201d Schrecker has been active in the American Association of University Professors, AAUP, since the 1990s. I should note she has three degrees from Radcliffe Harvard and formerly taught there. She\u2019s a graduate of Radcliffe 1960.\nEllen Schrecker, welcome to Democracy Now! It\u2019s great to have you with us. As we look at these universities under attack, you\u2019ve studied higher education for over half a century. Let\u2019s talk about what was happening then and what\u2019s happening today.\nELLEN SCHRECKER: OK. The main thing that happened then to universities was that about a hundred faculty members, most of them with tenure, were fired and blacklisted. That happened in every major institution of civil society within the United States. And although the universities pride themselves on academic freedom \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 they collaborated with the forces of repression through \u2014 that were actively imposing a climate of fear and self-censorship throughout American society.\nToday, what\u2019s happening is worse, so much worse that we have to really find a new phrase for it. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll be. But during the McCarthy period, it was attacking only individual professors and only about their sort of extracurricular political activities on the left, in the past and in the present, then present. Today, the repression that\u2019s coming out of Washington, D.C., it attacks everything that happens on American campuses.\nAMY GOODMAN: I\u2019d like you to start off \u2014 we have a very young audience. We also have their parents and their grandparents around the world. And I\u2019d like you to start off by talking about who McCarthy is. What do we mean by the McCarthyism of, for example, the 1950s?\nELLEN SCHRECKER: OK, that\u2019s a very good way to start, because McCarthyism, unfortunately, is misnamed. It is not just the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, who came in onto the stage of history in 1950 after the \u201cism\u201d that he gave his name to had been really dominating American domestic politics since the late 1940s. \u201947 is when the Truman administration imposed a loyalty test, an anti-communist loyalty test, on its employees.\nSo, if we wanted to name this phenomenon of political repression, anti-communist political repression \u2014 and I want to specify that it didn\u2019t attack randomly people on the left, but very specifically people who had some kind of connection, usually in the past, with the communist movement, that during the 1930s and \u201940s was the most dynamic force on the left, even though it was a very flawed, very flawed political group. It was nonetheless very influential on the left. And if we wanted to give that political repression of the 1940s and \u201950s a name, it should have been Hooverism, after the FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.\nAMY GOODMAN: You know, the movie Good Night and Good Luck, they showed real black-and-white footage of McCarthy, and test audiences thought he was too harsh, unrealistic, not realizing it was actual footage. And now you have Good Night and Good Luck on Broadway, George Clooney starring in it, and it is the financially most successful Broadway show we\u2019ve seen, is going to be now for free on CNN in a few days. But the significance of that, that that \u2014 what people feel today was a cartoon character was, in fact, much harsher and sharper than people ever dreamed?\nELLEN SCHRECKER: Yeah, he was beyond the pale, because, like the current president, he had no guardrails, as it were.\nAMY GOODMAN: Not to mention Roy Cohn, his sidekick in the hearings, who would later go on to mentor Donald Trump, until, at the very end of his life, Donald Trump rejected him when he was dying of AIDS.\nELLEN SCHRECKER: Exactly. So, there are lots of similarities with the fact that there\u2019s this very aberrant character at the heart, or at the sort of public heart, of this repressive movement. But what we should have known in the \u201940s and \u201950s, and should know now, is it\u2019s not just a one-man show. It has been this moment of trying to crack down on dissent, constitutional dissent, free speech, the ability to say what Israel is doing in Gaza is a terrible thing. That is something that has been building up for decades. And that was the same thing during McCarthyism. There was a kind of network of right-wing activists, similar to groups today, like the Heritage Society, that brought us the 2025 Project blueprint for Trump\u2019s attack on the institutions of civil liberties and civil society, that has come to fruition since he entered the White House.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, I mean, you speak as a Jewish author, active member of the American Association of University Professors. Would you say that the McCarthyism of yesteryear is the charges that President Trump, with his sidekick Elon Musk giving the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d salute, charging antisemitism for what he\u2019s doing?\nELLEN SCHRECKER: Antisemitism is a pretext. We know that. Trump has been all his life a racist, clearly befriending these fascist individuals and groups for years. And what we\u2019re seeing is a kind of a melding of Trump\u2019s own right-wing proclivities, reactionary proclivities, pro-fascist proclivities, with a long-term attempt within some pro-Zionist organizations to eliminate all support for Palestinian freedom and Palestinian liberation from American universities, in particular, but from within American society.\nAMY GOODMAN: You have, earlier this month, a federal judge, Geoffrey Crawford, ordering the release of Columbia University graduate, Palestinian activist Mohsen Mahdawi from a prison in Vermont. He was picked up by masked, hooded ICE agents at his naturalization interview in Vermont. He was beyond holding a green card. The judge writing in his ruling, quote, \u201cOur nation has seen times like this before, especially during the Red Scare and Palmer Raids of 1919-1920\u201d and during the McCarthy period of the 1950s. And I wanted to take it beyond that. You note that, you know, that we\u2019re not just talking about individual professors anymore. We\u2019re talking about current attacks being much broader. And you write that \u2014 this interesting paradox, quote, \u201cdespite higher education\u2019s much larger footprint within American society, today the academy is in a much weaker position to resist political intervention.\u201d Why is it weaker?\nELLEN SCHRECKER: It\u2019s weaker for two reasons. One, because the state is stronger. The state does much more with regard to higher education than it did in the 1950s. You know, it supports most important basic scientific research. It regulates things on campus with regard to, shall we say, diversity, equity and inclusion, with trying to ensure that all Americans have a good shot at higher education. That was a push by the federal government. So, you can see that the government is much more involved. It funds student loans. Most smaller universities without huge endowments rely on students who have to get federal loans in order to pay tuitions. So, what he\u2019s doing by withdrawing federal money from higher education is, essentially, threatening to destroy American higher education today.\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to turn to the clip of Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking in March following the arrest of the Columbia graduate student, now graduated graduate student, albeit he was in jail in Louisiana when he got his diploma at Columbia, Mahmoud Khalil.\nSECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: If you tell us, when you apply, \u201cHi. I\u2019m trying to get into the United States on a student visa. I am a big supporter of Hamas, a murderous, barbaric group that kidnaps children, that rapes teenage girls, that takes hostages, that allows them to die in captivity, that returns more bodies than live hostages,\u201d if you tell us that you are in favor of a group like this, and if you tell us when you apply for your visa, \u201cAnd by the way, I intend to come to your country as a student and rile up all kinds of anti-Jewish student, antisemitic activities. I intend to shut down your universities,\u201d if you told us all these things when you applied for a visa, we would deny your visa. I hope we would. If you actually end up doing that, once you\u2019re in this country on such a visa, we will revoke it. And if you end up having a green card \u2014 not citizenship, but a green card \u2014 as a result of that visa while you\u2019re here and those activities, we\u2019re going to kick you out.\nAMY GOODMAN: Of course, the Trump administration not proven any of this. And a number of students have been released from prison, with very angry judges talking about \u201cWhere are the grounds for these people to be imprisoned?\u201d Mahmoud Khalil has been now imprisoned for three months as his little baby was born here in New York. If you can talk about what this leads to, these kind of harsh attacks, when it comes to speech and when it comes to universities? You were just addressing the deans at Columbia University. Some compare Harvard not fighting \u2014 Harvard fighting back against the Trump administration, and Columbia conceding, and the pressure it\u2019s put on its students.\nELLEN SCHRECKER: Yeah, this has been a constant in the history of American higher education to collaborate with political repression. They, universities, do not fight back. They didn\u2019t fight back during the McCarthy period. They\u2019re not \u2014 were not fighting back, until this miracle. It really was a miracle, totally unexpected, of the president at Harvard saying, \u201cNo, I cannot go along with what you were asking.\u201d And what they were \u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: The Jewish president at Harvard, right?\nELLEN SCHRECKER: He\u2019s Jewish, right.\nAMY GOODMAN: Alan Garber, who President Trump is accusing of antisemitism.\nELLEN SCHRECKER: Well, of course, we\u2019re all antisemites, as long as we feel that maybe you shouldn\u2019t be killing babies in Gaza every day.\nBut what we\u2019re seeing is the beginning of a pushback against what Trump is doing, what his entire apparatus of hoodlums, I think, is trying to do to the universities. And that wonderful quote you had from Secretary of State Rubio, when he said, you know, paraphrasing these supposed terrorists, that they wanted to shut down the universities, he\u2019s doing more to shut down the universities than probably anybody else in America at this moment.\nAMY GOODMAN: Threatening to revoke the visas of all \u2014\nELLEN SCHRECKER: Exactly.\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014 international students. What about the role of your organization, the AAUP, the American Association of University Professors?\nELLEN SCHRECKER: Right. We are a group that is over a hundred years old. And when we were founded, it was a period very much like today, where outsiders, politicians and especially very wealthy businesspeople on boards of trustees, were interfering with what faculty members were saying and doing with regard to \u2014 at that point, there was a lot of labor unrest and attempts to create unions. And university professors were sort of saying, \u201cWell, look at the working conditions under which American workers are being oppressed. Let\u2019s do something about industrial accidents and things like that.\u201d Today, we\u2019re seeing that, in every way, the federal government, state legislators interfering with the academic work of university professors. And that is what my organization is trying to do, is to protect the integrity and the educational value of what goes on on American campuses.\nAMY GOODMAN: Do you hold out hope, in this last minute we have together?\nELLEN SCHRECKER: Yes, because, unfortunately, we have no model we can follow from McCarthyism, because there was no pushback, but today we\u2019re seeing people marching to commencement at Harvard wearing labels saying, you know, \u201cEnough is enough, President Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing huge crowds showing up to welcome Mohsen coming back from Vermont after having been picked up by ICE.\nWe\u2019re seeing a growing movement within civil society, that has to be maintained, and has to be maintained for years. I mean, the damage that the Trump administration is doing is absolutely beyond the pale and has never, never been equaled in American life with regard to higher education. So, we\u2019ve got to get out there in the trenches and even begin to think some more about: OK, if they\u2019re not paying attention to the judges, if the Supreme Court folds \u2014 and let us pray that it does not \u2014 what do we have to do?\nAMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re going to have to leave it there, Ellen Schrecker, author of Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America, No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities, also the author of The Right to Learn: Resisting the Right-Wing Attack on Academic Freedom. We\u2019ll link to your piece in The Nation headlined \u201cWorse Than McCarthyism: Universities in the Age of Trump,\u201d as well as Jelani Cobb\u2019s piece in The New Yorker that extensively quotes you, Ellen Schrecker, at democracynow.org.\nWhen we come back, President Trump vows to go to the Supreme Court to keep his tariffs in place, even though court after court is challenging them.

        "Summary": "Republican elected officials are trying to roll back passed measures and place restrictions on citizen-led initiatives.",
        "Content": "Across the country, Republican lawmakers have been working to undermine or altogether undo the will of the voters by making it harder to pass amendments and laws through citizen-led initiatives.\nIn Missouri, the 2025 legislative session was dominated by Republican lawmakers trying to reverse two major measures that voters had put on the ballot and approved just months before; one made abortion in the state legal again, while the other created an employee sick leave requirement.\nGOP lawmakers in Alaska and Nebraska also have moved to roll back sick leave benefits that voters approved last year, while legislators in Arizona are pushing new restrictions on abortion access, despite voters six months ago approving protections.\nAt the same time, Republican leaders in Florida, Utah, Montana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Arizona, Ohio, North Dakota and South Dakota have approved efforts to restrict citizen-led ballot initiatives or are considering measures to do so, essentially trying to make it harder for voters to change laws outside legislatures.\nIn some cases, legislators aren\u2019t just responding to measures that voters approved; they\u2019re acting shortly after citizen-led efforts failed but came too close for comfort, such as an abortion-rights initiative in Florida, which in November fell just short of the 60% of votes needed to pass and loosen the state\u2019s ban on the procedure.\nRepublican elected officials across these states make strikingly similar arguments: They say the initiative process is susceptible to fraud and unduly influenced by out-of-state money. What\u2019s more, they say that they, as elected officials, represent the true will of the people more than ballot initiatives do.\nIn his opening speech on the first day of Utah\u2019s legislative session in January, Senate President Stuart Adams urged lawmakers to push back against citizen-led ballot initiatives, warning that \u201cunelected special interest groups outside of Utah\u201d were using the process to \u201coverride our republic\u201d and \u201ccast aside those who are duly elected.\u201d\nUtah lawmakers then passed a law tightening the process. They required initiative sponsors to detail how their proposal would be funded and, if it makes the ballot, pay for costly publication of the ballot language in newspapers across the state \u2014 potentially adding $1.4 million in expenses. They also voted to put a 2026 measure before voters that would require a 60% supermajority for any tax-related initiatives.\nThe battle between direct democracy and representative government isn\u2019t new, and it hasn\u2019t always been the domain of just Republicans. Democrats have done the same thing, although perhaps not with the same frequency, when voters have taken steps they had campaigned against.\nWhat\u2019s different now, political observers say, is that the tension has reached a new level. State lawmakers, primarily Republicans the past few years, are routinely trying to undermine voter majorities.\n\u201cThis is very much connected to the rise of authoritarianism that we\u2019ve seen across the country,\u201d said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a nonprofit that tracks and supports ballot measures across the 26 states and the District of Columbia that allow some form of direct democracy. \u201cThey can\u2019t win fairly, so they\u2019re trying to rewrite the rules to get their way no matter what a majority of folks in their state wants.\u201d\nIn Missouri, overturning the will of voters has almost become the legislature\u2019s main business. Lawmakers wasted no time moving to undo a constitutional amendment that legalized abortion up to fetal viability, advancing a new measure to place another amendment on the ballot that would ban it again.\nThey also moved to repeal a sick leave requirement and portions of a minimum wage increase, which had also passed through the initiative process but which Republicans have said are harmful to businesses.\nThe bill has gone to Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has indicated that he will sign it.\nIn addition, Missouri lawmakers passed, and the governor signed, a new law that limits the ability of courts to intervene when the legislature writes ballot language for proposed constitutional amendments.\nCritics say the law opens the door to misleading ballot language, giving politicians and partisan officials more power to frame initiatives in a way that could mislead voters. Kehoe said in a statement that the law \u201cstreamlines complex procedures while protecting the rights of every Missourian.\u201d\nState Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson, has supported multiple failed efforts to change the state\u2019s initiative process \u2014 he\u2019d prefer a 60% threshold rather than a simple majority, as it is now \u2014 and backed the sick leave repeal and the amendment to restore Missouri\u2019s abortion ban.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been elected in a representative republic to see to the needs of the people,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\nState Rep. Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City and the House minority leader, recalled that one of her first fights as a lawmaker was over the expansion of Medicaid, which voters approved in 2020 but Republican lawmakers refused to fund the following year.\n\u201cThey thought they were being clever \u2014 and of course, the courts told them they are not clever. They had to fund it,\u201d Aune said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen this nearly every year I\u2019ve been here, and this year has been the absolute worst.\u201d\nIn response to lawmakers\u2019 efforts, a new campaign called Respect Missouri Voters is recruiting volunteers to collect signatures for a statewide ballot measure in November 2026. The measure would bar lawmakers from overturning voter-approved initiatives or undermining the citizens\u2019 ability to use the initiative process.\nIn several states, Republican legislators are trying to change the initiative petition process by imposing stricter rules on who can collect signatures and how petitions are submitted and raising the threshold for passing amendments. They are also trying to limit out-of-state funding, shorten signature-gathering windows and give themselves more power to rewrite or block voter-approved measures.\nArkansas is one example of where this is playing out. Last year, abortion rights supporters turned in more than 100,000 signatures for a ballot measure that would have loosened the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban. But the state Supreme Court upheld a lower court\u2019s ruling blocking the proposal from making the ballot, deciding that organizers had made a technical error in how they submitted paperwork for a portion of the signatures that had been collected by paid canvassers.\nThis year, state Sen. Kim Hammer, a Republican from Benton, led a push to pass a series of laws aimed at the ballot initiative process. They place requirements on petition circulators and signers, including mandates that the signer read the ballot title in the presence of a canvasser or have it read to them, that canvassers ask signers to show photo ID and that they inform signers that petition fraud is a crime. They also expand state oversight, giving officials more power to disqualify petitions.\nThe League of Women Voters of Arkansas has filed a lawsuit challenging some of the new laws, along with existing restrictions, arguing that they violate the U.S. Constitution. Arkansas Secretary of State Cole Jester said in a statement that they were \u201cbasic, commonsense protections, and we look forward to fighting for them.\u201d\nHammer said he\u2019s concerned that outside groups are using Arkansas as a testing ground for policy changes, and he wants to prevent that by keeping the ballot process \u201cas pure as possible.\u201d\n\u201cThey drop the rock in the state, and it just ripples out from there,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSo it\u2019s to the benefit of abortionists and to the benefit of the marijuana industry and others to be able to do whatever they have to do to get a foothold.\u201d\nDan Smith, a political scientist at the University of Florida who studies direct democracy, said it wasn\u2019t long ago that voters might punish a candidate for opposing a popular policy \u2014 like raising the minimum wage or expanding health care.\nBut that connection has largely been severed in the minds of voters, he said. Today, many voters experience a kind of cognitive dissonance: They support abortion rights or paid sick leave at the ballot box but continue voting for politicians who oppose those policies.\nThey don\u2019t see the contradiction, he said, because partisanship has become more about team loyalty than policy.\nSmith said the disconnect is reinforced by gerrymandered legislative and congressional districts, which are drawn to favor Republican candidates and help maintain their supermajority control. They can override or ignore voter-backed initiatives with little political risk.\nDirect democracy in the United States took root during the Progressive Era of the late 1800s and early 1900s, especially in the West and Midwest, where newer states had less entrenched political structures and were more open to reform. These regions were often skeptical of centralized power, and reformers pushed for tools like the initiative and referendum to give citizens a way to bypass political machines and corporate influence.\nThe first state to adopt the initiative process into its constitution was South Dakota in 1898. Now it\u2019s one of the states where legislators are trying to undermine it.\nMost East Coast and Southern states never adopted initiative processes at all. Their constitutions didn\u2019t allow for it, and lawmakers have shown little interest in surrendering power to voters through direct legislation. Some academics have argued the process is barred by Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, which requires states to produce governments by electoral processes.\nWhile efforts to override or undermine voter-approved initiatives are now almost exclusively driven by Republicans, Democratic-controlled legislatures have also tried to rein in direct democracy when it clashed with their priorities.\nAfter California voters passed Proposition 13 in 1978 to limit property taxes \u2014 and later Proposition 209 in 1996 banning affirmative action \u2014 Democrats sought ways to blunt or undo their impact through legislation and legal challenges.\nIn the mid-2000s, Colorado Democrats began pushing to restrict the initiative process after a wave of conservative-backed measures passed at the ballot box. A key example was Amendment 43, a 2006 initiative placed on the ballot by citizen petition, which amended the state constitution to define marriage as between \u201cone man and one woman.\u201d It passed with 55% of the vote and effectively banned same-sex marriage in the state until the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such bans in 2015.\nIn 2008, Colorado\u2019s Democratic-controlled legislature placed a referendum on the ballot that would have made it harder for people to petition to change the state constitution. The measure, also backed by some Republicans, failed at the polls. But in 2016, voters approved a citizen-initiated measure that raised the bar for constitutional amendments by requiring signatures from every state senate district and a 55% supermajority to pass. More recently, Democrats have sought to overturn Colorado\u2019s \u201ctaxpayer bill of rights,\u201d which voters enacted through initiative petition in 1992. The measure prohibits tax increases without voter approval. Democrats have argued the law may be unconstitutional because it strips the legislature of its budgetary authority.\nBut most of the states that allow citizen-led ballot initiatives are Republican-controlled, which means the fight over direct democracy is often playing out in red states. At the center of the GOP argument is the claim that voter initiatives are driven by outside influence and funding. Smith called it \u201chypocrisy.\u201d\n\u201cIf you ask lawmakers to not take any outside contributions when they are running for office, they would find every reason under the sun to oppose it,\u201d he said.\nEfforts to change the initiative process have themselves drawn heavy outside funding. In August 2023, Ohio voters decisively rejected Issue 1, a Republican-backed proposal to raise the threshold for passing constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60%. The measure also would have made it harder to place initiatives on the ballot by requiring signatures from at least 5% of voters in all 88 counties.\nBackers claimed the changes were needed to protect the constitution from out-of-state special interests \u2014 but the campaign itself was funded mostly by $4 million from conservative Illinois billionaire Dick Uihlein.\nJust three months later, Ohio voters returned to the polls and approved a new Issue 1 \u2014 this time a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights up to fetal viability. It passed with nearly 57% of the vote.\nIn 2006, Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment to raise the threshold for future amendments to 60% \u2014 but the measure itself passed with just 57.8% of the vote, a margin that wouldn\u2019t meet the standard it created.\nThat irony came into sharp focus in 2024, when a ballot measure to protect abortion rights received 57% of the vote \u2014 more support than a similar measure in Missouri, which passed with just under 52% \u2014 yet failed in Florida due to the supermajority rule.\nAfter the election, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Republican lawmakers began pushing for even tougher restrictions on the process, pointing to a report issued by the governor\u2019s administration alleging \u201cwidespread petition fraud\u201d in the push for the abortion rights measure. The governor signed a law prohibiting felons, non-U.S. citizens and non-Florida residents from serving as petition circulators; limiting the number of signed petitions a volunteer can collect before being required to register as an official canvasser and requiring signers to write either the last four numbers of their Social Security or driver\u2019s license number on petitions.\nIn response, several groups have filed a federal lawsuit challenging the new restrictions. Florida Decides Healthcare, which is working to place a Medicaid expansion initiative on the 2026 ballot, has argued that the law imposes vague and punitive restrictions that chill political speech and civic engagement. The state has not yet responded to the lawsuit; the lead defendant, Secretary of State Cord Byrd, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cI think that what happens here is being watched and copied,\u201d Mitch Emerson, executive director of Florida Decides Healthcare, said in an interview. \u201cAnd if these attacks on democracy work in Florida, they\u2019ll spread.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Israeli ministers said the expansion is aimed at preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state.",
        "Content": "Israeli officials have announced a plan to advance settler colonialism in the occupied West Bank by establishing 22 new settlements, in open defiance of international law.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who have previously pushed for the total annexation of the West Bank, said in a statement that the expansion is aimed at furthering Israel\u2019s goal of quashing any possibility of a Palestinian state.\n\u201cAll the new communities are being established with a long-term strategic vision, aimed at reinforcing Israeli control of the territory, preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state, and securing development reserves for settlement in the coming decades,\u201d the ministers said.\nThe expansion includes the legalization, under Israeli law, of numerous existing Israeli outposts technically built without authorization but still created under the purview and with the protection of Israeli soldiers. Such illegal outposts have ballooned since Israel began its genocide in Gaza, with settlers builiding dozens of new outposts through violent expulsion of Palestinians from their land.\nNabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the expansion announcement a \u201cdangerous escalation\u201d that will perpetuate a \u201ccycle of violence and instability\u201d in the region already facing an increase in Israeli settler violence.\n\u201cThis decision violates all international resolutions, especially UN Security Council Resolution 2334,\u201d which reaffirms the illegality of Israel\u2019s settlements in Palestine, Rudeineh said.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a historic decision last year ruling that Israel\u2019s occupation and annexation of Palestine is illegal. It ordered Israel and Israeli settlers \u2014 who are often explicitly backed by Israeli leaders \u2014 to end all new settlement activities.\nIn other words, the announcement of yet more settlements blatantly flouts international law.\nIsraeli group Peace Now says that this is the largest single settlement expansion since the signing of the Oslo Accords over 30 years ago, and condemned the announcement as \u201cadvancing de facto annexation.\u201d\nIsrael has already established roughly 160 settlements, housing 700,000 Israelis, in the tiny territory roughly the size of Delaware.\nIsrael has been accelerating settlement establishment at a record pace throughout its genocide in Gaza. Officials carry this out through recognizing settlements and through means like demolishing thousands of Palestinians\u2019 homes, paving the way for future outposts or settlements and forcing Palestinians to consider leaving the territory entirely.\nThe latest expansion comes as Israel has embarked on what appears to be the final stages of its genocide in Gaza. Officials like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are no longer hiding their intentions of the forced expulsion of all Palestinians from Gaza in order to make way for total Israeli control of the territory.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "Universities should ensure that their research output is \u201cin sync\u201d with Trump administration goals in order to keep their federal funding, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said on Wednesday, as scientists across the U.S. warn of dire consequences brought by the administration\u2019s massive cuts.\n\u201cUniversities should continue to be able to do research as long as they\u2019re abiding by the laws and are in sync, I think, with the administration and what the administration is trying to accomplish,\u201d McMahon said in an interview on CNBC.\nThis represents a complete reversal of the process of scientific or other research inquiry, as McMahon is essentially implying that researchers must determine the outcome of their studies before analyzing the actual evidence.\nMcMahon\u2019s statement lays bare the true reasoning behind the sweeping cuts to scientific research in the U.S. led by Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d \u2014 effectively saying that the thousands of now-terminated health and safety research grants, on crucial subjects like cancer treatment or anything racism-related, can no longer continue because they clashed with the Trump administration\u2019s goals.\nExperts have warned that these cuts will not just jeopardize the U.S.\u2019s global standing as a beacon for research and scientific breakthroughs, but may also cost lives and cause a massive setback for research internationally. The cuts will also result in an estimated 68,000 people losing their jobs across the U.S.\nThe remarks, combined with the administration\u2019s other attacks on scientific research and health guidelines, are a show of the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to sacrifice lives and livelihoods in order to demand compliance with its authoritarian agenda.\nFor instance, with regards to the administration\u2019s attacks on Harvard University, including funding revocations and other threats to the university\u2019s operations, McMahon said that President Donald Trump is trying to send a message to other schools to comply with the administration\u2019s demands.\n\u201cThe president is looking at this as, \u2018okay, how can we really make our point? And what are the things that Harvard and other universities are doing that we have to call attention to?\u2019\u201d she said.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken numerous steps to censor scientific research in order to promote his own disinformation campaign.\nOn Wednesday, Kennedy threatened to ban government-funded scientists from publishing in the world\u2019s top medical journals, including the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA, calling them \u201ccorrupt\u201d without explanation. He said that, under his purview, the government will instead make its own journals that only employ \u201clegitimate scientist[s].\u201d\nWhat Kennedy has historically deemed as \u201clegitimate\u201d science has often been, in actuality, bunk conspiracy theories backed by little to no scientific evidence, like his dangerous views regarding vaccines and autism. Like McMahon, Kennedy has adopted a prescriptive view of scientific inquiry, saying last month that the U.S. will determine the cause of autism \u2014 believed by scientists to be caused by various genetic and environmental factors \u2014 by September.\nMeanwhile, according to a report published Thursday by Notus, Kennedy\u2019s flagship \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report contains numerous glaring errors, including claims that directly contradict the research it cites, and seven studies that don\u2019t exist, seemingly falsified by Trump administration staffers.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 20:05:02 +0000",
        "Summary": "The state law imposes massive fines on anyone who releases air quality data, possibly violating the First Amendment.",
        "Content": "For several years, Amy Stelly has been partnering with the Louisiana State University School of Public Health in New Orleans to monitor air quality next to the Claiborne Expressway, a busy highway that runs northwest of the city\u2019s iconic French Quarter.\nAt a community meeting in April, Stelly, who runs an organization called the Claiborne Avenue Alliance Design Studio, was excited to unveil some of this data in a new interactive tool on the alliance\u2019s website. People would be able to see hot spots for particulate matter \u2014 a pollutant generated by heavy traffic and associated with health risks like heart attacks and aggravated asthma \u2014 near their homes, schools, and workplaces. The data would support her push for the expressway\u2019s removal and could be used by other neighborhood groups to advocate against highway expansion.\nBut the data on her website was short-lived. Stelly had her webmaster remove it soon after the community meeting. She had gotten wind of a 2024 state law that made it illegal to share air pollution data generated from technologies not approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. Violations could incur hefty fines of up to $32,500 a day, with violations done \u201cintentionally, willfully, or knowingly\u201d racking up an additional $1 million.\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t make sense to do a big push, given the fact that we were violating the law by even having a meeting,\u201d Stelly said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford $32,500 a day. I don\u2019t have that, nor do I have the million dollars. So it just seemed more prudent to remain quiet for a while.\u201d\nThe Claiborne Avenue Alliance is part of a coalition of neighborhood and environmental groups that sued Louisiana regulators last week over the state\u2019s Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA. The 2024 law was ostensibly meant to standardize community-based air monitoring programs throughout Louisiana, many of which had recently expanded thanks to funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But the community groups \u2014 including The Concerned Citizens of St. John; The Descendants Project; Jefferson, Orleans, Irish Channel Neighbors for Clean Air; Micah 6:8 Mission; and Rise St. James; along with the Claiborne Avenue Alliance Design Studio \u2014 said the law is a de facto ban on the dissemination of their research and a violation of their First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty mind-boggling,\u201d Stelly said.\nCAMRA was backed by petrochemical industry trade associations. It essentially says that if community groups want to monitor air pollution and share their data with the public, they have to use \u201can [EPA]-approved or promulgated emission test or monitoring method,\u201d based on the pollutant being monitored. CAMRA\u2019s requirements only apply to monitoring \u201cfor the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance\u201d with federal, state, or local air quality laws. In other words, they only kick in for community groups trying to identify illegal levels of air pollution.\nPollutants covered by CAMRA include six federally regulated \u201ccriteria air pollutants\u201d (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide), 188 federally regulated \u201chazardous air pollutants,\u201d and 14 \u201ctoxic air pollutants\u201d regulated by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.\nAccording to a Louisiana DEQ study from earlier this year, regulatory-grade monitors for these pollutants costs more than $791,000 each, plus up to $200,000 more for annual maintenance and operations. Those prohibitive costs are, in a way, the reason community air monitoring programs exist in the first place. By using less expensive equipment, they\u2019re able to deploy air monitors in places that would otherwise not be covered by the EPA\u2019s reference monitors and the 27 air monitoring sites within the National Air Toxics Trends Station Network.\n\u201cThere is no need for these groups to spend $60,000, $80,000, $100,000 on equipment when in fact there is equipment that, for $200 or less, will give you perfectly adequate results for you to be able to tell your community, your family, whether or not the air they\u2019re breathing is safe,\u201d said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project, at a press conference last week.\nCynthia Roberts, executive director of the nonprofit Micah 6:8 Mission \u2014 one of the groups that brought the lawsuit \u2014 told reporters that CAMRA \u201cis not about protecting public health or ensuring good science. It\u2019s about silencing communities like mine.\u201d She said her organization\u2019s air monitors near a Westlake Chemical complex in Sulphur, Louisiana, have frequently shown particulate matter concentrations higher than what the EPA considers unhealthy. Roberts used to post this information on Facebook. But now, she said, \u201csimply posting that kind of data could cost us $32,500 per day.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not just chilling,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s censorship, and it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\nNone of the community groups that brought the lawsuit has been fined since CAMRA was enacted last year, but their leaders say the law has obstructed their work. Caitlion Hunter, research and policy coordinator for Rise St. James, said community air monitoring has been critical along the 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River dubbed \u201cCancer Alley\u201d due to its density of petrochemical facilities and elevated cancer rate. People rely on her organization\u2019s data, she said, because federal regulators have failed to monitor for ethylene oxide, a human carcinogen. Joy Banner, who co-directs The Descendants Project, said she \u201cput a pause\u201d on a planned program to publicize data from her nonprofit\u2019s air quality monitors in St. John the Baptist Parish, in the heart of Cancer Alley.\nCAMRA is \u201cscaring us away from being able to share the data with our community members who need it the most,\u201d Banner said at the press conference.\nNandan Joshi, an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, which is representing the community groups alongside the Environmental Integrity Project, told Grist that CAMRA violates Louisianans\u2019 First Amendment rights to free speech in three ways: First, it seeks to broadly regulate any \u201callegations\u201d made against polluters \u2014 even if those allegations are made in an informal context, rather than in court. Second, it includes a provision requiring \u201cquality assurance certifications\u201d to be published alongside certain air pollution analyses, even though it doesn\u2019t say what those certifications are. And third, it requires that any air pollution-related communications come with \u201cclear explanations\u201d of the data interpretation and any relevant uncertainties. Joshi described this as compelled speech \u2014 an \u201cobvious\u201d First Amendment violation \u2014 and said it wasn\u2019t clear what the regulators would consider to be a sufficient explanation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare these days to see something so directly regulating speech,\u201d Joshi said. The West Virginia House of Delegates passed a similar bill last year, but it died in the state senate. A law passed earlier this year in Kentucky limits community air monitoring data in rulemaking, but does not attempt to stymie the public sharing of that data.\nThe Louisiana community groups\u2019 lawsuit also argues that CAMRA violates their First Amendment \u201cright to petition\u201d \u2014 to use their air monitoring data when asking the Department of Environmental Quality or the EPA to step in when clean air laws have been violated. A third claim says CAMRA is in conflict with the Clean Air Act and the EPA\u2019s efforts under the Inflation Reduction Act to promote the use of community air sensors. The plaintiffs want the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the state attorney general\u2019s office to be barred from enforcing CAMRA.\nThe Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality declined to comment. The state\u2019s attorney general, Liz Murrill, told Grist, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs \u2018violates their constitutional rights.\u2019 But we\u2019ll defend the lawsuit.\u201d\nStelly, with the Claiborne Avenue Alliance Design Studio, said she and her colleagues have found themselves in a confounding situation. In many cases, they obtained air sensors through EPA grants \u2014 but now they\u2019re being told that those sensors are insufficient. For Stelly specifically, her grant and partnership with Louisiana State University will eventually require her to submit a written report on the data she\u2019s collected, even though CAMRA suggests such a report could be illegal.\nCAMRA \u201cwill force us into a position of noncompliance if we cannot provide that written report with that data,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very weird.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared in Grist.\nGrist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

        "Content": "Former Columbia University student protester Mahmoud Khalil remained in detention in Louisiana Thursday even after a ruling by a federal judge who found that his imprisonment by Trump immigration officials is \u201clikely\u201d unconstitutional \u2014 but his attorneys expressed hope that the decision brought Khalil a step closer to being reunited with his wife and newborn son.\nU.S. District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey ruled that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has likely violated constitutional law in his attempt to use Section 1227 of the U.S. Code to remove Khalil from the United States.\nRubio first claimed that Khalil\u2019s involvement in student protests supporting Palestinian rights last year threatened U.S. foreign policy interests, and then alleged that Khalil committed fraud by not disclosing information about his past work with the Syria Office at the British Embassy in Beirut and with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), an agency that has long received U.S. funding to provide aid to Palestinians in Gaza.\nCalling the administration\u2019s pursuit of Khalil\u2019s deportation \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Farbiarz wrote, \u201cThe issue now before the court has been this: Does the Constitution allow the Secretary of State to use Section 1227, as applied through the determination, to try to remove the petitioner from the United States? The court\u2019s answer: likely not.\u201d\n\u201cIf Section 1227 can apply, here, to the petitioner, then other, similar statutes can also one day be made to apply,\u201d the judge added. \u201cNot just in the removal context, as to foreign nationals. But also in the criminal context, as to everyone.\u201d\nNEW: In today's opinion, Judge Farbiarz says the government's invocation of the \"foreign policy provision\" to deport Mahmoud Khalil was likely unconstitutional. He invites further briefing and will issue an order on Wednesday with next steps. pic.twitter.com/WKIp8meNNl\n\u2014 Tyler McBrien (@TylerMcBrien) May 28, 2025\nBut Farbiarz called on Khalil\u2019s legal team to provide more information pertaining to the government\u2019s accusations against him regarding his immigration application, and declined to issue a preliminary injunction to release Khalil on bail \u2014 or to move him from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Jena, Louisiana to one in New Jersey where he would be closer to his wife and son.\nThe judge wrote that his finding \u201cdoes not entitle [Khalil] to a preliminary injunction. He has not put before the court evidence as to the various other things he must prove\u2026 before an injunction might issue\u2026 The court will give the petitioner a chance to quickly fill out the record, and for the respondents to then weigh in.\u201d\nKhalil is being represented by groups including the ACLU, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the ACLU of New Jersey, and several legal firms. His legal team said that Farbiarz \u201cheld what we already knew: Secretary Rubio\u2019s weaponization of immigration law to punish Mahmoud and others like him is likely unconstitutional.\u201d\n\u201cWe will work as quickly as possible to provide the court the additional information it requested supporting our effort to free Mahmoud or otherwise return him to his wife and newborn son,\u201d said the team. \u201cEvery day Mahmoud spends languishing in an ICE detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, is an affront to justice, and we won\u2019t stop working until he is free.\u201d\nKhalil was informed by immigration agents who detained him outside his Columbia University-owned apartment in March that his green card had been revoked, before they took him in an unmarked vehicle to a detention center in New Jersey. He was then transferred 1,400 miles away to Jena where he\u2019s been separated from his legal counsel as well as his family\nAn immigration judge in Louisiana ruled last month that the administration can pursue Khalil\u2019s deportation. The case in New Jersey is challenging his detention on the grounds that his constitutional free speech and due process rights have been violated.\nSeveral other international students who have been detained for supporting Palestinian rights\u2014and opposing Israel\u2019s U.S.-backed assault on Gaza \u2014 have been released from detention in recent weeks.\nElora Mukherjee, a professor at Columbia Law School, said Farbiarz\u2019s ruling was \u201ca victory in terms of the court recognizing that the targeting of Mahmoud Khalil based on his protected speech violates the due process protection he should be afforded under the Constitution.\u201d\n\u201cPeople around the world are watching to see what is happening in Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s case as one of the most prominent examples of the Trump administration taking actions against international students in the United States,\u201d Mukherjee told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd I think the biggest takeaway that people will see is that he is still in detention in Louisiana, separated from his wife and his newborn baby and having missed his graduation. It is a symbol of the hostility of the executive branch to international students and lawful permanent residents right now.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "Israel has repeatedly claimed without evidence that Hamas endangers civilians by hiding behind human shields. It turns out, however, that Israel has systematically used Palestinians as human shields in violation of both international and Israeli law. A new investigation by the Associated Press joins reports by +972 Magazine, Haaretz and the Red Cross in documenting how Palestinians have been used as human shields to inspect buildings, tunnels and other sites in Gaza and the West Bank. The investigation includes testimony and evidence from both Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians, collected in part by the anti-occupation Israeli veterans\u2019 group Breaking the Silence. In what is being called the \u201cmosquito procedure,\u201d Israeli soldiers are \u201cordered by senior officers to grab Palestinians next to them and to use them as human shields,\u201d explains Breaking the Silence\u2019s executive director, Nadav Weiman. \u201cDehumanization of Palestinians in Israel [has] become something so common that it also leads to these kind[s] of practices inside the IDF.\u201d\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: We turn now to Gaza, where more evidence is coming to light about how Israel has systematically used Palestinians as human shields in violation of both international and Israeli law. That\u2019s the conclusion of a new investigation by the Associated Press based on interviews with Israeli soldiers and with Palestinians who said they were used as human shields to inspect buildings, tunnels and other sites in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The AP reports the Israeli soldiers said the practice was used in part to spare combat dogs from injury or death. One Israeli sergeant admitted to using Palestinians as young as 16 years old as human shields.\nAMY GOODMAN: In February, the news outlet +972 revealed how Israel used an 80-year-old man as a human shield. Troops tied an explosive cord around his neck, then forced him to search abandoned buildings. After he finished the mission, he was ordered to flee, but then another Israeli unit fatally shot him and his wife Haaretz and the Red Cross have also documented Israel\u2019s use of human shields.\nThe AP report is based in part on testimonies collected by Breaking the Silence, a group made up of former Israeli soldiers opposed to the Israeli occupation. The group has also released photos of Palestinians being used as human shields in Gaza.\nWe\u2019re joined now by the group\u2019s executive director, Nadav Weiman. He\u2019s a former Israeli soldier, joining us from Tel Aviv.\nThanks so much for being with us. Tell us what information you collected, the Israeli soldiers you talked to, and how exactly they\u2019re using Palestinians as human shields.\nNADAV WEIMAN: So, Amy, I\u2019ve got to say that from the beginning of this war, we got testimonies from soldiers that told us that they were ordered by senior officers to grab Palestinians next to them and to use them as human shields, meaning that they were ordered to send Palestinians \u2014 some of them were dressed up with IDF uniforms, had GoPro cameras on their head or on their chest, and then they were sent into tunnels and houses to check that there isn\u2019t any IEDs or explosives over there, so the soldiers could enter safely or clear the area. And we got testimonies from different units, different times, different places in the Gaza Strip, which shows, as you said, that it\u2019s widely spread, this protocol.\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Nadav, as far as you know, how long has this practice been in place?\nNADAV WEIMAN: Now, the first testimony that we have is from December 2023, meaning immediately after the ground invasion started. And the last testimony that we had is from the beginning of this year, beginning of 2025, just before the ceasefire. And it\u2019s something that the IDF is using more and more and more, more units and more areas throughout the world.\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And to what extent are you aware of soldiers resisting these orders to use Palestinians as human shields?\nNADAV WEIMAN: Yeah, so, it\u2019s interesting. Now, every \u2014 almost every soldier in the IDF learned about the fact that we used Palestinians as human shields during the Second Intifada. Back then, we called it the \u201cneighbor procedure,\u201d when you come to arrest a high-ranking Palestinian or you know that he\u2019s armed, so you grab the next-door neighbor, and you told the neighbor, \u201cYou knock on the door. Not me.\u201d And maybe he will get shot. And if nobody shot him, then we told him, \u201cGet inside the house. Open all of the doors, and open all of the lights,\u201d so we will be more safe. And that was banned by the Supreme Court in Israel in the end of the Second Intifada. So, the reservists in the Israeli army grew up on that history, that we did something, it was bad, but it was banned, and that\u2019s it.\nAnd now they got a command that is exactly that, but, I can say, even worse, actually. Right? Because it\u2019s dressing them up in IDF uniform. Some of the soldiers told us that it\u2019s maybe that they will be the target, so they will get shot. Now, the thing is, is that our testifiers told us there was a debate inside their unit, but it\u2019s our testifiers, right? I just read an op-ed in Haaretz of an officer that served in Gaza, and he said that almost every platoon is using human shields. Right? So, our testifiers told us there was a debate. They came to the senior officers and told them, \u201cHey, you know, that we were trained to fight, not to use human beings as human shields, or that\u2019s dehumanization of Palestinians, or that\u2019s immoral or illegal,\u201d or I don\u2019t know what. But I cannot tell you what\u2019s going on in the greater IDF at the moment.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, explain, Nadav Weiman, why this is called the \u201cmosquito procedure.\u201d And also talk about what these Israeli soldiers told you about what happens to the Palestinians, many forced into houses, buildings, tunnels, that are suspected of being booby-trapped, allegedly made to perform tasks like looking for explosives in tunnels.\nNADAV WEIMAN: Yeah, so, first of all, a lot of things that the IDF has names for, I don\u2019t know the reason. But I can say that mosquito, like, it\u2019s a bug that flies in the air, and, like, you can kill it. Who cares about it? And that was the relationship a lot of times between the soldiers and those Palestinian individuals that were used. And that\u2019s the word: They were \u201cused.\u201d Right? We have a testifier that called them a \u201csub-army of slaves.\u201d\nNow, the protocol is quite simple. You need that individual with you for a period of time \u2014 two days, three days, a week, three weeks. So, it means that only when he\u2019s scanning a tunnel or a house or an alley, so he doesn\u2019t have handcuffs or a blindfold. The rest of the time, when he\u2019s with you inside the house, you need to feed him. You need to take him to the bathroom. But he\u2019s also handcuffed and blindfolded, so you need to help him. In some units, they were \u2014 the mosquitoes inside the house were used to clean the house where the soldiers stayed. So, it\u2019s not only \u2014 you know, don\u2019t only think about that time in the tunnel when they need to endanger their life. Think about the rest of the time, the majority of the day, that they were living with the soldiers inside the house. But again, eventually, they were supposed to be released. So, it\u2019s \u2014 again, I\u2019m quoting that soldier \u2014 a \u201csub-army of slaves.\u201d\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Nadav, could you talk about the context in which this news has been coming out, where there\u2019s mounting anger against Netanyahu, protests all across the country yesterday, for refusing to agree to a deal that would guarantee the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza? If you could explain what the mood is in Israel, the repeated calls for Netanyahu to step down? You\u2019ve said that he\u2019s acting like a dictator.\nNADAV WEIMAN: Yeah, so, from the very beginning of this war, we and other human rights organizations, we called for a deal to release our hostages, ceasefire and enter humanitarian aid into Gaza. Now, at the beginning, we were a minority at the protests. But as this war \u2014 it\u2019s hard for me to call it a war, because, as a soldier, they told me that a war, it\u2019s two armies fighting one another. So, as this intensive operation in Gaza went so long, and we killed so many civilians, and we lost so many of our soldiers, and also we \u2014 also some of our hostages, more and more Israelis are resisting this war. And if you look at polls in Israel at the moment, you can see that the majority of Israelis, meaning even Bibi\u2019s voters, I believe, are against the continuation of this war, and pro-hostage deal and pro-ending this war. And you can see the atmosphere on the streets.\nWhat happened yesterday, it was the 600th day of this operation, or since October 7th, and we saw a lot of anger. You know, protesters in Tel Aviv took over the headquarters of the Likud party in Tel Aviv for a couple of hours, right? And they put signs. They said it\u2019s the embassy of Qatar, because of the allegation that Qatar paid for the close advisers of Bibi to support them more than anything else. But I can say that what changed is, in the mid-March, when we returned fighting in Gaza, when we continued bombing in Gaza, and we broke the ceasefire, and we stopped releasing our hostages, the majority of the audience in Israel understood that this is a war to protect Bibi\u2019s seat and Bibi\u2019s government, not to release our hostages, not to fight Hamas and not to defend our borders, because if that was the case, we will go to a hostage deal, like Witkoff helped us achieve in the minute Trump stepped into office. Now, what we saw yesterday is more and more Israelis understanding that we are being lied to, that our soldiers are sent to die and to be killed for themselves without any good reason, without releasing our hostages or ending this war.\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to turn for a last example to the occupied West Bank, Israel admitting to strapping a wounded Palestinian man to the hood of an Israeli military vehicle during a raid on Jenin. Relatives and neighbors of the man, Mujahid Azmi, said Israeli soldiers used him as a human shield instead of allowing him to get medical care after he\u2019d been shot. This is 13-year-old Alaa Azmi speaking last year.\nALAA AZMI: [translated] We told them we want an ambulance for the wounded person in the room, so the army told us to bring him to them. We got him outside. And for about an hour or a half an hour, we kept asking for an ambulance. Then we called one. Fifteen minutes later, two Jeeps came, and they got in here. The troops told us to turn around and not to look. And they put Mujahid on the Jeep\u2019s hood and took him.\nAMY GOODMAN: After a video of the incident went viral, the Israeli military released a statement claiming the action was, quote, \u201cin violation of orders and standard operating procedures.\u201d Nadav Weiman, if you can talk about how Israel is responding now to this latest news of this much more widespread use of exactly this kind of example?\nNADAV WEIMAN: Now, first of all, I\u2019ve got to say that IDF spokespersons a lot of times when they are confronted with something bad that soldiers did that are against regulation, they say, \u201cIt\u2019s against regulation. We will educate the soldiers. A mistake.\u201d And that\u2019s it \u2014 no investigation, no nothing.\nNow, I\u2019ve got to say that now the IDF announced that six investigations were opened after the IDF soldiers used Palestinians as human shields in Gaza. And it\u2019s a joke, right? Because we have so many more incidents. And even Yaniv Kubovich from Haaretz newspaper published a couple of months ago that Herzi Halevi, then-commander-in-chief of the IDF, was sitting in the meeting room while the mosquito protocol was discussed, meaning that everybody knew.\nNow, I\u2019ve got to say, that connects to something a lot bigger in the Israeli society, and that\u2019s dehumanization of Palestinians. Right? Since October 7th, it\u2019s even on steroids, right? We have government members that are openly talking about genocide. Right? When the head of the Labor Party, Yair Golan, last week said that the right-wing politician likes to kill Palestinian kids and babies, he was called as a traitor by our government. You know, we have ministers saying there isn\u2019t any innocent in Gaza, that all of the Palestinians are assisting terror or terrorists by themselves. And that seeps down into the IDF, into commands that soldiers are getting. And if you connect that with the fact that we have more and more officers and commanders in the IDF that comes from the religious right wing and from the settler movement and believe that maybe it\u2019s a holy war, not a war of defending ourselves, you can understand why you have such a huge amount of those kind of incidents. Dehumanization of Palestinians in Israel became something so common that it also leads to these kind of practices inside the IDF.\nAMY GOODMAN: Nadav Weiman, we want to thank you for being with us, executive director of Breaking the Silence, a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers.\nWhen we come back, Israeli troops have fatally shot at least 10 Palestinians as they attempted to collect food and aid amidst the chaotic unveiling of a new Israeli-U.S.-backed aid distribution plan run by a shadowy U.S. group. We\u2019ll speak to Jeremy Scahill of Drop Site News, in 20 seconds.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced new visa restrictions that he claims are targeted at foreign officials who perpetuate \u201ccensorship\u201d of Americans on social media platforms \u2014 while his agency, under his direction, is scouring the social media accounts of immigrants in the U.S. for dissent.\nIn a statement announcing the policy on Wednesday, Rubio cited supposed concerns over free speech levied by foreign officials enforcing regulations for social media platforms \u2014 regulations often aimed at combating disinformation \u2014 that have affected American companies and individuals.\n\u201cIt is unacceptable for foreign officials to issue or threaten arrest warrants on U.S. citizens or U.S. residents for social media posts on American platforms while physically present on U.S. soil,\u201d Rubio said in a statement, ignoring that he has personally targeted U.S. residents for exercising their speech rights on U.S. soil.\nRubio singled out Latin America and Europe as places he may target with the visa policy.\nThe secretary of state did not specify which countries\u2019 officials he may target with the visa restrictions. However, social media giants owned by the GOP\u2019s Big Tech allies, like Elon Musk\u2019s X and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta, have faced numerous penalties under tech regulations. Brazil recently temporarily suspended X from the country due to disinformation, for instance, while X may also be facing fines under the EU\u2019s social media regulations.\nRepublicans have also taken umbrage with Europe\u2019s Digital Markets Act, antitrust regulations that target consolidation in the tech industry.\nIronically, Rubio said that such regulations impede on the U.S.\u2019s sovereignty, even though Rubio\u2019s policies seem to be retaliation against foreign entities for adopting regulations separate from the U.S.\n\u201cIt is similarly unacceptable for foreign officials to demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies or engage in censorship activity that reaches beyond their authority and into the United States,\u201d Rubio\u2019s statement said.\nThis is especially ironic as Rubio has said that he is actively working to censor Americans on behalf of Israel, a foreign entity, with the administration working to erode free speech rights of Americans who criticize Israel and its genocide in Gaza.\nIndeed, as Politico reported this week, Rubio is preparing to issue guidance for officials to scour the social media accounts of student visa applicants for supposed \u201cantisemitism\u201d \u2014 which is frequently used by the administration as code for speech critical of Israel.\nThe administration has already been conducting social media searches of students applying for visas or other residency in the U.S., but has largely targeted those known to have participated in pro-Palestine activism.\nAt the same time, the administration has said that its attempted restrictions on Harvard University\u2019s foreign student enrollment are in service of \u201croot[ing] out the evils of anti-Americanism.\u201d\nThe new restrictions come amid a sweeping crackdown on immigration and Americans of color, with the administration working to deport thousands of people from the U.S. and seeking to block thousands of people from entering.\nRubio also announced on Wednesday that the Trump administration is working to \u201caggressively revoke visas for Chinese students\u201d and will tighten visa restrictions for people from China or Hong Kong. He singled out people with supposed connections to the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 which can be as broad as people with affiliations with the government \u2014 or people studying \u201ccritical fields.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

That designation allowed the world\u2019s richest man to play a key role in the Trump White House without facing Senate confirmation or the full slate of ethics rules that apply to ordinary federal officials.\n\u201cAs my scheduled time as a special government employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President [Donald Trump] for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\u201d Musk wrote on his social media platform, X. \u201cThe DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\u201d\nWhile Musk came nowhere close to his initially stated goal of slashing $2 trillion in federal spending, his team\u2019s infiltration and efforts to gut federal agencies inflicted lasting damage, progressive lawmakers and watchdog groups said in response to news of his departure.\n\u201cDOGE is not a way of life, it\u2019s a mantra of destruction,\u201d said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen. \u201cThe legacy of Elon Musk is lost livelihoods for critical government employees, hindered American education, loss of funding for scientists, and the violation of Americans\u2019 personal privacy, all in the service of corrupt tech-bro billionaire special interests.\u201d\n\u201cThe carnage is even more horrifying internationally, as Musk\u2019s chainsaw will lead to the pointless and needless deaths of likely millions of people in the developing world,\u201d Gilbert added. \u201cThis is a legacy of carnage and corruption that will haunt us for many years to come.\u201d\nRep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called Musk\u2019s exit a win for \u201cthe anti-corruption, anti-billionaire movement in American politics\u201d but warned that the Tesla and SpaceX CEO\u2019s \u201clikely goal is to continue exercising corrupt influence \u2014 just from behind a curtain, as billionaires too often do.\u201d\n\u201cWe will have to keep up the pressure, scrutiny, and eventually formal oversight until we finally take back our government from Musk and the entire billionaire class,\u201d Casar said.\nNext week, the Trump White House plans to send to the Republican-controlled Congress a $9.4 billion rescission package that, if passed, would codify some of the spending cuts pursued by Musk\u2019s team. Politico reported that the package \u201cwill target NPR and PBS, as well as foreign aid agencies that have already been gutted by the Trump administration.\u201d\nThe impact of DOGE-led attacks on federal agencies and Trump\u2019s withholding of hundreds of billions of dollars of congressionally approved spending will persist long after Musk\u2019s exit.\nReuters highlighted one example last week, reporting that \u201cHead Start preschool programs for low-income U.S. children are scrambling to cope with funding cuts and delays, as they feel the squeeze of President Donald Trump\u2019s cost-cutting drive.\u201d\n\u201cAdding to the strain,\u201d the outlet noted, \u201cElon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency released $943 million less in congressionally approved funding for distribution through April 15 compared with the previous year.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "The message coming from the Trump administration is: \u201cTake care of yourselves \u2014 because we won\u2019t.\u201d",
        "Content": "As Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d (MAHA) acolytes readily admit, U.S. public health continues to deteriorate. Five years into the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. life expectancy is at best stalled while those of other industrial countries have rebounded back onto their historical trends upward.\nThe solution Trump administration officials are offering is to replace 125 years of \u2014 albeit underfunded \u2014 public health infrastructure with a eugenics-framed program wrapped in natural health packaging.\nDuring his swearing-in as the new director for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz presented this program in the terms of wartime sacrifice:\nLike Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Oz signaled his plans to focus on chronic disease in the U.S., saying it was \u201cthe patriotic duty of all Americans to take care of themselves.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s important for serving in the military, but it\u2019s also important because healthy people don\u2019t consume health care resources,\u201d he added. \u201cThe best way to reduce drug spending is to use less drugs, because you don\u2019t need them, because you\u2019re healthy, and it feels a lot better.\u201d\nThe message: Take care of yourselves \u2014 because we won\u2019t.\nNever mind the trillions of dollars Americans pay into a largely privatized \u2014 and very profitable \u2014 health care system, far outspending other industrial countries only to suffer worse health outcomes.\nThe new Trump administration is now compounding this long-standing damage by dismantling the last of the public commons.\nIt\u2019s cutting billions to state programs tracking disease, repealing emissions and drinking water regulations, revoking hundreds of millions in funding for life-saving research, canceling local food programs for schools and food banks, rolling back vaccinations, and shutting down the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC\u2019s) Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee.\nThe administration is also truncating the bird flu response and Meals on Wheels; firing CDC\u2019s sexually transmitted infections lab team; cutting the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); dismembering the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; and reducing the Medicare programs Oz will supervise, as Congress weighs deep cuts to Medicaid, pricing the poorest out of health care to the public health cost of us all.\nIn these programs\u2019 stead, MAHA aims to place responsibility for health problems on the individual. Americans must somehow eat better and sleep more while also working more hours than their European counterparts, for stagnating pay. Americans must now \u201cdo their own research\u201d on complex medical matters beyond the due diligence that can reasonably be expected of any adult \u2014 as if each of us can serve as our own CDC.\nNothing inspires patriotism like blaming Americans for the societal damage the political class pursues in their name.\nA Continuity We Must Cop To\nDemocratic Party politicos, largely state officials outside Washington, D.C., have objected to these rollbacks both in the press and in the courts. Many a Democratic accusation, however, also carries the ring of a confession.\nWhere, after all, did the Trump administration get the idea the pandemic was over and that it could strip out federal COVID-19 programs? Or that public health was a matter of \u201cyou do you\u201d individualism? Wasn\u2019t it only three years ago that President Biden\u2019s CDC Director Rochelle Walensky took a eugenics position on the pandemic, claiming it was good news that it was largely people with underlying health conditions who were dying from COVID?\nWho botched the latest bird flu response to begin with? What administration did nearly nothing around the toxic derailment in East Palestine, Ohio? Who green-lighted over a year of Palestinian genocide, with, we recently learned, even Israeli officials surprised President Joe Biden never pressed for a ceasefire and with Secretary of State Antony Blinken approving bombing Gaza aid convoys?\nThere\u2019s a shared path across administrations leading to this public health moment \u2014 with whole populations at home and abroad increasingly abandoned. Any opposition movement must understand that these patterns began long before Donald Trump if it aims to fight back effectively.\nThe problem here is a structural crisis of capitalism and requires more than an electoral solution. The public commons no longer holds space within existing relations of private property and production. The bases of our shared society are being treated as disposable baggage, threatening the country\u2019s very existence.\nWhy Public Health Must Be Collective\nUnder whichever political party, public health, by definition, can never be conducted as an individualist enterprise.\nYes, each of us has choices to make and responsibilities to attend to during a pandemic or other emergency, but \u2014 as the CDC missed even before Trump \u2014 effective public health isn\u2019t merely an emergent property of many millions of individual choices. Public health requires collective decision-making. It requires action at scale \u2014 from the neighborhood level to global cooperation.\nOur health is connected to people halfway across town or halfway across the world. Making sure we can mutually protect ourselves requires us to arrive at decisions together. Our society relies on this collective decision-making to protect our shared social health.\nModern employers \u2014 from the classical liberal era to neoliberalism and the now-accelerating turn toward a fascistic reorganization of government \u2014 have consistently opposed such an objective.\nWhile some employers want the state to help keep the workforce healthy enough to be efficiently exploited on the job, other employers \u2014 and sometimes the very same ones \u2014 are perfectly willing to serve workers into the maw of occupational dangers in order to reduce expenses.\nElsewhere, employers and their proxies demand that funding for social services be redirected to industrial subsidies or tax cuts for the rich. Sick or dead employees can just be replaced from the reserve army of labor \u2014 the unemployed surviving on society\u2019s margins \u2014 or, increasingly, by AI.\nCountries differ in how they approach public health programming. National programs differed in their response to COVID and bird flu. But any such program must operate at scales of organization that match the scales of the problems jurisdictions face.\nSo no corporation, individual, or market can defeat a pandemic. Public goods like public health and clean water require other orders of intervention. We cannot shop our way out of problems in population health, which represent far more than the mere \u201cexternalities\u201d corporations park off their balance sheets or the influencer marketing MAHA is attempting to turn into policy.\nPublic Health Is More Than a Good Idea\nThe connections between the structure of a society and its public health practices speak directly to bedrock notions of social justice and fairness.\nOur collective health arises from the daily ergonomics of the workplace and the kinds of collective decisions we make around how to organize and run our neighborhoods and rural communities.\nThe notion that workers and residents could govern themselves from the bottom-up seems to many commentators beyond our increasingly top-down society. History, however, is replete with examples. For instance, Maroon communities were self-governing safe havens for self-liberated formerly enslaved people, often joining with Indigenous people throughout the southern hemisphere.\nHistorian Mike Davis describes the origins of Chambers of Commerce as a desperate employer effort to counter Chambers of Labor, another example, which fought for worker well-being from the factory floor to the neighborhood block.\nWith only Chambers of Commerce left today, the top-down version is now presented and operationalized as the natural order of things. In our hyper-individualist culture, the boss/employer/owners \u2014 and Kennedy, Oz, Walensky, and other officials in recent governance \u2014 aim to shift all responsibility for health outcomes, and all the blame, onto atomized individuals.\nWe see similar efforts in other sectors. The framing the oil industry attempted in making everything environmental a consumer choice also underlies the COVID-19 response. We cannot consume our way out of a pandemic, however, even with the best respirators or hand sanitizers on the market.\nThe labor movement structurally disrupts the notion that each of us alone is enough during a widespread health crisis. Most union members working on workplace safety instantly recognize and dismiss this \u201cblame the worker\u201d (and the worker alone) approach.\nWe could all benefit from learning to assimilate that recognition as a social gut instinct. The health of the country would likely improve if the public moved away from viewing its interests and well-being in the funhouse mirror of the employers and the political candidates that the wealthiest fund.\nThe Holes in Swiss Cheese Modeling\nSuch a pivot would also suit U.S. public health practitioners. Many public health models accept \u2014 and operationalize \u2014 the political premises of the institutions funding them, with significant impacts on our health interventions.\nA variety of public health models, for instance, show only things that a worker or consumer can do during a crisis.\nA common representation of this approach comes out of Ian Mackay\u2019s adaptation of James Reason\u2019s \u201cSwiss Cheese\u201d model for respiratory defense. Each \u201cslice\u201d of an intervention has its uses and problems. Layering the different kinds of interventions covers each slice\u2019s functional holes. What masking misses, handwashing, eye protection and social distancing can likely catch.\nWe see in such models always the \u201cme,\u201d never the \u201cwe.\u201d Every intervention is the individual\u2019s personal responsibility.\nHospital epidemiologist Saskia Popescu presents a broader version, showing what individuals can do \u2014 wear masks, get vaccinated \u2014 and what \u201cwe\u201d can do collectively:\nYet \u201cshared responsibilities\u201d universalizes updating the HVAC system at your work, the downtown library or the neighborhood bar to no one in particular.\nIf everyone is responsible, then no one is responsible, and nothing is changed. \u201cWe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d and \u201cshared\u201d must always be explicitly identified. It\u2019s the boss\u2019s responsibility to provide clean air and personal protective equipment (PPE) at work, though perhaps the model is technically right in that without unions demanding clean air through bargaining or legislation, the intervention might not ever take place.\nThe abrupt end to federal pandemic protections guaranteed companies would stop providing paid COVID sick leave and other precautions (now including vaccination) on their own. Employers, as most people who call in sick know, hate paying people not to work.\nSome employers chose a different path, if only in passing fashion. The University of Southern California (USC) adapted the Swiss cheese model to illustrate its own responsibility alongside the responsibility of individuals within that institution:\nUSC didn\u2019t distribute free masks, but did provide testing, tracing and HVAC upgrades to good epidemiological effect.\nWhich health model institutions use shapes what they see as the nature of the emergency and what they choose to do about it. The model of personal responsibility isn\u2019t entirely wrong \u2014 but it is woefully incomplete.\nThe most frightening model \u2014 the social Darwinism that encourages sacrificing elders or youth to the needs of the market \u2014 often went unspoken during the early pandemic (except for a shameless lieutenant governor of Texas here and there). As Oz\u2019s press conference demonstrated, the soft eugenics of early COVID is now being increasingly deployed in more explicit language.\nThe Swiss cheese model provides an excellent, accessible tool for grasping multilayered problems and their solutions. We now need to keep track when modelers and policy makers leave out whole blocks of slices that make the critical epidemiological difference. We cannot let the growing holes in the model be normalized.\nHierarchy of Public Health Control\nThere are other models. One of the better ones for a workplace, or even for a country or economy, comes from the American Industrial Hygiene Association\u2019s (AIHA) review of \u201chierarchy of controls\u201d (HoC). Many union safety activists use this starter one from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH):\nNote the engineering controls are elevated in effectiveness above PPE, in, for instance, preventing COVID infection and keeping the virus out of the workplace. It\u2019s the presence of engineering and administrative controls such as testing, sick days, bringing in outside air, and filtering the air with upgraded filters that drive the greater part of infection outcomes in the workplace:\nHorizon Risk Consultancy, the consultant that adapted the NIOSH HoC for COVID here, does not, however, recommend air filters, HVAC upgrades or paid sick leave.\nHere\u2019s a more comprehensive version of the COVID HoC model from Doctors in Unite, the British medical union, including changes in ergonomics, working outside or from home and wage protections:\nThe full array of possible COVID-specific interventions inside the body and out are gathered in one graphic, including vaccination, face masks, distancing, ventilation, remote work, and, if necessary, furlough.\nPublic \u2014 Not Private \u2014 Prevention Must Be Our First Responder\nWe see the most effective occupational intervention is to keep the hazard outside the workplace.\nPrevention through design \u2014 like building codes that design out fire risk \u2014 offers many professions, including building engineers, building inspectors and sanitation workers, opportunities to serve as public health heroes and save lives. In a prevention framework that extends beyond the individual, these are our true first responders.\nThe important work that firefighters, nurses, doctors and EMTs conduct should be embraced, of course, but also understood as the second and third lines of public defense. If a patient\u2019s first encounter with a professional about their heart problem is a paramedic, society failed that patient.\nPublic health ecologists Deborah Wallace and Rodrick Wallace argue the modeling of emergencies, however necessary, often misses when and where the emergency begins. Structural causes \u2014 including expropriation, patriarchy and white supremacy \u2014 are as much part of the emergency, a bigger picture public health movements should assimilate in the face of the present administration\u2019s efforts to censor such understanding.\nThis framework of prevention also puts engineers, architects, sheet metal workers and other trades in a position to design and construct buildings that inhibit the spread of airborne diseases. Preventing hospital visits saves both lives and money, but in ways that \u2014 contrary to the policies of Kennedy and Oz \u2014 place responsibility on those with the power to intervene at scale.\nThe entire design and construction professions, beyond essential public health measures like redesigning meat processing plants and following the new LEED certification that includes indoor air quality standards, should collaborate with unions in redesigning every workplace and all public spaces to better public health.\nIn other words, even the very best of the Swiss cheese models miss arguably the most critical interventions of all: the very package in which the slices come. While the diagrams show individuals, the government and even corporations, they do not show any organization of workers themselves \u2014 from unions to broader communities and how we choose to organize our society.\nIt is the responsibility of workers\u2019 organizations, whether in the workplace or in the greater community, to push for the implementation of these safety protections \u2014 often of stunning epidemiological impact \u2014 in a society that presently denies them as a matter of principle.\nOther parts of the bigger picture are still missing. Individual buildings and workplaces successfully eliminating COVID and future outbreaks will slow, but not end, pandemics.\nUltimately, preventing most zoonotic pathogens from emerging in the first place will better position us to bring the \u201cage of pandemics\u201d to an end. We can protect nature from the doomsday extractivism driving disease emergence by deploying regenerative agriculture, agroecology, conservation, regional planning, land back movements, and cooperative agro-economies. We can return the locus of control around what to grow to farmers and farming communities while also integrating Indigenous knowledge.\nThat is, we should better integrate collective choice and mutual economics up and down scales of social organization, across sectors and over our shared landscapes.\nMAHA Public Health Is No Such Thing\nBuilding on the back half of the Biden era, the Trump administration appears intent on exactly the opposite trajectory. It seems to be aiming to convince people that public health itself is the danger and removing it is a societal advance.\nThe resulting stops on the administration\u2019s MAHA campaign trail have been shameless in their misdirection.\nIn April, RFK Jr. shared with tribes in Arizona and New Mexico the administration\u2019s intention to prevent chronic disease in Native American populations. The administration, however, had just effectively ended the CDC Healthy Tribes program by mass firing program staff. The program deployed traditional medicine and foods to tackle disproportionate rates of chronic conditions, including diabetes and liver disease.\nRFK Jr.\u2019s announcement that HHS would prompt the food industry to remove synthetic dyes still left in the food system was juxtaposed with reports only a week earlier that the FDA would be ending federal-level food safety inspections and quality control programs for food testing laboratories.\nThe FDA had also just closed out an unpublicized investigation of a 15-state E. coli outbreak. The agency\u2019s internal report on the outbreak didn\u2019t even name the food suppliers and distributors involved, part of a broader abandonment in informing the public about outbreaks since the inauguration.\nOz\u2019s swearing-in ended in a similar if more allegorical fashion:\nTelevision personality Mehmet Oz was sworn in as the new administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid on Friday, but the Oval Office ceremony ended when a girl family member fainted.\nA reporter was about to ask a question when the incident occurred, and Trump looked over at what was happening. White House staffers could then be heard shouting \u201cpress out\u201d and \u201cget out right now.\u201d\nWith an empty gesture at a diagnosis:\nTrump then went over to see what happened, and could be heard saying, \u201cShe\u2019s OK.\u201d\nBy that flippant assurance, found more widely in the MAHA program, a country is all well when it ends well. And by many a measure of what counts as a functioning society, the new administration signals its intent on wrapping up the project called the United States. A country without public health operating at scale can scarcely survive as such a thing \u2014 unless Americans organize together to get public health locked in as a central public tenet.\nThis piece was adapted from Pandemic Research for the People Dispatch #10 on collective choice and public health.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2: Thanks for having me.\nKH: How are you doing today?\nOOT: Pretty good, all things considered. How are you doing?\nKH: I am managing and muddling, which I guess is pretty okay, all things considered. I am also really grateful to be in conversation with you today.\nOOT: Likewise.\nKH: So, some of our listeners will obviously be familiar with your work, or might remember our last conversation, but for the unacquainted, can you tell us a bit about yourself and your work?\nOOT: I teach political philosophy at Georgetown. My political interests extend beyond teaching political philosophy. I\u2019m one of the fellows at the Climate and Community Institute. I\u2019ve done organizing in the past with my workers union, first in grad school, which was a UAW local, and am now one of the people organizing Georgetown\u2019s AAUP chapter. And beyond that, my interests are in the Black radical tradition, anticolonial traditions, both intellectually and otherwise.\nKH: Well, I am so glad to have you back on the show, because, among other things, I have been eager to discuss your recent piece, \u201cWhy Protests Should Be Promises,\u201d which was published in Time magazine. In the piece, you argue that protests should not only express dissent but also serve as credible threats of sustained action, such as strikes, boycotts, or other forms of collective withholding to compel systemic change. Could you talk about why this concept of a protest as a promise feels especially urgent in this moment?\nOOT: I think one of the things that, obviously, veteran organizers well know, but maybe people who are newer to organizing, newer to protest culture, might reflect on is why protests work. I think we\u2019ve been often given this very tidy story about past political movements, especially the civil rights movement, where there was a march and there was expression of disagreement, there was awareness spread about social injustices of various kinds. Then question mark, question mark, then change happened, and a lot of details go unremarked on, unreflected on in those question marks that we skip past.\nAnd in general, I think we\u2019re starting to see that lack of reflection reflect itself in the organizing. It\u2019s fine if people have criticisms of this or that particular organization out there, if you have criticisms of a particular union or unions in general, or if you have criticisms of a particular church or churches in general or if you have criticisms of a particular religious organization. But the reason why these kinds of collections of people were able to succeed at being parts of social change in previous generations, in previous eras of political history, is because of what I was talking about in the article.\nIt was because they were able to command not just attention, not just cause awareness of political issues, but they could meaningfully mess things up for the powerful as a result of being able to organize people at scale, whether it was the bus boycotts, whether it was strike actions, whether it was withholding rent. And I think we need to think about that kind of leverage if we believe our own criticisms of the people in power.\nI think a lot of people agree with the notions that the various people in power, the health care executives, the shareholders of large corporations \u2013 they don\u2019t care. They\u2019re insufficiently attentive to what\u2019s going on in our society. They\u2019re letting people become homeless, they\u2019re letting people die of preventable health care problems. And if we really internalize the view of the world that I think follows from that, then I don\u2019t think we can have an awareness-based strategy of how we get them to stop running health care or housing or anything else in the way that they\u2019re doing.\nKH: I really appreciate what you\u2019ve raised here about leveraging power, because I agree that we are dealing with some major, popular misunderstandings around protest. In addition to the historical simplifications you were talking about, one of my concerns is that a lot of people simply don\u2019t know what it means to build leverage. For example, after the Hands Off marches that some of us participated in, which drew millions of people into the streets, I saw some people referring hopefully to the \u201c3.5 percent rule.\u201d For folks who are unfamiliar, the 3.5 percent rule is a theory derived from Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth\u2019s research on nonviolent movements. The theory suggests that no government can withstand a challenge of 3.5 percent of the country\u2019s population mobilizing against it in a peak event.\nNow, in addition to the fact that Chenoweth has acknowledged that there are actual historical exceptions to this theory, including recent uprisings in Bahrain, where the government withstood a mobilization of 6 percent of the country\u2019s population, Chenoweth has also stated:\nThe rule does not speak to leadership, strategic imagination, organizational capacity, or sustainability. Strategic leadership is required to organize a constituency, motivate their engagement, design campaigns adaptively, innovate tactics creatively, mobilize allies, respond to adversaries, sustain long-term organizational capacity, and devise alternatives to existing systems. A movement\u2019s ability to do this is probably more important than a movement\u2019s ability to quickly mobilize a large number of people, especially because today\u2019s digital organizing environment makes it easier to coordinate mass protests but not necessarily to sustain them.\nNow, I know that was a long quote, but I think it\u2019s really important. Chenoweth also specifies that the movements she studied for her dataset were not reformist movements, but movements that sought maximalist outcomes, such as overthrowing governments or claiming independence. So we\u2019re talking about different contexts as well, depending on your perspective.\nAlongside those caveats, there are also critiques of Chenoweth and Stephan\u2019s work that I think are worth considering. I find Andreas Malm\u2019s counterarguments particularly compelling, but even if we were to take the 3.5 percent rule, as Chenoweth has explained it at face value, we need to understand that it doesn\u2019t mean that 3.5 percent of us getting together on a Saturday afternoon and participating in permitted marches across the country and holding signs will mean that Trump has to resign. That is not a thing. And I am not saying this to devalue the big marches that people have organized because I do think they have value. I attended those protests for a reason. I believe mass marches can help us rally our collective spirits and remind people that they\u2019re not alone, and that they have the potential to be a part of something larger than themselves.\nBut I think trying to recreate that energy through mass marches repeatedly, whether the marches are permitted or not, is a losing proposition because you\u2019re not really amassing power. You\u2019re not, as you\u2019re saying, establishing leverage, and you\u2019re not affecting material outcomes. And over time, people get tired of doing the same thing and not seeing any results. So numbers dwindle, which feels disempowering to the people who do keep showing up. And I have seen this kind of errant approach of continuously trying to replicate moments that feel empowering or inspiring across a number of movements. And we really don\u2019t have time to get stuck in this cycle this time around.\nStrategy right now is not about scheduling the next big march.\nOOT: Yeah, I absolutely agree. And I would just add, if we\u2019re talking about a counterexample to the surface-level misreading that once you get a mass protest of 3 percent of the population that you get large-scale social change, we could add ourselves in the United States to that, right? The estimates of the percentage of the population that participated in the 2020 summer uprisings after the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, they range from 6 percent to 10 percent of the U.S. population. So I think it\u2019s important both that we understand that the claim being made in the first place wasn\u2019t if you have a protest or a series of protests with a certain percentage of the population that you\u2019re automatically going to get social change, and then I think it\u2019s also important, the clarification that you point out about Chenoweth, what demands people were making is an important aspect of the extra details we would want to know besides the 3.5 percent magic number, what other organizational capacities the people represented in the 3.5 or whatever percent have and cultivate is something that we would want to know that gets left out of that simple story. And the more you stare at those details, the more, I think, you have to come to the conclusion that those are actually the things that matter most, more than the 3.5 percent number.\nSo, obviously, the more people are involved, the better, and there\u2019s a reason to keep track of how many people are involved, but we really need to focus in on what we\u2019re getting people involved to do. And it\u2019s got to be something better, deeper, and more compelling than just telling people to express displeasure with how things are going.\nKH: So, in thinking about what actually makes a protest effective, I\u2019m curious, is there a protest you\u2019ve participated in that you believe was especially effective?\nOOT: There\u2019s one I think about a lot in this context, just because, in a way, it\u2019s my personal best counterexample to the excessive number focus. One of the most influential, most successful protests I\u2019ve ever participated in had, if I recall correctly, exactly five people involved. We were protesting the lack of all-gender restrooms on the third floor of our building, which is where the philosophy department was at UCLA. And one of my union siblings, she figured out who the decision-maker was on the facility side of things that was the immediate barrier between getting a bathroom designated as an all-gender bathroom and not.\nAnd she organized a bunch of us to go plaster this guy\u2019s name across campus, to make signs, to have a bullhorn, and walk the right blocks of campus where the right people would notice us. And lo and behold, I think to this day, there is still an all-gender bathroom on the third floor of Dodd Hall. And all it took was knowing specifically who to pressure, how to pressure them, and getting not zero people, not one person, but enough people, which turned out to be literally five. But the context was we were all members of the workers union or most of us were. And I think the administration knew that if they dug in too hard, the next version of this confrontation might involve more than five people. It might involve things like the press and so on and so forth.\nSo I don\u2019t want to make it sound as though as soon as you find four other people, you can make any change to any political system. But I think the point stands that making durable changes, making specific kinds of interventions politically, isn\u2019t always about the raw numbers. Sometimes it\u2019s about picking your spots and knowing what\u2019s vulnerable, and importantly, having the ability to, when the chips are down, move large numbers.\nKH: I love that. And to be honest, this question of what makes a protest effective is really dear to my heart, as a movement educator, so I am going to geek out and go on a bit of a rant here.\nI usually think of protest, not in terms of permitted marches, but in terms of direct action. Every direct action is a protest, but not every protest is a direct action. A direct action is an intervention that occurs outside the status quo, so it\u2019s something we\u2019re not getting permission for. And in the school of thought I\u2019ve worked with, there are four primary purposes for a direct action: To advance a strategic campaign, to mark a momentous occasion, to participate in acts of political communion, or to address the needs of our communities in ways that defy or challenge the status quo. Some direct actions represent a mashup of these intentions.\nFor example, here in Chicago, we have a long tradition of rallying outside juvenile detention centers around the December holidays. We sing songs and sometimes we carry lighted messages that spell out the words, \u201cWE LOVE YOU,\u201d and we bring messages of love and care to the young people inside those facilities, which fulfills a community need. Those young people need our love and support. And at the same time, by standing out there in the cold, and singing, and tearing up while those children wave and draw hearts in soap on their windows, we are also reaffirming our values. That\u2019s political communion. We are being reminded of who we are, and why we\u2019re in the struggle in the first place \u2014 and that\u2019s very important to our political endurance.\nBut we\u2019re not just organizing to comfort people who are harmed by the system or to reaffirm who we are in relation to the system, we\u2019re also trying to make material changes.\nSo in that vein, another action that comes to mind for me is a really simple one, in the home stretch for the fight for reparations, for victims of police torture in Chicago, Rahm Emanuel was particularly politically vulnerable very suddenly because he wound up in a mayoral runoff. We planned and executed a lot of actions during that time, but one that I think carried a lot of weight was an artful action outside his home. It was very cold, there was a lot of snow on the ground, and there were cops outside guarding his house because this was a moment of peak protest. But a group of people all sprang out of their cars and around corners at the same time. And we spelled out a message in lights outside his home and the message read, \u201cREPARATIONS NOW.\u201d\nWe got a photo with the house in the background and we turned around for a moment to face the house so Rahm could see the message. We saw lights go out inside the house, so we knew there were people there seeing it, pretending not to be home. And then we got out of there before anyone got arrested. That image, as part of the campaign, went viral on social media. It was published, and republished, and it really carried the message that this legacy of torture and the demand to address it was inescapable for Emanuel. We were literally bringing it to his doorstep.\nThat attention was the last thing he needed or wanted to focus on at that time. And we ultimately won that campaign. And a lot of people, who were tortured under the leadership of Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge, received reparations in the form of monetary compensation, mental health care, access to education for themselves and their families, and more. And that home stretch of direct actions was crucial to that outcome. But we\u2019re also talking about an effort that was many years in the making, a true coalitional effort between groups and individuals. And ultimately, it was won by leveraging our power and the political vulnerability of our bitch-ass mayor.\nOOT: Magnificent.\nKH: So let\u2019s talk about what we need to accomplish and build right now. What do you think the organizing and formations we need to get out of this mess look like?\nOOT: So I think anything that can play the role of strong-arming the people in charge could potentially be the kind of organization or the kind of effort that would work. Historically, unless you\u2019re seceding from a country, then maybe you\u2019re talking about an army or a militia. I guess if folks want to do that, they can do that. But historically, we\u2019re talking about unions, workers unions, tenants unions. More recently, people have been talking about creating debtors unions. These are organizations that involve the disempowered, but don\u2019t just involve them in the way that NGOs might involve the disempowered or the way that philanthropy, that charity might involve the disempowered, that\u2019s like recipients of something that some other group of people are doing. But the point of a union is to make the disempowered powerful.\nThe point of a tenants union is that if the landlord has to deal with all the tenants at once, now suddenly it\u2019s not as obvious. It\u2019s not as clear who has the upper hand in that engagement. You\u2019re evening the playing field just a little bit. And the more powerful the tenant union is, the more even the playing field is. I think in principle, any group of people that\u2019s prepared to take an action, whether it\u2019s one of those kinds of organizations or some other kind, could be that kind of organization, so long as the action hits the enemy where it hurts. So the Montgomery bus boycott, not principally organized by unions, but withholding money from people that want money, that\u2019s a way to have leverage. The people boycotting Target right now, I think you could say, are doing a version of that. And I think they\u2019re putting some real pressure on Target and I think time will tell how well that works. But I think it\u2019s certainly the kind of thing that has worked historically, and it represents smart political thinking, so we need to do a lot more of that.\nKH: I agree that we need union power, now more than ever. If people want to learn more about union organizing, I really recommend checking out No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age by Jane McAlevey. And if people are interested in tenant organizing, I think Abolish Rent is an absolute must-read. I really agree with you that moments of mass protest should be moments where we are flexing the structured power that we are building.\nI also really think this is a time for people to experiment, in terms of doing what it takes to meet community needs, from accessing the care people need to organizing community defense. There are longstanding traditions of harm reduction work that people can learn from, in terms of what it means to care for people, even when that means breaking the rules. For people who feel drawn toward that kind of work, I really recommend checking out Shira Hassan\u2019s book Saving Our Own Lives and Angela\u2019s Hume\u2019s book Deep Care. Dean Spade\u2019s book Mutual Aid is also a really important resource, if you\u2019re focused on addressing community needs.\nAnd if people are really interested in work that involves breaking rules, I would also encourage folks to know who they are working with and make sure that you have a lot of trust, and have done some solid risk assessment, because we want people to act righteously and consent to risk in an informed way. For some people, who they can trust with information that shouldn\u2019t be public is obvious \u2014 maybe you have co-strugglers or trusted neighbors, or people you\u2019ve known for years who are the only people you would do that kind of work with. That\u2019s ideal. But if you don\u2019t have that kind of long-term understanding, and you\u2019re looking to break rules, I highly recommend checking out Vision Change Win\u2019s Get in Formation Toolkit. There is a section on vetting that everyone should read, and you can also use their risk assessment toolkit to think through what you\u2019re doing, and make sure you\u2019ve covered all of your bases. Because whatever we\u2019re doing, we want to look out for ourselves and each other, and move in a good way.\nAnd speaking of how we move, and how we build with people, I have frequently quoted something you said on social media about what we prioritize in our dealings with other people. You wrote, \u201cAt some point, you should decide whether you will accept the discipline imposed by your material objectives and commitments or the discipline imposed by your resentments.\u201d Can you talk about the distinction between the discipline imposed by our objectives and the discipline imposed by our resentments, and how you see these motivations showing up on the political landscape?\nOOT: So one of the themes I\u2019ve talked a lot about in the last few years, especially around the idea of elite capture and some of the discussions that get brought up in that context, is coalitional politics. I think people rightly have lots of resentments about the way that they are treated, people who are dealing with bigotry on a daily basis, dealing with disrespect on a daily basis. Part of being the kind of person that would fight for a better world is being the kind of person that doesn\u2019t just take disrespect and bigotry lying down. We should be the kind of people that object to that, whether it happens at work or in the organizing place or wherever it happens.\nSo at bottom, I\u2019m deeply sympathetic to the resentment people have about misogyny or about racism or about any of the other things that we\u2019re fighting against in our organizations. But one of the places that people often take it is a suspicion, sometimes even what they take as a principled stance against certain kinds of relationships. We\u2019re not going to work politically with this kind of person or with that organization because of the kind of people that are in that org. And that is one response you can have to the well-earned, well-justified resentments that we all develop.\nBut there is still the question of what it is you\u2019re trying to accomplish politically and whether or not, as a matter of fact, you can do it without that org over there or without that neighbor over there or without that section of the union. And I think if we\u2019re serious about things like the 3.5 percent rule, if we\u2019re serious about things like mass politics, if we\u2019re serious about things like organizing across our workplace or our apartment building or our church congregation, we\u2019re going to find ourselves in a position where we have to choose between leaning into our assessments of who deserves our support or who deserves our scorn and resentment and who it is that we, in fact, need to work with and build with if we\u2019re going to get the job done, if we\u2019re going to challenge the richest, most well-armed organizations and people on the planet.\nAnd I think we will find, if we ask ourselves the strategic questions that we \u2026 We need a lot of people. We certainly don\u2019t need people who are going to actively work against our interests. So there\u2019s a fine line between letting things go and letting wreckers in, but we need to be honest about where that line is. And sometimes we mobilize arguments that are designed to prevent people from entering the movement who are wreckers, and we use those arguments to defend our own wrecker-type behavior. And that is what I\u2019m getting at with that quote. We need to be disciplined \u2026 We will be disciplined by something. We will behave, we will make choices, we will make connections or fail to make connections, and we can either let our anger do the choosing for us or we can let our goals do the choosing for us.\nKH: I really appreciate what you\u2019re saying about taking mass politics seriously, and taking what we believe it takes to win seriously, because, as a jumping off point, I don\u2019t think everyone does. I think that some of the politics of disqualification, where people kind of wear ideologies and ideas as merit badges, and strut around saying, \u201cBehold my righteous politics,\u201d and vote people off the island all day \u2014 I think that shit\u2019s often, really, a form of surrender. It\u2019s a resignation, a shrinking down of what it means to do politics to the scale of maybe winning arguments or coming off as better than someone else. It\u2019s about having a righteous political identity rather than winning a political battle, and I think that often, the object of winning doesn\u2019t even enter into the calculus, because there\u2019s no theory or vision of that \u2014 other than maybe, at best, the bad guys will eventually crumble on their own, and personally, I can\u2019t accept that as a game plan. Even if I were to accept that as inevitable, the costs along the way are too damn high.\nDwelling in expressions of disdain, disgust, and sanctimony may get likes and reposts, because people love that shit, but it does not build power. And while people on the left model that, and some folks mistake that kind of acting out for the work of doing politics, the right is accumulating more and more actual power, and taking even greater control of our lives.\nAnd so I think that we need to, as you say, acknowledge that we have a right to be mad about some shit, and also be disciplined about what we want to see happen. As Mariame and I wrote in Let This Radicalize You, how much discomfort is the whole world worth? That is an admonition I take seriously in my own work, and I am challenged by it all the time. And you know, anyone who has worked with me knows, I am no pushover. I will push back on some fucked up behavior, but I also approach difference more carefully and diplomatically than I would have ten years ago, because I am a better organizer now than I was ten years ago. Organizing is a craft, and I am better than I used to be at prioritizing what I want to see happen, and what I hope we\u2019re all going to do in order to survive, or have health care, or have homes, or end police violence \u2014 whatever it is, I know how to make that more important than the fact that I am not gonna like everyone in the room, and that some folks are gonna be on some bullshit.\nBut sometimes when I say this, people will tell me that people not experiencing social consequences for having taken bad or offensive positions doesn\u2019t help us move forward. What would you say to those folks?\nOOT: If someone can tell me the story, actually, if someone can paint me the consequential picture that starts at being shunned by a few leftists on the internet or something and ending up at a real change of heart, not just on the scale of the particular individuals being shunned, but on the scale of, say, the 3.5 percent number or even larger than that, if that\u2019s the story of a massive cultural shift, I\u2019d be receptive to that. I don\u2019t think out of hand that it\u2019s impossible that we could get to one from the other, but I don\u2019t myself see it.\nI think at the end of the day, you have to make a decision about what it is that you mean when you\u2019re saying that what your politics is informed by is a political ideology like anti-imperialism or socialism, or is informed by advocacy for a particular marginalized group, a pro-women politics or pro-Black politics, something like that, is what you mean that the aesthetic in your head that you attach to those ideas you describe as pro-Black or pro-woman or pro-colonized, or something like that, or do you mean that you actually want to do something for the actual people out there in the world that correspond to those labels because those people think all sorts of things and are problematic in all sorts of ways and are excellent in all sorts of ways and have opinions that were not formed in a radical reading group, but were formed by the same propaganda and the same material oppression that formed the rest of the world.\nAnd I think the retreat from engaging with the actual empirical things that people think and say across identity groups, across classes, across races, across genders, et cetera, and just carving out a small niche of like-minded people that you\u2019re willing to engage with is a form of surrender, as you were saying, because it\u2019s trading the actual nature of the struggle that we have in front of us with a science fictional one. We don\u2019t need to contend with the things people actually think and say out there in the world outside of the people that view the world in the way that we do. And we certainly don\u2019t need to deal with the consequences of the decisions those people make out there, except as they inform what criticisms we circulate amongst ourselves in here. But once you adopt the actual practical goal of trying to do something about the world outside of your affinity group, outside of the circle of people that think and move like you do, you necessarily have to take seriously some stuff that maybe objectively doesn\u2019t deserve to be taken seriously or maybe people that you think don\u2019t deserve to be taken seriously, but that\u2019s the job, or else we\u2019re just not doing the thing that we say we\u2019re doing.\nKH: I also think we need a lot more humility. As a Native person living in the United States, I have never seen clean hands or clean money, and I have met very few people in my life who I would say did not benefit from someone else\u2019s suffering or oppression, and who did not move in ignorance or indifference to that oppression and suffering, at some point, and that includes me. I think that we had really better hope that people can be redeemed for the ways that they have been ignorant of other people\u2019s suffering, benefited from other people\u2019s suffering, and not really read into the consequences of their actions. We had all better hope that people can be redeemed, under those circumstances, because I don\u2019t really know anyone in my day-to-day life who\u2019s excluded from that.\nWe live in the heart of empire. There\u2019s lots of accountability to go around and there\u2019s a lot of mistakes that have been made. But I think that we really need to accept that any movement to make things better is going to be an amalgamation of flawed people operating on a really fucked-up terrain. It\u2019s going to be about trying to make things happen that need to happen.\nAnd in that process, in the waging of struggle, what we can learn about each other, what we can learn from each other about how to maybe make some things right, that\u2019s not the pursuit of purity. It\u2019s the pursuit of solidarity and really showing up for each other in ways that are meaningful and doing the work of collective survival in ways that a lot of people clearly aren\u2019t ready for, but that I hope we are going to get ready for. Because, all of this disqualification, talking about why everybody and their brother isn\u2019t good enough to be part of the struggle \u2014 that shit does not reflect the stakes. When it comes down to it, in a struggle for collective survival, you struggle with the people who are there and who are willing to lock arms. And I think imprisoned organizers understand that better than anyone, which is why we should be learning everything we can from incarcerated and formerly incarcerated organizers right now, because those folks know what it\u2019s like to move under fascistic conditions.\nAnd good labor organizers understand this, too, inasmuch as you have to be able to organize with people who aren\u2019t of your own choosing. And if you can\u2019t do that, then you\u2019re really not going to get a thing done at scale.\nOOT: Yeah, who\u2019s in your apartment building? Who\u2019s on your cell block? You didn\u2019t pick those, but that\u2019s who you have to work with. And just to that same point about humility, I don\u2019t know, maybe some people \u2026 I actually have met some people that just seem to have, from birth, had good politics. Every now and again, I look at them like they\u2019re aliens because there\u2019s like three of them, but I am certainly not one of them. And I remember having not-so-good political opinions and habits and ways of talking. And I remember why I challenged those. And I\u2019ll tell you in not a single instance was it me just reasoning from first principles and the delightful purity of my soul out of propaganda and years of socialization into a better outlook. I happened to meet someone who told me something or led me to an experience that made me challenge some belief that I had or some fucked-up way of talking that I had or some fucked-up way of treating other people that I had.\nAnd in my case, at least, a lot of those connections and a lot of those experiences are direct results of privileges that I had. I went to school and I got to read something that I wouldn\u2019t have gotten to read somehow else or I got to move across the country and I got to meet people that I wouldn\u2019t have met in southwestern Ohio. And I had experiences that I wouldn\u2019t have had over there. And so I think the honesty we should have about ourselves is one of the quickest routes, at least in my case, to humility, because whatever I\u2019m getting right now, it\u2019s not because I was ordained, destined to come to the right political opinion. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time to think about something.\nAnd so if we look out at the world, at our cell block, or at our shop floor, or at our apartment building and see people who didn\u2019t luck into those particular circumstances, why have the opinion that this person is some irredeemably politically problematic person rather than holding out the hope that maybe this person just hasn\u2019t chanced into the particular conversation that you chanced into that set you on your political trajectory. And why not also hold out the hope that you could be the person that sets them on a different political trajectory than they\u2019re currently on? Your talking to them could be the conversation that leads them to think about something differently from how they had thought about it before. Why couldn\u2019t it be you? Why couldn\u2019t it be this thing that you\u2019re doing with your neighbors or with your fellow workers or with the other people that owe money to the same institution you owe money to?\nKH: Yes, and also, don\u2019t be shocked if it doesn\u2019t all come together in one conversation. In my experience, people\u2019s views change over time, through ongoing dialogues, and through the experience of shared struggle. Most people aren\u2019t responsive to someone walking up to them and saying, your politics are bad, use these instead. And people who are that impressionable are still going to be that impressionable when the next persuasive person comes along with a different view. So, I think this advice of yours, to think about our own growth processes, and how we\u2019ve changed in our views and beliefs, is really important too. Most of us don\u2019t arrive at better ways of doing and thinking overnight. There are people who were patient with us, and we probably really annoyed and frustrated those people at times. I know I did, and I try to remember that anytime I\u2019m the one giving someone else room to grow. And I\u2019m not saying it always works out, or that people will always come around to a better way of thinking or doing, but if we write each other off quickly and easily, it definitely doesn\u2019t happen.\n[musical interlude]\nI also want to talk a bit about language and how the Trump administration has characterized a lot of the harm it\u2019s doing. Many of the administration\u2019s attacks on workers, on public services, and on programs that people depend on have been framed as efforts to root out the influence of DEI programs. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion has become code for Black people, women, accessibility, and really any acknowledgement of the existence of marginalized people. It\u2019s functionally similar to the way that right-wingers use the word \u201cwoke.\u201d This puts us in a defensive position, but often, what we\u2019re defending isn\u2019t actually DEI, but rather, the truth of history, or the basic rights of marginalized people. We also know that DEI initiatives, as you recently wrote, often \u201cwrapped corporate entities in a shawl of faux progressivism, donned to placate societal demands for civil rights, even while these same entities continued to oppose unionization and other efforts to meaningfully empower the workers whose diversity they were so eager to acknowledge.\u201d So how do we navigate the demonization of DEI and defend what\u2019s actually under attack? How do we reframe this crisis in a manner that reflects the reality of the situation?\nOOT: I think what\u2019s happening at the bottom is a direct assault on values, and it couldn\u2019t be clearer from the fact that the administration itself is naming DEI, naming diversity, equity, and inclusion as its enemy. Now, they\u2019re referring to it with an acronym and they\u2019re using cleverly the faux progressivism that we were just talking about, the empty association with those values that corporations developed to make it seem as though their target is this corporate perversion of the values or their target is the bad faith allusions to those values.\nBut you can see from the patterns of who they\u2019re firing from what they\u2019re canceling that their target just is the values. And I think this is the thing that represents an element of confusion for centrist institutions like the New York Times. If you are in essentially a valueless ideological space and you don\u2019t essentially believe in political values as an organizing feature of politics and political life, it\u2019s very hard to parse the difference between the attack on corporate DEI and the attack on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Those seem like the same thing from that political vantage point.\nSo I think what\u2019s incumbent on the rest of us is to do the opposite of this constant refrain that we need to pivot to anodyne issues like whatever the economy refers to and get out of contentious politics and just talk about potholes and jobs. But, in fact, I think there needs to be an even more full-throated defense of the values that are under attack by the Trump administration. Certainly not corporations versions of those, but the real solidarity-based versions of those thoughts and values that I think are alive and well in our movement spaces.\nKH: The language that gets used to describe what\u2019s happening around us can really shape people\u2019s responses. You mentioned the New York Times, and I was especially grossed out recently by NYT reporter Eric Lipton\u2019s refusal to characterize Trump accepting a jet as a gift from a foreign state as corruption, because according to Lipton, corruption requires explicit quid pro quo. There are so many examples of the corporate press demurring or really doing the spin work you might have expected from Trump\u2019s lackeys during the first administration, but this time around, the administration doesn\u2019t feel the need to spin anything the president does. He\u2019s just off in this realm of extremity and the legacy media is doing the spin work for them. Some people call it \u201csanewashing,\u201d but I think what we\u2019re really talking about is a laundering of fascist lies and a lot of preposterous behavior. Can you talk about that laundering process and what it means for our movements?\nOOT: Yeah, I think my read \u2026 I don\u2019t know Eric Lipton, but I also feel like I\u2019ve met a thousand versions of this guy. So just judging from that statement where there\u2019s a kind of person that just \u2026 It\u2019s the caricature of a centrist. I don\u2019t really know what I believe. I know what distance I would like to maintain between the people on the right who believe things and the people on the left who believe things. And that lack of a core set of one\u2019s own political commitments does, I think, draw you inevitably to sanewashing, because at the end of the day, you need to believe that wherever politics has ended up is somewhere near what is normal and reasonable, even if it tilts slightly to the right of your ideal version of those ideas or slightly to the left, depending on who\u2019s in office. But when the people to the right of you are fascist and you\u2019re still doing that, then absolutely, I think laundering of fascism is as good a description of any of that centrist positioning in that historical context.\nI think what it means for our movements is there is a deep communications challenge, there\u2019s a deep informational challenge, that we have to take on because the institutions that are best positioned to rain alarm bells are effectively working for the other side. And I think that means we have to think seriously and strategically about what it is to develop an information architecture that is robust to the sanewashing of centrist legacy media. We have to develop other ways of not just getting information out, but getting \u2026 We have to develop ways not just of getting information out, but of sounding our own alarm bells, not just informing people, but rousing people to action.\nAnd again, I\u2019m going to sound like a broken record, but this is one of the functions of organizations. Not everybody in Alabama was probably tracking transit politics, but the people who were sent out the message saying what we need to do at this point in time is boycott the bus system. And so people did. Not everybody in a union is going to be equally well positioned to track what\u2019s going on in bargaining, even if you have open bargaining in your union, but you\u2019re going to have people on the committee who will be in the room and who can report back to everyone else saying, \u201cNegotiations are breaking down. We need to authorize a strike,\u201d something like that.\nWhatever else our organizations are, they are information networks and they work best when other information networks like ideally functioning press, like people\u2019s informal communities, people\u2019s religious affiliations, people\u2019s membership in clubs, people\u2019s hangout spots are also a part of the effort to make sure people know what\u2019s going on and people are in a position to do something about bad things that are going on. And we need to think really holistically about how we can set those up in a way that\u2019s going to be compatible with resisting the machinations of the people in charge to take all of the wealth and power for themselves.\nKH: I absolutely agree. And I\u2019ve also seen you talk about the importance of supporting independent media, and I just want to emphasize to folks how important that infrastructure is going to be in the coming months and years. We need to fortify the cooperative and supportive networks of independent media that exist right now. The Movement Media Alliance is a very important project. And I also want to shout out the Truthout Center for Grassroots Journalism, which is part of our organization here at Truthout, and headed up by my good friend Maya Schenwar. The Center is currently mentoring six independent news publications, helping folks firm up their fiscal and legal structures, support their staff, connect with movement people, and explore what kind of stories and authors they should engage with during this really scary and uncertain time.\nI get really frustrated when I hear about how we need a leftist Joe Rogan, or fucking whatever, when what we really need is to fortify the powerful longstanding work that people are doing, that already has a lot of reach, that has always been under-resourced, and has already helped elevate the voices and stories of our movements. The legacy media has capitulated, and the truth is its own front of struggle. There is no \u201csaving democracy\u201d without fighting on that front. The fabric of our shared reality is under attack. That\u2019s something that we absolutely cannot surrender. And I really need people to understand that. I am at Truthout because I believe in what we do, and I hope people will support the kind of media they believe in, and that they want to see in the world in these times.\nAnd speaking of meaningful projects, and what we choose to engage with or support, I also want to ask about a piece you wrote for Teen Vogue called \u201cDonald Trump and His Allies Don\u2019t Really Care What Kind of Leftist You Are.\u201d In that piece, you wrote, \u201cWhen you are recruited by people and projects to be a thing and others that want to do a thing, join the doers.\u201d As we wrap up this conversation, can you talk about this distinction between being and doing and the kind of politics people should be wary of in these times?\nOOT: Yeah. One thing that I\u2019ve been through, especially as a baby leftist, was constantly flirting with these various ideological labels and groups. And I\u2019ll just use classic commie ones just as an example, but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s particular to socialism or communism. Everywhere on the left has their versions of these, these schools of thought or possible identifications that you can make. Am I a Maoist or a Trotskyist or Leninist or do I belong to this theory or that theory? And the particular kinds of sectarian squabbles that you would see come up around these would not confine themselves to reading groups about particular texts or discussions about particular segments of 20th century leftist history. People would click up around actual organizing efforts.\nI just remember thinking, \u201cWait, so the way that we\u2019re supposed to try to confront the sheriff\u2019s department here in Los Angeles, what the fuck does that have to do with whether or not I buy so-and-so\u2019s criticism of the agricultural policy of 1930s Soviet Russia?\u201d What is it that we\u2019re actually accomplishing by having these kinds of disagreements and trying to identify ourselves as the particular leftists of this or that tradition? And the more I organized, the more I thought about these sorts of things, the more I suspected that, for some people, the goalposts had shifted somewhere along the line and being a proper Trotskyist or a proper Nkrumaist or a proper this or that was actually the thing that they were trying to do politically rather than get the sheriff\u2019s department to stop collaborating with ICE, or rather than trying to defund the police department or rather than trying to retake over the school board.\nAnd for some people, it was actually the other way around. Those struggles were in service of their goal of being the right leftist rather than trying to make any particular change to the world. And so it\u2019s the long way round to the discussion we were having earlier about these subtle forms of political surrender, where people stop trying to at least primarily accomplish political changes to the world, and people end up nursing resentments or nursing these kinds of ego-driven identifying goals.\nAnd I think it\u2019s an unnecessary, unforced error that we should all do our best to try to avoid. I don\u2019t think living up to any particular historical figure or any particular subset of any political thinking is the important thing that we\u2019re doing. All of those, after all, were just ways of responding to the political problems of their times. And we should just do our version of that. Look outside, what is the thing you\u2019re going to try to get done? Who do you need to get it done? What do you need to get it done? How do you need to move to get it done? Those are the primary questions. And where that sits you next to the long history of political activism is interesting. I\u2019m a nerd. I study philosophy for a living. I\u2019m not uninterested in how to draw the narrative line that starts at Fanon and ends somewhere in my apartment or whatever. But it\u2019s not the thing that\u2019s important about climate change activism or anti-carceral activism or anything else that we might be doing.\nKH: That really resonates. And I think these conversations around being more focused on the politics we do than the politics we wear are really important. And I think this also ties back to what we were saying about protest and direct action earlier. A lot of protests that people get really hyped about are what we would call \u201cexpressive protests.\u201d They can be energizing. They can allow us to express ourselves and our position, and maybe feel unified in that expression. And we do need that energy. But what we also need, and what we need a lot more of, are instrumental actions \u2014 protests that apply meaningful pressure to targets and attempt to reshape our social and political environment. That involves more than raising awareness. It\u2019s about impact. The best protests are expressive and instrumental, but I want us to constantly keep coming back, in everything we do, to how effective our actions are, and what impacts we\u2019re having.\nNow, with all of that said, is there anything else you would like to share with or ask of the audience today?\nOOT: The one other thing that I think goes nicely with what we were saying about the leftist media landscape and, just in general, trying to build a more hospitable system for ourselves to do politics out of, to organize out of, is we should not overlook the role of literal physical spaces in that. So what that\u2019s going to look like is going to be different depending on where you\u2019re at. Maybe there\u2019s a friendly church that some of you meet at. Maybe there\u2019s a radical bookstore in your city. Maybe there\u2019s a coffee shop that is run by a workers\u2019 cooperative that is down and that collaborates with some of the activists there. But whatever the spaces, the physical spaces, maybe it\u2019s somebody\u2019s house, maybe it\u2019s somebody\u2019s apartment, but I think trying to support those places is a big force multiplier. The more you can do to keep those places thriving and to keep the workers and the comrades who support them supported and healthy and secure, the better it is for everyone in the vicinity of those spaces. And so I think one of the concrete things that we can do to support progressive leftist, whatever, movements is to support the spaces, the places, the buildings that support them.\nKH: That is such a good point. And by the way, if you\u2019re someone who has a space that you can make available to movement folks, please consider doing so. I know that here in Chicago and in many cities where space is at a premium, we don\u2019t have enough of these spaces where folks can meet and gather and do the work of community building. So, yes, let\u2019s fortify and support those places where they exist, and let\u2019s open up more space to do the work we need to do together.\nOl\u00faf\u1eb9\u0301mi, this has been such a great conversation. I\u2019m so grateful you could join me today. You\u2019re someone who I always learned so much from and I\u2019m just so grateful to have had the chance to talk today.\nOOT: Likewise. Thanks a lot for having me.\nKH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I\u2019ll see you in the streets.\nShow Notes\n- Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity Politics (And Everything Else) by Ol\u00faf\u1eb9\u0301mi O.

Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: We begin today\u2019s show looking at the case of Jeanette Vizguerra, a well-known immigrant rights activist, mother of four, detained in Denver in March. She\u2019s being jailed at the Aurora ICE Processing Center, operated by the private prison company GEO Group, in Colorado.\nIn 2009, Jeanette Vizguerra successfully fought deportation following a routine traffic stop. Then, in 2017, during the first Trump administration, she was targeted for deportation and took sanctuary in the Unitarian church in Denver, living there with three of her young children. She received a stay of removal, but then, upon its expiration in 2019, returned to sanctuary. She received additional deportation stays during the Biden administration, but those eventually expired.\nHer lawyers allege that Jeanette was detained in March in retaliation for speech that\u2019s protected under the First Amendment. Jeanette Vizguerra is a longtime activist who worked as an SEIU labor organizer, volunteered with the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition and the American Friends Service Committee, AFSC, and founded the activist organizations Dreamer\u2019s Mothers in Action-Colorado, Abolish ICE Denver and Sanctuary for All.\nIn 2017, during the first Trump administration, I visited Jeanette Vizguerra at the First Unitarian Society Church in Denver, where she sought sanctuary, and talked to her.\nAMY GOODMAN: Are you prepared for ICE to come in at any time?\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] Yes. We have an internal plan here at the church, and not only at this church, also at the church where Ingrid is, who is at the other church in Mountain View. She has been in sanctuary for over three months. Both churches are part of the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition, and each church has its own emergency plan. I am also prepared. Before coming here, I prepared a family plan in case ICE were to go to my house. Part of the plan with my children was that one of them would be filming, and the other one would be calling people from a list that I gave them. And here, we have a similar plan. So I am prepared, and so are the people here. We hope that Donald Trump will respect these spaces. It would look wrong from a moral standpoint if he came after mothers who are just fighting for their families.\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Jeanette Vizguerra eight years ago, in 2017.\nEarlier this month, she was named one of this year\u2019s recipients of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. It marks the first time the award has been given to someone in immigration detention.\nJeanette Vizguerra recently spoke to the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Latino USA host Maria Hinojosa in a rare interview on camera from inside the ICE jail. In a moment, we\u2019re going to play Jeanette Vizguerra in her own words, but first we turn to Maria Hinojosa, who\u2019s joining us from Austin, Texas.\nMaria, welcome back to Democracy Now! How did you get this interview? How often do you get to go into an ICE jail?\nMARIA HINOJOSA: Good morning, Amy. Good morning, Juan, from Austin.\nLook, when we got the news that we were going to be able to come inside the Aurora ICE Processing Center with a camera and a microphone, I couldn\u2019t believe it, because I essentially have been banned from going inside immigrant detention facilities, because I\u2019m one of the few who has been documenting this since about 2010 and showing what these places actually look like and what the treatment is like for people being held. So, when I heard that I was going to be allowed inside, of course, I immediately asked my producer, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nIt goes to the heart of Jeanette Vizguerra\u2019s case. Jeanette Vizguerra believes that she is not being held in immigrant detention because of her immigration status, but rather she is being held because of her words and because of her activism. And so, what we understand is that when we made the request to come and interview her, and we were expecting a denial, her lawyer said, \u201cIf you deny Maria Hinojosa and Latino USA to come in and interview Jeannette Vizguerra, we can make this part of our case arguing on her First Amendment rights.\u201d It was an absolute checkmate situation, where they had to, essentially, let us in with cameras, with microphones, to see Jeannette Vizguerra in the Aurora detention facility.\nAnd see, Amy and Juan, you know, I\u2019ve been visiting detention facilities for years, right? And I\u2019ve been in maximum-security men\u2019s prisons for years. I had to walk through \u2014 Amy and Juan, I had to walk through nine prison doors in order to get to where Jeanette was being seated inside a windowless room where we were going to do the interview. When I go into a maximum-security men\u2019s prison, there are two doors, two prison doors. And yet, in an ICE detention facility run by privately held GEO Group, where a majority of the people being held there are not criminals, they are treated worse than in a maximum-security men\u2019s prison. It was shocking. But I will say that Jeanette Vizguerra, though she is sick \u2014 she told us she has a stomach virus; she says many people are sick inside the detention facility \u2014 she appeared firm in our interview, that lasted one hour.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Maria, how would you compare Jeanette\u2019s case to that of someone like Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained over his Palestinian rights activism, both clearly being targeted because of their speech?\nMARIA HINOJOSA: Jeanette Vizguerra says that she is the Mahmoud Khalil of the immigrant rights and sanctuary rights movement. She believes that just like Mahmoud Khalil from Columbia University, where I\u2019m a professor at Barnard College \u2014 she believes that he is being held and targeted because of his activism. She says, \u201cThe same thing is happening to me. I\u2019m being held and targeted because of my activism.\u201d\nBy the way, somebody senior in the comms department from the Department of Homeland Security said in a tweet, after Jeanette had been taken \u2014 said, actually, in tweet, \u201cWe will come and get you. Even if you have been named to Time magazine\u2019s 100 most important people, we will come and get you.\u201d So, she absolutely feels like she is being targeted. The ICE agent \u2014 one of the ICE agents who took her when she was apprehended in Colorado said to her, \u201cWe got you.\u201d And according to Jeanette, he had her social media on his phone. So, Jeanette argues, her lawyers argue, that she has absolutely been targeted by this administration.\nAMY GOODMAN: Maria, we\u2019re going to hear Jeanette describe the situation in her own words, in her conversation with you. We\u2019re talking to Maria Hinojosa, the host of Latino USA. Let\u2019s go to an extended excerpt of that conversation that Jeanette Vizguerra had with you inside the privately run immigration jail in Aurora, Colorado.\nMARIA HINOJOSA: Did you imagine that you would end up being the very specific target of a new Trump administration?\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] I knew that if \u2014 well, in fact, many people, colleagues and friends, warned me, \u201cJeanette, you\u2019re going to need to stay quiet. Have a plan for yourself. Don\u2019t make noise, because they\u2019re going to come after you.\u201d So, what happened? Trump won. And the first time, when he signed the executive action removing sensitive locations, which, of course, I had helped create with the Sanctuary Foundation, the Sanctuary Coalition, and I was a national sanctuary leader, the media started reaching out to me. And I was like, \u201cShould I do it or not?\u201d Thinking about it, right? But at the same time, I sat my whole family down, and I told them, \u201cWe have to have a plan, because things are going to happen.\u201d And\u2026\nMARIA HINOJOSA: So, in your head, when you were asking yourself, \u201d\u00bfLo hago o no lo hago?,\u201d \u201cDo I speak out, or do I not speak out?\u201d after Trump had been reelected?\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] I wondered about that, but then the first raid happened. I already had this feeling that something was in the air, that something was going on.\nMARIA HINOJOSA: Was it a feeling of fear?\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] I always have that kind of intuition that something is going to happen, that something is coming. I spoke with my colleagues, and I told them about a plan just in case. The day before, because I went to a march that Sunday \u2014 right before I was arrested \u2014 I made a call out to the community. In fact, I was able to give one last interview, where I said we are living in difficult times and that we also needed to have an escalation protocol, a way to better protect our community.\nMARIA HINOJOSA: How many days after you made that speech on that Sunday, saying, \u201cThey are escalating. We have to escalate, too, as activists\u201d \u2014 how many days after that were you detained?\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] The next day.\nMARIA HINOJOSA: Do you believe, Jeanette, that you specifically are being targeted because of your activism, because you speak out?\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] Yes. And I found out that same day I was detained, because, well, the officer placed his phone down like this, and when he did, the screen lit up. And there it was, my social media, and a photo of my husband. I said to him, \u201cWhy are you monitoring my social media?\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s public.\u201d And another one responded, \u201cWe finally got you.\u201d\nMARIA HINOJOSA: So, what do you think \u2026 the Trump administration?\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] They are trying to say that they have the power, that they have the resources, and that they will deport anyone, not just me, but anyone who is inconvenient. They want to send a message to other activists like me that they will suffer the same consequences. They want to silence us. They want to erase us from the map. But I\u2019ve said it before, and I will say it again: It doesn\u2019t matter where I am, whether I\u2019m here or in my country, because I will have influence on a binational level. It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m not physically here. I have my seeds here.\nMARIA HINOJOSA: Do you believe that you are here because of political persecution?\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] I am a political prisoner. I never thought I would become a political prisoner in the United States, a country where laws are supposedly respected, where freedom of speech is protected, where one supposedly has the right to speak out, to protest, to denounce injustice. That is what I am, a political prisoner. And not just me; there are others, too, because of their activism who are imprisoned right now.\nMARIA HINOJOSA: Do you believe that you are the Mahmoud Khalil of the immigrant rights movement?\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] We are in the same situation. We are in the same situation, and there are many of us.\nMARIA HINOJOSA: When you say the words, \u201cI am a political prisoner,\u201d tell me what\u2019s going on for you as you say those words about yourself right now in the year 2025.\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] In 2025, we are going back so many years. Like I say, we are heading toward a dictatorship, because they want to silence those of us who are raising our voices, those of us who are revolutionizing movements.\nMARIA HINOJOSA: You say that you are here because you\u2019re fighting for your First Amendment right. You say that you won\u2019t be quiet no matter where you are, what country or what place that you\u2019re being detained. So, in fact, what is your message to the world right now?\nJEANETTE VIZGUERRA: [translated] My message to everyone who might watch this interview is that no leader who is making change will have a life free of suffering. All leaders suffer. All leaders face attempts to be silenced. All leaders face efforts to make us disappear. But thanks to everything we do, we achieve enormous changes out there. And right now the message to the community is: The people save the people. If you remain silent, we will not have change.\nAMY GOODMAN: That\u2019s Jeanette Vizguerra speaking to Latino USA host Maria Hinojosa. They are inside an ICE jail in Aurora, Colorado, run by GEO Group. Maria Hinojosa is still with us, speaking to us from Austin, Texas. Maria, she talks about all leaders suffer. In fact, in the rest of the interview \u2014 and we\u2019ll link to it at democracynow.org, that you\u2019ve posted on YouTube on video, and we\u2019ll link to your Latino USA piece for radio \u2014 in the rest of it, she breaks down. Jeanette breaks down as she talks about her four children, her seeds. Can you talk about her strength and what she faces?\nMARIA HINOJOSA: You know, Amy, it was really something to witness being inside the detention center. I actually call them \u201cdetention camps.\u201d \u201cCenter\u201d is just too neutral of a word. And to realize that even inside the detention facility, Jeanette continues to be an organizer. So, people are coming to her, and they\u2019re asking her, \u201cWhat should I do if I\u2019m sick? You know, can I get in touch with this person, make a call?\u201d She told me that the phones oftentimes are simply not working, which is extraordinary for people being held and not having access to phones. So, inside the detention camp, she is still helping people. And Jeanette is a consummate organizer and an activist. And journalists like us who do these interviews, we understand the amount of work it takes to be an activist and an organizer. It\u2019s not simple.\nAnd so, oftentimes in the interview, when I would ask Jeanette about her personal feelings, she would start talking about other people who were in a difficult situation, other people who she\u2019s helped. And, Amy and Juan, I had to kind of ask her more than once to talk about herself. How does she feel being held away from her four children, three of whom were born in the United States? How does she feel emotionally?\nAnd at the end of the interview, Amy, Jeanette did something which she rarely does. She does not like to show this part of herself. But she cried. And she told me that it is incredibly lonely to be inside and to have all of this pressure and to know that the whole world is watching her. But we were able to see a moment of vulnerability, because, al final de cuentas, ultimately, Jeanette Vizguerra is a mom who is an activist and who lives in Colorado for 30 years. So, she\u2019s a human being. And that was part of our intention, was to hear from Jeanette and see her not just as a political prisoner, but as a mom and as a human being.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Maria, I wanted to ask about the broader issue of the last few months as immigration raids have been going on, especially agents of ICE picking people up outside of courthouses in various cities, and the advertising campaign that Homeland Security has been mounting, urging undocumented immigrants to self-deport.\nMARIA HINOJOSA: You know, Juan, I look at my Instagram feed and \u2014 first thing in the morning, of course. And what do you see? You see stories about a baby, a 4-year-old, who could be dead in a matter of days if she is removed from this country. You see the story of a high schooler \u2014 I believe his name is Dylan \u2014 who went in, was following the law and the \u201cprocess\u201d legally, and then is taken right outside of a courthouse in New York City. You see the stories of men who are climbing \u2014 undocumented immigrants who are climbing trees in order to escape ICE, who are fully, like, in almost military garb, covering their faces. What are we supposed to call this, when you have masked agents with no identification taking people off streets and farms and corners and courthouses? You know, the question is, for those people who voted for Donald Trump: Are you satisfied? Does this make you feel like we are a better country because you\u2019re seeing this? This is not sustainable.\nAnd what Jeanette told me and kind of the new movement in terms of the sanctuary movement, which I\u2019ve been covering since the 1980s \u2014 the new movement, the sanctuary movement, is not behind closed doors in a church. The new movement, the sanctuary movement, is people of conscience with American citizenship who can go and take the sanctuary movement to the streets. And this is where our country is going, Juan. It is a very desperate place, but then you see people like Jeanette Vizguerra, who \u2014 she\u2019s holding her head high, even though she is in a very, very challenging situation in this ICE detention camp.\nAMY GOODMAN: And I wanted to ask you about, well, related news, reports emerging of Trump\u2019s so-called border czar Tom Homan earning at least $5,000 in fees for his consulting work for the private prison company GEO Group, which operates at least 16 jails or detention centers nationwide, a key contractor in carrying out Trump\u2019s mass deportations. Homan has been at the head of Trump\u2019s raids, mass detention, deportation agenda, and was acting director of ICE in the first Trump administration. And, yes, Jeanette Vizguerra is being held in a GEO Group jail. Maria?\nMARIA HINOJOSA: And Tom Homan also served under Barack Obama. So, Tom Homan has been around for a long time. You know, I think that people who watch and listen to Democracy Now! are clear about the fact that you have privately run prisons. So you have a private prison industry that runs prisons and now actually is making their money \u2014 millions upon millions of dollars \u2014 by keeping people in a detention bed. That is how they make their profit. And if mass incarceration, because of activists, has decreased a little bit, mass detention is on the rise. The money that is going to be made by GEO, by CoreCivic, which used to be known as Corrections Corporation of America \u2014 they don\u2019t want people to know that they are in the business of detention, so they just got rid of that name and call themselves CoreCivic. The American people need to understand that profit is being made by keeping a person in a detention bed. And how do they feel about this? And again, not just Tom Homan, but thousands of people are making money, making big bucks off of this. And this is totally distressing.\nI\u2019ll just tell you \u2014 I\u2019ll give you one scene from the detention facility in Aurora. You walk into the entrance room, the kind of lobby area. Now, GEO is a billion-dollar company. You should have seen the pictures that they had on the wall in the little lobby area, trying to show that they are a great facility. You would expect from a multimillion-dollar corporation that they would have the best photographs about the best treatment that they\u2019re offering. It was disgusting. They had a photograph of a wall of phones and said \u201cexpert communications available.\u201d They had a picture of half of a basketball court, with all walls and just a skylight, this big. They\u2019re like, \u201cfacilities for gymnastics and working out.\u201d It was horrific, Amy. And so, this is what most people cannot get a chance to see, because they\u2019re privately run, and they can just say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let any reporters in ever,\u201d and they can do that.\nAMY GOODMAN: Maria Hinojosa, we want to thank you so much for being with us, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, founder of Futuro Media, host of Latino USA. We\u2019ll link to the video and audio of your exclusive interview with the jailed immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra.

        "Summary": "A migrant detention deal between Italy and Albania is part of a global trend that tramples on the right to asylum.",
        "Content": "Each year, thousands of migrants attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea in the hope of finding refuge in Europe. And each year, European countries use every tool in their arsenal to keep those migrants out of their borders \u2013 from bureaucratic processes to militarization, and now, increasingly, through outsourcing the control of the border itself.\nIn April, Italy carried out its fourth mass transfer of migrants to Albania. The Italian Navy vessel Libra, which has recently been given to Albania, docked at the port of Sh\u00ebngjin with 40 migrants on board.\nThe deportation follows an agreement signed by Italy and Albania in November 2023: Italy would build migrant jails on Albanian soil to conduct the identification and asylum claim procedures for migrants arriving in Italy, effectively outsourcing these processes to Albania. Under the arrangement, Italian authorities would transfer migrants intercepted in international waters by Italian vessels to the newly built centers, and consider their asylum applications outside Italian territory. In exchange, Italy gave Albania an advance of 16.5 million euros, and set aside another 100 million euros as collateral, in addition to opening negotiations over energy transfer and work visas for Albanians. The agreement, the result of confidential negotiations conducted through informal administrative channels, was finalized behind closed doors without obtaining the formal status of an international treaty.\nHuman rights groups also decried the framework of the deal, with Amnesty International saying it was \u201cnot only dangerous in itself, but also as a potential blueprint\u201d for similar agreements in the future. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) also stated that it has gathered testimonies from individuals rescued and assisted aboard its vessels, many of whom have endured physical violence, abuse, torture, and sexual violence. All of them, due to the realities in their countries of origin, the journey across the desert, their stay and detention in Libya or Tunisia, the sea voyage, and all experiences suffered as direct victims or witnesses, must be considered at risk of severe health consequences. The organization says that, according to the procedures of the protocol signed between Italy and Albania, the conditions on board Italian military ships and patrol boats are inadequate for a proper assessment of people\u2019s health status, seriously increasing health risks for migrants. Nevertheless, the parliaments of both countries voted in favor of implementing the pact.\nThe opaque and irregular procedures underlying the agreement have inevitably led to implementation problems in addition to likely violations of human rights. Shortly after the centers in Albania opened on October 14, 2024, groups of migrants were returned to Italy on three separate occasions. The first instance occurred in October 2024, following a decision by an Italian court, which, deeming it impossible to classify the detainees\u2019 countries of origin as \u201csafe,\u201d which would potentially render their transfer to Albania a potential violation of asylum law, suspended the transfer order and mandated the migrants\u2019 return for the standard asylum claim examination process. Similar events transpired in November 2024 and in late January 2025, with the same outcome and the same justifications for the return. Each returned migrant entailed duplicated procedures and costs for Italy, in addition to the compounded suffering for those caught in this bureaucratic tug-of-war.\nHowever, the transfer of migrants to Albania this April differed sharply from the previous ones: For the first time, the 40 men who arrived at the port of Sh\u00ebngjin did not originate from international waters but directly from Italy\u2019s Centri di Permanenza per il Rimpatrio (CPRs) \u2014 detention centers holding migrants set to be deported. This transfer was made possible by the introduction of a new law, which amended the bilateral agreement, extending the possibility of transfer to migrants already present on Italian territory and subject to deportation orders. An imposing lineup of law enforcement, with vans from Italy\u2019s national military police (the Carabinieri) and Italy\u2019s militarized financial police (the Guardia di Finanza), awaited the Italian vessel on the quay, ready to take the migrants bound for Albania. The scene of the men disembarking from the ship with their hands restrained by plastic zip ties caused particular dismay. \u201cThey\u2019re getting off handcuffed,\u201d said Member of the European Parliament Cecilia Strada, an eyewitness who arrived on site, and who has previously spoken out against both the agreement as well as Italy\u2019s restrictive immigration policies.\nItaly\u2019s strategy of outsourcing migration flows extends to a broader network of agreements to externalize its border operations. In 2023, Italy renewed its memorandum of understanding with Libya, meant to keep migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean off of Italy\u2019s shores. The renewal entails a further investment of 8 billion euros earmarked for strengthening the Libyan Coast Guard and the so-called \u201crehabilitation\u201d of detention centers in Libya, facilities repeatedly condemned by the UN. The cooperation scheme also includes the provision of 300 new armed pick-up trucks used to forcibly push migrants away from the sea and into the desert, a practice known as desert pushbacks. The renewal of the agreement came even after the International Criminal Court found that the treatment of migrants in Libya may constitute crimes against humanity as well as war crimes \u2013 crimes in which Italy could be found to be complicit. There is plenty of accessible and verified documentation behind these claims \u2013 including harrowing video evidence of the Libyan Coast Guard shooting at and threatening migrant boats in distress as well as NGOs engaged in rescues in the Mediterranean; footage from Libyan detention camps revealing arbitrary detentions, torture and extortion; and photographs of dozens of migrant bodies abandoned to their fate in the desert.\nAnother manifestation of Italy\u2019s border externalization can be seen in Tunisia. Current policies, often solidified through international agreements, aim to establish facilities or reinforce migration management capabilities in third countries. While presented as humanitarian efforts to manage migrant flows, these initiatives often mask a true intent to block departures at any cost. These practices carry serious human rights risks, with numerous reports of violence, abuse, and inhumane conditions suffered by migrants in identification centers \u2014 places where individuals are held to be identified and registered after their arrival \u2014 or prior to potential repatriation, as frequently occurs in Sfax, Tunisia. An investigation has revealed that Tunisian security forces, funded by European countries as part of their border management programs, are engaging in racial profiling of migrants, conducting pushbacks into the desert, mass arrests, and displacement campaigns based on skin color within Tunisia. As with Libya, Italy invokes \u201ccooperation\u201d and the \u201cfight against trafficking\u201d to justify agreements that, in reality, externalize anti-migrant violence. Meanwhile, traffickers have not disappeared at all; they have only adapted, raising the prices of alternative routes and multiplying the risks for those fleeing.\nItaly\u2019s approach to immigration is part of a broader strategy of the European Union (EU), aimed at outsourcing the management of its borders and the movement of people to third countries. A precursor to this trend is the \u201cEU-Turkey Statement\u201d of 2016. Through a significant allocation of financial resources, amounting to 6 billion euros, the EU incentivized Turkey to strengthen the control of its borders and to take back migrants who passed through Turkey in their attempt to reach Europe via Greece. Research by Amnesty International attests to Turkish returns of asylum seekers and refugees to countries with minimal or absent human rights protections, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. While the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement included nominal clauses aimed at safeguarding human rights, such as individual asylum application assessments, their practical implementation was widely challenged by human rights organizations and UN agencies. Critics focused on Turkey\u2019s actual capacity to be considered a \u201csafe third country\u201d and on procedural shortcomings that compromised asylum seekers\u2019 access to justice and guarantees, making rights protection more theoretical than real.\nThe EU implements these policies through a series of instruments and partnerships with various third countries, often combining financial incentives, security cooperation and technical support for border management. The \u201cEU-Egypt Strategic Partnership\u201d of March 2024 represents an emblematic case and saw Brussels establish a funding of 7.4 billion euros to Cairo, a significant portion of which is explicitly tied to strengthening the Egyptian border apparatus and repressing migration. The agreement fully aligns with the model that combines economic support, the transfer of know-how, and security cooperation, aiming to control migratory movements even before they reach European shores.\nThe impacts of this agreement on migrants are multiple and often severe. The strengthened control of Egyptian borders, made possible by European funds, translates into an increase in pushbacks, arrests, and detentions. Migrants are thus stranded in Egypt or forced to embark on even more dangerous routes, with reduced or no access to asylum procedures and heightened vulnerability to exploitation and abuse. The agreement\u2019s lack of independent monitoring mechanisms raises significant human rights concerns in a country already known for its repressive practices. Furthermore, unlike the understanding with Turkey, which included nominal human rights clauses, the pact with Cairo focuses almost exclusively on border control, without stringent conditions for the treatment of migrants.\nThe European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) assumes an increasingly significant role in this strategy of border externalization. The community body ensures the coordination of transnational activities with nonmember states through the deployment of specialized units, the allocation of technological resources, and training programs dedicated to the border security forces of partner countries. Frontex\u2019s expanding role, fueled by a continuously increasing budget and a broadened mandate, further demonstrated by recent plans to establish a standing corps of 10,000 border guards by 2027, is overshadowed by a long and documented history of human rights abuse allegations.\nNumerous reports from NGOs and journalistic investigations have revealed Frontex\u2019s alleged involvement in unlawful practices. For instance, a 2022 Lighthouse Reports investigation uncovered that Frontex was implicated in at least 22 documented pushbacks in the Aegean Sea between March 2020 and September 2021. In these cases, individuals were placed on life rafts and left adrift towards Turkey after being identified by Frontex. Similarly, Human Rights Watch documented Frontex\u2019s complicity in abuses in Libya in 2022, through aerial surveillance that enabled the Libyan Coast Guard to intercept migrant boats, despite knowing these individuals would be returned to a country where they face arbitrary detention and torture. All these practices gravely endanger the lives and dignity of migrants.\nOf course, outsourcing migration processes isn\u2019t limited to Europe. For example, the United States, through its 2019 agreement with Mexico known as the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program, forced over 70,000 asylum seekers, many of whom were fleeing violence and persecution, to await the outcome of their protection applications in dangerous territories that lacked essential services.\nThe U.S.\u2019s recent pact with El Salvador has pushed the boundaries even further. The agreement saw the deportation of more than 230 migrants to Salvadoran territory, the majority of whom were Venezuelan. To carry out the expulsions, the Trump administration resorted to an obsolete law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, conceived for the summary expulsion of foreign citizens from \u201cenemy\u201d countries in wartime. Despite the fact that the law had not been applied since World War II and had been challenged by legal scholars and temporarily blocked by a federal ruling, the administration equated migrants to \u201cinvaders\u201d to justify its use. The operation was made possible by a bilateral agreement with El Salvador which, in exchange for $6 million, allows the United States to transfer deportees to the maximum-security prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT), a facility already condemned by the UN for torture and inhumane conditions. In this case too, local security apparatuses are financed without any guarantee of respect for human rights, fueling a humanitarian crisis that is not resolved but simply shifted out of public view.\nThis approach to externalization isn\u2019t limited to El Salvador. For example, between February 12 and 15, 2025, the United States expelled 299 third-country nationals to Panama, individuals who had crossed the US-Mexico border. Panama issued these deportees 30-day \u201chumanitarian permits,\u201d extendable to 90, advising them to leave the country. These expulsions were condemned by Human Rights Watch as violations of international law. Additionally, there are concrete reports and concerns that the Trump administration considered similar agreements with Libya, a country in armed conflict, despite Libyan authorities denying direct talks and a federal judge already blocking deportations without due process.\nIn such situations, local security forces receive funding without any guarantees regarding human rights. This contributes to a humanitarian crisis that, instead of being resolved, is merely shifted out of public view.\nAustralia, too, has externalized its own borders since 2013, detaining migrants, including asylum seekers, in offshore centers in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, through a policy widely condemned by humanitarian organizations for its inhumane and degrading conditions, the psychological damage caused by prolonged detention, and the lack of access to rapid and fair asylum procedures.\nThe United Kingdom also famously attempted to relocate the asylum process with an agreement with Rwanda in 2022, envisaging the transfer of applicants for the examination of their claims. Initially blocked by the U.K. Supreme Court in November 2023, due to concerns about Rwanda\u2019s categorization as a safe country, to get around this problem, the British government subsequently passed the \u201cSafety of Rwanda Act 2024,\u201d declaring the African country \u201csafe\u201d for the purposes of British law and border management.\nThe trend of wealthy countries paying poorer states, often characterized by authoritarian governments or weak judicial systems, to intercept migration flows at external borders or accommodate deportees thus externalizes their international protection responsibilities. The result is a parallel migratory system, opaque and removed from any institutional oversight, where the methodical recourse to coercive practices is the very foundation of the mechanism. From the Libyan prisons financed by the EU to the CECOT prison in El Salvador, up to the Australian detention centers in Papua New Guinea, the pattern repeats itself with disturbing regularity.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "We must dismantle the lie that criminalization safeguards democracy and ensures our safety.",
        "Content": "As most of the federal government has declined to \u201ccheck\u201d the Trump administration over the past three months, a new imbalance has been established \u2014 one that favors the autocratic rule of a megalomaniac and the oligarchs who have purchased his favor. The failure of formal checks and balances to significantly stymie Trump is painfully clear. It is also not unprecedented. As Lisa Miller illustrates, checks and balances have been routinely weaponized to obstruct efforts to improve the lives of everyday people, maintaining a system of vast inequality in which policy favors the ultrawealthy.\nWe would only extend her argument by noting that faith in checks and balances tends to stem from an even more fundamental faith in \u201claw and order.\u201d This faith too is misplaced, yet it is even more pernicious, since it justifies the government institutions responsible for two of the most spectacular and entrenched forms of inequality in the United States: policing and prisons. We agree that mass movements are the only real antidote to Trump\u2019s malevolence and the only path to true democracy. But tweaking our constitutional order without dismantling these inherently corrupt and unjust instruments used to enforce authoritarian rule will only leave the heart of our liberal fascist system intact. Checks and balances won\u2019t save us \u2014 and rule of law, as we know it, won\u2019t either.\nThe prison industrial complex is already a fully functioning system of disposal. It strips years from the lives of those it ensnares, who are forced to live in torturous conditions while the system\u2019s evils are largely rendered invisible. Fascist forces already have the means to cage and surveil massive numbers of people \u2014 and the infrastructure is expandable. Trump is currently seeking $45 billion to expand ICE jails. And as we have seen in recent months, local police can be deputized to unleash terror on immigrant communities.\nTrump\u2019s abduction and incarceration of permanent residents and visa holders, including the political targeting of students like R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk and Mohsen Mahdawi and the disappearing of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, are certainly dire escalations. But the words of a plainclothes officer who participated in Ozt\u00fcrk\u2019s abduction \u2014 \u201cWe are not monsters. . . . We do what the government tells us\u201d \u2014 should ring forebodingly in all of our ears. These kinds of actions are far more routine than most Americans are willing to admit. Trump may be particularly shameless and brazen in making a spectacle of authoritarian cruelty. But justified outrage should not keep us from seeing that his administration is not an absolute rupture from the past. On the contrary, Trump is sharply and rapidly intensifying the U.S. state\u2019s long and bipartisan history of abduction and caging, deploying these powerful, incredibly well-resourced instruments of repression for overtly fascist ends.\nAs anti-authoritarian thinker and strategist Scot Nakagawa has argued, \u201cThe expansion of America\u2019s carceral state since the 1970s is not solely about prisons and policing \u2014 it represents the exercise of power and control in service of the preservation of unjust and anti-democratic hierarchies.\u201d Just as neoliberalism encased markets \u2014 insulating capital from the impacts of labor organizing, government interventions, and the will of the people \u2014 so has the carceral state entrenched the norms of inequality. As the country\u2019s social safety nets have been slashed over the course of decades, huge investments have been made in police and prisons. Nearly 2 million people are incarcerated in the United States \u2014 more than any other country in the world \u2014 and almost half a million are confined by electronic shackles. Upon release, they are saddled with even deeper poverty. Even social services, educational systems, health care, and other forms of state-sponsored support are now pervaded by policing and surveillance.\nFrom the criminalization of poverty, homelessness, and acts of survival and despair to the incessant targeting of social movements, prisons and policing have suppressed challenges to the system as the rich amassed obscene concentrations of wealth. The first U.S. police departments grew out of slave patrols, anti-immigrant vitriol, and the suppression of labor organizing, and that legacy \u2014 the protection of property and hierarchy at all costs \u2014 continues. While working-class people have faced increased precarity and uncertainty, an order ensuring stability at the top and immiseration for the rest has been violently maintained.\nThe result, as Andrew Krinks has argued, is \u201cmass devotion\u201d to criminalization in the United States, leading even many exploited people to \u201cput their faith in the pseudo-divine power of cops and cages to make safe, which is to say, to save, in the midst of the existentially threatening disorder that colonial racial capitalism itself creates.\u201d But a system that disposes of people and enforces inequality will never function in the service of our liberation.\nMoreover, the fetishization of law and order as the foil to fascism falls flat when so many of the U.S. government\u2019s deadly injustices are legal, from routine deportations to mass incarceration to military \u201caid.\u201d Condemning Trump and his ilk as \u201cfelons\u201d and \u201clawbreakers\u201d is not just the mirror image of Trump\u2019s characterization of immigrants and student protesters as gang members and terrorists. It lends credibility to a thoroughly unjust regime of punishment while dehumanizing people caged in our prisons and betraying those whose efforts to survive, self-determine, care for themselves, or act in opposition to fascist edicts will render them \u201ccriminals.\u201d\nThis is not to say that law has no role to play in resistance. It is crucial to use every tool at our disposal to defend against fascism, and that sometimes means engaging with the legal system through defense work, class action lawsuits, and legislative advocacy. The important work of organizations like the National Lawyers Guild, Palestine Legal, Movement Law Lab, Transgender Law Center, Just Futures Law, Transformative Justice Law Project, and many more remind us that dismantling death-making systems must include reducing immediate harms to human beings and communities. But engaging with the law in order to mitigate harm and change policy is a very different project from the \u201crule of law\u201d reverence that goes hand in hand with criminalization and policing.\nRather than catering to that mythology, we must dismantle the lie that criminalization safeguards democracy and ensures our safety. The death-making potential of the public\u2019s faith in criminalization has now reached an inflection point. If we maintain our faith in these mechanisms of surveillance, control, stigmatization, and disposal, we are worshiping at the altar of our own destruction. We are faced with the ultimate surrender of our humanity, our freedom, and ourselves.\nTo mobilize people in mass opposition to fascism, bring forth a true social transformation, and usher in ways of living and governing ourselves that will not be conquered, bought, or co-opted by men like Musk and Trump, we need to embrace a truly liberatory vision. What decarceration, anti-deportation, and activist defense initiatives can we grow? What mutual aid efforts can we engage in? What community-building projects can we foster, to keep each other safe? What creative and journalistic endeavors can we undertake to inform and spark action? What radical shifts can we imagine that prioritize the redistribution of wealth and opportunity? What irresistible projects can we dream up to usher forth a future that leaves no one behind?\nIt\u2019s long past time to renounce the mass devotion to punishment, stigmatization, and disposal that helped create and continues to fuel this moment. In its stead, we need a movement of movements \u2014 a collaboration that recognizes our shared humanity and makes collective liberation its spiritual center.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Tom Homan disclosed consulting fees from GEO Group, one of the largest immigrant jail operators in the US.",
        "Content": "One of President Donald Trump\u2019s top immigration officials was recently paid an undisclosed amount to consult for a major immigrant jail operator that is poised to profit from the administration\u2019s fascist immigration crackdown, new reporting finds.\nFinancial filings show that Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, consulted for GEO Group in the two years prior to his appointment in January, per The Washington Post.\nThe for-profit operator is one of the largest private prison companies in the U.S. and contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \u2014 the agency Homan headed for 18 months under Trump\u2019s first term. GEO operates the vast majority of the immigrant jails in the U.S. (along with CoreCivic) and raked in hundreds of millions in funding from ICE contracts in 2021.\nAccording to the filing, GEO paid Homan more than $5,000 for his consulting work. Because ethics rules allow officials to report within a range of values, it\u2019s possible GEO paid Homan far more.\nThe consulting fees raise questions over whether the consulting amounts to a conflict of interest for Homan, who oversees deportations and border enforcement as border czar. The White House has denied wrongdoing and said that Homan will recuse himself from the government\u2019s dealings with GEO.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Democrats said that Homan\u2019s consulting represents a \u201cserious conflict of interest.\u201d\n\u201cThe GEO Group is a major private prison contractor whose largest source of revenue is contracts with ICE,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (Illinois), the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, told the Post. \u201cThis news raises even more questions, and the corruption concerns are too large to ignore.\u201d\nDurbin has recently spoken out against the Trump administration\u2019s practice of detaining huge numbers of immigrants without due process or oversight after a visit to two GEO Group-managed prisons in Louisiana, where people like Mahmoud Khalil and R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk were incarcerated by immigration officials over their pro-Palestine advocacy.\nThe prisons operated by GEO are notorious for abuse. Prisons managed by the $4 billion company have received complaints of neglect, assault, and other abuses, while the company\u2019s cost-cutting measures involve such practices as paying incarcerated people less than $1 a day for labor.\nGEO\u2019s stock value doubled after Trump was elected, and the company is slated to benefit even more under the Trump administration. Homan has called for the number of beds in immigrant jails to nearly triple, from 34,000 to 100,000, while saying that mass deportation is \u201cmore important to this country than anything.\u201d\nMuch of this expansion is expected to be carried out by GEO and CoreCivic.\nPer the Post, GEO\u2019s chief executive, David Donahue, has bragged to investors that the company faces an \u201cunprecedented opportunity\u201d with the new administration.\nThe Trump administration has already awarded GEO with hefty contracts to reopen two facilities that had previously shut down. GEO estimates that the contract for a Newark detention center, awarded in February, will be worth $1 billion over its 15-year term, and will generate $60 million in revenue for the company each year. Another contract for a facility in Michigan will bring in $70 million in revenues annually, the company estimates.\nMeanwhile, Republicans have proposed a boost of $150 billion to immigration enforcement in their marquee reconciliation bill, including $59 billion for immigration detention and transportation, meaning that GEO and other companies could be poised for a major windfall.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "The governor issued an executive order after the NIH announced plans to use the proposed database to discover a \u201ccure.\u201d",
        "Content": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has signed an executive order safeguarding the medical records of autistic people in Illinois. The order follows a recent federal proposal by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create a national autism database. It prevents state agencies from sharing autism-related information with anyone outside of state government without a clear reason and informed consent.\nThe order also clearly states that \u201cautism is a neurological difference \u2014 not a disease or an epidemic \u2014 identified by trained clinicians and healthcare professionals, with rising identification rates attributable to improved practices, greater awareness, and expanded access to screening tools.\u201d\n\u201cEvery Illinoisan deserves dignity, privacy, and the freedom to live without fear of surveillance or discrimination,\u201d Pritzker said in a press release. \u201cAs Donald Trump and [the Department of Government Efficiency] threaten these freedoms, we are taking steps to ensure that our state remains a leader in protecting the rights of individuals with autism and all people with disabilities.\u201d\nAfter backlash to the database proposal, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attempted to clarify it, saying he would create an autism database using Medicare and Medicaid data. The goal is to discover a \u201ccure\u201d for autism, despite the fact that autism is a naturally occurring condition and not believed to have a cause.\nKennedy also made statements suggesting that he believes autistic people\u2019s lives are worthless and harmful. In one speech, he said of autistic children, \u201cThese are kids who will never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d He also said, \u201cAutism destroys families.\u201d Doctors and autism advocates say this wildly and insultingly mischaracterizes the experiences of autistic people, and falsely paints their lives as a burden to themselves and others.\nThe HHS\u2019s statements and actions make Pritzker\u2019s order necessary, according to Zoe Gross, director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mistrust now between the autistic community and HHS and the administration because of the way that Secretary Kennedy is talking about our community,\u201d Gross told Prism. \u201cWhich was one reason I was really excited to see Governor Pritzker push back on that in the executive order.\u201d\nAn HHS spokesperson told Prism in an emailed statement that the autism database would \u201cenable researchers to analyze large-scale, de-identified data to better understand the causes of conditions like autism and chronic diseases.\u201d The statement also said that \u201cdata with personal identifiers are subject to federal privacy laws and regulations\u201d and that the autism data platform \u201cwould be fully compliant with these laws and regulations.\u201d\nGross, however, remained concerned that the data would not be adequately protected. She worried that people\u2019s data could be linked to them and used to enable discrimination.\nGross also told Prism, \u201cWe feel the data needs to be used for good, for research that will positively impact the autistic community.\u201d\n\u201c[What] we fear it\u2019s going to be used for instead is to create a bogus link between autism and vaccines, because we know that that\u2019s Secretary Kennedy\u2019s existing belief,\u201d Gross continued.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Kennedy] knows enough stories and knows enough about the community to make comments like he\u2019s made,\u201d said Kimberly L. Johnson, former president of Chicagoland Autism Connection and board president of disability advocacy group The Arc of Illinois. Johnson pointed to her own son, now 32 years old, who was nonverbal as a child and has now graduated from college and lives independently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really frustrating,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you hear comments coming from someone who is now in charge of this very delicate area for families and hasn\u2019t even been in office long enough to even have conversations [with the autistic community].\u201d\nJohnson said that in contrast, she\u2019s been pleased with the way that Pritzker\u2019s office has reached out to autistic and disabled organizations and individuals. Advocates with the Arc of Illinois didn\u2019t know an executive order was coming necessarily, Johnson told Prism, but Pritzker, \u201casked for our opinion\u201d on autistic issues.\nJohnson also pointed out that Pritzker has been strongly advocating against Medicaid cuts. The Republican Congress is currently proposing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which would leave some 13 million people without insurance. Medicaid \u201cis the lifeline of services for people with disabilities,\u201d Johnson told Prism. Pritzker, Johnson said, understands \u201cthat the state could not take that weight if Medicaid services were cut.\u201d\nHHS statements about data collection on autistic people have been \u201calarming,\u201d according to Ly X\u012bnzh\u00e8n M. Zh\u01cengs\u016bn Brown, senior adviser at Autistic Women & Nonbinary Network. They expressed deep concern about the potential misuse of a federal autism database, citing historical abuses of data collection against marginalized groups.\n\u201cWhat do you use a registry for? Perhaps to increase surveillance on people, to round people up, or to target people for caging or elimination,\u201d Zh\u01cengs\u016bn Brown said. \u201cThat might sound hyperbolic, but if you look historically and in other countries, this is what is happening, and we don\u2019t want that to happen here.\u201d\nFederal officials have stated that any database would use de-identified data and comply with privacy laws, emphasizing that individual identities would not be tracked or monitored. However, in recent public statements and letters to HHS, advocacy groups have continued to communicate concern about the adequacy of these safeguards and the potential for misuse. They expressed concern about the Trump administration targeting trans people and the way that has intersected with policies targeting or denigrating autistic people.\nTrans and nonbinary people are up to six times more likely to be autistic than cis people. Some right-wing legislators have been misusing this finding to argue that nefarious trans ideologues are misleading innocent and incompetent autistic children into becoming trans. This \u201cundermines the autonomy and dignity of autistic trans people and further contributes to the criminalization and the demonization of the trans community,\u201d Zh\u01cengs\u016bn Brown said. \u201cSo there are very, very real-world impacts that are dangerous and potentially deadly for our communities coming out of the current administration\u2019s rhetoric.\u201d\nPritzker has also been proactive in trying to protect trans rights in Illinois. The state has passed laws making it easier for trans people to change gender markers on state ID and has guaranteed trans women access to women\u2019s bathrooms in the workplace. State-level pushback against discriminatory federal policies can be helpful, according to the advocates Prism spoke to, who all agreed that Pritzker\u2019s executive order would help protect autistic medical records and autistic people.\nAdvocates say that solidarity is also important. States cannot fully counteract federal policy. But when the head of HHS is spreading misinformation about autism, they said it\u2019s vital that other leaders push back and model informed policy based on actual research and input from autistic people.\n\u201cI would love to see other states adopt similar executive orders,\u201d Gross said, \u201cboth affirming the state government\u2019s belief that autism is not an epidemic or something to be terrified about, and also protecting the data rights of autistic people and our data privacy.\u201d\nPrism is an independent and nonprofit newsroom led by journalists of color. We report from the ground up and at the intersections of injustice.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "Dozens of the roughly 200 cryptocurrency traders who were invited to a private dinner held by President Donald Trump last week hold other crypto assets with symbology linked to far right ideologies, white nationalism and neo-Nazism, a government watchdog says.\nAccording to a recent report by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), 50 of the invitees hold crypto assets named after Pepe the Frog, a cartoon figure associated with the far right, as well as coins with names or symbols referencing bigoted ideologies.\nFor instance, CREW said, nine of the traders\u2019 wallets contain coins with openly antisemitic or racist names.\n\u201cFor example, one token is called \u2018FUCK THE JEWS,\u2019 while another is simply the n-word. Four others are variations on the word \u2018swastika,\u2019 such as \u2018Swasticoin\u2019 and \u2018Swastika Coin,\u2019\u201d CREW wrote.\nCREW acknowledged that the traders may have bought the coins based on potential profits, and that Pepe the Frog, while adopted years ago by the far right, is not always a symbol of hatred.\nHowever, the report is the latest example of the numerous associations with neo-Nazis and white nationalists held by Trump and his administration officials \u2014 in a presidential term that began with key administration ringleader Elon Musk performing what appeared to be a Nazi salute at a Trump rally.\nIt comes at a time when the Trump administration is using accusations of supposed antisemitism as a bludgeon to crack down on free speech, levying the claim against supporters of Palestinian rights without evidence while also embracing and defending outspoken neo-Nazis who actually pose a threat to the safety of Jewish people.\nThe event is also one of many shows of Trump\u2019s penchant for naked corruption, as many critics say, with Trump allowing wealthy people and entities to buy access to the presidency or even legal favors.\nThe gala, hosted at Trump\u2019s Virginia golf club, was advertised by Trump\u2019s team as \u201cthe most exclusive invitation in the world.\u201d Trump invited 220 top buyers of his crypto coin, $TRUMP, to the event, with those in attendance having spent a combined $148 million in hopes of having a chance to attend.\nThe event and release of the coin was a display of opulent wealth with the seemingly explicit purpose of enhancing Trump\u2019s personal wealth \u2014 as CREW put it, \u201ca naked attempt by President Donald Trump to profit from his office.\u201d The announcement of the dinner in April made the value of the coin surge.\nOne known attendee, the top holder of the coin, Justin Sun, is facing charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission for cryptocurrency-related fraud. But the Trump administration paused the charges after Sun funnelled tens of millions of dollars to various Trump-affiliated projects.\nSimilarly, The New York Times reported Tuesday that Trump pardoned a man awaiting prison time for tax fraud after his mother attended one of Trump\u2019s $1 million per plate fundraising dinners at Mar-a-Lago earlier this year.\nPaul Walczak, a former nursing home executive who pled guilty to stealing millions of dollars from employee tax payments, was supposed to pay $4.4 million in restitution and serve an 18-month sentence. But, just weeks after the dinner, which advertised access to Trump himself, the president pardoned Walczak instead.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "A new study confirms what locals and environmental activists across the Gulf South and beyond have said for years: Black, Brown and Indigenous workers do not benefit equitably from jobs offered by the petrochemical industry despite their communities often bearing the brunt of its pollution.\nIn Louisiana, for example, residents and activists say jobs promised to Black communities located near refineries and chemical plants often go to white workers who commute from their homes a safer distance away from the toxic smokestacks, chemical fires, explosions, leaky pipelines and sky-high cancer rates that make the region notorious.\nPublished in the Ecological Economics journal by a team of environmental experts last month, the study examines employment at chemical and petroleum manufacturers nationwide. The researchers also conducted a case study of Louisiana\u2019s petrochemical corridors, where local and state politicians lure industrial developers with lucrative tax breaks in the name of creating jobs and revenue.\nThe study cites years of research showing that the pollution and climate risks associated with the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry disproportionately fall on Black, Brown, Indigenous and poor white communities. Most of the wealth extracted from and created in these communities does not stay there, one reason why academics and activists call them fossil fuel \u201csacrifice zones.\u201d\nResearchers say the latest findings \u201creveal systemic inequality\u201d in the petrochemical workforce across the United States. At plants that manufacture chemicals or products made from petroleum and other fossil fuels, people of color were \u201cconsistently underrepresented among the highest-paying jobs and overrepresented among the lowest-paying jobs in both subsectors,\u201d the authors wrote.\nFor decades, Black residents of the Gulf South fighting against the expansion of refineries and chemicals plants near their historic neighborhoods \u2014 or virtually right on top of them \u2014 have been met with promises of jobs and other economic benefits. And for decades, residents have told visitors to Louisiana\u2019s \u201cCancer Alley\u201d and other industrial corridors that the jobs and benefits touted by petrochemical companies and supporters of their expansion rarely materialize after those corporate polluters receive permission from the government to set up shop.\nInstead, residents are left to wonder about the long-term health impacts of pollution when they get sick or are forced to evacuate their homes due to a release of toxic chemicals from the plant, refinery or storage tanks located on the other side of the fence, according to Roishetta Ozane, a Louisiana-based organizer and founder of the Vessel Project, a mutual aid and environmental justice group.\n\u201cWe are screaming at the top of our lungs about all the promises the industry makes to our communities that they don\u2019t keep, and about those burdens that come from industry,\u201d Ozane told Truthout in an interview. \u201cWe are constantly carrying those burdens.\u201d\nOzane lives in the small town of Sulphur outside of Lake Charles in southwest Louisiana, where she counts 14 petrochemical facilities within miles of her house. Her family\u2019s home is walking distance from a chemical plant that caught fire and produced a massive plume of toxic gas after Hurricane Laura made landfall in 2020, Ozane said.\n\u201cWhen we go by these facilities, the license plates on these vehicles are from Alabama, Georgia, Florida \u2014 wherever but from Louisiana,\u201d Ozane said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have the jobs here, but people do have cancer, and children do have asthma.\u201d\nOzane says her community is already overburdened with pollution, but the fossil fuel industry is aggressively pushing to build new infrastructure in the region, including massive terminals for liquifying cheap fracked gas and exporting it overseas. Despite becoming the world\u2019s top fossil gas producer, the price U.S. households pay for natural gas skyrocketed by 52 percent between 2016 and 2023. In Louisiana, enough methane gas was flared and leaked from existing infrastructure in 2019 to cover energy bills for two-thirds of households in the state. Methane pollution is a major contributor to global warming, which intensifies hurricanes and flooding in the Gulf South.\n\u201cWe get the jobs that are most dangerous \u2014 temporary work, construction \u2014 and then those jobs go away and we\u2019re back to figure out how to survive and thrive in this community that is now more polluted to begin with,\u201d Ozane said, adding that workers worry about exposing their children to chemical residues.\nOzane said her community remains impoverished despite the vast industrial development, with a large portion of the population depending on food assistance and other safety net programs. Lake Charles has a poverty rate of 23 percent, more than twice the national average. People struggle to pay bills while also contending with health threats from petrochemical pollution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that policy makers speak with frontline folks to get our perspective,\u201d Ozane said. \u201cPeople of color were significantly underrepresented in jobs at these oil refineries and chemical plants in particular here in Louisiana, which is a very racist place for lack of a better term. There are still state laws based on the Jim Crow era, so it\u2019s nothing new to us.\u201d\nAmerican Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a national trade association for the industry examined in the study on racial disparities in hiring, did not respond to a request for comment.\nDavid Cresson, president of the Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance, said the study does not consider the role of the chemical industry in workforce development in the state, including by supporting STEM programs for elementary and high school students, and working with universities and trade schools to provide scholarships and career paths toward high-paying science and engineering jobs in chemical manufacturing.\n\u201cWe are committed to closing the training gap in Louisiana by investing in early education, STEM training and technical scholarships to ensure that all members of our communities are represented among our industrial workforce,\u201d Cresson said in a statement to Truthout.\nHowever, potential opportunities for students in the future offer little condolence to the people already living in the shadow of industry. In Cancer Alley, the petrochemical corridor along the Mississippi River located between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, residents of the rural, majority-Black communities in St. James Parish are fighting a historic legal battle in federal court.\nSt. James and the surrounding area is packed with the fossil fuel and petrochemical facilities that give Cancer Alley its name. Residents of majority-Black neighborhoods face increased risks of cancer, respiratory ailments and newborn health harms. After a multiyear fight to prevent a Taiwanese company from building another massive plant on land where the community\u2019s ancestors were enslaved, worked and eventually buried after death, St. James residents sued the parish government, arguing that a land use policy slating residential areas for industrial development is unconstitutional and discriminatory.\nActivists fighting environmental racism in St. James originally filed the lawsuit in 2023, seeking a moratorium on construction of new sources of pollution in their community. On April 9, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that advocacy groups representing residents of St. James can proceed with the lawsuit, a major victory after a series of legal setbacks.\n\u201cThe pendulum of Justice has swung in our favor,\u201d said Gail LeBoeuf, a St. James resident and organizer with Inclusive Louisiana, in a statement last month, after the ruling. \u201cWe have been sounding the alarm for far too long that a moratorium is needed to halt the expansion of any more polluting industries in our neighborhoods, and too many lives have been lost to cancer.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

However, the family received a letter last month stating that their legal status had been terminated and urging them to leave the United States of their own accord, to avoid deportation.\nWhile spokespeople for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as well as CHLA declined to comment, the Times reported on a letter written by Dr. John Arsenault at the family\u2019s request:\nIf there is an interruption in her daily nutrition system, called Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), the doctor wrote, \u201cthis could be fatal within a matter of days.\u201d\n\u201cAs such, patients on home TPN are not allowed to leave the country because the infrastructure to provide TPN or provide immediate intervention if there is a problem with IV access depends on our program\u2019s utilization of U.S.-based healthcare resources and does not transfer across borders,\u201d Arsenault wrote.\n\u201cThis is a textbook example of medical need,\u201d said the family\u2019s attorney, Rebecca Brown of the pro bono legal firm Public Counsel, who petitioned for continuation of their temporary humanitarian legal status. \u201cThis child will die and there\u2019s no sense for that to happen.

Adriana Smith was declared legally dead in February after a medical emergency caused her brain function to cease. Smith, a nurse, had been initially turned away when she first sought medical care. She was nine weeks pregnant at the time. But because her medical providers would face legal consequences including jail time if they were to end the pregnancy, Smith\u2019s body is still being kept on breathing machines despite the fact that Smith herself can no longer be resuscitated. The case demonstrates once again that \u201cit is deadly to be Black and pregnant,\u201d says Monica Simpson of the reproductive justice organization SisterSong.\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez.\nWe turn now to Georgia, where there\u2019s growing concern about the plight of a pregnant woman who\u2019s been declared brain dead but has kept on life support for three months against the wishes of her distraught family because of Georgia\u2019s abortion ban. Adriana Smith is a 30-year-old mother and nurse who suffered a medical emergency in February due to blood clots in the brain, was declared legally dead. At that point, she was about nine weeks pregnant. She\u2019s now about 22 weeks pregnant, but doctors have kept her on breathing machines because her fetus was old enough to have detectable cardiac activity. Georgia\u2019s \u201cheartbeat law\u201d bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected.\nThis comes as Georgia\u2019s attorney general has said Georgia\u2019s heartbeat bill does not require medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death, and issued a terse statement that, quote, \u201cRemoving life support is not an action \u2018with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.\u2019\u201d\nGeorgia\u2019s maternal and infant mortality rates are among the worst in the country, with Black women dying at twice the rate of white women.\nWe\u2019re joined now by two guests. In Washington, D.C., Mini Timmaraju is with us, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America. And in Atlanta, we\u2019re joined by Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, the national women of color reproductive justice collective that\u2019s based in Georgia, has a lawsuit against Georgia, arguing its six-week abortion ban is denying people in Georgia lifesaving care.\nWe welcome you both back to Democracy Now! Monica Simpson, let\u2019s begin with you. Can you talk about the situation right now, what the family wants for their beloved, brain-dead loved one who is pregnant and who doctors are keeping on life support?\nMONICA SIMPSON: Thank you so much for having me.\nIt is a dire situation that we\u2019re dealing with here in Georgia. And we are constantly having to navigate this system that keeps showing us over and over again that it is deadly to be Black and pregnant in this state, where access to care is so far out of reach for so many people, and the limitations and the criminalization that we are constantly navigating now with this abortion ban is something that Georgians did not want, and it\u2019s something that we are constantly doing all that we can to push back against.\nAdriana deserved to be here. What we know about her story is that she did what she knew what to do as a nurse. When she found out and she could feel in her own body that something was wrong, she went to the doctor. She went to get the care that she needed, and she was sent home. Now, if the doctors would have been \u2014 did everything they could, maybe we would have been able to get a different outcome for Adriana. But, unfortunately, that\u2019s not what happened, because, unfortunately, that\u2019s not what happens for so many Black women in this country. They are not trusted when they are going into their doctor\u2019s offices. They\u2019re not trusted when they are saying that there\u2019s something wrong with their bodies. They\u2019re not trusted when they are saying that they need access to care. And, unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened to Adriana.\nAnd so, now her family is battling such a hard time. They should be able to grieve. They should be able to take care of themselves and all of the family members who are having to deal with this ordeal. But, unfortunately, they\u2019re having to navigate so many unanswered questions. They\u2019re having to navigate something they shouldn\u2019t have to, which is an abortion ban that\u2019s connected to this issue, that should not even be at play at this particular moment.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And in Georgia, we\u2019re talking about one of the states that has among the worst maternal and infant mortality rates in the country, particularly for African American women and children. Could you talk about that?\nMONICA SIMPSON: Absolutely. We are dealing in Georgia with maternal health deserts, right? Over half of our counties do not have access to an OB-GYN, so care is out of reach for so many. We are also a state that has yet to expand Medicaid, and we know, federally, we are still fighting for Medicaid to be something that Americans have access to, which means that there are thousands of people upon thousands of people who are falling in the cracks every single day, not having access to basic healthcare needs. So, when you add that to a state that has now put a six-week abortion ban in place, it makes it a very, very harsh environment for folks to be able to get access to what they need in terms of their reproductive healthcare.\nAMY GOODMAN: I mean, it is amazing. Georgia\u2019s Attorney General Chris Carr released a statement declaring that the six-week abortion ban doesn\u2019t require medical professionals to keep women alive on life support after they\u2019ve been declared brain dead, Monica.\nMONICA SIMPSON: What I find very interesting about the times that we are in is that this abortion ban has created so many obstacles for people. There has been too many people who have tried to figure out what it means, when it means that, and that is the problem that we\u2019re dealing with here. It is not cut and dry. It is not black and white. It is something that we\u2019re having to constantly navigate over and over again.\nAt the end of last year, we lost two more Black women because of what this abortion ban put in place for them in terms of a barrier. We lost Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, right? These are two Black women who were also pregnant in our state that wanted to terminate a pregnancy and came up against the very real barriers that this abortion ban puts in place for folks.\nAnd so, what is happening constantly, as we are getting these stories, as we\u2019re understanding what the landscape is really looking like for people in Georgia because this abortion ban is in place, is that it is not a cut and dry \u2014 we\u2019re not getting cut-and-dry answers here. We are dealing with folks who are in real time having to navigate too many questions, whenever it should be that we should have access to the real-time healthcare that we need in order for us to be able to thrive and to live our most healthy lives in Georgia. And that is not the case with this abortion ban that is currently in place.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "NPR sued U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday over his recent executive order aiming to end federal funding for the outlet, a move that the lawsuit calls an illegal attack that \u201cthreatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.\u201d\nColorado Public Radio, KSUT Public Radio, and Roaring Fork Public Radio joined NPR in filing the legal challenge, which also names White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\u201cThe order is unlawful in multiple ways,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIt flatly contravenes statutes duly enacted by Congress and violates the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause by disregarding Congress\u2019 express commands. It also violates the First Amendment\u2019s guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.\u201d\n\u201cThe order aims to punish NPR for the content of news and other programming the president dislikes and chill the exercise of First Amendment rights by NPR and individual public radio stations across the country,\u201d the suit continues. \u201cThe order is textbook retaliation and viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s May 1 executive order instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which is funded by Congress, to end both direct and indirect funding to NPR and PBS, accusing the outlets of \u201cbiased and partisan news coverage.\u201d\nThe lawsuit demands court action barring the Trump administration from implementing the president\u2019s order.\nRoughly 1% of NPR\u2019s funding comes directly from the federal government, and its member stations across the U.S. receive around 10% of their funds from the CPB. NPR says more than 43 million Americans consume its articles, podcasts, and other content on a weekly basis.\nKatherine Maher, NPR\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement Tuesday that Trump\u2019s order \u201cis a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment\u2019s protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press.\u201d\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has ruled numerous times over the past 80 years that the government does not have the right to determine what counts as \u2018biased,'\u201d said Maher. \u201cNPR will never agree to this infringement of our constitutional rights, or the constitutional rights of our member stations, and NPR will not compromise our commitment to an independent free press and journalistic integrity.\u201d\nPress freedom organizations have issued dire warnings about the consequences of federal funding cuts for NPR and PBS, arguing they could result in the closure of hundreds of local radio and television stations nationwide.\n\u201cThe harm of these cuts will disproportionately befall rural American communities,\u201d a coalition of advocacy groups wrote in a letter to congressional leaders last month. \u201cLess densely populated parts of the country tend to have fewer options for reliable news sources. These markets are often less viable for commercial media, making it unlikely that the gap left by shuttered public media stations will be adequately filled.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Officers are arresting people after hearings and putting them into expedited proceedings that do not require a judge.",
        "Content": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested 11 people after their court hearings at the San Diego Immigration Court on Thursday as part of a nationwide operation launched this week to try to fast track deportations.\nBeginning Tuesday in courts including those in Santa Ana and Las Vegas, attorneys representing the U.S. government \u2014 who are also employed by ICE \u2014 requested that immigration judges close cases of some people who had been in the U.S. for less than two years and who had shown up without attorneys. Normally a closed immigration court case would mean that the government is no longer trying to deport someone. But instead, ICE officers waited outside courtrooms to arrest those people and put them into expedited proceedings that do not require a judge.\n\u201cGoing to immigration court is your chance to be heard,\u201d said Michelle Celleri, an attorney and legal rights director of Alliance San Diego. \u201cIt is your right. It is part of due process.\u201d\nCelleri said that arresting people who show up for their hearings would discourage others from coming to immigration courts.\nICE and the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the immigration court, did not respond to requests for comment from Beyond the Border. ICE has told other news outlets that it is detaining people who are subject to a fast-track deportation authority.\nThat fast-track deportation process is called expedited removal.\nIn expedited removal, an immigration officer, rather than a judge, gives the deportation order. In an executive order issued in January, President Donald Trump called for officers to use the process on anyone who has been in the U.S. for less than two years.\n\u201cWith expedited removal, they can deport them tonight,\u201d said Ginger Jacobs, a private immigration attorney in San Diego. \u201cThey\u2019re short-cutting the due process these folks came here to receive in immigration court.\u201d\nBut not everyone detained in San Diego on Thursday had closed cases. ICE arrested several people who had received future hearings dates from the immigration judges they appeared before, according to their attorneys and friends.\nRuth, a volunteer with the grassroots group Detention Resistance who asked not to be fully identified because of concerns about potential retaliation, said she had accompanied her friend, a man from Colombia who has been in the U.S. for just under a year, to court Thursday morning.\nShe said that when her friend left the courtroom to go to the bathroom, officers tried to detain him even though his hearing hadn\u2019t happened yet. During his hearing, Ruth\u2019s friend told the judge that he was afraid of being arrested when he went back outside the courtroom.\nThe judge told her friend that he wasn\u2019t affiliated with ICE and couldn\u2019t control what they did, Ruth said. Her friend turned in his asylum application, and the judge gave him another hearing date.\nWhen her friend left his hearing, ICE officers took him into custody.\n\u201cHe came in good faith keeping with his asylum process,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cNow we don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going to happen to him.\u201d\nRuth said her friend has been active in the San Diego community and getting involved as a volunteer to help others in need.\nTracy Crowley, an immigration attorney with Immigrant Defenders Law Center, took on Ruth\u2019s friend\u2019s case as he was being detained. She said she was still trying to figure out the legal reason for taking him into custody.\n\u201cIt\u2019s wild,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThe warrants are very bareboned and don\u2019t include the legal basis for detaining them.\u201d\nCrowley was among a group of lawyers who jumped in to try to represent people in their court proceedings throughout the day in an effort to avoid additional arrests.\nJacobs, the private immigration attorney, said her office took on four cases Thursday, including that of a young woman from Turkey who seemed terrified by the officers\u2019 presence.\nIn the afternoon, Jacobs helped a mother and her teenage son, quickly getting to know them in the courtroom in the moments before the hearing began. Outside in the hallway, more than 10 officers waited. ICE also called in two private security guards and two Federal Protective Services officers because of the presence of journalists, attorneys and community members documenting their actions in the hallway.\nAfter the family left the courtroom, ICE appeared to follow them to try to detain them. Jacobs followed after the officers, and she said that ICE decided to let the family go.\nJacobs said ICE let the family go because the son had accompanied his mother.\nICE officers in San Diego mistakenly attempted to arrest two additional people Thursday. The officers later acknowledged the error.\nIn one case, an attorney from the American Bar Association Immigration Justice Project accompanied his client out of the courtroom. When ICE moved to arrest the client, the attorney objected, asking to see a warrant.\nOfficers shoved themselves between the attorney and his client. Two officers took hold of the man and he ended up on the ground. Beyond the Border witnessed him begin to gasp for air and hyperventilate. The attorney asked to be allowed to help his client, but ICE officers kept him away.\n\u201cMay I please see a warrant because the warrant you provided is not that person,\u201d the attorney said after ICE showed him their documentation. \u201cYou are making an unlawful arrest.\u201d\nICE continued to keep him away from his client, saying that the man was having a medical emergency.\n\u201cHe\u2019s having a medical emergency thanks to you,\u201d the attorney replied.\nAnother attorney in the hallway called for an ambulance, and eventually ICE backed away from the man. The attorney helped his client down the hallway to the elevator, holding the man\u2019s arm over his shoulders to support his weight so that he could move away from the officers.\n\u201cI will help my client at this point,\u201d the attorney said as they left. \u201cYou guys have done enough.\u201d\nSeveral people who had accompanied family members to their hearings were left in the hallway in tears as they watched loved ones being taken away. Celleri worried about family members who weren\u2019t there and would have no way of knowing what had happened.\n\u201cFor those who are unrepresented, to their family they have just disappeared, and they are not going to know where they are for 48 hours \u2014 and that\u2019s if they know how to find them,\u201d Celleri said.\nOfficers told attorneys in the hallway that those arrested on Thursday would be taken to Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.\nLindsay Toczylowski, an attorney and CEO of Immigrant Defenders Law Center who was among the first to publicly call attention to the ICE operation, called the arrests a bait and switch.\n\u201cBy detaining people in courtrooms, we are discouraging people from doing what we have always asked them to do,\u201d Toczylowski said. \u201cWe have always stressed how important it is for people to show up to court, to avail themselves of the system to follow the rules that are set out.\u201d\nShe said courts in Santa Ana, Chicago, Phoenix and Miami also saw arrests this week.\nCelleri said people with upcoming hearings should know that if they don\u2019t come to court, they will likely be ordered deported in their absence.\nShe said that if ICE attempts to arrest someone, that person should make sure the officers have the correct name and that if that person has already paid bond to get out of immigration custody, the person should not be detained again.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Trump is underfunding FEMA, leaving states that rely on it dangerously unprepared for severe storms.",
        "Content": "With the official start of hurricane season less than a week away, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is facing a storm of its own.\nDonald Trump\u2019s administration has begun gutting the agency, slashing budgets and cutting staff. The president has made clear from the start of his term that he wants to shift the financial burden for disaster relief from the federal government to states \u2014 the same vision outlined in the far right Project 2025 playbook \u2014 if not eliminate FEMA entirely, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has pledged. While emergency management experts agree that states should play a role in funding their disaster relief efforts, recent government leaks have raised concerns that the Trump administration is leaving FEMA dangerously underfunded \u2014 and leaving the states that rely on it unprepared in the face of upcoming severe storms.\nIn a May budget draft, Trump proposed slashing FEMA grants by $646 million, even as the agency is projected to run out of disaster relief money by this summer for the third consecutive year. The administration also canceled a grant program called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, which funds community-level emergency preparedness efforts. The popular program had enjoyed bipartisan support.\nIn internal meetings, newly appointed FEMA head David Richardson admitted himself that the agency isn\u2019t ready for hurricane season. Like many of the efforts undertaken by the Trump administration this term, FEMA\u2019s transition to a \u201csmaller footprint\u201d has been hasty and disorganized. An internal review found that understaffing and other issues had derailed FEMA\u2019s usual processes for hurricane season preparedness. The agency is also scrambling as it adjusts to new leadership after the Trump administration fired acting FEMA head Cameron Hamilton earlier this month. The sudden firing was in response to Hamilton\u2019s public testimony at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing, during which he said he does not \u201cbelieve it is in the best interests of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later told reporters that Hamilton had been dismissed because he said \u201csomething that was contrary to what the president believes.\u201d\nScientists say that warming ocean temperatures are causing more intense and destructive hurricanes. And many months later, states are still reeling from last year\u2019s devastating season: In North Carolina, where Hurricane Helene killed at least 100 people last September and caused nearly $60 billion in damage, residents and town leaders are still waiting for disbursements of federal funds. Data released this month by North Carolina\u2019s Office of State Budget Management found that $5.95 billion has been allocated by federal and state governments for Helene recovery \u2014 only about 10 percent of the total amount needed to rebuild homes and public infrastructure. But just because money has been earmarked doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s been disbursed. \u201cThe money is there,\u201d Zeb Smathers, the mayor of Canton, North Carolina, told The Charlotte Observer. \u201cIt\u2019s the will to act. I\u2019m very tired of excuses.\u201d\nIn April, FEMA denied North Carolina\u2019s request for the federal government to continue matching 100 percent of the state\u2019s spending on Helene debris removal for another six months. \u201cThe need in western North Carolina remains immense \u2014 people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,\u201d North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement. \u201cI am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA\u2019s bad decision, even for 90 days. Six months later, the people of western North Carolina are working hard to get back on their feet; they need FEMA to help them get the job done.\u201d\nIt\u2019s clear that FEMA needs reforms. Bureaucratic red tape and procedural lags have left vulnerable people in limbo. Ironically, as the Trump administration has preached streamlining the agency, a memo obtained by southwest Virginia outlet Cardinal News outlined new, additional \u201cmanual review processes\u201d implemented by FEMA that were slowing Helene recovery efforts in the region. John Scrivani, the acting state coordinator of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) wrote to local emergency managers on April 11, that FEMA had provided \u201crevised guidance\u201d on how documentation should be submitted for grant programs. After submitting the requested documentation, Scrivani wrote, VDEM still had not received feedback from FEMA, leaving the state agency without guidance as it awaited payment for a range of disaster reimbursements and emergency preparedness funds \u2014 seven months after the storm.\n\u201cUnfortunately, at this time, we do not have an update as to when and if these funds will be made available,\u201d wrote Scrivani. \u201cWe are asking for your patience and understanding as we navigate this together.\u201d\nIn a statement to Cardinal News, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) voiced his opposition to the new procedures, noting that allocated federal funds had already undergone a thorough review process. \u201cFEMA and DHS\u2019s announcement to conduct additional reviews of grants, including for emergency management and disaster assistance, is ridiculous. These communities need funding as soon as possible, and the Trump Administration is unnecessarily making it harder for these communities to rebuild,\u201d said Kaine.\nSimilarly, in North Carolina, state lawmakers are wrangling over what to do as they await clarity on federal relief funds. \u201cThe continual line from the Republicans in the North Carolina legislature is \u2018Well, we got to wait and see what the feds are going to do,\u2019\u201d North Carolina Rep. Eric Ager told The Assembly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing that for six months now, right? And it\u2019s still not completely clear what the feds are gonna pay for and what they\u2019re not.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "In recent years, a growing number of nonprofits have turned to advancing technologies to document methane emissions.",
        "Content": "When Sharon Wilson arrives on site at an oil and gas facility in Texas, it\u2019s the smell that often greets her first. An odor similar to rotten eggs or a mechanic shop can come from toxic pollutants emitted during fossil fuel production, like hydrogen sulfide and benzene. But Wilson is also there to capture an invisible, odorless pollutant: methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can only be seen through her optical gas imaging camera.\nWilson and her crew at advocacy nonprofit Oilfield Witness are called \u201cmethane hunters\u201d \u2014 but she simply points her camera at an oil and gas facility and can see a black cloud on screen as the instrument picks up hydrocarbons absorbing infrared in real time.\n\u201cThe oil and gas industry says \u2018Look, you can see our site \u2014 you can\u2019t see anything.\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWell, yeah, you can with one of those cameras.\u201d\nIn recent years, a growing number of nonprofit organizations and non-governmental initiatives have turned to advancing technologies to document methane emissions on their own. As methane emissions pose an increasing threat to the climate amid the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory rollbacks and attempts to gut federal emissions tracking, those groups are grappling with what their work will mean in the years to come.\nScientists and government bodies say reining in methane releases from fossil fuel facilities, which make up about a third of global methane emissions from human activity, is crucial to limiting irreversible climate change. Methane is a powerful climate pollutant \u2014 more than 80 times more potent at warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over the span of 20 years. Across the United States, it\u2019s emitted from an ever-expanding web of oil and gas projects, including nearly a million active oil and gas wells, along with pipelines, compressor stations, export facilities, and underground storage and transportation lines. One of the biggest sources is abandoned coalmines and oil and gas wells, according to the latest Global Methane Tracker report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nAlthough countries and companies have the tools to reduce methane emissions at low or no cost \u2014 and many have pledged to do so \u2014 the implementation of mitigation measures is \u201cweak,\u201d and record fossil fuel production has kept those emissions high, the IEA found. The agency further noted that \u201cwithout targeted action on methane, the risks of severe climate damage increase considerably.\u201d\nPart of the problem is that methane emissions have long gone undercounted \u2014 oil and gas companies may be emitting up to three times the amount of methane estimated in records they provide to federal regulators. Under the Trump administration, those companies could be exempt from having to provide any records at all. The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to get rid of most reporting requirements under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which once obtained publicly available data from thousands of polluting facilities across the country. For the first time in nearly three decades, the EPA did not publish its mandatory annual report on national greenhouse gas emissions this year.\nNow, some of the third parties tracking methane emissions are optimistic that they are well primed to help fill in those gaps and work with companies to change their ways. Other watchdogs are expressing alarm over the implications of evaporating federal standards and oversight, which some say were already inadequate to manage pollution from increasing fossil fuel projects.\nAs the EPA stops tracking greenhouse gas emissions, state and local regulators may have no choice but to turn to independent emissions databases for information. One example is Climate TRACE, a global nonprofit coalition that uses satellites and other remote sensing technologies to provide an emissions inventory for states, municipalities, sectors, and corporations worldwide. \u201cClimate TRACE is increasingly going to be able to continue to provide emissions estimates for every facility in America if other data sources shut down,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, one of the coalition\u2019s founders.\nMcCormick said his group works with big tech and car companies looking to reduce emissions in their supply chains, and anticipated more interest in his database from private companies across polluting sectors. \u201cThere are more and more emissions reducing opportunities that are actually really good business,\u201d he said, adding that methane leaks in particular are an easy fix. \u201cThe ongoing increase in oil and gas has a very different carbon footprint depending on what we do with methane.\u201d\nThe technology for pollution tracking is more sophisticated than ever, with new satellite programs like the Environmental Defense Fund\u2019s (EDF) MethaneSAT and Carbon Mapper able to measure methane emissions and leaks from wide regions and specific infrastructure across the globe. At the Society for Environmental Journalists conference in April, scientists from EDF and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) spoke to reporters about the advancing ability of those satellites to document companies\u2019 changing methane emissions over time.\n\u201cIn order to address methane emissions we needed to understand where those emissions were and how much those emissions were, and we had no data \u2014 nobody had data,\u201d said Steve Hamburg, the lead scientist for MethaneSAT at EDF. With satellites tracking methane pollution, he explained, \u201cwe don\u2019t have to take anyone\u2019s word for it, we can independently validate it. Every major company knows that\u2019s going to be happening whether they want it or not, around the world.\u201d\nDeborah Gordon, senior principal in RMI\u2019s Climate Intelligence Program, who began her career at Chevron, said she believed better methane tracking would lead oil and gas companies to fix their leaks. \u201cGas is a commodity,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to leak the product that they can sell. There\u2019s real value in these companies understanding what they\u2019re losing and burning up in smoke, and also reputational risk.\u201d\nOther groups in the methane tracking space are more skeptical that documenting emissions alone could lead the fossil fuel industry to adequately police itself. \u201c[Satellite] data is sold to the industry,\u201d Wilson, of Oilfield Witness, wrote in a blog post. \u201cSo if they were going to stop methane by using satellite data, methane levels would be going down right now, as the industry has access to the best data available. Unless we stop drilling new holes, satellites are just another delay tactic.\u201d\nThe companies are \u201cnot necessarily bound to social responsibility, and never were,\u201d said Josh Eisenfeld, oil and gas research and accountability manager at Earthworks, a nonprofit group that advocates for communities impacted by fossil fuel pollution.\nLike Oilfield Witness, Earthworks uses optical gas imaging cameras to capture methane emissions and other toxic pollutants at oil and gas facilities across the country, then uses its data to submit complaints to the relevant regulatory authority. According to Eisenfeld, state regulators often have limited resources to monitor the complex web of polluting fossil fuel infrastructure in so many communities. On-the-ground monitoring can help them precisely detect a faulty point at a facility where methane is leaking. \u201cWe like to think we\u2019re helping them be more efficient,\u201d he said.\nWhile Earthworks is working to alert state regulators, the group is limited in what it can do without cooperative federal oversight. The Trump administration is undoing Biden\u2019s federal fee on methane emissions and requirements for addressing leaks and phasing out routine flaring, which would have created uniform, stricter standards across the country. \u201cThe same companies that said they supported methane rules that were introduced by the Biden administration are now silent as these rules are rolled back and as their requirements to report how much they pollute are nixed,\u201d Eisenfeld said.\nThe American Petroleum Institute, meanwhile, has reversed its earlier support for the rule \u2014 calling it a \u201cpunitive tax on American energy production that stifles innovation\u201d after it was repealed by a newly Republican-controlled Congress in February.\nMore than half of the hundred largest onshore oil and gas producers in the United States have no public commitments to reducing methane pollution, while others have quietly delayed or rescinded those commitments, according to a recently updated database by Earthworks and the advocacy nonprofit Gas Leaks. Exxon, for instance, dropped references to absolute methane emissions reductions in its latest corporate reporting after claiming two years earlier that the company planned to achieve an \u201cabsolute reduction in methane emissions by 70%\u201d by 2030. \u201cEven the commitments that they claimed in the past had no real legal requirements attached to them,\u201d said Eisenfeld.\nThe gap in federal oversight could also be filled by third-party monitoring initiatives with very different motivations from those watchdogs. Oil and gas companies are now working with firms to monitor and \u201ccertify\u201d their gas as low on methane emissions, allowing it to be sold by gas utilities at a premium. But their methodologies \u2014 which can include continuous emission monitoring systems \u2014 can vary vastly in effectiveness, depending on connectivity issues and the number and placement of monitors a firm chooses to use on site.\nOne of those firms is Project Canary, a leading gas certification company whose CEO has stated that \u201cwe are going to be able to solve climate change with measurement.\u201d The company sells its own continuous emission monitoring systems to the companies it certifies.\nAccording to two reports published by EarthWorks and environmental advocacy nonprofit Oil Change International, Project Canary\u2019s monitors in Colorado regularly missed methane pollution events from oil and gas operations due to their placement and their tendency to be offline. Project Canary claimed it was not certifying the sites referenced in the reports. Earthworks stands by their findings, and says they are still awaiting data from Project Canary to support that claim. Earthworks also says its report appeared to prompt revisions to air quality rules in the state.\nAnother gas certification initiative launched in partnership between RMI and developer SYSTEMIQ, MiQ, aims to create \u201ca financial incentive\u201d for producers to reduce their methane pollution by generating different price levels for oil and gas based on adherence to MiQ\u2019s standard of methane emissions management. \u201cThe future must be powered by 100% clean energy. MiQ\u2019s mission is to reduce the climate impact of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector until we get there,\u201d said Georges Tijbosch, MiQ\u2019s senior advisor, at the time of its launch.\nEven if methane emissions from the oil and gas sector were drastically reduced \u2014 they can\u2019t be eliminated entirely, as methane is the primary component in so-called \u201cnatural\u201d gas \u2014 the extraction and burning of fossil fuels creates a host of other public health and environmental hazards. Just this week, a new analysis found that Colorado oil and gas companies have secretly pumped at least 30 million pounds of chemicals into the ground over the past 18 months.\nAt the moment, there is a decline in pressure on the industry to curb its climate pollution in the U.S. The European Union is exploring loopholes for U.S. gas exports to comply with its methane emissions standards in order to avoid trade disputes with President Trump. The U.S. Interior Department is planning to fast track oil and gas project permitting procedures that could take multiple years to a maximum of 28 days. Even before the change in administration, oil companies headquartered in and outside the U.S. were \u201cretiring\u201d their climate commitments while ramping up fossil fuel production.\nEisenfeld warned that while \u201cwe need all of the tools in the toolbox to combat climate change, we also need to be honest about what each of those tools can do. Voluntary efforts by the fossil fuel industry, no matter what third party creates them, will always be limited by what the industry is willing to do voluntarily.\u201d\nWilson, a fifth-generation Texan, worked an office job as a contractor with major oil and gas operators for more than a decade before she quit and moved to Wise County, the birthplace of fracking. She began submitting open records requests to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) \u2014 and eventually bought her own optical gas imaging camera to document the pollution coming from oil and gas wells next to homes and schools. Wilson has faced ire from the industry after speaking out on her blog against the impacts of fracking \u2014 in one case, hundreds of her private emails were subpoenaed by oil and gas company Range Resources in a high-profile defamation lawsuit against a Texas couple who accused the company of polluting their groundwater.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sitting on the side of the road watching oil and gas make big messes for almost 30 years,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe have to continue to fight back against the industry\u2019s ongoing propaganda about how they have reduced emissions.\u201d\nWilson estimates having made nearly 500 complaints to the TCEQ, using the footage from her cameras as evidence. But the agency largely stopped responding to her requests, she said, even before the change in administration. The state doesn\u2019t have a specific rule targeting methane releases from oil and gas infrastructure, and sued the Biden administration for its methane rule when it was first published.\nBy documenting invisible pollution, Wilson hopes to expose what she sees as the biggest impediment to action: the industry\u2019s deceit about the harm its operations cause. \u201cI think that most people, if their lover lied to them at this level, their clothes would be out in the front yard on fire, and I think that that\u2019s where we need to get with the American public \u2014 they need to break up with the oil and gas industry,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best way for them to be empowered to do that is to understand the extent of lying and to actually see the pollution they are breathing, and it\u2019s everywhere.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "What happens when the most powerful people give up on the future \u2014 but still control the schools?\nTo understand what\u2019s happening in education today \u2014 the banning of books, the rise of AI that surveils and dehumanizes learning, the outlawing of honest lessons on race and gender, and the criminalization of critical thought \u2014 we must look beyond the classroom and name the dystopia being built around us.\nProphetic storytellers have long warned us about this moment. What once read as science fiction is fast becoming science nonfiction. In Parable of the Sower, Octavia Butler envisioned a nation unraveling under climate collapse and corporate rule, where the wealthy retreat to walled-off company towns protected by private security. Neill Blomkamp\u2019s film Elysium imagined a world where the elite flee the earth to an orbital fortress.\nWhat Butler and Blomkamp warned of in fiction, Naomi Klein and Astra Taylor now name in fact. In a searing essay for The Guardian, they call this era end times fascism: a grim convergence of white supremacist nationalism, billionaire bunker fantasies, apocalyptic Christian Zionism and a pandemic response that treats mass death as collateral for profit.\nAt the heart of this strategy is a billionaire exodus \u2014 a flight from accountability and from the world they set ablaze. Plutocrat preppers like Elon Musk envision colonizing Mars through SpaceX, building a self-sustaining city governed by AI and populated by a select few. Jeff Bezos talks of offloading Earth\u2019s industry to space. Peter Thiel has invested in luxury bunkers in New Zealand and backed \u201cseasteading\u201d projects aimed at building floating, privately governed city states in international waters beyond the reach of democratic regulation. This isn\u2019t science fiction. It\u2019s class war \u2014 the ultrarich abandoning the rest of us to climate collapse and surveillance capitalism, while shielding themselves behind fortress walls, digital firewalls and ideologies that sanctify abandonment.\nConsider the world they\u2019re trying to escape: 2024 was the hottest year ever recorded. Wildfires in Los Angeles revealed the scale of the unfolding climate catastrophe, causing rising sea levels, crop failures and mass displacement. The AI arms race is accelerating, with experts warning of mass labor displacement, autonomous weapons and systems beyond human control. Nuclear tensions are rising. And the U.S. government is funding the bombing of schools, universities, hospitals and mosques in Gaza \u2014 while punishing teachers who allow students to even debate the morality of genocide and ethnic cleansing in Palestine. Schooling is being recast as a tool not just for compliance and surveillance, but for instilling hopelessness and surrender.\nThis is end times schooling \u2014 and we must decide whether to be its instruments or its interruption.\nArmageddon Academics\nIt\u2019s not just that schools are impacted by end times fascist policy; teaching young people to accept the end of the world is a prerequisite to bringing it about.\nThat means teaching students that history is made by elites, not everyday people; that the climate disasters they see either don\u2019t actually exist or are unstoppable; that unregulated AI is benevolent and beyond challenge; that genocide in Gaza is too \u201ccomplicated\u201d to name; and that questioning power is dangerous, while submission to it is safety.\nYou can see it in the criminalization of truth. Today, nearly half of U.S. public school students attend schools where teachers are banned from teaching honestly about race, gender or sexuality. Texas law prohibits teachers from giving credit for student civic engagement. The statute reads: \u201c[A] teacher may not require, make part of a course, or award a grade or course credit \u2026 for a student\u2019s \u2026 efforts to persuade members of the legislative or executive branch at the federal, state, or local level to take specific actions by direct communication.\u201d Laws like this are about crushing the idea that education can empower students to make change.\nYou can see it in the rise of AI tutors and scripted lessons that sever learning from human relationships. AI is being used to justify fewer teachers, larger class sizes and automated discipline \u2014 where algorithms decide who gets flagged, suspended or punished. The result is a digital caste system: Rich youth get mentorship and creativity; the rest get automation and monitoring.\nYou can see it in the crackdown on teaching and protesting the genocide in Gaza: educators disciplined, students arrested and campus groups disbanded for daring to name the violence.\nAnd you see it in what we could call \u201carmageddon academics\u201d: the near-total erasure of climate crisis education. For example, McDougal Littell\u2019s Modern World History limited climate change to just three paragraphs, claimed \u201cnot all scientists agree,\u201d and blamed the Global South for inaction \u2014 without quoting a single person affected by climate collapse.\nThis is schooling for extinction.\nThe fascist project has no room for young people who think critically, question authority, or imagine a world beyond border walls, binaries and bunkers.\nAn Unshakable Belief in the Future\nThe danger of naming end times fascism is that it can feel paralyzing, like the system is so powerful and cruel that resistance is futile. That\u2019s exactly the point. This project feeds on despair.\nThe antidote is not denial; it\u2019s defiant hope and collective action. As the editors of Rethinking Schools remind us, \u201cTo step into a classroom is to express confidence in young people\u2019s capacity to learn, to grow, to change, to make a difference \u2014 to do good in the world.\u201d\nWe need to say this out loud. Because everything about end times schooling tells young people their lives don\u2019t matter \u2014 that nothing they do will make a difference.\nBut history tells us otherwise.\nEvery major movement for justice \u2014 abolition, labor, civil rights, anti-colonial uprisings \u2014 was built during hard times, under hostile regimes. The Montgomery Bus Boycott began just months after Rosa Parks told fellow organizers she didn\u2019t believe anything big would happen in her city. Then she acted \u2014 and history turned. Before that, the 1936\u201337 Flint Sit-Down Strike erupted at the height of the Great Depression, when autoworkers faced brutal conditions and mass unemployment \u2014 and still seized General Motors\u2019 Fisher Body plants, holding them for 44 days until they forced the company to recognize their union.\nIf end times fascism tells students there\u2019s no future, we must teach as if the future is ours to shape. If schools are being weaponized to train youth for extinction, then education must become a form of survival \u2014 rooted in truth, care, resistance and imagination.\nAnd that kind of education is already happening \u2014 in walkouts for Gaza, in classrooms defying book bans, in radical reading groups and mutual aid projects. Just listen to Alex Ames, one of the founding members of the Georgia Youth Justice Coalition (GYJC), speaking at the \u201cOur Freedom to Learn\u201d forum hosted by HEAL Together:\nIt has been an incredible three years at GYJC since we first started building young people\u2019s power toward education justice and toward multiracial democracy. Just this spring, we defeated the largest voucher bill in Georgia\u2019s history. We stopped \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d legislation for the second time in two years \u2014 they keep coming back. We halted policies criminalizing librarians or banning gender-affirming medical care. And we won $25 million for public school counselors that our students need. And last year we halted every book ban in the state. \u2026 I also should mention we just won the largest public school budget in the entire history of the state of Georgia.\nThis is what end times fascists fear most: the imagination of a generation not willing to disappear quietly.\nEducating against end times schooling doesn\u2019t mean offering shallow optimism; it means helping students confront the world as it is \u2014 and insisting it doesn\u2019t have to stay that way.\nThe Struggle for New Beginnings\nIn their essay on end times fascism, Klein and Taylor invoke the Jewish tradition of Doikayt, Yiddish for \u201chereness\u201d \u2014 a call to stay and struggle for justice where you are, rather than escape to imagined sanctuaries.\nI share that ethic. But I\u2019d argue we can\u2019t fully commit to the here and now without first journeying through time and space, using the people\u2019s true futuristic technologies: memory, study and imagination.\nWe must travel back in time \u2014 through conversations with elders, research and engagement with study groups \u2014 to remember what has been stolen and to gather lessons from the people and movements who dared to fight back. Then we must travel to the future \u2014 through the power of radical imagination \u2014 to glimpse a world where housing is a right, where we feed people instead of bombing them, where freedom isn\u2019t gated, policed or sold. (If you need a high-powered time machine: the Zinn Education Project offers free people\u2019s history lessons; Molly Crabapple paints revolutionary futures into being; and Afrofuturists like Octavia Butler, Sun Ra and Ryan Coogler carry us forward beyond today\u2019s limits.) Only then can we return to the present, with new perspectives and strategies, ready to fight.\nBillionaires know this. That\u2019s why they are trying to smash the curricular \u201cflux capacitors\u201d of social justice classrooms \u2014 curricular devices that allow students to travel through history, with freedom to dream about the future and act in the present.\nThey know they cannot inflict end times fascism without turning classrooms into graveyards for hope. That\u2019s why they\u2019re attacking schools with such ferocity.\nBut if we refuse to surrender the schools, they cannot win.\nThe 2018\u201319 Red State Revolt showed us how to fight back. Educators in GOP-controlled states like West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona won dramatic gains by shutting down their entire school systems until funding for public education was substantially increased.\nThe Chicago Teachers Union\u2019s (CTU) recent contract victory shows what that resistance can build. CTU not only won higher wages, but also protections for teaching the truth about race, gender and sexuality; investments in housing and mental health; immigrant protections; and groundbreaking environmental initiatives, from installing solar panels to launching composting programs.\nThis is social justice unionism: bargaining for the common good.\nAnd here is the inconvenient truth for billionaires: even in their bunkers or space stations, they still need labor \u2014 because they won\u2019t be cleaning their shelters, caring for the sick, or repairing technology on their own.\nBut while billionaires need us, we don\u2019t need them.\nThe world would do quite well without them \u2014 and that means we hold power. We can refuse. We can refuse to code their surveillance, fly their rockets, or educate the next generation for extinction. That spirit lives in the growing call for a general strike in 2028. After its 2023 strike victory, the UAW aligned all contracts to expire on May Day and invited other unions to do the same. CTU\u2019s new contract expires in 2028 and they have joined with the UAW to launch an organizing initiative to prepare.\nWhile the oligarchs are doing everything they can to make this the era of end times fascism, we are not at the end; we are at the start of a process of revealing what this country truly is and what we must overcome to achieve a new beginning \u2014 the one our ancestors dreamed of and that our children deserve.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "If Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, settles a $20 billion lawsuit brought by U.S. President Donald Trump, it could face another lawsuit from a leading press freedom organization.\nThe Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF), a Paramount shareholder, notified company executives in a letter on Friday that a settlement with Trump \u201ccould amount to a bribe\u201d to the president and his administration \u201cfor their approving and not impeding\u201d a merger of Paramount and the entertainment company Skydance.\nFPF addressed its letter to Shari Redstone, Paramount\u2019s controlling shareholder. In recent weeks, Redstone \u2014 who stands to profit from federal approval of the merger \u2014 has come under fire for advocating a settlement with Trump and keeping tabs on CBS coverage of the president, who claims the outlet deceptively edited an interview it conducted with Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election.\nParamount\u2019s leadership has reportedly discussed settling the Trump lawsuit for up to $20 million. Redstone has privately pushed for a settlement in hopes that it will \u201cclear the way for the merger\u2019s approval,\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported last month.\n\u201cI am writing to demand that you institute an immediate litigation hold, as FPF plans to file a shareholder derivative lawsuit on behalf of Paramount in the event of a settlement by Paramount,\u201d wrote Seth Stern, FPF\u2019s director of advocacy. \u201cWe expect that other long-term shareholders will join the suit.\u201d\nFPF notes that a derivative lawsuit \u201cis a procedure that allows shareholders of a company to recover damages incurred due to impropriety by executives and directors.\u201d\n\u201cAny damages award would go to Paramount, not FPF,\u201d the group added.\nThe lawsuit warning comes after a trio of U.S. senators cautioned that Paramount \u201cmay be engaging in potentially illegal conduct\u201d by pursuing a settlement with Trump in exchange for approval of the Skydance merger.\n\u201cParamount appears to be attempting to appease the administration in order to secure merger approval,\u201d wrote Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in a May 19 letter to Redstone.\nInternally, Paramount executives have acknowledged that settling the Trump suit \u201ccould expose directors and officers to liability in potential future shareholder litigation or criminal charges for bribing a public official,\u201d the Journal reported in February.\nIn a statement on Friday, Stern said that \u201ccorporations that own news outlets should not be in the business of settling baseless lawsuits that clearly violate the First Amendment and put other media outlets at risk.\u201d\n\u201cA settlement of Trump\u2019s meritless lawsuit may well be a thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system,\u201d said Stern. \u201cNot only would it tank CBS\u2019s reputation but, as three U.S. senators recently explained, it could put Paramount executives at risk of breaking the law.\u201d\n\u201cOur mission as a press freedom organization is to defend the rights of journalists and the public, not the financial interests of corporate higher-ups who turn their backs on them. When you run a news organization, you have the responsibility to protect First Amendment rights, not abandon them to line your own pockets,\u201d Stern added. \u201cWe hope Paramount will reconsider the dangerous path it appears to be contemplating but, if not, we are prepared to pursue our rights as shareholders. And we hope other Paramount shareholders will join us.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "Sandra Anderson didn\u2019t think the storm would be too bad. When her grandchildren asked if the dogs should be brought in, Anderson demurred, saying they\u2019d be fine. But later that night, an alert on her phone warned her of a tornado tearing through her hometown of London, Kentucky. Seconds later, it hit her neighborhood.\n\u201cI hollered for my handicapped son to hit the hallway,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWindows were exploding. There was such a horrifying howl before it hit.\u201d\nTornadoes are measured using what\u2019s called the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which ranks them on a scale of 1 to 5 according to their wind speed and potential for damage. The mile-wide twister that blew out Anderson\u2019s windows and flattened entire neighborhoods traveled over 50 miles and clocked in at EF-4, making it a particularly violent one. Meanwhile, an EF-3 funnel cloud cut a 23-mile path through the St. Louis area.\nBoth were part of a broader system that stretched from Missouri to Kentucky, spawning over 70 tornadoes that killed at least 28 people and leveled or damaged thousands of structures. Eastern Kentucky bore the brunt of the fury; 18 people died there. Seven more were killed in Missouri.\nThe storms come as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration makes deep cuts to the National Weather Service, or NWS, and its parent organization, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Together, the two agencies provide accurate and timely forecasts to meteorologists and others and play a key role in forecasting tornadoes and warning people of impending danger. Meteorologists and other experts warn that the administration\u2019s cuts to the agency could cost lives.\nThe NWS has lost 600 people through layoffs and retirements, according to The New York Times, leaving many local weather stations scrambling to cover shortfalls. The office in Jackson, Kentucky, for example, is 1 of 8 nationwide to abruptly end 24/7 forecasting after losing an overnight forecaster, and it\u2019s now short about 31 percent of its staff. The Jackson office serves a large swath of eastern Kentucky, a rural region with patchy access to cell and internet that has been repeatedly battered by storms and floods over the past five years.\nAll of this comes as the private forecasting company AccuWeather warns that the United States is facing its worst tornado season in more than a decade.\nEven as the twister in eastern Kentucky passed, people began to speculate that NWS staffing cuts contributed to the death toll. Their suspicion stemmed from the tornado warning\u2019s upgrade to a Particularly Dangerous Situation, a designation reserved for particularly severe situations with an imminent threat to life and property. That warning, meant to convey the need to take cover immediately, came shortly before the tornado touched down at around 11:07 p.m., several officials told Grist.\nThat designation, called a PDS, came after the popular YouTube forecaster Ryan Hall Y\u2019all, who is based in eastern Kentucky, urged everyone in the storm\u2019s path to seek shelter around 10:45 p.m. Local television news meteorologists did so about the same time. \u201cWe just have to hope we\u2019re doing a good job of getting that message out there because otherwise nobody would know,\u201d Hall, who does not have formal meteorology training, told his audience around 10:54 p.m.\nAlthough the NWS issued 90 alerts on May 16, including warnings about flash flooding and impending tornadoes, someone who identified himself as an NWS-trained weather spotter left a comment on Hall\u2019s feed saying the agency issued the PDS only after he raised the issue. \u201cI called the NWS in Wilmington, Ohio, who relayed my report to the Jackson weather office,\u201d he posted. \u201cA couple minutes after that, it was upgraded to a PDS confirmed by weather spotters.\u201d Many commenters credited Hall with saving lives.\nNeither Hall nor the commenter who identified himself as a weather spotter could be reached for comment. Chase Carson, a tourism commissioner in London, followed a forecasting livestream on Facebook as the storm developed. He spent the day after the twister volunteering at the city\u2019s emergency response center, responding to the crisis. \u201cYou have people who had nicer homes but still didn\u2019t think that the tornado was going to hit their area because we didn\u2019t receive enough warning prior,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a lot of X, Y, and Zs that went wrong to keep us from being able to be prepared.\u201d\nThe National Weather Service defended its handling of the storm and the timeliness of its warnings in Kentucky, telling Grist in a statement that its offices in Louisville, Jackson, and Paducah \u201cprovided forecast information, timely warnings, and decision support in the days and hours leading up to the severe weather on May 16.\n\u201cInformation was conveyed to the public through multiple routine means, including official products, social media, and NOAA Weather Radio, as well as to partners through advance conference calls and webinars. As planned in advance, neighboring offices provided staffing support to the office in Jackson, Kentucky. Additionally, the Jackson office remained fully staffed through the duration of the event using surge staffing. Weather forecast offices in the central region continue to evaluate storm damage and other impacts from this tragic event.\u201d\nTom Fahy, the legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees\u2019 Organization, said the offices were fully staffed and that weather forecasting offices in multiple cities typically collaborate when extreme weather is expected. \u201cPeople make sacrifices,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the night off, you got to come to work.\u201d According to Fahy, that\u2019s part of the life of service NWS forecasters sign up for \u2014 which might intensify as offices lose staff.\nPeople on the north side of St. Louis were equally suspicious of the NWS response after they did not hear warning sirens go off, even though the system had been tested the day before the tornado. However, the city runs that system and Mayor Cara Spencer blamed the problem on \u201chuman failure\u201d because the municipal emergency management protocol was \u201cnot exceptionally clear\u201d on who is to activate the system. To that end, the city tested the warning sirens again Tuesday and Wednesday, and Spencer issued an executive order placing the fire department in charge of activating the warning system.\nAliya Lyons only knew to take shelter thanks to the St. Louis University emergency alert system. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear any sirens,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that was a major failure on the city\u2019s part. Lives were lost. I can\u2019t say if it was entirely because of the sirens. But it\u2019s really heartbreaking \u2014 elders may not have a cellphone, cellphones might be dead.\u201d\nShe worries that the situation will only get worse; the Trump administration has proposed cutting NOAA\u2019s budget by more than 25 percent. \u201cEven with the current National Weather Service, horrible things can happen \u2014 now is not the time to gut them. We should be making it more robust.\u201d\nFahy said the NWS and its union are collaborating to realign staff to meet a \u201creduced service schedule.\u201d The expectation will be that stations will work together to fill in gaps as needed.\nThat may not do much to ease Bobby Day\u2019s mind. He is the interim police chief in London and worked with city officials and first responders on emergency planning days before the tornado. He\u2019s long counted on the NWS to do his job and is never without his NOAA weather radio. He still recalls a wild and destructive storm that hit London out of the blue on a clear night a few years ago. The agency\u2019s forecasts and warnings were essential in timing evacuations.\n\u201cAlmost to the minute they said it was going to happen, it happened,\u201d he said.\nNOAA and the National Weather Service may well continue to deliver that level of precision even as the Trump administration slashes its budget and staffing. But meteorologists and others who deal with extreme weather worry that the suspicion and speculation that followed the tornadoes will only mount, undermining confidence in the agencies even as they become more vital to public safety. This frustrates Jim Caldwell, a meteorologist at local station WYMT-TV, who worries people will turn away from reputable, if strained, resources in favor of social media personalities like Hall \u2014 although Caldwell did not specifically mention him by name. Some of them are good forecasters, he said, but others favor sensationalization to calm preparation in a bid to gain viewers or virality.\n\u201cWith the uprise of social media and these fake weather people out there in the weather world that are not real,\u201d he said, \u201cwe need more assistance from the government to issue warnings, issue watches, and to make sure that these hype-casters are cut off because we need an official word.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared in Grist.\nGrist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

        "Summary": "Editor Malu Halasa discusses the poetry and art of steadfast survival documented in \u201cSum\u016bd: A New Palestinian Reader.\u201d",
        "Content": "Part of the Series\nStruggle and Solidarity: Writing Toward Palestinian Liberation\n\u201cSum\u016bd, the process of steadfastness, of survivance, is not just a project of survival, but also one of remembrance, record-keeping, and revitalization,\u201d write Malu Halasa and Jordan Elgrably in the introduction to Sum\u016bd: A New Palestinian Reader (Seven Stories Press). The world has now witnessed sum\u016bd at its most tenacious, as Palestinians hold on to life, dignity and a centuries-old culture amid an onslaught that threatens their survival. The book\u2019s collections include some of the most incisive political commentary, moving poetry and arresting art coming from Palestine. The intellectual and cultural richness that has been erased by decades of misrepresentation and silencing shines through on every page.\nIn addition to her work on Sum\u016bd, Malu Halasa is curating the \u201cArt of the Palestinian Poster\u201d exhibition at the P21 Gallery in London during the city\u2019s \u201cShubbak: A Window from Contemporary Arab Cultures\u201d festival.\nIn this exclusive interview, the anthology\u2019s co-editor Malu Halasa discusses the importance of art to the Palestinian struggle, how Israel has targeted Palestinian writers and artists, and how a new generation of activists is using art as part of their nonviolent resistance. The following transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nPeter Handel: Your new book, Sum\u016bd: A New Palestinian Reader, brings together essays, fiction, poetry and art primarily by Palestinian writers. What does sum\u016bd mean and why did you choose it as the title?\nMalu Halasa: As a younger generation comes to the issues of, for and about Palestine, recent discussions have been taking place about the \u201cacceptability\u201d of violent resistance. The argument for violence plays into Israel\u2019s insistence that Palestinians are \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2014 despite a backdrop of Israeli assassination and historic targeting of moderate Palestinian voices.\nThe Arabic word sum\u016bd is often translated as \u201csteadfastness\u201d or \u201cstanding fast.\u201d It is, above all, nonviolent resistance.\nThe introduction to our anthology Sum\u016bd begins by quoting Palestinian author and human rights lawyer Raja Shehadeh, from Ramallah: \u201cSum\u016bd has \u2018been practiced by every man, woman and child here struggling on his or her own to learn to cope with, and resist, the pressures of living as a member of a conquered people.\u2019 Sum\u016bd is both a personal and collective commitment; people determine their own lives, despite the environment of constant oppressions imposed upon them.\u201d\nIn creative expression, the Palestinian people have agency. Through arts, literature and culture, Palestinian writers, artists and cultural practitioners speak for themselves, and the philosophy and lived experience of sum\u016bd has been essential to this. So it is important for me, as someone who has written about Palestine for nearly 30 years, to champion literary, artistic, dissident and queer Palestinian voices in this \u201cNew Reader,\u201d particularly for a generation seemingly coming to the struggles of Palestine for the first time. It is also important to show that ongoing resistance has been taking place since 1948, and that violence is not the only way that people take a stance and advance the cause of social justice in their lives.\nYou write, \u201cArt was and still is perceived as a threat to the Israel authorities. In the West Bank and Gaza in the 1970s and 1980s, there were no official galleries, and artists showed their work in schools, churches, and town halls. The popularity of these exhibitions among ordinary Palestinians also drew an unexpected audience\u201d \u2014 the Israeli military. How have Palestinian artists been persecuted and how have they managed to work despite it?\nAn example of sum\u016bd is the art of the Vera Tamari, particularly a 2002 art installation called \u201cGoing for a Ride?\u201d which she did during the Israeli invasion of Ramallah when Israeli military tanks rolled down the streets of Ramallah and crushed the parked cars in their way. (Remember, former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon enlarged the streets of Gaza City so they were wide enough for Israeli Merkavas.) Tamari took these wrecked cars off the streets of Ramallah and arranged them in an art exhibition on the edge of a school playing field. It had been so busy during the exhibition\u2019s opening (and remember this was taking place during an Israeli incursion), the artist only had time to take two pictures of the installation. That evening, Israeli tanks came upon the installation, rolled many times over the crushed cars forward and backward, crushing them more again. Then the soldiers got out of their tanks and urinated on the installation, activities Tamari who lived nearby was able to film. In Sum\u016bd we show the two photographs that Tamari took of her exhibition, alongside her other artwork.\nDuring this same invasion in 2002, artist Rula Halawani went out on the streets of Ramallah, and photographed corpses of Palestinians on the roads and pavement. She printed the negatives of the photographs and entitled them \u201cNegative Incursion.\u201d In some circumstances the act of bearing witness is radical resistance.\nIn the book, there are artists who have excavated the Palestinian experience. Taysir Batniji in his \u201cWatch Towers\u201d black-and-white photographic series documents Israeli watchtowers. For \u201c38 Days of Re-Collection,\u201d Steve Sabella photographed a Palestinian home abandoned in 1948, images of which he printed on fragments of walls or plaster from Old Jerusalem homes. The cover for Sum\u016bd was taken from Sabella\u2019s \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d series, which shows barbed wire.\nDuring this war on Gaza too, artists have responded with remarkable work; for example, Hazem Harb\u2019s charcoal drawings \u201cDystopia Is Not a Noun\u201d and his abstracted \u201cGauze\u201d series. There is a younger generation of artists as well: social documentary photographer Rehat Al Batniji and her portraits of Gazan fisher[folk]. Through artwork like this and more established artists such as Sliman Anis Mansour and his \u201cHomeland\u201d charcoal on acrylic painting showing the penning of Palestinians crossing at Erez Checkpoint to Gaza, the Sum\u016bd anthology has the opportunity to show and discuss occupation, apartheid and colonial settlement and their effects on ordinary Palestinian lives.\nAlso, there is a greater story pertaining to the Palestinian flag: The periods when the Israeli authorities ban it or have allowed it to be shown; its banning on the internet and how the flag and the keffiyeh, both demonized, have been used by Palestinian artists, either outright or in the case of the flag, metaphorically through its colors. It is fascinating that the emblem of a \u201cnot yet official\u201d state has seemingly more power than flags belonging to official nation-states. On Sum\u016bd\u2019s back cover is a watermelon fresco from a villa in Nazareth that was documented by the Gazan artist Hazem Harb, who writes in the book about the arrest and beating up of this father by the Israeli military in Gaza City and the urgency Harb feels as he makes art during genocide.\nYou include a number of poets in Sum\u016bd. Talk about the importance of poetry in Palestinian culture.\nThere are many books on the politics of Palestine, and most of them, usually by political pundits or academics, concentrate on the \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d of the Middle East. By encountering Sum\u016bd\u2019s firsthand accounts of Palestinian memoir, artists\u2019 motivations behind the artwork, and the critical analysis that challenges Israeli propaganda, readers have the opportunity to break from the usual Palestinian stereotypes that populate mainstream press and media. Poetry too provides a glimpse into the Palestinian psyche. All of us will remember the words of Refaat Alareer who allegedly received a phone call from the Israeli military saying they were going to kill him and they did \u2014 in an airstrike in 2023. Alareer had written:\nIf I must die\nYou must live\nto tell my story\nPoetry speaks not to the mind but the heart. Hopefully those who have hardened themselves to Palestine will hear the words of these precious, young poets.\nHow do you think the world\u2019s understanding of the Palestinians\u2019 plight has changed since Israel\u2019s latest attack on Gaza?\nI can only answer this question through my own experience as a writer and reporter on the Middle East. There has definitely been a generational change in terms of attitude toward Palestine. Nineteen-seventy was one of the first times I went to Jordan-Syria-Lebanon to report a big story. This was during the Lebanese civil war, and I had been working at Rolling Stone magazine. I returned with an interview with Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, which had been difficult to get in war-torn Beirut. Absolutely no one was interested.\nI spent the next 10 years working as a music journalist. By then I had moved from New York and was covering rap in Britain. It was the hundreds of hours I spent interviewing Public Enemy and writing on Black American history that I started thinking about my own family culture, and the stories I wanted to tell from my experience and background. The Jordanian side of the family has strong ties to the Palestinian struggle, with members of our extended family in the West Bank. Family stories eventually became the basis for my debut novel Mother of All Pigs, a fictional account of my uncle who had raised pigs in the mountains of Jordan. But again, I had tried to publish a draft of the novel in the early 1990s, and nobody was interested. Time has changed all of that.\nIn my own writing about Palestine, I remember I had become obsessed with water as a civil rights issue for Palestinians. After traveling and reporting in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Israel, I wrote a feature-length piece about water shortages and permaculture in Palestine. Essentially to make the desert green, the Israelis draw precious water from underground aquifers beneath the West Bank, grow avocados and herbs, which they sell through major U.K. supermarkets to essentially water-rich nations.\nHowever, that year, 1998, there had been a drought in Britain. Despite the fact that a mainstream newspaper had contributed to the finances of my trip, once it rained in Britain, the newspaper editor no longer wanted the story. It was these kinds of scenarios that someone like me with an interest in reporting from and about the Middle East for the mainstream media regularly encountered. This is how it was, and in many ways this situation hasn\u2019t changed. We only hear or read about the region when it\u2019s at war.\nSo against this backdrop of indifference The Markaz Review has emerged as an important publication. In the mid-2000s, when I was the managing editor for the book imprint belonging to a Dutch cultural fund, I came to understand that cultural expression can be a platform for authentic, non-elitist voices from the Global South. I then started co-editing and producing wide-ranging anthologies, initially featuring new writing and images from Beirut and Tehran, and then later from the Syrian revolution and more recently the women\u2019s protests in Iran. When the war on Gaza started in 2023, I started talking to Markaz\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Jordan Elgrably about producing a \u201cPalestinian Reader,\u201d for all the reasons I\u2019ve discussed above.\nIn my decades of writing about the Middle East, whether through the prisms of politics or culture, I never thought I would see this groundswell support for the Palestinian cause in my lifetime. The Israelis remain adept at controlling the narrative and shutting down criticism of their brutal occupation and disenfranchisement of the Palestinian people. Today, we\u2019re seeing the effects of right-wing, pro-Israeli groups on the Trump administration: the arrest and threatened deportation of pro-Palestinian students from the U.S. and the intimidation of anti-Zionist Jewish voices.\nThe one thing Israel and the U.S. administration cannot control are the stories of genocide and starvation that continue to come out of Gaza. All over the world, shocking images appear in real time on people\u2019s phones. These are the truths that cannot be hidden, ignored or denied.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Some states are allowing private companies to decide which people in prison are allowed to contact their family members.",
        "Content": "Some states\u2019 departments of corrections are outsourcing to private companies their decision-making about who can and who cannot communicate with people in their prisons. These decisions cut families and loved ones off, sometimes permanently.\nThe Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) has said it does not maintain any records of who has been blocked from communications with people incarcerated in the state. According to the department, these lists are maintained by the private company Securus, which manages phone, e-messaging and video calls for the state.\nIn a denial of an open records request submitted by Truthout, the department said: \u201cThe records you request from the Securus messaging system are not public records, created, used or maintained by the department and; therefore, are not disclosable under the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56. You may submit your request directly to Securus.\u201d Neither Securus nor its parent company Aventiv responded to any requests from Truthout for further information.\nAs a private company, Securus is not subject to open records laws in Washington State or anywhere else in the U.S. Prisons are public agencies, and increasing privatization of communications options has contributed to decreased transparency.\nCommunication in Prison Is Tightly Restricted\nPeople in prison exist in a state of highly restricted communication with the outside world. They cannot have cellphones or access the internet. They can place outgoing phone calls but cannot receive calls, and they can exchange e-messages accessed at a kiosk or on an individual tablet. Unlike email, each of these messages costs money to send and they require both parties to have an account with the messaging service.\nPhone and messaging services in prisons across the country are managed by private companies like Aventiv and Global Tel Link. These companies charge people in prison and their loved ones up to 50 cents per message for their services. Out of these fees, they also often offer a commission back to the prison itself, creating a system in which both the state and the private company make money off some of the poorest people in the U.S.\nThe same companies provide video call services (also for a fee), which in many facilities have been allowed to replace in-person visitation. Increasingly, the ability to receive snail mail from loved ones has been restricted as well; since 2017, at least 16 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons have moved to scanning all incoming mail and providing recipients with the electronic scan in lieu of the original paper. People in prison have spoken extensively about how they are harmed by this practice, which eliminates the smells and physical traces of their loved ones from letters and replaces it with a sometimes inadequate scan. Mail scanning creates a massive surveillance database, with few companies offering clarity on what happens to the private data collected or how long it is retained.\nIn all forms of communication, prison staff insist they \u201chave to know who\u2019s on the other end,\u201d Jim Kopriva, spokesperson for the Washington Department of Corrections, told Truthout. From the prison\u2019s perspective, such monitoring is critical to catching and squashing criminal enterprises that are conducted from within the prison walls. This is why most prisons have strict rules prohibiting any third-party contact, meaning relaying a message to or from another person who is not directly on the phone, message or visit.\nPrivate Companies Take It Upon Themselves to Block Consumers\nKnowing who is \u201con the other end\u201d means the prison also maintains control over who can (and cannot) communicate with people in prison. Certain people outside the prison are blocked from communicating directly, as a result of rule violations, court orders and sometimes even administrative mistakes.\nTake third-party contact: Since incarceration disproportionately impacts Black and poor communities, it is likely that many people know more than one person in prison. Prison rules in Washington (DOC policy 200.00) dictate that outside supporters can only deposit money to one account, punishing those with more than one loved one inside. The rule forces people to choose who they can support or risk running afoul of the rules and being blocked altogether.\nSimilarly, nonprofits and advocates who communicate with large rosters of people in prison, often sharing vital information or doing essential newsgathering, are open to being blocked altogether if prison officials decide that their activities constitute third-party contact.\nThe privatization of communications increases the risk of people being blocked with very little oversight. These companies directly advertise a set of automated tools to more effectively surveil and control communications. The contract between Securus and the Washington Department of Corrections, for example, says Securus offers software benefits such as the Threads application which \u201callows authorized users to analyze corrections and communications data to generate targeted investigative leads,\u201d and the \u201cInvestigator Pro\u201d application which \u201chelp[s] investigators find correlations among calls.\u201d\nOne prison staffer familiar with mail review procedures told Truthout that a lot of communication bans come \u201cfrom the company itself doing it instead of the facility doing it\u2026. Most people that were restricted come down to the company JPay actually restricting them.\u201d\nThe staff member, who spoke anonymously in order to protect their job, added that as a corrections officer reviewing e-messages, \u201cI couldn\u2019t even see who was restricted and who wasn\u2019t restricted.\u201d\nPeople Are Barred From Communication Without Any Information About Why\nThe process that occurs when someone is blocked is opaque. People on the outside are not always notified by the DOC when there is a problem, and there is no clear appeal process for those not within the system. Emails obtained by Truthout show officials at the Washington DOC acknowledging that the gap in their notification process is a problem, but Kopriva said he was not aware of any updated processes.\nWithout notification, people on the outside find that their messaging accounts just suddenly stop working. Answers from Aventiv, the parent company of both JPay and Securus, are very hard to come by. Typical of corporate helpdesks, these companies offer generic email addresses and 1-800 numbers for customers with any issue, including being blocked. Most responses are automated, and human assistance is tricky to obtain. In this author\u2019s experience, for example, the only way to be directed to a live person on the JPay helpline appeared to be pressing buttons on the automated phone tree for at least three minutes.\nWithout notification from the prison about what rules have been violated and what remedies are available, people can find themselves permanently blocked from contact with a loved one behind bars. The ability to communicate with loved ones, whether birth family or otherwise, has critical mental health impacts for those in prison and can even decrease violence within the prison. Permanently blocking contact with someone in the outside world can be extremely damaging, yet prisons are allowing private companies to do just that.\nPrisons Blame Drugs for Restrictions, But Prisons Do Little Else to Prevent Drug Abuse\nKopriva says the Washington Department of Corrections does everything it can to promote a \u201ccore mission of rehabilitation,\u201d and that \u201cincludes contact with the outside world and loved ones and support networks.\u201d This must be balanced, he told Truthout, with \u201cinterrupting negative behavior,\u201d and particularly reducing drug trafficking in the prison.\nKopriva says drug-running is the main reason that people who want to be in touch are blocked, citing specifically the skyrocketing rate of overdoses as a main concern. But others argue that there are many other actions the department could take to more effectively curb overdoses and drug use inside.\nA recent piece in the Prison Journalism Project describes addiction treatment in Washington State prisons as \u201cscarce and confusing.\u201d Treatment programs that are advertised are often hard to access in practice, with extremely limited availability. Another prison journalist, writing for Filter magazine, reported on the repeated failure of guards in his Washington State prison to use Narcan to reverse overdoses. The failures were due to a false belief that Narcan is not effective in the case of a fentanyl overdose (it is), lack of Narcan availability and a general hesitancy on the part of guards to administer the drug themselves.\nIn his discussion with Truthout, Kopriva highlighted Suboxone abuse as a major problem in prison. This is itself a demonstration of the prison\u2019s focus on control rather than safety and well-being: Suboxone is the prescription medication used to treat opioid addiction. It does not lead to overdoses, because it contains naloxone (Narcan) within it.\nPrison staff have a long history of overstating the benefits of mail scanning and other severe limitations to communication while providing little evidence of their success. A Prison Policy Initiative report shows that there is no solid evidence that mail scanning limits the flow of drugs or decreases the risks of overdose.

        "Summary": "Experts say it\u2019s past time to regulate &ldquo;forever chemicals&rdquo; as a class.",
        "Content": "Last week, environmental groups decried plans from the Environmental Protection Agency to rescind and \u201creconsider\u201d drinking water limits for four per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, compounds linked to cancer and damage to the immune and endocrine systems, among other health effects.\nThe limits had been finalized by Joe Biden\u2019s administration last April as part of an effort to limit people\u2019s exposure to hazardous \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d Out of a total of more than 10,000 known PFAS, they targeted just six of the most concerning ones. The Trump administration\u2019s EPA said it would retain the limits for two of the PFAS but give utilities more time to comply with them and scrap the others. One advocate called the EPA\u2019s move a loss for public health and a \u201cvictory for chemical companies.\u201d\nBut how protective were the Biden regulations to begin with? And how much of a difference will it make to pare them back?\nOn the one hand, experts agree that backtracking is not in the public\u2019s interest. Virtually everyone has PFAS coursing through their veins, and specific kinds like PFOS and PFOA are known or likely to contribute to kidney and testicular cancers. The other compounds originally regulated by the Biden administration have been linked to elevated cholesterol, heart disease, and an increased risk of diabetes.\nThe chemicals have become so ubiquitous in people and the environment because of their use in everything from outdoor clothing to cooking utensils and food packaging. Runoff from firefighting foam, infused with the chemicals, has contributed to widespread drinking water contamination, along with manufacturers\u2019 deliberate dumping of the chemicals into rivers \u2014 despite knowing about their health risks.\nOnce they\u2019re created, PFAS don\u2019t break down naturally; hence the moniker \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d Regulating them is an \u201cimportant win,\u201d experts have said, one that \u201callows the country to begin cleaning up the mess in its water.\u201d\nBut the fight over drinking water limits for individual PFAS distracts from the larger context that there are thousands of types, and scientists suspect they all have similar health effects. Even last year, when the Biden administration first announced its national drinking water standards, scientists criticized it for addressing PFAS on a chemical-by-chemical basis. \u201cThe EPA is trying to regulate six forever chemicals. Just 10,000 to go,\u201d as the title of an op-ed by one Harvard researcher put it.\nErik Olson, a senior strategist for the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the U.S. is \u201cstuck in a Whac-a-Mole game\u201d with PFAS, in which only the best researched compounds are regulated. Lesser-known compounds may be just as toxic \u2014 thanks to their similar chemical structures \u2014 but escape regulations just because they haven\u2019t been studied, he added. \u201cWhat we need to do is control PFAS as a class.\u201d\nOf the six forever chemicals targeted by the Biden administration\u2019s original policy, PFOA and PFOS are the most prevalent and, consequently, they\u2019ve been researched the most extensively. Those compounds got the strictest drinking water limits of 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level at which they can be detected, reflecting scientists\u2019 understanding that there is no safe exposure level for them. Three additional compounds \u2014 PFNA, PFHxS, and GenX \u2014 were given a contamination limit of 10 parts per trillion. Water utilities were instructed to use a \u201chazard index\u201d to monitor a sixth chemical, called PFBS, as well as mixtures of the chemicals.\nThe Trump EPA said it would keep the PFOA and PFOS drinking water limits but give utilities until 2031 to comply with them, instead of 2029. The rules for the other four compounds will be scrapped and reevaluated. The EPA said it intends to finalize its replacement regulations by next spring.\nA statement from EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the extended timeline for PFOA and PFOS would provide \u201ccommon-sense flexibility\u201d to utilities, some of which sued the EPA over its regulations last year. The utilities said the EPA\u2019s new rule was too strict and would cause unreasonable compliance costs.\nA spokesperson for the EPA told Grist that the process by which the agency had \u201cpromulgated the preliminary regulatory determinations simultaneously with the proposed regulation\u201d for PFNA, PFHxS, GenX, and PFBS under the Biden administration \u201cwas inappropriate and may not comply with the statutory requirements of [the] Safe Drinking Water Act.\u201d With regard to the rescissions, they said that \u201cwhile EPA cannot predetermine the outcome, it is possible\u201d that the agency will issue more stringent requirements this spring.\nDaniel Jones, an emeritus professor of molecular biology at Michigan State University, said the impacts of the Trump administration\u2019s reversal will depend on geography. Communities primarily affected by PFOS and PFOA may not be greatly affected, since the standards for those chemicals remain in place \u2014 albeit with an extended timeline for compliance. To meet the standards, water utilities will likely have to install something like an activated carbon filtration system, he said, which is effective at removing \u201clong-chain\u201d PFAS like PFOA and PFOS, which have a larger chemical structure than compounds like GenX.\nPutting these filtration systems into place will thankfully sweep up more PFAS than just PFOA and PFOS, Jones said.\nStates like North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia, however, face disproportionate contamination from GenX due to production facilities concentrated there. This contamination could continue unabated if the standard for the compound is eliminated. According to Olson, some of the technologies that remove PFOS and PFOA are not as effective at attracting GenX. \u201cTo really control the full suite of PFAS, we need to go to more advanced technologies like tight membranes, like reverse osmosis,\u201d he said.\nSome water utilities may opt for these more advanced \u2014 and expensive \u2014 technologies if they believe that they will eventually be required to test for and limit a much larger number of PFAS, Olson added.\nAlthough Jones is disappointed that the EPA intends to drop regulations for the four PFAS, he said he is more concerned about a single clause in the EPA\u2019s press release, about the EPA\u2019s intent to establish a \u201cfederal exemption framework\u201d for the PFOS and PFOA limits. The release contains no further information about what this would entail, but Jones worries it could allow water utilities to circumvent the federal government\u2019s water quality requirements altogether. \u201cIt seems that an exemption framework is likely to open the door to say, \u2018This is going to cost too much, you don\u2019t have to do it,\u2019\u201d he said.\nThe EPA spokesperson said exemptions would not allow utilities to violate regulations: \u201cRather, they allow additional time to find a compliance solution.\u201d\nJones also raised concerns about funding for further PFAS research, including investigations on how exposure to mixtures of the chemicals may impact human health. One of his federal grants for PFAS research was recently cut by the Trump administration, he said, and a colleague at Michigan State University studying PFAS on farms has also had his funding rescinded.\nIn addition to regulating PFAS by groups or as a class, Jones said the EPA should set pollution standards using what\u2019s known as the \u201cprecautionary principle,\u201d which doesn\u2019t require definitive evidence about a chemical\u2019s harms before it can be regulated. \u201cIn some countries, if you want to release a chemical into the environment you have to show it\u2019s safe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. usually takes the opposite approach and says, \u2018You can use these chemicals \u2026 and if we find that there\u2019s a problem, then we\u2019ll come up and regulate [them].\u2019\u201d\nOlson believes the EPA\u2019s alterations to the PFAS rules are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s \u201canti-backsliding provision,\u201d which says any revision the EPA proposes to a drinking water standard must be at least as protective of public health as the previous one. The law also caps compliance timelines at five years, whereas postponing the PFOS and PFOA compliance deadline to 2031 would give water utilities seven years.\n\u201cUltimately, we need to be phasing these chemicals out,\u201d Olson added. \u201cWe have to turn off the spigot and stop using these things so that five generations from now, our great-great-great grandchildren won\u2019t be dealing with them.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note: The Natural Resources Defense Council is an advertiser with Grist.

        "Content": "Part of the Series\nThe Road to Abolition\n\u201cI don\u2019t fuck with none of y\u2019all cops,\u201d rapped Julius Smith, aka Prince Jooveh, on the song \u201cHands Up.\u201d \u201cEighty percent of y\u2019all are cowards, y\u2019all stay up in our business.\u201d In one hand, he held a phone to hear the trap beat. In the other, he held a second phone to fire off lyrics. He had 30 minutes to get it right before time ran out \u2014 he was recording behind bars as a person incarcerated by the Florida Department of Corrections for 17 years. Jooveh had to finish before the guards told him time was up.\nThe last line of his song was an echoing wail, \u201cWe are not free. The only thing we are guilty of is pain and poverty. The poor get prison. The rich get richer.\u201d\nIn prisons across the United States, music beats against walls and bars. Many incarcerated people facing long sentences feel a welling-up in their throats: stories that need to be told.\nIn June 2025, the new album Bending the Bars \u2014 produced by the prison abolitionist group Community Hotline for Incarcerated People (CHIP) \u2014 will be released. Singles are already online from its 16 tracks. Some tell of love lost. Some lament youthful mistakes. Some expose the racism of the prison-industrial complex.\nNow more than ever, art by people in prison is needed. Making music transforms how incarcerated people see themselves. Hearing their music also transforms how the public sees them. The image of incarcerated people is being used by the Trump administration to make the case for deportations. Trump hammers relentlessly on the scary headlines of \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201cviolent criminals\u201d to normalize breaking the rule of law and dismantling civil rights. The goal is not to deport people who break the law, but to lay the groundwork for assaulting citizens who protest his plans to create an authoritarian police state.\nMaking Music in the Hole\n\u201cHonestly at first it was annoying,\u201d said Gary Field, who has been incarcerated for over 20 years by the Florida Department of Corrections and who is a board member of CHIP, in an interview with Truthout. \u201cWhen I got to prison, I\u2019d hear the men battle rapping. They\u2019d use whatever they had. Bang cups on the bars. Beat their chests. I listened and realized that they were incredibly talented. So many of them could easily have number one hits on the radio.\u201d\nBending the Bars rips away bipartisan perceptions and propaganda on crime and punishment by letting the artists speak their truth. The rappers tell us about their lives and hopes, grudges and fears. They mourn lives they\u2019ll never live. The image that rises from their lyrics is of complex human beings who can be a part of society again \u2014 which is in stark contrast to the imagery of the \u201cunredeemable, violent criminal\u201d that has been dominant since the 1970s: This toxic caricature of incarcerated people began with President Richard Nixon\u2019s 1971 \u201cwar on drugs\u201d and President Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cget-tough-on-crime\u201d turn, when many U.S. prisons shed their rehabilitation programs. The shift left the nearly 2 million people who are locked up with little to no resources to make a life after serving their sentences.\nBeyond the 2 million behind bars are 4 to 5 million on parole. According to prison therapists, 15 to 20 percent of incarcerated people have mental illnesses. Even after jail, many people with felony convictions can\u2019t vote, and the stigma of having had a felony conviction previously is like an invisible ball and chain, stopping them from getting jobs, housing and education. Cast out of society, they are driven back into the streets. It\u2019s no wonder that many return to prison. It\u2019s no wonder that the U.S. has made a revolving-door prison-industrial complex.\nThis system is why abolitionist organizations like CHIP figuratively break down prison walls by fighting draconian rules that further isolate jailed people. In Broward County, Florida, near where CHIP is based, Gov. Ron DeSantis ended free monthly calls for incarcerated people and reduced their authorized mail to postcards. No letters. Just postcards.\nGetting the voices of jailed people out matters. It matters to those inside: As Field tells Truthout, \u201cThe project brought people together. We would coordinate with CHIP to get outside collaborators. We had no high-tech audio equipment. We had to use phones to record. We got people in rival gangs to work with us. I\u2019m a people-person. I was the house man, and I\u2019d talk to everyone.\u201d Field cites his own life story to challenge prison stereotypes. \u201cWhen I was young, I got a scholarship to a prep school in Connecticut, met the children of bankers and senators. I traveled to Europe, and I ended up in prison at 46. I\u2019m an odd bird.\u201d\nHe talked about his life and the dramatic twists and turns it took. As he painted the scenes, the prison phone system told us in a robotic voice that he had one minute left. Field raced against the clock to share his reality but time ran out.\nBeating the Rap\n\u201cI\u2019m so tired of these four walls,\u201d raps \u201cGhostman\u201d on the song \u201cFour Walls.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so tired of these phone calls.\u201d A major theme in Bending the Bars is showing the humanity of prisoners stereotyped by right-wing media. The tactic of flipping the script is one of the oldest, deepest and strongest traditions in Black art, whether literature, painting or music.\nHip Hop flips the script on racism. Rappers have always pointed out that criminals are often the victims of systemic racism and poverty. You can hear this in songs from rap\u2019s golden era \u2014 say in 1982\u2019s \u201cThe Message\u201d by Grandmaster Flash, who raps about a broken city that breaks its people. You can hear it in KRS-One\u2019s 1993 hit, \u201cSound of the Police\u201d where he booms his bass voice going, \u201cWhoop! Whoop!\u201d like a cop car swooping in. You can see it the famous scene in the 1998 film Slam where spoken word artist-activist Saul Williams rips a poem from his heart in a prison yard as fellow prisoners are stunned by its beauty.\nBlack art displaying Black humanity goes back to the beginning: Frederick Douglass\u2019s 1845 autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, has one of the most powerful scenes of Black art. He wrote of hearing other enslaved people sing in the woods between plantations, \u201cThey told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains.\u201d\nHere is the truth: Art rescues us from oppression. Bending the Bars is one thread in a long quilt, woven by voices over the centuries, and one sorely needed now. The Trump administration constantly invokes images of \u201canimalistic criminals\u201d to justify deportation. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put it this way, \u201cSo the president has discussed this idea publicly. \u2026 American citizens to be deported, these would be heinous violent criminals who have broken our nation\u2019s laws repeatedly.\u201d\nTrump has long used racist stereotypes and fearmongering about incarcerated people to push a right-wing authoritarian takeover. Now he is extending that fearmongering to dissidents and political enemies \u2014 and next, could be you. This is why we need to see artists like Prince Jooveh, who says he rediscovered himself in music. \u201cI got to see myself as an artist,\u201d he said in an interview after he was released in February. \u201cI got a job. I\u2019m looking for a recording studio.\u201d He was breathless on the phone. \u201cI saw the effect my song had on people. It was electrifying.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "The over $150 billion allocated for boosting militarization in the U.S. in Republicans\u2019 reconciliation bill could, instead, be used to keep millions of people enrolled in Medicaid and food assistance programs, a new report finds.\nAccording to a report released Thursday by Public Citizen, the reconciliation bill proposes a boost of over $163 billion to militarized spending, including funds for the Pentagon and for the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s mass deportation campaign. This would bring the Pentagon\u2019s yearly budget to over $1 trillion and triple the budget for mass immigration detention, the report says.\nFurther, this funding boost alone could more than fund Medicaid for nearly 14 million people at risk of losing their health care coverage under the reconciliation bill, as well as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps, for 11 million who may lose food assistance under the bill.\nShifting funding away from these lifesaving programs and instead allocating it to militarization is effectively \u201ctrading life for death,\u201d the report says.\n\u201cThis reconciliation package is a direct redistribution of resources from struggling Americans to the Pentagon and militarization,\u201d said Lindsay Koshgarian, report co-author and Program Director at the National Priorities Project, in a statement. \u201cProtecting families from losing health care and going hungry is as simple as rejecting new spending on dangerous and unnecessary weapons and indiscriminate mass deportations.\u201d\nRepublicans have been boasting that their sweeping, multi-trillion dollar bill, which takes a machete to crucial social programs, is aimed at reducing \u201cwaste\u201d within the programs. But, as the report helps to demonstrate, the bill would actually serve as a major vehicle for Republicans to sap wealth from the poor and redistribute it to the rich, through tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and enrichment of the GOP\u2019s corporate backers.\nIndeed, part of the Pentagon funding boost is slated to be earmarked for President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cGolden Dome\u201d defense system \u2014 an idea that experts say is impossible to implement, but that could funnel hundreds of billions of dollars to private military contractors like SpaceX.\nThe report lays out the devastating impacts that Republicans\u2019 proposed cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and the child tax credit would have on a state-by-state basis. In numerous states, the militarization boosts could instead fund Medicaid, SNAP and the child tax credit for millions of people.\nThe report also highlights individual districts where Medicaid or SNAP benefits for thousands of people could be paid for just from funding for Trump\u2019s \u201cGolden Dome\u201d; in Texas\u2019s 21st district, which serves parts of San Antonio and Austin, Medicaid coverage for over 13,500 could continue to be funded with money instead earmarked for the military project.\nThe reconciliation bill passed the House 215 to 214 this week and now goes to the Senate, where it only needs to clear a simple majority vote to pass.\n\u201cIf implemented, this budget would rip the rug out from under everyday Americans relying on Medicaid and SNAP to survive, just to further enrich Pentagon contractors,\u201d said Savannah Wooten, another co-author and People Over Pentagon Advocate for Public Citizen. \u201cStealing money away from life-sustaining programs to fund war, weapons, and death should be an immediate non-starter for every member of Congress.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday dismissed a price discrimination lawsuit against the drink and food giant PepsiCo, a move that former FTC Chair Lina Khan, who served under former President Joe Biden, called \u201cdisturbing behavior.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, filed only a few days before U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, accused PepsiCo of providing a big box retailer customer, Walmart, with pricing advantages, while increasing prices for competing customers and retailers.\n\u201cThis lawsuit would\u2019ve protected families from paying higher prices at the grocery store and stopped conduct that squeezes small businesses and communities across America,\u201d Khan wrote on X on Thursday. \u201cDismissing it is a gift to giant retailers as they gear up to hike prices.\u201d\nThe three members of the FTC, all Republicans, voted 3-0 to drop the suit. Current FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson, who was named chairman by Trump, cast the lawsuit as a \u201cnakedly political effort to commit this administration to pursuing little more than a hunch that Pepsi had violated the law.\u201d He also said that the FTC under Biden \u201crushed to authorize the case.\u201d Ferguson also opposed the lawsuit when the FTC first voted to pursue it.\nAntimonopoly groups were quick to criticize Thursday\u2019s move.\n\u201cThis meritless dismissal is a win for monopolists and billionaires,\u201d said Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, in a statement on Thursday. \u201cAdding insult to injury, the agency dropped the case just one day before the parties were due to justify extensive redactions in the complaint, denying the public the ability to review the facts and judge the merits for themselves. This is a corporate pardon for Walmart and PepsiCo.\u201d\nOpen Markets legal director Sandeep Vaheesan said the move illustrates that despite their rhetoric, the current FTC commissioners are \u201cnot willing to faithfully apply the law enacted by Congress.\u201d\nStacy Mitchell, co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which is an advocate for independent businesses, called it \u201ceffectively an endorsement of the predatory tactics Walmart uses to crush local grocery sores, create food deserts, and drive up prices.\u201d\nThe agency had sued PepsiCo under the Robinson-Patman Act, a 1936 law intended to prevent price discrimination but has been little used in recent decades.\nThe announcement of the dropped lawsuit came the same day it was reported that the FTC is investigating the progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America over potential coordination with other groups, including the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, which was a World Federation of Advertiser initiative. Media Matters president Angelo Carusone confirmed in a statement to Axios that the investigation is over claims Media Matters and other groups coordinated advertising boycotts of the social media site X.\nX\u2019s owner, billionaire Elon Musk, who has played a core role in the Trump administration, has ongoing lawsuits against both the World Federation of Advertisers and Media Matters.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration\u2019s revocation of Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll foreign students, threatening the legal status of thousands of students, after the school sued to stop the ban.\nThe administration\u2019s ban is a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of the First Amendment and due process protections, the university said in its lawsuit. A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order allowing the university to keep its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification while the legal action plays out.\n\u201cWith the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard\u2019s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nAccording to the university, Harvard enrolls over 7,000 visa holders who are now thrown into turmoil over the ban. The ban comes just days before graduation.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered her department to terminate the university\u2019s SEVP certification on Thursday, meaning that existing foreign students \u201cmust transfer or lose their legal status,\u201d the department said in a statement.\nThe agency claimed that it is holding Harvard accountable for \u201cpro-terrorist conduct,\u201d including supposed antisemitism on campus, as well as \u201ccoordinated activity\u201d with the Chinese Communist Party.\nHowever, the revocation comes amid a protracted fight between the administration and the university over Trump officials\u2019 crackdown on pro-Palestine protests. Republicans have also been fear mongering over Harvard\u2019s supposed research ties with the Chinese government as part of the Trump administration\u2019s fight with the university and their ongoing quest to further tensions with China.\nCommentators and left-wing advocates have said that the Trump administration is clearly using its fight with Harvard as a way to force institutions to fall in line with its fascist ideologies and to crush dissent.\nIndeed, Trump administration officials made this clear in a chilling letter sent to the private university on Thursday.\nDHS revoked Harvard\u2019s SEVP certification \u201cto send a clear signal to Harvard and all universities that want to enjoy the privilege of enrolling foreign students, that the Trump Administration will enforce the law and root out the evils of anti-Americanism and antisemitism in society and campuses,\u201d Noem wrote.\nIn other words, the department says it\u2019s banning foreign students from enrollment at Harvard because it wants to send a signal that it is \u201croot[ing] out the evils of anti-Americanism.\u201d\nStudent visas are a crucial pathway for immigration the U.S., with over 1.5 million in the U.S. on academic or vocational visas in 2023. Last month, the Trump administration was forced to reinstate the records for thousands of international students whose status they changed after facing numerous losses in court challenging the records changes.\nThe Trump administration is also fighting a protracted battle with Harvard after it became the first Ivy League university to publicly refuse to capitulate with numerous administration demands, including giving preference to right-wing students and ideologies and rooting out pro-Palestinian sentiment within its departments.\nLast month, the university filed a lawsuit after the administration revoked federal research funding to the institution. President Donald Trump also threatened to revoke the university\u2019s tax exempt status if it didn\u2019t comply with the administration\u2019s demands.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "While the Heritage Foundation document focuses on the Palestine solidarity movement, its ultimate target is far broader.",
        "Content": "Project Esther isn\u2019t just about Palestine. Crafted by the Heritage Foundation \u2014 the same far right organization behind Project 2025 \u2014 the playbook purports to provide a \u201cnational strategy to combat antisemitism.\u201d First published and reported on last year, the document has seen new life in recent days following a New York Times investigation into Trump administration policies that mirror the plan. But Project Esther\u2019s authors make clear that their war on the Gaza solidarity movement is just a Trojan horse for a far more ambitious project: destroying the American left.\nMainstream coverage of Project Esther has largely framed the document as an effort to crush the pro-Palestinian movement. It\u2019s important to emphasize, however, that the threat Project Esther poses to the left more broadly is not a byproduct \u2014 it\u2019s part of the plan\u2019s core design. The text lays bare the McCarthyist nature of this political moment and underscores the urgent need for the left to mount a multipronged, coalitional defense.\nAt the center of Project Esther\u2019s crosshairs are the people and organizations it dubs the \u201cHamas Support Network,\u201d or HSN, though there\u2019s no evidence that the entities it\u2019s targeting actually support Hamas, or that they are even organized in any sort of a network. The playbook proposes a slew of recommendations for dismantling this fictional network, including deporting international students, purging pro-Palestine faculty from educational institutions, defunding organizations, increasing criminalization and promoting social ostracization of people that speak out in support of Palestinian rights. \u201cWithin the United States, the HSN receives the indispensable support of a vast network of activists and funders with a much more ambitious, insidious goal \u2014 the destruction of capitalism and democracy,\u201d Project Esther claims.\nThis is, of course, pure projection. There is no \u201cvast network\u201d of funders behind the grassroots uprising for Palestine \u2014 unlike Project 2025, which was crafted by 100 conservative organizations and, as DeSmog reported, bankrolled by six billionaire families. By attempting to frame the Gaza solidarity movement as a well-funded and cohesive network, Project Esther clearly aims to implicate any and all organizations on the left \u2014 a target that includes, but is not limited to, people and organizations that have spoken out in defense of Palestine.\nThat goal is demonstrated in Project Esther\u2019s repeated claim that the so-called HSN is seeking to destroy capitalism, which carries clear echoes of Sen. Joseph McCarthy\u2019s communist witch hunts of the 1950s. The project goes so far as to ludicrously equate Karl Marx\u2019s Communist Manifesto, Soviet agitprop and Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. (The Soviets, you might recall, fought against the Nazis in World War II.)\nThe proposals offered up by Project Esther can also be traced back to these witch hunts. One of Project Esther\u2019s suggested tools for quashing pro-Palestine activism is the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a law enacted in 1938 to combat Nazi propaganda, which requires that agents of foreign countries register with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and periodically disclose their political activities, and creates criminal and civil penalties for noncompliance. Although FARA was intended to provide transparency around foreign lobbying, it was coopted for McCarthyist suppression in the \u201850s to paint left activists as agents of communist regimes. In one egregious abuse of power, the DOJ used FARA to prosecute renowned civil rights leader and historian W.E.B. Du Bois for his perceived communist sympathies. That case was dismissed, but Project Esther is now urging federal leadership to pull from the same playbook, painting leftist activists and groups as \u201cHamas supporters\u201d to tee up its own weaponization of FARA.\nAnd Republicans have already expanded their use of the \u201cforeign agent\u201d rhetoric beyond Hamas: Last month, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) accused The People\u2019s Forum, a New York-based community center, and CODEPINK, an antiwar group, of ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and urged the DOJ to investigate the groups for FARA violations. The Trump administration levied similar allegations against Harvard University in a May 22 post on X, claiming that the school has coordinated with the CCP and fostered antisemitism on campus. Citing a \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d campus environment, an accompanying letter from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the administration is barring Harvard from enrolling international students.\nMany on the left have highlighted how the government\u2019s crackdown on pro-Palestine groups is itself in service of the Israeli state and its foreign lobbyists in the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. But pointing out Project Esther\u2019s hypocrisy does little to undermine its mission, which hinges on equating anti-Zionism with anti-Americanism. This sleight of hand is how Project Esther widens its scope of attack. Pointing out that Zionist lobbyists are the \u201creal\u201d foreign agents ultimately obfuscates the deeper root of the problem \u2014 the deployment of money and imperial power, regardless of where they originate, in support of policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing \u2014 while also capitulating to Project Esther\u2019s framing of Palestinian liberation as having anything to do with being pro- or anti-American.\nEven more concerning than FARA, however, is Project Esther\u2019s recommendation that the government use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to prosecute activists. By weaponizing RICO against the pro-Palestine movement, the Trump administration could ensnare people and groups across the left in a massive policing dragnet, attempting to paint everyone from anti-capitalists to Black Lives Matter activists as Hamas supporters. We have already seen RICO weaponized in Georgia against the Defend the Atlanta Forest movement, where Attorney General Chris Carr indicted 61 protesters on flimsy racketeering charges. Prosecutors claimed in legal filings that the fight to stop a massive police training center began during the nationwide protests against George Floyd\u2019s murder by police in 2020. Project Esther\u2019s authors also invoke George Floyd\u2019s name, making clear they perceive all mass mobilizations against injustice as threats: The document claims that the pro-Palestine movement is using Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack on Israel as a \u201cGeorge Floyd-style event to spring onto center stage and grab a giant microphone.\u201d\nCrucially, while Project Esther claims to be about combating antisemitism, no major Jewish organizations participated in its drafting, and the blueprint targets progressive Jewish groups like Jewish Voice for Peace. Only one of the four people on the project\u2019s leadership task force is Jewish, while two are evangelical Christian Zionists, and the document, notably, does not make any mention of right-wing antisemitism. Ironically, Project Esther claims that the pro-Palestine movement is \u201ca threat to the foundations of the United States and the fabric of our society.\u201d But the glaring lack of Jewish voices that went into crafting the document, coupled with the draconian, far-reaching tactics it proposes, should dispel any lingering doubt about the project\u2019s true aims: an assault on democracy and the overall suppression of the left.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

With all Democratic senators opposed to the package, Republicans are working to use the reconciliation process to avoid a filibuster.\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: We begin today\u2019s show looking at Trump\u2019s sweeping budget bill that includes what\u2019s been described as the biggest Medicaid cuts in U.S. history. On early Thursday morning, House Republicans passed the bill, giving massive tax breaks to the rich while slashing spending for Medicaid, Medicare, food assistance and subsidies for clean energy. The measure just eked through with a 215-to-214 vote that came after an all-night session and days of negotiations.\nThe legislation would trigger $625 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next 10 years, denying coverage to an estimated 7.6 million Americans, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Food assistance under the federal SNAP program would also see $300 billion in cuts, while adding billions in funding for Trump\u2019s border enforcement and mass deportation agenda.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson praised the budget package, speaking after the vote.\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON: We look forward to the Senate\u2019s timely consideration of this once-in-a-generation legislation. We stand ready to continue our work together to deliver on the One, Big, Beautiful Bill, as President Trump named it himself.\nAMY GOODMAN: Ahead of the House vote, Democratic Congressmember Greg Casar of Texas confronted Republicans on the House Budget Committee on rising healthcare premiums for their constituents while giving billionaires more tax breaks.\nREP. GREG CASAR: In this bill, they\u2019re going to jack up the premiums on healthcare for the people that rely on the marketplace for their healthcare. And so, I will hand the mic over, yield my time to any of my Republican colleagues that want to address the amount of money that their tax-paying citizens are going to have to pay in increased premiums for their healthcare. \u2026 And what bothers me the most is that we want to hide it. Nobody wants here to talk about the fact that they are jacking up insurance costs on their own constituents while giving a billionaire a tax break. Nobody on the Republican side pushing this bill wants to have an in-person town hall and look their constituents in the face and explain to them why they want to hand Elon Musk another $25 billion contract while jacking up your health insurance costs, not just by hundreds, but by thousands of dollars.\nAMY GOODMAN: Again, they\u2019re the largest Medicaid cuts in U.S. history. The legislation would trigger $625 billion in Medicare cuts over the next 10 years.\nSome Senate Republicans have voiced some concerns over the measure and will now have to pass their own version of the budget. With all Democratic senators opposed to the package, Republicans could resort to using the reconciliation process to avoid a filibuster.\nFor more, we go to Washington, D.C. We\u2019re joined by Chris Lehmann, D.C. bureau chief for The Nation. His latest piece is headlined \u201cTrump and Johnson\u2019s Big Ugly Lie.\u201d\nChris Lehmann, welcome back to Democracy Now! Lay out what\u2019s in the legislation.\nCHRIS LEHMANN: Thanks, Amy. Always a pleasure.\nYeah, I would say the legislation is basically a mugging conducted by the 1% against the rest of us. It represents the single largest upward redistribution of wealth effectuated by any piece of legislation in our history. The tax cuts work out to about $4 trillion, and the chief beneficiaries are at the upper end of the income spectrum. People earning $4 million or more, the 0.1%, will realize $389,000 gains in their after-tax income, whereas the lowest quintile of earners, who make $17,000 or less, will be on the hook for $1,000 and some change in their after-tax income, and that number will rise over the 10-year course of this package.\nAnd the GOP has dishonestly peddled it as a, you know, necessary \u2014 the cuts in the legislation as necessary fiscal discipline. In point of fact, this package will increase the federal deficit by $3 trillion. And you saw instantly the bond markets swooned on the news that this legislation has passed. The futures markets today are sort of in freefall.\nSo, it is just an outlandish piece of legislation, you know, based on basic economic principles, and it is a massive giveaway to the wealthy. You mentioned, you know, the historic cuts to Medicaid, to SNAP, to food assistance. There\u2019s also just, you know, crass and corrupt lobbying giveaways. There\u2019s a provision in it that prohibits all states from regulating artificial intelligence. It\u2019s a staggering work of theft from on high.\nAMY GOODMAN: And explain the \u201con high.\u201d Explain what the billionaires get in exchange for cutting Medicaid, triggering the Medicare cuts, cutting clean energy, cutting food assistance.\nCHRIS LEHMANN: They get $2.5 trillion in tax cuts. And that is \u2014 that\u2019s been the social contract, you know, behind the MAGA takeover of the GOP all this time. You know, the billionaires are more than happy to have Trump foment racial hatreds, you know, panic about the border, about DEI, what have you, go after universities, as we\u2019re now seeing, all in exchange for this, for yet more obscene wealth. That, you know, as is crafted in this bill, is directly taking critically needed support and, you know, assistance from the middle class and the working class.\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to ask you about the position of the Democratic Party in this. The party has faced widespread criticism, accused of failing to properly challenge Trump\u2019s agenda. There\u2019s a new piece \u2014\nCHRIS LEHMANN: Yeah.\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014 by The New \u2014 in The New Republic that says, quote, \u201cHouse Republicans managed to pass their draconian budget bill, which promises to make massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and food assistance, early Thursday morning by a narrow one-vote margin that was only possible due the deaths of three Democrats in this current Congress.\u201d It goes on to talk about, on Wednesday, Representative Gerry Connolly of [Virginia] passed away after battling esophageal cancer. He\u2019s the third Democrat to die in office this year and the sixth in just over a year. In March, longtime Arizona Congressmember Ra\u00fal Grijalva passed away also after battling cancer, and Congressmember Sylvester Turner of Houston, Texas, died six days earlier. Can you talk about all of this?\nCHRIS LEHMANN: Yes, this is, you know, an ongoing problem. And obviously, this is all in the shadow of new revelations about how the Biden White House basically concealed the actual cognitive decline of the president. You know, there is a huge gerontocracy problem in the Democratic Party, and where, you know, it is not an exaggeration, as the piece you quoted says, that if we did not lose these three House members, this disastrous bill might have been stopped.\nAnd it\u2019s also \u2014 you know, beyond the demographics, there is also just a basic failure of standing up for principle. You know, there was an earlier budget showdown that could have produced a government shutdown, and Democrats had leverage at that point to get concessions from Republicans in exchange for letting the budget go forward, and Chuck Schumer just folded like a cheap suit in the Senate and gave the Republicans everything they demanded. That\u2019s the sort of longer-term background to this disastrous bill that passed yesterday. The Republicans know they can count on Democrats either to, you know, to put things bluntly, to die or to fold. And, you know, this is a real problem.\nAMY GOODMAN: I just want to note, Heather Cox Richardson, in her newsletter, points out that we\u2019re talking about \u201cthe single biggest increase in funding to \u2014\nCHRIS LEHMANN: Yes.\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014 \u201cimmigration enforcement in the history of the United States,\u201d increasing ICE\u2019s detention budget from $3.4 billion a year to $45 billion through September 2029, a staggering 365% increase on an annual basis that would permit ICE to detain at least 100,000 people at a time. Your final comment, Chris Lehmann, as we move on to talk about one of the people who\u2019s in that detention system, Mahmoud Khalil?\nCHRIS LEHMANN: Well, I think it\u2019s, again, important to outline, in this case, that this boondoggle to the repressive and, you know, illegal ICE detention system comes on the back of another Democratic capitulation. The same Democratic Senate voted to endorse the Laken Riley Act, which erected this new system of detention and rendition that\u2019s operating illegally and without accountability in our country, after, prior to that, the Democrats eagerly touted a Republican immigration reform that included many of these same draconian provisions. So, again, it\u2019s a failure of effective resistance and moral leadership on the part of the Democrats. And yeah, it\u2019s a disastrous amping up of this shadow, you know, fascist state.\nAMY GOODMAN: And just to put an underscore on it, Heather Cox Richardson writes, \u201cIt increases ICE\u2019s budget for transportation and removal operations by 500%, from the current $721 million to $14.4 billion. It also calls for [$46.5 billion] for construction of barriers at the border, including completing 701 miles of wall, 900 miles of river barriers, and 629 miles of secondary barriers, and replacement of 141 miles of vehicle and pedestrian barriers.\u201d It calls for $45 billion for adult and family detention, enough to detain at least 100,000 people at a time.\nChris Lehmann, I want to thank you for being with us, D.C. bureau chief for The Nation. We\u2019ll link to your piece, \u201cTrump and Johnson\u2019s Big Ugly Lie.\u201d\nWhen we come back, the jailed Palestinian activist who should have been walking across the graduation stage at Columbia this week, instead jailed in Jena, Louisiana, Mahmoud Khalil, testified at his asylum hearing Thursday that if he is deported, it could result in \u201cassassination, kidnapping, torture.\u201d Hours before the hearing, Mahmoud Khalil got to hold his 1-month-old baby Deen for the first time in Deen\u2019s little life. We\u2019ll get an update from Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s lawyer, Ramzi Kassem.

        "Summary": "Despite growing suppression, students have achieved multiple divestment victories and are pushing for more wins.",
        "Content": "In recent weeks, students across multiple university campuses in the United States have launched hunger strikes in solidarity with the people of Gaza enduring famine. The protesters are also calling on their school to cut ties with weapons manufacturers and other companies connected to Israel.\nIn addition to the hunger strikes, we have seen new encampments and even campus occupations. Despite the growing suppression of the movement, students have achieved multiple divestment victories and are pushing for more wins.\nStudent protestors across the country are adapting their strategies to Trump\u2019s crackdown, but it\u2019s safe to say the activism is not slowing down.\nHunger Strikes\nMore than two dozen California students began a fast on May 5, with more schools joining in the proceeding days.\n\u201cIf ever there was a moment that demands civil disobedience, it is the hour of genocide. We walk in the footsteps of earlier Stanford students who occupied this same plaza to end the Vietnam War and later to force partial divestment from apartheid South Africa. Now that baton passes to us. On October 20, 2023, Stanford students built the nation\u2019s first Gaza\u2011solidarity encampment,\u201d said the Stanford University\u2019s hunger strikes in a statement published at Mondoweiss.\n\u201cFor 120 days, hundreds of Stanford community members sustained this encampment to demand an end to the genocide in Palestine and to press Stanford University to act \u2014 by providing direct support for Palestinian students and, ultimately, by divesting its endowment from defense contractors and surveillance firms complicit in that genocide. Our university\u2019s leadership and administration ignored the calls from the overwhelming majority of the Stanford student body to take action and only reacted with escalated repression.\u201d\nSan Francisco State University (SFSU) students recently ended their strike after obtaining several commitments from their school. The administration said it would expand the implementation of the divestment policy and work toward a partnership with Palestinian universities.\nSan Francisco State University (SFSU) is one of three schools that have pressured their university to some level of divestment in the past and is building upon those earlier victories.\nAt a press conference about the development, a fourth-year SFSU student said the action could inspire other schools to take action.\n\u201cHow are we able to study and learn and not feel a sense of duty to the students in Palestine who are without a single standing college because of a genocide funded by our student dollars?\u201d she said. \u201cHere at San Francisco State, we are the example. Our school goes to show we can divest for more on occupation. Students do not and should not have to be complicit in genocide just because they want education.\u201d\nSix students at Sacramento State, which has also previously adopted a divestment policy, also recently ended their hunger strike.\nAmal Dawud, a Sacramento State student, said it\u2019s a way to remind people about what hundreds of thousands of people are experiencing in Gaza.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been two years and it\u2019s been two months, and they haven\u2019t had food entering the Gaza Strip,\u201d a student told the local news, referring to Israel\u2019s ongoing blockade on humanitarian aid. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of why a hunger strike was the method that we chose.\u201d\nAt UCLA, student activist Maya Abdullah was hospitalized on the 9th day of her hunger strike.\nUCLA student Maya Abdallah has been hospitalised on the ninth day of her hunger strike.\n\u2014 TRT World (@trtworld) May 19, 2025\nShe announced the strike on May 10, calling for her university to divest from companies linked to Israel pic.twitter.com/Mg34GYCIGV\nStudents with the group Yalies4Palestine recently met with Yale College Dean Pericles Lewis amid an ongoing hunger strike at the school. The demonstrators are demanding that Yale divest from weapons manufacturers, adopt human rights-based investment strategy, end its academic partnerships with Israel, and grant amnesty for student protesters.\nLewis told the strikers that he couldn\u2019t grant students amnesty without knowing their plans. Yale President Maurie McInnis has refused to meet with the protesters so far.\n\u201cMaurire McInnis, the people are watching,\u201d said Yalies4Palestine in a statement on social media. \u201cOur support is overwhelming and our numbers are growing.\u201d\n\u201cThe strikers demand a response,\u201d it continues. \u201cMcInnis, meet with us. Commencement is coming. Your starving students are still here. We are not going anywhere.\u201d\nEncampments\nIn addition to the hunger strikes, students have also erected Gaza solidarity encampments this semester, but most have been shut down by campus police departments.\nOn May 8, students at Johns Hopkins University erected an encampment on the campus\u2019s Keyser Quad, declaring it the Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya Liberated Zone, in solidarity with Palestinians.\nAccording to the protesters, over 30 university cops (JHPD) and Baltimore police pulled the canopies down, injuring multiple students.\n\u201cCops mangled the metal so that the legs were sticking in all directions and support beams were twisting,\u201d said one student. \u201cThe person I was linking arms with got stuck bending over under the canopy trying to get out someone else out\u2014their heads were getting caught between metal poles in the canopy roof, and we weren\u2019t able to get them out until JHPD stopped pulling it down for a moment.\u201d\nLast month, about 200 student protesters gathered at Yale University\u2019s Beinecke Plaza to protest far-right Israeli security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir\u2019s visit to New Haven. An encampment was erected, but eventually disbanded over fear of retribution from the school.\nThe next day, Yale College revoked the aforementioned Yalies4Palestine\u2019s status as a registered student group, despite the fact that they did not organize the protest.\nAt Dartmouth College, students disbanded an encampment after the administration agreed to set up an immigration legal fund for international students and release a formal response to the protesters\u2019 divestment demands by May 20.\nPalestine Solidarity Coalition member Ramsey Alsheikh told the student paper that the development was \u201ca massive victory\u201d and \u201ca step forward for the student movement,\u201d but pointed out that the activism would not be stopping.\n\u201cWe will move forward,\u201d said Alsheikh. \u201cThis is not the end.\u201d\nLast spring\u2019s encampments also continue to reverberate.\nIn 2024, students at the University of San Francisco pressured their school into adopting a divestment task force through their encampment protest. Their Students for Justice in Palestine chapter secured a seat on the task force, and protesters investigated the school\u2019s investments. Since discovering the university\u2019s economic connections to Palantir, L3Harris, GE Aerospace, and RTX Corporation, they have been pressuring the administration to divest from the U.S. defense companies over their contracts with the Israeli military.\nLast month, the University of San Francisco agreed to sell off its direct investments in the weapons manufacturers.\nAn organizer who spoke with Mondoweiss said the victory was achieved through the persistence of the student movement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been exhausting for students, but they haven\u2019t faltered,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have worked to pressure the administration, whether it\u2019s through the student government or the alumni. Our comrades disrupted graduation last year. All these different things have increased our visibility.\u201d\nThe activists acknowledge that this is a major win, but they say the fight is not over. They want the school to overhaul its investment strategy entirely and sever its remaining connections to Israel.\nColumbia Library Occupation\nOn May 7, Columbia University students occupied the school\u2019s Butler Library to protest the genocide in Gaza.\nColumbia\u2019s administration quickly called in the cops. Roughly 80 people were arrested, and the school swiftly suspended students over the action, including some who didn\u2019t even participate in the protest.\nIn a statement, acting Columbia president Claire Shipman said she was compelled to call in police because the students were causing \u201csubstantial chaos.\u201d She also blamed the Trump administration\u2019s targeting of campus activists on the protesters.\n\u201cI am deeply disturbed at the idea that, at a moment when our international community feels particularly vulnerable, a small group of students would choose to make our institution a target,\u201d said Shipman.\nIn the New York Times, reporter Sharon Otterman contrasted the protest with the occupation of Columbia\u2019s Hamilton Hall last year, when the only public safety officer present left the scene.\n\u201cThe university\u2019s newly assertive response satisfied many of those who were harshly critical of Columbia\u2019s management of last year\u2019s protests, including the Trump administration\u2019s antisemitism task force, which has cut more than $400 million in research funding from Columbia, citing what it called the university\u2019s failure to protect Jewish students,\u201d wrote Otterman. \u201cColumbia is negotiating with the task force in hopes of having the federal dollars restored.\u201d\nThe Trump task force praised Shipman\u2019s response to the library occupation. \u201cShe has stepped in to lead Columbia at a critical juncture and has met the moment with fortitude and conviction,\u201d said the group in a statement.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Summary": "Model legislation from right-wing policy incubator ALEC aims to extend deregulation far beyond Washington, DC.",
        "Content": "As Elon Musk and his DOGE cronies take a sledgehammer to federal agencies, corporate interests are mounting a coordinated effort to dismantle state rules and regulations \u2014 backing legislative efforts to kneecap state watchdogs\u2019 ability to enforce everything from environmental protections to worker safeguards.\nThis means that as guardrails for consumers and workers are dismantled on a federal level, states are in danger of losing their ability to pick up the slack.\nIn 15 states this year, according to a review by The Lever, lawmakers have introduced so-called \u201cjudicial deference\u201d laws, which would stack the deck against state regulators and allow corporate America to swiftly challenge and strip away state protections ranging from restrictions on pollution to consumer safeguards.\nThe legislation mimics the Supreme Court\u2019s 2024 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo decision that defanged federal regulators, with widespread consequences.\nTen of the bills include language that is nearly identical to model legislation authored by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a right-wing policy incubator that, with the assistance of private interests, is pushing to gut state regulators\u2019 power around the country. In Missouri and Nevada, the bills have made it through one chamber; in Oklahoma, the legislation now awaits the governor\u2019s signature.\nThe language, experts told The Lever, in some cases goes beyond the ruling of the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority to even further constrain state regulators.\nThe coordinated push reveals how states are becoming a more important battleground than ever for the fight against corporate power and deregulation. If, for example, the embattled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can\u2019t protect you from junk fees, your state attorney general could be the next best option.\nBut if ALEC and its corporate backers succeed in pushing these bills through state legislatures, the end result is deregulation that extends far beyond Washington, consumer advocates warn.\n\u201cThis is giving massive handouts to corporate interests who don\u2019t want to be regulated and who are maximizing profit over the well-being of the community that they\u2019re in,\u201d said Devon Ombres, senior director for courts and legal policy at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy think tank.\nBetween the Loper Bright case and state-level efforts, Ombres said, lawmakers were \u201cgiving these already super powerful entities leeway to attack regulations in entirely new ways.\u201d\n\u201cA Very Well-Funded Campaign\u201d\nBack in 2014, when a power plant challenged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2019s air pollution regulations, a more liberal Supreme Court sided with environmental regulators. The Clean Air Act, the court reasoned, might not spell out exactly how the EPA should enforce Congress\u2019 antipollution law, but environmental regulators had the authority to interpret ambiguous provisions according to their expertise.\nThe doctrine backing this decision was called Chevron deference, a precedent established by the high court in a 1984 ruling over the oil giant\u2019s challenge to anti-pollution laws.\nFor decades, the Chevron doctrine directed federal judges to defer to regulators\u2019 judgment on questions of law, so long as their judgment was reasonable. The state of affairs greatly expanded the scope and power of regulatory agencies.\nOnce embraced by the conservative establishment, the Chevron doctrine was a prime target of corporate interests by the 2010s. Corporate America had come to believe the precedent handed too much authority to regulators trying to rein in corporate power \u2014 like when the EPA successfully won over polluters.\nParticularly emblematic of the corporate turn against Chevron is the evolving position of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas once supported the doctrine, upholding it in an opinion he authored in 2005. But he flip-flopped on the issue after years of undisclosed gifts and luxury travel from corporate billionaire Harlan Crow, as well as endless lobbying by right-wing legal organizations such as the Pacific Legal Foundation, which are increasingly backed by dark money.\nThomas\u2019s about-face was just one step in the conservative legal movement\u2019s long game to overturn Chevron and usher in a new deregulatory age. Another was the Loper Bright case, a challenge to federal marine authorities brought on behalf of commercial fisheries in New England. The case was backed by a laundry list of corporate interests, and the Supreme Court ultimately ruled 6-2 in their favor last year, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recusing herself, and Thomas joining with the majority to vote to sunset Chevron.\nChief Justice John Roberts, in his majority opinion in Loper Bright, held that courts must now \u201cexercise their independent judgment\u201d when deciding whether federal authorities have exceeded their authority \u2014 dealing a serious blow to regulators\u2019 power. The ruling has had wide-ranging consequences: Courts cited the death of Chevron to strike down firearm background check requirements, airline fee restrictions, and environmental protections, as ProPublica reported last fall.\nNow state courts, which have their own standards for evaluating state rules and regulations, are being forced to ask the same questions. For decades, there has been a piecemeal system in the states of so-called \u201cjudicial deference\u201d \u2014 how much judges defer to regulators\u2019 judgment. In the years after Chevron, many states adopted similar legal regimes, but not all: The notoriously corporate-friendly Delaware, for instance, has long had a far less deferential standard.\nState standards on this issue are a \u201cmoving target,\u201d said Daniel Walters, a Texas A&M University School of Law professor. \u201cAt the state level, things are changing all the time.\u201d\nBut recently, Walters has seen an accelerated trend of legislation on a state level.\nA \u201cvery well-funded campaign,\u201d he said, has begun \u201cadvocating for changes at the state level, to try to eliminate deference there.\u201d\nThis campaign is being driven in part by ALEC.\n\u201cA Thumb on the Scale\u201d\nIn a recent April webinar, ALEC staffers and conservative lawmakers around the country gathered on Zoom to discuss their deregulation battle across the states.\n\u201cSo many states are moving in the right direction to adopt ALEC model policy,\u201d Jonathan Williams, ALEC\u2019s president and chief economist, said on the call.\nHe pointed in particular to Missouri, where lawmakers are advancing an ALEC-authored judicial deference bill to weaken the power of regulators in the state. The legislation passed in the Missouri Senate in February by a wide margin (25-7) after ALEC sent a representative to the state house to testify in its favor, and is now being deliberated on in the House.\nFor years, ALEC has been a secretive hotbed for conservative policy, working closely with lawmakers across the country to pass model legislation drafted by the group. Its backers include the shadowy political network funded by conservative petrochemical tycoon Charles Koch of Koch Industries, among hundreds of other corporate interests, many of which were also involved in the fight against Chevron deference.\nMany states with conservative leadership, hopping in on the DOGE zeitgeist, have been attempting to copy the Trump administration\u2019s extreme agency-gutting playbook. State-level Department of Government Efficiency-inspired entities have cropped up in 26 states, according to an April report from the Economic Policy Institute.\nThey are being egged on by ALEC\u2019s \u201cgovernment efficiency coalition,\u201d a working group that coordinates these efforts nationwide. The Lever attended multiple coalition webinars this year, in which ALEC representatives and state lawmakers discussed their strategy \u2014 as well as the group\u2019s attempts to pass judicial deference legislation.\n\u201cEvery good idea that comes out of the states should be funneled up to the federal government, and vice versa,\u201d ALEC\u2019s CEO, Lisa Nelson, said on a January call.\nALEC isn\u2019t the only corporate interest group lobbying for the Missouri deregulation bill. Legislative records indicate that the Associated Industries of Missouri, an industry group whose members include Boeing, Ford, and Mastercard, has been pushing for the legislation. So has the Pacific Legal Foundation and Americans for Prosperity, a dark money group backed by the Koch network.\nThe Missouri bill, like nine other bills introduced in different states this year, draws almost word for word from model legislation on judicial deference drafted by ALEC, which the organization claims will \u201crestore judicial autonomy\u201d by seizing power away from state regulators and returning it to the courts.\nWhat\u2019s particularly noteworthy about this language, noted Walters at Texas A&M, is that it appears to expand upon the Supreme Court\u2019s stance on judicial deference in its Loper Bright decision. Not only does the ALEC legislation direct that courts not give any deference to agency judgment at all, but it also directs judges to \u201cexercise remaining doubt in favor of a reasonable interpretation that limits the scope of agency power and maximizes individual liberty.\u201d\nThis, Walters said, goes \u201cwell beyond\u201d what the Supreme Court decided in Loper Bright, amounting to a \u201cthumb on the scale against agency action.\u201d\nYet despite how apparently extreme the language is, state lawmakers are taking it up. Last year, Idaho codified the language into law. This legislative session, the Nebraska and Oklahoma legislatures have, like Missouri, both pushed bills containing the ALEC language through at least one chamber.\nAccording to Walters, the impact of such a drastic policy \u2014 which directs judges to oppose agency action whenever possible \u2014 could be \u201cchilling\u201d in states, where regulators are in charge of critical environmental protections, antitrust enforcement, worker safeguards, and many other policies.\n\u201cIt just seems like stacking the deck in many ways against agency action, and I think it would have profound implications for the ability of regulators to do their job,\u201d he said.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

        "Content": "Gavin Newsom, Elon Musk and Marjorie Taylor Greene agree on this one thing\nDonald Trump\u2019s megabill has attracted the rebuke of typical allies and opponents alike.\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom and fellow Sacramento Democrats are finding themselves in an awkward yet convenient alliance with MAGA-world figures against President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d\nJust days after leaving the administration, Elon Musk took his opposition to the extreme over Trump\u2019s mega budget and reconciliation package, posting on X Tuesday that he \u201cjust can\u2019t stand it anymore\u201d with what he called the \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d that is \u201cthis massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill.\u201d\nHis outburst had Newsom, a frequent sparring partner, chiming in with agreement.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have said it better myself,\u201d the governor responded to Musk.\nThe vote of support from Newsom marks the latest turn in the rocky relationship between him and Musk, who enjoyed a favorable relationship with the governor while growing many of his companies within the state, but had become a regular target of criticism from the blue state leader during his time at the White House.\nMusk\u2019s post, meanwhile, encouraged Republican critics of the reconciliation package like Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to quickly echo his outrage as well.\nBut Newsom also found himself in agreement with conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on Tuesday over a particularly thorny provision of the bill: a 10-year ban on the enforcement of AI state regulation introduced by her fellow House Republicans.\nThe Georgia lawmaker threatened to vote against the bill if it returns to the House with the moratorium still included \u2014 presenting a potential headache for GOP leadership, who could barely scrounge up the votes the first time. The package is being considered in the Senate, where the measure may not survive scrutiny under the upper chamber\u2019s Byrd rule, meant to strip out measures that have no impact or only a negligible one on the budget.\n\u201cI am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there,\u201d Greene posted on X. \u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous.\u201d\nNewsom, who previously expressed fears about overregulating California\u2019s booming AI industry, has said he is concerned the moratorium will be \u201covercorrecting in the other direction federally.\u201d\nFour Democrats from the California Legislature joined a letter to Congress from state lawmakers on Tuesday morning to oppose the moratorium on state AI laws, only to see their criticisms echoed by Greene hours later.\n\u201cGiven the long absence of federal action to address privacy and social media harms, barring all state and local AI laws until Congress acts threatens to setback policymaking and undermine existing enforcement on these issues,\u201d they wrote as part of a bipartisan coalition of 260 state lawmakers.\n\u201cWe respectfully urge you to reject any provision that preempts state and local AI legislation in this year\u2019s reconciliation package.\u201d",

        "Content": "\u2018A historic betrayal\u2019: Murkowski slams Trump administration revoking protections for Afghan immigrants\nA joint letter from Lisa Murkowski and Jeanne Shaheen urged the Department of Homeland Security to reinstate the protections immediately.\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) denounced the Trump administration\u2019s decision to axe temporary protected status for Afghan immigrants \u2014 the latest break by the centrist Republican from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\nIn a joint letter with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the senator urged the administration to reconsider the cancellation of the temporary protection, which affords Afghans a work permit and legal status in the U.S.\n\u201cThis decision endangers thousands of lives, including Afghans who stood by the United States,\u201d Murkowski and Shaheen \u2014 the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 wrote. \u201cThis decision represents a historic betrayal of promises made and undermines the values we fought for far more than 20 years in Afghanistan.\u201d\nThe letter \u2014 which was sent May 23 and released Friday \u2014 comes amid reports that the State Department is shuttering the office that coordinated Afghan resettlement for those who helped with the war effort, part of an agency-wide reorganization aligning with the Trump administration\u2019s moves to reduce foreign aid and assistance and refocus on \u201cAmerica First\u201d priorities.\nMurkowski has not been shy about criticizing her own party, while encouraging her fellow GOP senators to do the same. The Republican has rebuked President Donald Trump for his close relationship to Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing the U.S. of \u201cwalking away from our allies.\u201d But she also acknowledged a reticence within Republican circles of defying Trump \u2014 saying \u201cwe are all afraid\u201d of Trump\u2019s retaliation.\nShe\u2019s also not the only Republican to raise red flags about the cancellation of TPS protections for some immigrants, with Miami\u2019s members of Congress also urging the Trump administration to continue the protections for Venezuelans and Haitians.\nThe Alaska Republican first criticized the decision on TPS shortly after it was announced by the Department of Homeland Security, calling it \u201cconcerning\u201d in light of promises from Noem to address a backlog of asylum applications \u2014 which could dramatically increase as former TPS holders look for avenues to stay in the U.S.\nBut eliminating TPS has been one of Trump\u2019s key campaign promises from the start, after calling the program corrupt and saying the legal status had been extended for too long.\nThe battle over TPS has made its way to the courts. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to revoke TPS protections for roughly 350,000 Venezuelans.\nMurkowski has previously called out the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, which happened under the Biden administration, saying the \u201cbotched\u201d operation endangered many who then came to the U.S. \u2014 and that ending protections would only exacerbate the problem.\n\u201cThis administration should not compound that misstep by forcing them to return to the Taliban\u2019s brutal regime,\u201d Murkowski wrote on X earlier this month.",

        "Content": "Fired copyright chief loses first round in lawsuit over Trump powers\nShira Perlmutter asked a judge to reinstate her, arguing the Library of Congress is not under direct presidential control.\nA judge denied a request for reinstatement Wednesday from the ousted head of the national copyright office, rejecting for now her claims that President Donald Trump had no right to fire her.\nShira Perlmutter was fired as register of copyrights earlier this month, an office housed inside the Library of Congress. In a suit filed in Washington\u2019s federal court last week, she alleged that Trump and his subordinates overstepped in both naming a new Librarian of Congress \u2014 the only official, she claims, that can hire and fire a copyright chief.\nPerlmutter asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order keeping Trump\u2019s appointees out of the Library of Congress and keeping her on the job, but U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly denied the motion from the bench in a hearing Wednesday.\nPerlmutter\u2019s lawsuit names as lead plaintiff Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, whom Trump attempted to appoint as acting Librarian of Congress, alongside Trump and several other administration officials. Justice Department lawyers representing Blanche & Co. asserted in a court filing this week that the Library of Congress is \u201cpart of the Executive Branch and is subject to presidential control.\u201d\n\u201cThe Library of Congress is not an autonomous organization free from political supervision,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\nThe White House argues that Trump has the authority to name an acting librarian and register of copyrights who can serve temporarily under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act \u2014 much as the president can name acting leaders for any other federal agency with a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed chief.\nKey lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including some top Republicans, are questioning that assertion, and it has created a standoff at the Library of Congress over the attempted takeover.\nRep. Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, said in a statement that the arguments in the recent administration court filing amount to \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional efforts to wrest control of the Library and the Copyright Office from Congress and the American people.\u201d\n\u201cThe law is clear,\u201d Morelle said. \u201cThe Library of Congress is a legislative branch agency, and the President has no authority to appoint an Acting Librarian or meddle in the Library\u2019s personnel decisions.\u201d\nIn addition to attempting to install Blanche as acting librarian, Trump also attempted to appoint Brian Nieves as acting assistant librarian and Paul Perkins as acting register of copyrights, replacing Perlmutter as director of the Copyright Office.\nBut Robert Randolph Newlen, who assumed the acting librarian role immediately after Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden\u2019s removal, appears to remain in control of the library, and Blanche has not been seen at the library or sent communications to employees since the attempted takeover earlier this month.\nWhile Kelly did not immediately grant Perlmutter\u2019s request, her lawsuit will continue. Kelly indicated he will hear arguments in the coming weeks on whether to grant a preliminary injunction blocking Trump and Blanche while the litigation plays out.\nIn the meantime, the leadership of the library and copyright office will remain in limbo.\n\u201cIf Mr. Blanche assumes the role of Acting Librarian of Congress, the Executive Branch will gain access to reams of confidential information that belongs to Congress and that Congress has zealously guarded from disclosure, as well as privately owned copyright deposits,\u201d Perlmutter\u2019s lawyer wrote in a Tuesday filing.\nRepublican chairs of the House and Senate panels with oversight responsibility of the library declined a request for comment.\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, called once again for Congress to take bipartisan action to codify full congressional control of the library, condemning the \u201cunprecedented encroachment by the White House.\u201d",

        "Content": "A retiring chief strains to keep the Capitol Police above the partisan fray\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise or necessary or useful to try and convince members of Congress what to think\u201d about the Jan. 6 riot, Thomas Manger says.\nThomas Manger inherited a force in crisis when he became chief of the U.S. Capitol Police four years ago. He\u2019s now leaving a force under a microscope.\nThe 70-year-old law enforcement veteran came out of retirement just months after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol \u2014 tasked with stabilizing a department whose officers had been physically and emotionally battered and whose protective mission had suddenly grown immensely more complicated.\nBut that was only the beginning of challenge for Manger, who soon found himself holding one of the most politicized jobs in all of policing. Within months, an alternative narrative about Jan. 6 took hold on the right, and with many of its proponents now in power in Washington \u2014 including President Donald Trump \u2014 he has had to strike a careful balance between standing up for his officers and heeding the lawmakers who oversee and fund his department.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise or necessary or useful to try and convince members of Congress what to think,\u201d Manger said. \u201cI think you make the compelling argument about what the Capitol Police need, about what the Capitol Police require to do their jobs and allow them to make a decision.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say Manger has been silent. He has spoken out at key junctures, criticizing Trump\u2019s blanket pardons of Jan. 6 offenders and, just last week, the Justice Department\u2019s decision to move toward a $5 million settlement with the family of Ashli Babbit \u2014 the Jan. 6 rioter who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer while trying to storm a room off the House floor.\nBut in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday \u2014 amid his last week on the job before retiring for good \u2014 Manger said it wasn\u2019t productive for the embattled force\u2019s chief to be snarled in political fights on the Hill, or in the larger war over the memory of the Capitol insurrection.\nWhile Manger has felt compelled to speak up about situations that directly affect his officers, he has taken pains to stay out of other battles. He again called the pardons \u201can absolute slap in the face to police officers, frankly, all over this country\u201d Tuesday, for instance, but refused to weigh in on the fate of a bronze plaque commemorating the officers who responded to the riot.\nCongress ordered the fabrication of the memorial and its installation \u201cat a permanent location on the western front of the United States Capitol\u201d in March 2022. The plaque was cast, inscribed with \u201cTHEIR HEROISM WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN,\u201d but after Republicans won the House majority the following November, it was put into storage in the Capitol basement.\nCalling it a \u201cvery political issue,\u201d Manger said he has not spoken to Republican congressional leaders about the plaque and declined to call for it to be installed. He said he had not seen the actual memorial, just a photograph.\n\u201cI hope they will find some middle ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of memorials that are attached to the Capitol building, but there are certainly a lot of informational pedestals where you have little historical briefings around the campus.\u201d\nThe tap dance reflects the enormous challenges of managing a department that is ultimately responsible to a web of overlapping overseers. There\u2019s the three-member Capitol Police Board, four oversight committees and senior congressional leaders themselves \u2014 all of whom have influence over the department and how it operates.\nManger \u2014 who previously led the departments in Montgomery County, Maryland, and Fairfax County, Virginia \u2014 said dealing with the menagerie of Capitol Hill power centers was \u201cvery different\u201d from reporting to a single elected executive and \u201cvery, very challenging.\u201d\nThat, he said, has required a focus on the future of the Capitol Police and securing what the department needs to keep lawmakers, tourists and staff safe. It\u2019s also a situation that will hang over whoever replaces Manger as chief.\n\u201cIf they pick someone from the inside, they\u2019re going to know what our mission is,\u201d Manger said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have that \u2014 that\u2019s good. If they pick somebody from the outside, they\u2019re going to have to learn about our mission, the uniqueness of it, but the structure of oversight as well, and there is a learning curve there.\u201d\nAn even bigger challenge for the force, however, has been keeping up with a rising tide of threats against lawmakers. The department reported more than 9,400 in 2024, and a good number of those threats were deemed credible enough to require temporary protective details for rank-and-file lawmakers who otherwise would not be entitled to them.\nThat has stretched resources thin, Manger said: \u201cWe\u2019re always robbing Peter to pay Paul to put that together. We should have the staffing to do those kinds of details.\u201d\nManger recently made his final budget requests to Congress, asking lawmakers for $967.8 million for fiscal 2026, a 22 percent boost over the current funding level which was set in fiscal 2024. He acknowledged in hearings with appropriators that for his department\u2019s size \u2014 about 2,300 sworn officers and civilians \u2014 a budget approaching a billion dollars is enormous. He stressed the sweeping intelligence, security and nationwide coordination mandate of the Capitol Police.\nBoth the Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill are trying to rein in federal spending, and lawmakers tasked with spending are expected to begin writing their bills in the coming weeks. The outgoing chief warned against continuing to keep funding flat for the department he\u2019s set to exit long before any spending deal is reached.\n\u201cIt would impact our ability to address the growing number of threats against a member of Congress,\u201d Manger said. \u201cWe\u2019d just be crossing our fingers and saying, \u2018Well, hope nothing happens,\u2019 because there\u2019s more that we think we can do if we had the resources.\u201d\nThe job of choosing Manger\u2019s replacement will fall to the Capitol Police Board, comprised of House Sergeant-at-Arms William McFarland, Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Jennifer Hemingway and Architect of the Capitol Thomas Austin. Top congressional leaders choose those officials and are expected to have some influence in the pick.\nManger said that anyone coming in after him has to know that the job has a much different mandate and set of responsibilities than a municipal police department. He said he would be available as a sounding board but was looking forward to retirement \u2014 some consulting work, maybe, and finally fixing the fence in his yard.\n\u201cOne of the things that I really, truly want to get away from is the aggravations of being a police chief,\u201d he said. \u201cSo whatever I do, it\u2019s going to be something I want to do.\u201d",

        "Content": "How Mike Johnson doused a GOP dumpster fire\nThe speaker spent months keeping flare-ups from growing into a conflagration even Donald Trump couldn\u2019t extinguish.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson bet it all on \u201cone big, beautiful bill.\u201d With a heavy assist from President Donald Trump in the final hours, he delivered.\nThe bill\u2019s House passage early Thursday morning was at least temporary vindication for a series of strategic decisions championed by the Louisiana Republican \u2014 chiefly, that packaging a massive suite of tax cuts together with other sundry GOP priorities would make it easier to move ambitious legislation with his tiny governing majority.\nJohnson had to battle for months with factions of his own conference, and with the Senate, at multiple key junctures. But he plowed through and moved a host of Trump\u2019s campaign promises closer to the president\u2019s desk after a final flurry of negotiations and a rare, overnight session on the House floor.\n\u201cThere was a few moments over the last week when it looked like the thing might fall apart,\u201d Johnson told reporters shortly after the vote, adding he visited the House chapel to pray on it.\nIn essence, Johnson spent months fighting fires. His job, in conjunction with other GOP leaders, was to manage flare-up after flare-up as various groups inside the House ranks battled over trillions in tax cuts and politically explosive reductions to social safety-net spending.\nJohnson might not have succeeded in putting out every blaze, but he kept them from growing into a conflagration that even Trump couldn\u2019t extinguish. He\u2019ll probably have to do it again later this year after the Senate sends back revisions to the megabill.\nThe outlook for the legislation looked bleak throughout the past week, as various bands of holdouts resisted coming aboard.\nOn Wednesday night, for instance, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) \u2014 a conservative hard-liner \u2014 suggested the bill would potentially \u201chave to fail\u201d on the floor for leaders to realize it should be reworked. Moderate Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.) said he was \u201cnot happy\u201d with changes the conservatives had secured to more quickly eliminate clean-energy tax credits he\u2019d been working to defend.\nNeither ended up voting for the bill. Davidson was one of two House Republicans who voted \u201cno\u201d Thursday, and Garbarino missed the vote.\nBut Johnson had spent the week peeling off almost every other member \u2014 moving methodically between holdout groups, patiently working through a seemingly endless litany of issues.\nOn Monday night, after tentatively approving some key demands from fiscal hawks who had delayed a key Budget Committee vote, Johnson faced ire from the other side of the conference in a closed-door meeting.\nSeveral Republicans in the Main Street Caucus told Johnson they were frustrated that he was once again appearing to entertain politically explosive cuts to Medicaid \u2014 cutting the federal share of funding to states, known as FMAP \u2014 after the speaker had seemed to rule them out.\nSome of the centrist-leaning Republicans in the room pressed the speaker to publicly take the proposal off the table for good this time \u2014 and send a message to the hard right not to push further.\nRep. Max Miller (R-Ohio), a former Trump aide, spoke up to air his own irritation with how Johnson had managed the whole megabill process.\nIndeed, the speaker and his team\u2019s tactics had grated on many GOP members. They believed he had unwisely delayed settling the biggest battles until the final hours and had given disingenuous assurances to some at-risk Republicans that the Senate would intervene and block some of the bill\u2019s most unpalatable provisions.\nJohnson jotted down notes as members spoke. A few minutes later, as he walked back to his office, he told reporters, \u201cFMAP has not been on the table \u2014 it\u2019s been off the table for quite some time.\u201d\nHe had extinguished another fire. But it was time for Johnson to call in backup.\nThe next morning, Trump made a rare journey to the drab, poorly-lit Capitol basement to make his wishes clear. It was uncertain if he\u2019d stanch the disputes or toss more fuel onto them.\nThe visit came just a few days after the hard-liner rebellion had blocked the bill in the Budget Committee vote over concerns that the megabill would add trillions of dollars to the national debt.\nBefore he even walked into the meeting, Trump appeared to be looking to stoke conflict \u2014 dismissing the hard-liners\u2019 deeply held beliefs.\n\u201cI\u2019m a bigger fiscal hawk \u2014 there\u2019s nobody like me,\u201d he told reporters alongside Johnson, in response to a question about some of the hard-right concerns.\nInside the meeting, the president took on a kind of Rodney Dangerfield persona, House Republicans said \u2014 telling barbed jokes at lawmakers\u2019 expense.\nHe laced into the fiscal hawks and \u201cSALT Republicans\u201d pushing for the expansion of a key tax break \u2014 calling out \u201cgrandstanders\u201d by name who sought to stand in the way of his \u201cone big, beautiful bill.\u201d\n\u201cHe insulted several people with a great intensity,\u201d said one bewildered House Republican, who like others was granted anonymity to speak candidly about private meetings and conversations.\nTrump\u2019s tongue lashings and Johnson\u2019s hardball approach to muscling the bill through this week rattled some even long-time GOP lawmakers. It was clear there was no room for dissent.\n\u201cI could never have imagined when I started in politics that we would have this kind of a scenario,\u201d one House Republican said of the our-way-or-the-highway approach. \u201cBut who else do we turn to, besides Johnson?\u201d\nNear the end, the speaker needed to douse one last blaze: The hard-line House Freedom Caucus was balking and pushing for concessions on Medicaid that other Republicans simply would not accept.\nA White House meeting was arranged with the holdouts, and Johnson sat in with top lieutenants as Trump unleashed the fire hose \u2014 pressing Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Andy Harris of Maryland and other hard-liners to vote for the bill.\n\u201cIt was tough. There was no back and forth,\u201d said one Republican briefed on the meeting. \u201cHe let them have it.\u201d\nJohnson returned to the Capitol triumphant. \u201cThe plan is to move forward as we expected,\u201d he told reporters.\nRoy and Harris then huddled through the night with White House officials including Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair and Legislative Affairs Director James Braid. The hard-liners pushed for, and said they secured, promises for executive orders to address Medicaid and other items on their wish list.\nMeanwhile, as night turned to morning over the course of a nine-hour vote series, Johnson huddled one-on-one with several previously balking members on the floor.\nRep. Michael Cloud of Texas, a fiscal hawk who a few days earlier had said the bill \u201cfell short,\u201d spoke to Johnson around 3 a.m. Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia, who won a key concession ending the taxation of gun silencers, sat with the speaker later in the morning.\nAnd just before Republicans passed the massive bill a little before 7 a.m., the speaker and Miller spoke for several minutes, ending their conversation with a handshake.\nUnlike several prior high-stakes votes during Johnson\u2019s speakership and predecessor Kevin McCarthy\u2019s, there were no dramatic scenes wrangling last-minute votes from the assembled hard-liners.\nHis team was confident the tough tactics had worked. \u201cThey always fold,\u201d one senior GOP aide said.",

        "Content": "Ousted head of Copyright Office challenges Trump administration in court\nThe White House\u2019s attempt to seize control of the Library of Congress has run into opposition from key leaders \u2014 including Republicans.\nThe former head of the U.S. Copyright Office has filed suit against the Trump administration, arguing her abrupt ouster from the position violated the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.\nShira Perlmutter was fired by the White House in early May, just days after the administration dismissed the Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden. Her suit, filed Thursday in federal court in Washington, says only Hayden could legally have terminated her from the post.\n\u201cCongress vested the Librarian of Congress\u2014not the President\u2014with the power to appoint, and therefore to remove, the Register of Copyrights,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cAccordingly, the President\u2019s attempt to remove Ms. Perlmutter was unlawful and ineffective.\u201d\nHayden had served atop the Library of Congress since the Senate confirmed her appointment in a 74-18 vote in 2016. She chose Perlmutter to run the copyright office in 2020.\nThose named in the suit include Todd Blanche, Trump\u2019s pick to replace Hayden at the Library of Congress; Sergio Gor, director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office; and Paul Perkins, who the administration tapped to replace Perlmutter as register of copyrights.\nThe White House\u2019s attempt to seize control of the Library of Congress has run into opposition from key leaders \u2014 including Republicans \u2014 in the legislative branch who have questioned Trump\u2019s authority to select an acting successor for Hayden.\nThe Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which the White House maintains gives Trump the power to fill the post with an acting replacement, applies to executive agencies, and not an arm of the legislative branch, many lawmakers insist.\nPerlmutter\u2019s lawsuit builds on that interpretation.\n\u201cIn short, the President\u2019s attempt to name Mr. Blanche as acting Librarian of Congress was unlawful and ineffective, and therefore Mr. Blanche cannot remove or replace Ms. Perlmutter,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from POLITICO.",

        "Content": "\u2018They\u2019re the backbone\u2019: Trump\u2019s targeting of legal immigrants threatens health sector\nFederal policy changes are having spillover effects on everything from disease outbreak mitigation to long-term care\nThe Trump administration\u2019s efforts to strip protections from more than half a million legal immigrants could devastate the health sector, endangering care for the elderly and worsening rates of both chronic and infectious diseases.\nHundreds of thousands of health care workers, including an estimated 30,000 legal immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, are at risk of being deported \u2014 worrying providers and patients who rely on them for everything from nursing and physical therapy to maintenance, janitorial, foodservice and housekeeping work.\nGoodwin Living, a faith-based, not-for-profit elder care complex just across the Potomac River from D.C., is poised to lose 65 staff members following Supreme Court rulings on Friday and earlier in May that gave the Trump administration permission to terminate humanitarian parole and temporary protected status issued by prior presidents to migrants from several countries plagued by poverty and violence.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t even imagine the impact it would have on those of us that are cared for on a daily basis if we were to suddenly lose them,\u201d said Jill Miller, who has resided at Goodwin Living for eight years with her husband Carl. \u201cThey\u2019re the backbone.\u201d\nGoodwin Living is one of hundreds of long-term care facilities around the country that employ immigrants whose legal status will soon end, and its leaders have joined a chorus of providers from Florida to California warning that the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown will decimate care capacity and facilitate the spread of communicable diseases, putting U.S. citizens at risk.\nThese vulnerabilities underscore the precarity of the nation\u2019s patchwork immigration system. Immigrants \u2014 both documented and undocumented \u2014 make up a disproportionate share of the health care workforce, particularly in areas like long-term care for the elderly and people with disabilities, and their expulsion would make existing shortages much worse.\nYet Congress\u2019 decades-long inability to enact permanent fixes has left millions dependent on executive actions and discretionary programs that can be upended every time a new administration takes power \u2014 a situation people on all sides of the immigration debate agree is unsustainable.\nEven conservatives who favor President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to end humanitarian parole and temporary protected status acknowledge that doing so could harm several sectors of the economy \u2014 including agriculture and construction in addition to health care \u2014 but they argue the Biden administration misused those programs as a backdoor means of ushering in more permanent migration.\n\u201cThere are valid concerns, absolutely,\u201d said Simon Hankinson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cBut the solution we need is for Congress to determine what level of immigration we need, what skill level we need, what the conditions are, and then to pass laws. You can\u2019t just completely bypass Congress with executive action on immigration and expect this fragile edifice that we set up to survive.\u201d\nThe administration, meanwhile, dismisses the health industry\u2019s concerns.\n\u201cThe assertion that the only way we can take care of our seniors is by allowing unvetted illegal aliens and foreigners with criminal records to remain in the country is grossly false and lazy,\u201d DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cIf people want to come to our country to be caregivers for our seniors, they need to do that by coming here the legal way.\u201d\nWhen asked specifically about workers with temporary protected status and humanitarian parole \u2014 who entered the country legally after being vetted and sponsored \u2014 the agency did not respond. Past presidents have extended legal protections and work permits to hundreds of thousands of immigrants under those programs because they face dangerous conditions in their home countries.\nThe Trump administration is simultaneously ramping up enforcement, including in formerly off-limits spaces like hospitals and clinics. That\u2019s causing immigrants and their citizen relatives to avoid all kinds of medical care \u2014 from testing and treatment for infectious diseases to preventive care for chronic conditions like diabetes, driving up costs for taxpayers and threatening public health more broadly.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re afraid to even go to work or send their kids to school, they\u2019re certainly afraid to come to doctors\u2019 visits,\u201d said Sandy Reding, an emergency room nurse in Bakersfield and the president of the California Nurses Association. \u201cThey\u2019re not seeking medical attention when they should, and we\u2019re seeing time and time again that those delays in care are making things worse.\u201d\nReding said an uptick in Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity targeting her area\u2019s large population of migrant farmworkers has caused many to avoid care for conditions like diabetes and elevated blood pressure \u2014 leading to preventable amputations or strokes.\n\u201cAnd when it comes to things like measles and bird flu that are easily spread, it poses a threat to the whole community,\u201d she said.\n\u2018The quality of care will be poor\u2019\nA study published in the medical journal JAMA in April calculated that about a million non-citizen immigrants work in health care, including more than 366,500 who are undocumented. And no sector of the sprawling health care system would be harder hit by mass deportations than long-term care for the elderly and people with disabilities \u2014 where immigrants make up nearly 30 percent of the direct care workforce.\nIn an amicus brief opposing the Trump administration\u2019s bid to cancel humanitarian parole for half a million workers, the attorneys general for 15 states and Washington, D.C. noted that immigrants make up more than three quarters of home health aides in New York and nearly half in California.\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to begin deporting about a half-million immigrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole programs implemented during the Biden administration. The decision came less than two weeks after the justices granted another immigration-related emergency request from the administration, allowing officials to end temporary protected status for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans.\nGiven already severe shortages of workers for typically low-paid and challenging care economy jobs, and a looming spike in demand for long-term care services as Baby Boomers age, the elder care industry is warning of an impending crisis.\nRob Liebreich, the CEO of Goodwin Living, worries he may have to accept fewer residents and cut back services if his workers are deported. Reducing the supply of long-term care workers amid increasing demand will also drive up the cost of services as facilities compete for those who remain, he said. That, in turn, could force more aging Americans to depend on untrained family members as caregivers, which then pulls those people out of the paid workforce.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a real drain on the overall economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut more importantly, I just don\u2019t want to let down the current American older adult population, and we\u2019re absolutely going to let them down by not having enough hands to provide the services and support that they deserve and expect.\u201d\nLeadingAge \u2014 an advocacy group representing thousands of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, hospice programs and retirement homes around the country \u2014 echoed Liebreich\u2019s fears in a letter to the Department of Homeland Security in April, pleading with the agency to reconsider ending the parole program. They did not receive a response.\nThe Trump administration acknowledged some of these concerns in its March executive order canceling humanitarian parole for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, noting that there will be repercussions both for the individuals and their employers. Still, the order argued, both the immigrants and their employers knew that the protections were temporary and subject to the discretion of the federal government, and they should have applied for more permanent status.\nLiebreich said that while Goodwin Living has helped over 200 workers become citizens over the past decade and has set up the 65 currently at risk to meet with immigration attorneys, the Trump administration is closing off many of the other programs they would have been eligible for \u2014 like temporary protected status \u2014 and not giving them enough time to navigate the process.\n\u201cThey thought they had two years to work with, not mere months,\u201d he said.\nSaudatu Savage, a registered nurse at Goodwin Living who came as a refugee from Sierra Leone more than two decades ago and is now a U.S. citizen, said it will make her job much harder if dozens of her coworkers are forced to leave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are not a lot of nurses out there, and there are going to be more and more patients. So it will be a burden on us and it\u2019s going to affect the whole health care system, and I fear the quality of care will be poor.\u201d\nWith the workers\u2019 status in limbo, even some staunch conservatives are warning of negative ramifications of the administration\u2019s crackdown, and are calling instead for an increase in visas for immigrants to work in health care.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just do across-the-board reductions and not have real challenges in areas where vital workers exist, especially in health care,\u201d said Tom Price, a former GOP congressman who served as the health secretary during Trump\u2019s first term and now works as a consultant. \u201cIf you just have across-the-board reductions, it will harm our ability to continue to provide care for folks at all different levels, whether it\u2019s acute or chronic care.\u201d\n\u2018Measles doesn\u2019t care about your immigration status\u2019\nWhen measles erupted among children in Minneapolis\u2019 large Somali community in May 2024, the city contracted with groups that work with the area\u2019s Somali, Hmong, Latin American and Native American populations, set up free vaccine clinics in their neighborhoods run by trusted community groups, deployed contact tracers, and produced videos in multiple languages urging vaccinations.\nA few months later, after identifying 52 cases and hospitalizing 12 people, they had it under control.\nBut local officials fear that now, amid the biggest measles outbreak the U.S. has seen in decades, including a few cases in Minnesota, they may not be as successful.\nHealth care providers in Minneapolis and around the country are reporting that since Trump took office and changed federal policy to allow immigration enforcement agents to detain people in hospitals and clinics, immigrants with and without documents are avoiding health services, including testing and treatment for infectious diseases and vaccinations.\n\u201cWhen people feel threatened, there\u2019s a chilling effect,\u201d said Michelle Rivero, the director of the city\u2019s Office of Immigration and Refugee Affairs, which was founded during the first Trump administration. \u201cThere is a greater sense of fear and anxiety with regard to accessing health care.\u201d\nThat chilling effect will be compounded, local officials warn, by the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to public health funding, which have forced the Minneapolis Public Health Department to shut down several vaccine clinics and end contracts with three community health organizations that were crucial in halting the 2024 measles outbreak: MHealth Fairview, Odam Medical Clinic, and Neighborhood HealthSource. The state\u2019s health department in April sent layoff and separation notices to 170 employees because of the funding cuts. Those employees worked in several areas including the state\u2019s response to measles.\nThe administration argued the funding should be cut because Congress had appropriated it to combat Covid-19 and the pandemic is over \u2014 though health departments around the country had been using the money to shore up defenses against other infectious diseases. Though a judge blocked the cuts from taking effect, that ruling could be overturned on appeal.\nAt a time when immigrant groups\u2019 already high distrust of government is even higher due to fears of immigration enforcement, said Deputy Health Commissioner Heidi Ritchie, public health departments won\u2019t be successful if they can\u2019t contract with non-governmental community groups to do outreach and provide services.\n\u201cWith the loss of those contracts, we can\u2019t be confident that we\u2019re able to serve a population when there\u2019s another measles outbreak,\u201d she said. \u201cMeasles doesn\u2019t care about your immigration status or your ethnicity. But when we are providing these clinics, they\u2019re free, and they are in community spaces that people already have trust with.\u201d\nUnder pressure from the Trump administration, several states including Minnesota and California are also rolling back programs that provide health insurance to undocumented immigrants, putting testing and treatment for infectious diseases further out of reach.\nIn addition to measles, public health leaders are concerned about the impact of Trump\u2019s immigration policies on efforts to combat tuberculosis \u2014 a bacterial infection the U.S. nearly eradicated decades ago that is now resurging from Kansas City to Los Angeles.\n\u201cPeople are, all of a sudden, a little bit leery of presenting themselves in congregate settings where they might be targets for enforcement,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. \u201cIt really is emanating out of a greater fear of those places being actively monitored by ICE.\u201d\nThe Trump administration and advocacy groups that want to restrict immigration say higher levels of tuberculosis in immigrant communities justifies turning people away at the border. But Freeman and other experts stress that while the infections are more prevalent in those communities, it has nothing to do with their country of origin and everything to do with crowded living conditions and a lack of access to vaccines, which is why TB outbreaks are also common in U.S. homeless shelters and prisons. By implementing policies that deter immigrants from seeking health services, she argued, the Trump administration could make the situation worse.\n\u201cWe are worried, from a public health standpoint, that people will tie tuberculosis outbreaks to immigrant communities unfairly and traumatize those groups even more,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cWe were fearful that it might be used by the administration to say, \u2018This is a disease they bring in. We\u2019ve got to get them out of the country.\u2019\u201d\nTo reach those fearful of coming in for services, some public health departments are ramping up telehealth services, while others are creating mobile units so that immigrants don\u2019t have to leave their neighborhoods. Still others are posting know-your-rights information in multiple languages for their patients, and coaching providers on what to do in the event of a raid.\n\u201cOur union has trained us on what to do if ICE comes into our hospitals,\u201d said the California Nurses Association\u2019s Reding. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been patient advocates but right now the need for that is even stronger.\u201d\nYet both research and anecdotal reports suggest that the health care repercussions of restrictive immigration policies can extend beyond their target populations and linger long after the policies themselves are lifted.\nA 2021 study found that the \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule in the first Trump administration \u2014 which penalized legal immigrants who used government safety net programs \u2014 led many low-income immigrants to avoid using health services, including more than a quarter of legal permanent residents, who were not subject to the rule. The chilling effect began years before the policy took effect, fueled by rhetoric from federal government officials, researchers found.\nAnother study, published in 2022, found that legal immigrants without green cards were still avoiding care more than a year after President Joe Biden got rid of the rule.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created fear and distrust of the health care system in the immigrant community even without enforcement,\u201d said Arturo Vargas Bustamante, a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. \u201cThis has big implications, including for mixed status households and U.S. citizen children, and it could be both costly and fatal.\u201d",

        "Content": "RFK Jr. threatens to bar government scientists from publishing in leading medical journals\nThe health secretary said the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet are in bed with pharma.\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threatened to stop government scientists from publishing their work in major medical journals on a podcast Tuesday as part of his escalating war on institutions he says are influenced by pharmaceutical companies.\nSpeaking on the \u201cUltimate Human\u201d podcast, Kennedy said the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet, three of the most influential medical journals in the world, were \u201ccorrupt\u201d and publish studies funded and approved by pharmaceutical companies.\n\u201cUnless those journals change dramatically, we are going to stop NIH scientists from publishing in them and we\u2019re going to create our own journals in-house,\u201d he said, referring to the National Institutes of Health, an HHS agency that is the world\u2019s largest funder of health research.\nHis comments come days after the White House released a major report, spearheaded by Kennedy, that says overprescribed medications could be driving a rise in chronic disease in children. The report suggests that influence from the pharmaceutical industry and a culture of fear around speaking out has drawn doctors and scientists away from studying the causes of chronic disease. It also comes after both JAMA and the NEJM received letters from the Department of Justice probing them for partisanship.\nKennedy\u2019s stance, however, conflicts with that of his NIH director, Jay Bhattacharya, who recently told a reporter with POLITICO sister publication WELT he supports academic freedom, which \u201cmeans I can send my paper out even if my bosses disagree with me.\u201d\nOn the podcast, Kennedy claimed the heads of the leading journals, including The Lancet Editor-in-Chief Richard Horton and the former editor-in-chief of the NEJM, Marcia Angell, also no longer consider their publications reputable.\nKennedy was referring to 2009 and 2015 statements, respectively, by Angell and Horton: Angell wrote it \u201cis simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published\u201d due to financial ties with pharmaceutical companies while Horton wrote about concerns about the replicability of scientific research.\nKennedy went on to say Horton \u201creally disgraced himself\u201d during the Covid-19 pandemic. Horton was at the center of a 2020 controversy when The Lancet retracted a study linking the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine to increased Covid-19 deaths. Horton said the publication would change its peer review process.\nThe London-based journal also published a letter from prominent scientists including EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak that said questioning whether Covid had a natural origin amounted to a conspiracy theory. A Trump administration website says that EcoHealth facilitated \u201cdangerous gain-of-function\u201d research at China\u2019s Wuhan Institute of Virology that President Donald Trump believes caused the pandemic. The Biden administration barred Daszak and EcoHealth from receiving further government funding, citing their failure to follow grant protocols.\nA JAMA spokesperson said the journal had nothing to add when asked about Kennedy\u2019s remarks, while NEJM and The Lancet did not respond to requests for comment.

        "Content": "The CDC is no longer recommending Covid vaccines for healthy children, pregnant women\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the decision without waiting for an agency advisory panel to vote.\nThe CDC is no longer recommending that \u201chealthy\u201d children and pregnant women get vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a post on X from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nThe CDC had recommended the vaccine to everyone at least six months old, including during pregnancy. Kennedy has long said that Covid vaccines are not safe, despite the medical consensus. The top U.S. vaccine regulator, Vinay Prasad, has said that the cost-benefit of the shots doesn\u2019t make sense for some groups, such as young men, who face an elevated risk of heart inflammation or myocarditis. POLITICO first reported last month that Kennedy was considering pulling the CDC\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine recommendation for children.\nMost Americans have stopped getting Covid vaccines. The most recent CDC data says about 1 in 8 children under 18 have received the latest shot while fewer than 1 in 4 adults age 18 and older have.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now one step closer to realizing President Trump\u2019s promise to make America healthy again,\u201d Kennedy said in a video, standing beside FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya. Kennedy cited \u201ca lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children.\u201d\nBut the change bucks the CDC\u2019s precedent for updating vaccine recommendations, which typically takes place after a panel of experts votes on changes. The CDC director can endorse or reject the recommendations, but historically has almost always deferred to the panel. A rare exception came in 2021 when then-CDC Director Rochelle Walensky overruled the advisers to offer wider access to Covid boosters. At the time, the panel had endorsed them only for older adults and others with underlying health conditions.\nTo win Senate confirmation, Kennedy promised Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chair Bill Cassidy (R-La.) that he would \u201cwork within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems\u201d and \u201cmaintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes.\u201d\nThe panel met in April but hasn\u2019t voted to update Covid vaccine guidance.\nThe decision to skip the vote is controversial.\n\u201cI\u2019m disturbed for a couple reasons,\u201d said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, which represents people who work in public health. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that they followed the normal process whereby you bring the advisory committees into this decision.\u201d\nBenjamin also said the decision raises questions about whether healthy children or pregnant women will continue to be able to access the Covid vaccination or whether insurers will reimburse for the shot.\n\u201cSudden changes in the time-tested process of approving and recommending vaccines create confusion that could reduce access to vaccines for those who need them and undermine trust in immunization,\u201d a spokesperson for the biotech trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization said in an emailed statement.\nHHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe World Health Organization recommends the Covid shot for pregnant women, any individual who is immunocompromised and children and adolescents with comorbidities.\nPrasad wants to test the efficacy of new Covid boosters in younger healthier populations in randomized controlled trials in which the shots are evaluated against a placebo. Because Covid boosters have not been tested in this way since the shots\u2019 initial approvals, he says it\u2019s not possible to know how effective they are in people who have been previously infected.\nLast week, the FDA published a framework for Covid-19 vaccines, which outlined a plan to limit the approval of future Covid vaccines to those 65 and older or people with an underlying condition, and to require new trials to prove the shots are effective for younger, healthy people.\n\u201cSeparate from my role as a regulator at the FDA, I\u2019m not encouraging or insisting young, healthy children to get a Covid shot unless there is new evidence that emerges that suggests there is a clear benefit with it,\u201d Makary said.\nBut other public health experts disagree.\n\u201cI\u2019m perplexed by this decision,\u201d said Mark Turrentine, an OB-GYN and professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. \u201cA lot of pregnant people died of Covid, especially during the Delta wave. And we know Covid still hasn\u2019t gone away. And we know pregnant people are a high-risk group. And we have a lot of data that the vaccine provides strong protection for both the mother and the baby.\u201d\nArthur Caplan, a New York University professor of medical ethics who has worked for the Covid vaccine maker Moderna, said the decision \u201cmakes little sense ethically or medically.\u201d\n\u201cPregnant women can lower transmission to vulnerable newborns by vaccinating,\u201d Caplan said in a text. \u201cPrevention is not just about death to the unvaccinated \u2014 it is to prevent hospitalization, ICU stays and long term chronic illness and death for others.\u201d\nDr. Rich Besser, a former acting director of the CDC under then-President Barack Obama and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, predicted the decision will impact insurance coverage of the vaccine \u2014 and exclude it from the Vaccines for Children program, which provides free vaccines that are part of the CDC\u2019s schedule to eligible children.\n\u201cIf a vaccine is not recommended for use in children, even if it ends up being approved for use, only those children who can afford to pay for it will be able to get vaccinated,\u201d Besser said.\nAlice Miranda Ollstein contributed to this report.",

        "Content": "RFK Jr.\u2019s report had a surprise target: Your doctor\nThe commission led by the health secretary says physicians often have the wrong prescription for America\u2019s ills.\nFrom food to pharma, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took on all the suspects he\u2019s long maligned in a report on health threats to kids \u2014 along with one unexpected one: Doctors.\nLaced throughout the report from Kennedy\u2019s Make America Healthy Again Commission are accusations against doctors \u2014 for reportedly being influenced by the pharmaceutical industry to overprescribe certain medications and for failing to treat the root causes of disease. The report, released Thursday, calls out the American Medical Association, the country\u2019s leading physicians\u2019 group, by name for adopting a policy the report claims discourages providers from deviating from standard practices and scientists from studying adverse vaccine reactions.\nThe surprise focus on physicians \u2014 softened in the report by calling them \u201cwell-intended\u201d \u2014 comes after weeks of furious lobbying by the food, pharmaceutical and farming industries who feared being demonized by the review.\nInstead, the report adopts an argument popularized by Kennedy and many of his colleagues in President Donald Trump\u2019s health department during the Covid pandemic, that the medical profession is dominated by groupthink and has been swayed by corporate interests. Doctors fear speaking out against conventional guidance, the theory goes, for fear of being ostracized. That, the report says, has curtailed research into the causes of chronic disease.\n\u201cThis report brings to the forefront a body of scientific research that has been largely ignored as we have been so busy as doctors in the modern health care system, billing and coding and seeing patients in short visits,\u201d Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters in a call Thursday.\nThe American Medical Association did not respond to requests for comment.\nKennedy has long opposed corporate influence in the health care world and has surrounded himself with deputies, including Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, who gained notice for criticizing the public health establishment for government missteps during the pandemic. They\u2019ve claimed that a culture of fear has prevented scientists and other public health experts from questioning why autism case rates have increased.\n\u201cScientists are often afraid to ask fundamental questions, for fear that they might get an answer that will lead to them being smeared by the press, being attacked by fellow scientists and losing their reputation,\u201d Bhattacharya told reporters Thursday. He also called much of medical literature \u201cunreliable.\u201d\nThe review, which Trump ordered Kennedy to pursue in February to assess chronic disease among children and seek solutions, says the rise in illness is likely the result of ultraprocessed food, exposure to chemicals, lack of exercise, stress and overprescription of drugs. It says physicians who diagnose and treat children with conditions including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depression are prone to \u201cover-pathologization\u201d of mental health issues in youth, preferring to medicate kids instead of trying to find the underlying causes of their illnesses and alleviate them.\nIt also criticizes industry-supported education of physicians, which it says \u201ctypically promotes drugs, encourages off-label prescribing, and contributes to polypharmacy in kids,\u201d which occurs when they take several medications at once.\nThe report calls out the AMA for adopting a policy calling for licensing boards to take disciplinary action against physicians who spread misinformation, an issue that became heated during the pandemic when some sought to punish doctors who prescribed off-label treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine for Covid.\nDoctors often experiment in this way, but the FDA said the treatments weren\u2019t effective and discouraged their use.\nPunishing doctors for deviating from government guidance \u201cdiscourages practitioners from conducting or discussing nuanced risk-benefit analyses that deviate from official guidelines \u2014 even when those analyses may be clinically appropriate,\u201d the report says.\nCarmen Paun contributed to this report.",

        "Content": "RFK Jr. says food and pharma are poisoning Americans. His big report says a fix is coming.\nThe Make America Healthy Again Commission that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. leads will release a strategy to combat chronic disease by summer\u2019s end.\nA much anticipated report led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says that children\u2019s health is in crisis and that it\u2019s likely the result of ultraprocessed food, exposure to chemicals, lack of exercise, stress, and overprescription of drugs.\nBut the report, from the Kennedy-led Make America Healthy Again Commission, shies away from the strident language Kennedy has used in the past in demonizing the food, farming and pharmaceutical industries, and leaves for another day proposals for how to improve kids\u2019 health. The accused industries have been lobbying furiously to persuade Kennedy to tone down the rhetoric.\nSolutions for the health crisis will come within 100 days, Kennedy promised reporters during a call Thursday.\nStill, the report paints a bleak picture, arguing that today\u2019s children suffer more from chronic diseases, such as asthma, allergies, obesity, autoimmune conditions, and behavioral disorders, than any previous generation.\nSimilar to his budget testimony earlier this month, during which he defended the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to cut his department\u2019s funding by more than 25 percent, Kennedy on Thursday said more money is not the answer. \u201cWe spend on health care two to three times what other nations spend, about $4.5 trillion a year, and we have the worst outcomes of any developed nation,\u201d he said.\nOn Capitol Hill, Kennedy has pointed the finger at some of America\u2019s most iconic food companies, accusing them of making kids sick for profit. At one hearing earlier this year, for example, Kennedy mentioned two Chicago firms, the Fruit Loops maker formerly known as the Kellogg Company, and the fast-food chain McDonald\u2019s and said they \u201cmass poison American children.\u201d\n\u201cIt needs to end, and I believe I\u2019m the one person who\u2019s able to end it,\u201d he said.\nHis critique of American drug companies has been just as withering, claiming their products are the third-leading cause of death in the United States.\nThe report says that over 40 percent of the roughly 73 million children in America have at least one chronic health condition and that it threatens both the economy and national defense.\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating to our military preparedness, with 74 percent of American kids who cannot qualify for military service,\u201d Kennedy said.\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year establishing the Make America Healthy Again Commission, tasking Kennedy to work with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and others to assess the causes of childhood chronic disease and develop a strategy to improve it.\nThe accused industries have banked on Rollins and Zeldin shielding farmers from Kennedy\u2019s attacks. Kennedy\u2019s opposition to pesticides and chemical weedkillers is well-known.\nAs a lawyer, he helped win a landmark lawsuit in which the plaintiff alleged that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup, caused his cancer.\nBut the EPA has found the product safe if used as directed and farmers have told Rollins the chemicals are vital tools in food production.\nThe report, in a major win for the industry, recommends no change in how the government treats them and suggests that any recommendations to come will be modest. \u201cPrecipitous changes in agricultural practices could have an adverse impact on American agriculture and the domestic and global food supply,\u201d the report states.\nRollins and Zeldin took pains in the call with reporters to stress that America\u2019s agriculture and chemical regulatory system are the best in the world.\n\u201cAs a representative of America\u2019s farmers and ranchers in Washington \u2014 second only I should say to President Trump \u2014 I have been gratified to work with my friends on the phone call and on the larger MAHA Commission to ensure that this report is not misinterpreted by some in the media to demonize American agriculture, but rather to show where opportunities exist to improve our technology, to improve our research and to improve our outcomes for a new and golden age in agriculture for America and the world,\u201d Rollins said.\nRather than new restrictions on farming practices, the report suggests the administration will seek to persuade Americans to change their eating habits by rewriting the country\u2019s dietary guidelines and restricting how low-income people can use food stamp benefits.\nThe report partly blames food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the federal school meals programs, for increased chronic disease, saying the programs have \u201cdrifted from their original goals.\u201d Just this week, USDA approved Nebraska\u2019s plan to ban the use of SNAP benefits to purchase junk food, the first state to receive a federal green light. Nebraska\u2019s Republican governor, Jim Pillen, will be at a White House event Thursday afternoon celebrating the release of the report, Rollins told reporters.\nSeveral other states are considering bans on the Trump administration\u2019s urging.\nBig changes are afoot for dietary guidelines. Those are typically updated every five years by USDA and HHS, with the next report due by the end of the year. The administration plans to accelerate that timeline.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to see is a whole new day on dietary guidelines, where federal nutrition advice will be sound, it will be simple, and it will be clear,\u201d Rollins said.\nThe guidelines will prioritize \u201cwhole, healthy and nutritious foods, such as dairy, whole milk, fruit, vegetables and meat and suggest limitations of food high in sugar and salt,\u201d she said.\nThe MAHA Commission report is critical of how prior dietary guidance didn\u2019t take a strong position on limiting ultraprocessed foods and accuses prior dietary guidelines \u2014 and their authors \u2014 of being \u201cunduly influenced by corporate interests.\u201d\nThe report also takes aim at pharmaceutical companies, but not as harshly as Kennedy has previously.\nIt warns that antibiotics, antidepressants, weight-loss drugs, and asthma medication are overprescribed and could be causing health problems. It calls for more study of their effects on children.\nThe report also promises more study of the childhood vaccine schedule \u2014 which has greatly expanded in recent decades \u2014 but doesn\u2019t endorse Kennedy\u2019s past claim that the increase could help explain the spike in autism diagnoses.\nMany in public health have described Kennedy as being \u201canti-vaccine\u201d because his criticisms of vaccines run so counter to medical research affirming their safety.\nThe report says vaccines do protect children from infectious disease, but raises concerns that vaccine side effects are not adequately tracked and not enough is known about their links to chronic disease.\n\u201cOur understanding of vaccine safety and any links to chronic disease would benefit from more rigorous clinical trial designs,\u201d the report says, including placebo testing as Kennedy has called for in recent congressional testimony.",

        "Content": "RFK Jr.\u2019s big report is coming. The GOP\u2019s farm and food allies are sweating.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s Make America Healthy Again Commission will assess the causes of childhood disease on Thursday.\nAn expected report Thursday from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. assessing the causes of chronic disease in children could test whether Republicans in Congress can get along with a Health secretary keen on regulating farm and food companies.\nRepublican lawmakers representing agriculture and food manufacturing districts have warned Kennedy to lay off, but they and the industries they represent are still fretting the report. They worry it will point to pesticides and food dyes as potential causes for kids\u2019 diseases and propose regulation that could cut profits and cost jobs. Even if Kennedy steers clear of regulatory proposals, they fear his report could dampen demand for the products their constituents make.\n\u201cWe have 88,000 farms in Missouri, and so my goal is to make sure that we feed Missouri and we feed the world, and we make sure that our producers have the tools they need to have the most effective crops, the healthiest crops,\u201d said GOP Rep. Mark Alford, who represents a broad swath of soybean and corn farms southeast of Kansas City.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s embrace of an environmental activist long on the far left of the Democratic Party worked out great in last year\u2019s election, and most Republicans in Congress endorsed Trump\u2019s decision to let Kennedy \u201cgo wild\u201d on health care.\nBut lately, they\u2019ve asked him pointed questions about what\u2019s coming in his Make America Healthy Again Commission\u2019s report. Kennedy has said repeatedly he believes food companies make people sick for profit.\nAt a Senate hearing this week, Kennedy told Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith that farmers have nothing to worry about from his report. He offered similar assurances to Republicans at a House hearing last week, including Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, whose Eastern Shore constituents use pesticides to protect their corn, soybeans and wheat.\n\u201cWe cannot make America healthy again without the partnership of the American farmers. We cannot be putting them out of business,\u201d Kennedy told Harris.\nKennedy also sought to assuage Republican Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, whose eastern Tennessee district includes a Mars candy plant that uses artificial dyes Kennedy believes are harming kids\u2019 brains. The plant produces the country\u2019s colorful peanut M&M supply.\n\u201cWe can all have some M&Ms and Little Debbies together,\u201d Fleischmann told Kennedy, adding: \u201cI think these dyes are safe.\u201d\nFleischmann got Kennedy\u2019s pledge to work with him and, so far, the GOP is holding its fire. When a POLITICO reporter asked Fleischmann about his concerns this week, he demurred, saying candymakers are more worried about cocoa tariffs than a crackdown on food manufacturing.\nOther Republicans are all-in on Kennedy\u2019s plans. During a confirmation hearing earlier this year, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville told Kennedy he thought one common dye, Red No. 3, which is used in candy, drinks and chips, causes cancer. \u201cWhat in the heck\u2019s going on?\u201d Tuberville asked.\nWhether Kennedy is successful in pursuing his goal of rooting out chemicals in our food will depend on whether he\u2019s able to win more such allies.\n\u2018Hijacked by radical groups\u2019\nKennedy\u2019s ideas about how to make Americans healthy \u2014 by restricting certain food ingredients and pesticides, removing fluoride from drinking water, and discouraging Americans from eating ultraprocessed foods, among other things \u2014 are reminiscent of European-style rules many GOP members despise.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be overregulated, and the regulations that we do have need to be based on science,\u201d said Alford.\nThe brother-in-law of a farmer, he co-led a letter in April signed by 78 other Republicans in the House and Senate urging Kennedy\u2019s MAHA Commission \u201cto use sound science and risk-based analysis in its policy decisions, particularly on crop protection tools and food-grade ingredients.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that our policy from the EPA and others who are trying to regulate farming in America are not hijacked by radical groups, environmental groups, that really want to see us go back 100 years in our farming practices,\u201d Alford told POLITICO.\nRepublican Sen. Chuck Grassley, whose home state of Iowa keeps the world fed on corn, soybeans and pork, also fears longtime GOP nemeses in the environmental movement are trying to infiltrate Trump\u2019s government.\nHe said stakeholders are telling him \u201cthat the creation of this MAHA report has lacked transparency,\u201d in a statement to POLITICO.\nGrassley said he wanted to know whether Kennedy and the staff working on the report met with food and agriculture executives or only with environmental groups. He also questioned whether Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and other members of the MAHA Commission that Trump created in February were consulted in developing the report.\n\u201cWe want to make sure sound science is the basis of these conclusions,\u201d Grassley said.\nMAHA\u2019s influence\nKennedy\u2019s report is expected to target pesticides as one of the many reasons for Americans\u2019 soaring rates of chronic disease, said one person familiar with the matter granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\nKennedy\u2019s opposition to pesticides is well-known.\nAs a lawyer, he helped win a landmark lawsuit in which the plaintiff alleged that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup, caused his cancer. The German conglomerate Bayer, which makes Roundup, is facing billions in legal liability from thousands of lawsuits alleging similar harm.\nManufacturers maintain that these chemicals, used as directed by EPA, are safe to use at very low levels \u2014 and Bayer denies glyphosate causes cancer.\nA decade ago, the International Agency for Research on Cancer declared glyphosate \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d but EPA, two years later, said it was \u201cnot likely to be carcinogenic to humans.\u201d Still, various studies have found links between glyphosate and some cancers and that the herbicide can have other adverse health impacts.\nThat has leaders of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement pushing back against congressional Republicans\u2019 concerns and accusing federal regulatory agencies of capture by the industries they\u2019re meant to regulate.\nIn a letter to Kennedy on Wednesday, movement leaders urged Kennedy to \u201cstand firm.\u201d\nFarm interests and their allies in Congress \u201cseek to protect corporations at the expense of the American families,\u201d wrote the more than 300 signatories, including Dave Murphy, Kennedy\u2019s former campaign finance director; Zen Honeycutt, Moms Across America\u2019s executive director; and Marla Maples, the co-founder of the Global Wellness Forum and Trump\u2019s ex-wife.\nLobbying ramps up\nFarm and food lobbyists are blowing up lawmakers\u2019 phones and ratcheting up spending as they seek to counter accusations from Kennedy and push back on the charges they fear his report will level.\nFarm groups are especially peeved the administration has essentially brushed off their concerns about how the report will treat pesticides.\n\u201cShould the MAHA Commission report baselessly attack and, worse yet, make claims that are simply untrue against the hardworking men and women who feed our nation, it will make further cooperation on this initiative very difficult and potentially put American food production at risk,\u201d groups like the National Corn Growers Association and the International Fresh Produce Association wrote in a recent statement.\n\u201cGrower groups are becoming furious that we\u2019ve asked for meetings and have heard nothing,\u201d said one person close to the pressure campaign.\nBayer, the maker of Roundup, earlier this month stood up an interactive exhibit in Washington\u2019s Union Station, a short walk from the Capitol, about the importance of pesticides for keeping food prices low. In an interview last week, Bayer CEO Bill Anderson said that Kennedy has still not responded to his request for a meeting.\nWhile Trump largely favored traditional GOP farm interests in his first term, he\u2019s embraced Kennedy\u2019s agenda in his second. Trump believes Kennedy\u2019s endorsement last August helped him beat Kamala Harris and will also help Republicans in Congress keep their majorities in next year\u2019s election.\nBig food companies are finding that even their friends on Capitol Hill are less inclined to take their calls.\nIt\u2019s \u201csort of get on board and get out of the way,\u201d described one food industry lobbyist granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.\nGrassley said in floor remarks Wednesday that he had concerns that key farm groups have struggled to get meetings with the administration about the report.\n\u201cI want everybody to know that I\u2019m watching this report closely that\u2019s coming out tomorrow, and I hope it reflects what [Secretary] Kennedy told me when I met with him in my office,\u201d said Grassley, referencing Kennedy\u2019s pre-confirmation promises to support the use of pesticides.\nMajor conglomerates and trade associations whose products the MAHA movement have targeted have brought on new lobbying help or ramped up their spending since Kennedy was tapped to lead Health and Human Services.\nPIM Brands, the parent company of Welch\u2019s Fruit Snacks, retained top K Street firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck in April to work on \u201chealth care-related matters affecting the food industry.\u201d\nNestl\u00e9, one of the country\u2019s most prominent sweets manufacturers, boosted spending by almost 40 percent to more than $377,000 in the first quarter of the year compared to the same time in 2024.\nAnd lobbying spend for Mars, the M&Ms producer, increased by over 57 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the first quarter of 2024.\nMeanwhile, the National Oilseed Processors Association \u2014 Kennedy believes seed oils are unhealthy \u2014 hired the all-GOP firm CGCN Group to tout the \u201cimportance of the domestic oilseed processing industry to the U.S. economy and American agriculture,\u201d according to disclosures.\nAlso in April, soft drink giant Coca-Cola enlisted the help of another firm, Kountoupes Denham Carr & Reid, to work on a range of issues related to the beverage industry, including trade and tax policy and food issues. Industry rival PepsiCo \u2014 whose non-soda brands include Lay\u2019s chips, Doritos and Cheetos \u2014 retained BGR Group to lobby Congress on issues related to the food and beverage industry, disclosures show. The firm is known for its strong ties to GOP lawmakers.\nFollowing Trump\u2019s election last year, the American Beverage Association, which counts Coca-Cola and Pepsi as members, hired Trump-tied firm Continental Strategy. The trade group reported dropping $790,000 on lobbying last quarter \u2014 the most it\u2019s spent in a single quarter since 2010.",

        "Content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sparred Wednesday with Democrats over President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to cut more than $30 billion from the HHS budget during Kennedy\u2019s first public appearance on Capitol Hill since his confirmation as secretary of Health and Human Services. The hearing before the House Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for writing HHS\u2019s spending bill for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, was the first round in what is set to be an epic spending battle. Democrats on the committee want to stop the cuts, which would amount to more than a quarter of the HHS budget, but lost the first big spending fight of Trump\u2019s term in March. Then, Democratic colleagues in the Senate decided to back a GOP spending bill that held fiscal 2025 funding flat and failed to rein in spending cuts and layoffs implemented by Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency initiative. On Wednesday, the panel\u2019s Democrats repeatedly pressed Kennedy about the magnitude of the cuts Trump has proposed and asked him to promise to spend the money Congress gives him. Kennedy said he would, but also justified the proposed cuts, painting them as a streamlining of a department that has grown bloated and inefficient. \u201cWe intend to do more, a lot more with less,\u201d Kennedy said, adding that he was reorganizing his agencies to root out redundant and wasteful programs and better combat chronic disease. \u201cWe committed to delivering more efficient, responsive and effective services to the over 100 million Americans who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and other programs.\u201d Democrats sought to point out the contradiction, since the administration has not spent some of the money Congress appropriated for HHS\u2019s use in the current fiscal year. \u201cThe evidence suggests that you are cutting billions of dollars in funding right now. The evidence shows that you are withholding at least $2.7 billion in lifesaving NIH resources, and that is only mid-way through 2025,\u201d said Connecticut Democrat Rosa DeLauro, the panel\u2019s ranking member. \u201cBased on the evidence, I believe, and the OMB director has indicated, that you are going to illegally impound billions of dollars of congressionally appropriated funding.\u201d But March\u2019s spending fight showed that Democrats have few options to push back on the cuts without help from across the aisle. Democrats could be put in a similar position later this year if Republicans can coalesce around a budget and force Democrats to choose between shutting down the government to force Republicans to rewrite the bill, or rubber stamp whatever the GOP has passed. Much will hinge on whether House Republicans are able to pass a bill on their own despite their slim seven-seat majority, or need Democrats\u2019 help.",

        "Content": "Trump admin cancels layoffs for some health workers ahead of Kennedy hearing\nThe move reinstates some employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \u2014 which lost more than 90 percent of its workforce.\nThe Trump administration on Tuesday asked some of the thousands of federal public health workers it laid off to return permanently, according to emails shared with POLITICO.\nThe move reinstates employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \u2014 which lost more than 90 percent of its workforce, several hundred people, as part of the administration\u2019s broader purge of tens of thousands of federal health agency staffers last month.\n\u201cYou previously received a notice regarding the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) upcoming reduction in force (RIF). That notice is hereby revoked. You will not be affected by the upcoming RIF,\u201d read one NIOSH employee\u2019s notice, seen by POLITICO.\nThe letters followed weeks of outcry from lawmakers, labor unions and public health experts who described the devastating effects the cuts could have, and one day before Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to make his first public appearance before Congress since his confirmation.\nKennedy has said HHS is filled with duplicative and wasteful offices and needs to be slashed, but has over the last month walked back many of the cuts, including to offices that processed Freedom of Information requests and researched women\u2019s health.\nOn Tuesday, letters went to workers on several NIOSH teams gutted April, including the Respiratory Health Division, the Division of Safety Research, the Division of Compensation and Analysis Support, the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, and part of the Division of Field Studies and Surveillance. These offices, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, conducted research and provided direct services to workers in fields with high health and safety risks, including firefighters with cancer and coal miners with Black Lung Disease.\nAn HHS spokesperson declined to answer how many employees received similar notices, but said in a statement that the workers were rehired because \u201cthe Trump Administration remains committed to supporting coal miners, who play a vital role in America\u2019s energy sector\u201d and recognizes \u201cthe courage and selflessness of firefighters, who embody the principle that public service is the highest calling.\u201d\nThe administration has defended the cuts as lawful \u201cstreamlining\u201d of a \u201cbloated\u201d agency, but a judge Friday night deemed them likely unconstitutional and blocked them temporarily. The Department of Justice is appealing the decision.\nKennedy heads to the Hill Wednesday to testify before House and Senate committees about the president\u2019s budget, the first opportunity for lawmakers to grill him about the mass layoffs and his sweeping overhaul of the Department of Health and Human Services. According to Kennedy\u2019s prepared remarks, posted by the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, he plans to defend ongoing efforts to \u201ccut government bloat,\u201d promising \u201csignificant workforce reductions\u201d in the months ahead. The opening statement makes no mention of NIOSH, but says the agency will become \u201cmore responsive and efficient, while ensuring that Medicare, Medicaid, and other essential health services remain intact.\u201d\n\u201cDemocrats are going to hold Senator Kennedy\u2019s feet to the fire,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during a Tuesday press conference. \u201cWe\u2019ll demand answers about the cuts and the firings. We\u2019ll demand answers about the chaos, confusion and uncertainty.\u201d\nMost of the divisions restored Tuesday are based at NIOSH\u2019s Morgantown, West Virginia facility, though some are headquartered at the agency\u2019s outpost in Cincinnati, Ohio. In a Tuesday email to staff, seen by POLITICO, NIOSH Director John Howard noted that only a fraction of workers whose jobs were recently eliminated have been asked back, and said he would \u201ccontinue to make the case for reinstating everyone.\u201d But he called the partial cancellation of layoffs \u201ca recognition of the importance of much of our work.\u201d\nHoward\u2019s email did not specify how many workers were impacted. The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents NIOSH workers and recently sued the administration over the cuts, said it\u2019s working to determine how many layoff notices were rescinded. The union confirmed, however, that some of the reinstated employees are on teams that manage the congressionally mandated National Firefighter Cancer Registry, Health Hazard Evaluation program, and Respirator Approval Program.\nHHS officials have repeatedly pledged to maintain these programs, but government websites say they are no longer operating, and NIOSH workers told POLITICO legally required data collection and health and safety investigations were halted by the cuts.\nSen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said Tuesday that Kennedy promised her in a phone call that \u201cover 100 [NIOSH] Morgantown employees will be returning to the job permanently.\u201d\nThe administration slashed around 400 jobs at the West Virginia outpost of NIOSH \u2014 including 185 union members. Some were called back a few weeks later, but told they would be laid off permanently in June or July.",

        "Content": "Wellness CEO files ethics complaint against top RFK Jr. adviser\nAn internal MAHA battle is breaking out between an HHS employee who co-founded a health care payments company and a CEO of a rival company.\nAn internal battle has emerged inside the \u2018Make America Healthy Again\u2019 movement, with the CEO of a supplements company and a top adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. leveling accusations against each other that include making threats of retribution, conflicts of interest and leaking false information to far-right activist Laura Loomer.\nAt the center of the fight are Peter Gillooly, CEO of The Wellness Company, and Calley Means, who in addition to serving as an adviser to RFK Jr. is the co-founder of a health care payments company and the brother of Casey Means, who was recently nominated to be the next surgeon general by President Donald Trump.\nIn a formal complaint to the Office of the Special Counsel and other agencies filed Saturday and obtained by POLITICO, Gillooly accuses Calley Means of abusing his position at HHS and violating the law prohibiting conflict of interest in government services by threatening to involve Kennedy and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya in the dispute.\n\u201cIf one more thing happens, I\u2019m going to go to Jay Bhattacharya and Bobby and tell him that you and your cadre of Peter McCullough and Kelly Victory are spreading lies and trying to fuck with him and hurt his administration,\u201d Means said, naming two members of the company\u2019s medical board, in a recording of a Saturday morning call between him and Gillooly obtained by POLITICO. (The transcript of the call is quoted in the complaint.)\nDuring the call, Means accused The Wellness Company, a supplement vendor led by a medical board of vaccine opponents that is regularly promoted on conservative media, of leaking false information about his own company, Truemed, to Loomer. Truemed provides customers with doctors\u2019 letters that allow them to use pre-tax dollars to purchase health and wellness products via their health insurance plans.\n\u201cI am going to sue the shit out of you and escalate this if it continues,\u201d said Means, who is currently serving as a special government employee. In that role, Means is allowed to serve in a temporary capacity without having to step away from his personal business.\nThe dispute puts on display the competing interests within Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement which has swiftly gained power and influence during Trump\u2019s second term. The MAHA coalition has reshaped the federal government\u2019s approach to health care as Kennedy has ousted roughly 25 percent of HHS staff and empowered vaccine opponents, wellness entrepreneurs and alternative medicine advocates with little to no government experience.\n\u201cI received information that the Wellness Company was actively spreading provably false information about Truemed,\u201d Means said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cI called the CEO of the Wellness Company and threatened legal action if he continued to spread this provably false information. I noted I would prefer they stop spreading provably untrue information before I was forced to take legal action.\u201d\nA lawyer for Truemed sent a cease and desist letter to Gillooly and The Wellness Company founder Foster Coulson on Monday, stating they have reason to believe the company spread false information about Truemed with Loomer for the purposes of embarrassing a competitor, according to a copy of the letter obtained by POLITICO.\nCoulson denies sharing information with Loomer. \u201cI have never spoken to Laura Loomer in my entire life,\u201d Coulson told POLITICO. \u201cUsing the government to essentially weaponize them against a private company is extremely concerning and is a tremendous threat.\u201d\nThe confrontation appears to have been prompted by a Friday post on X from Loomer accusing Means and Truemed of committing tax fraud by auto-generating doctors\u2019 letters without authentic medical review.\nReached by POLITICO, Loomer denied being sent any information about Means and said she did not know Coulson. \u201cI look up stuff on my own,\u201d Loomer said.\nMeans accused Coulson of sharing \u201cincorrect information\u201d about Truemed with people like Loomer, possibly as part of an effort to cut in on Truemed\u2019s business. Following Truemed\u2019s business model could save The Wellness Company\u2019s customers 30-40 percent on their supplements, Means told Gillooly during the call. \u201cNow, that should be something that you guys partner with us on but since you guys have a telehealth platform and if you guys wanted to do that and compete that would be maybe even a good idea,\u201d Means said.\n\u201cHe clearly states that if I do not accept his accusation and comply \u2014 which I am not guilty of in the first place \u2014 he will sue myself and my business,\u201d Gillooly wrote in the complaint. \u201cAdditionally, Means threatens to blackmail my private corporation with HHS executive leadership if we do not comply with his demands, and extort my business into transacting with Truemed.\u201d\n\u201cI think there needs to be a thorough investigation because this sort of behavior has no place in the federal government,\u201d Gillooly told POLITICO.\nThe complaint was submitted Saturday to the Office of Special Counsel, HHS Office of Civil Rights, HHS Office of Inspector General and the Federal Trade Commission.\n\u201cIn order to protect the integrity of our investigative process, HHS is unable to confirm any specific investigations or inquiries that may be taking place within the office,\u201d an HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe Office of Civil Rights thoroughly reviews each complaint and determines if it has the legal authority to review and investigate the complaint.\u201d\nThe Office of Special Counsel, which handles complaints of government employee wrongdoing, and the HHS inspector general declined to comment. The FTC did not respond to a request for comment.",

        "Content": "Trump promises to slash drug costs, tying US prices to those paid abroad\nThe push will likely draw lawsuits from the pharmaceutical industry.\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday revived a plan to tie prescription drug prices in the U.S. to what other nations pay for medicines.\nHis executive order, which was first reported by POLITICO, still leaves many questions about how the administration will implement a so-called \u201cmost-favored nation\u201d policy.\n\u201cFor years, pharmaceutical and drug companies have said research and development costs were what they are,\u201d Trump said at a Monday press conference. \u201cAnd for no reason whatsoever, they had to be borne by America alone. Not anymore they don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe order directs U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to ensure other nations do not \u201cpurposefully and unfairly undercut market prices and drive price hikes,\u201d in the U.S., according to a White House fact sheet.\nWithin a month, the federal health department is supposed to convey most-favored-nation price targets to drugmakers \u2014 a step the White House says should bring prices for Americans in line with \u201ccomparably developed nations.\u201d If that is not accomplished, Trump directed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to propose regulations to implement most-favored nations pricing.\nTrump on Monday posted on Truth Social that drug prices would be cut by 59 percent, a day after he posted on the social media platform that the U.S. will \u201cpay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.\u201d\nDuring his press conference, Trump clarified that the price would be based on what other wealthy nations pay.\n\u201cPrescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%,\u201d Trump posted on Sunday evening. \u201cThey will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA!\u201d\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated last October that setting maximum allowed prices for drugs based on prices outside the U.S. would lower average drug prices by more than five percent.\n\u201cBig Pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we will use the power of the federal government to ensure we are paying the same price as other countries,\u201d Trump said.\nHe also hinted that the goal of the policy was to facilitate direct sale of drugs to Americans at the most-favored nation price by cutting out middlemen, presumably a reference to the pharmacy benefit managers who negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers and companies.\nDrugmakers have long blamed them for the high prices Americans pay.\nThe push, which Trump announced in the White House alongside Kennedy and other health agency leaders, will almost certainly draw lawsuits from the pharmaceutical industry. A federal judge struck down Trump\u2019s most-favored nation policy during his first term in 2020 because the administration didn\u2019t follow rulemaking procedures mandated by Congress.\n\u201cThis Foreign First Pricing scheme is a bad deal for American patients,\u201d said Steve Ubl, CEO of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the lobbying arm of the brand name drug industry, in a statement. \u201cIt jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\u201d",

        "Content": "How Trump\u2019s last-minute contract decision sent brains to the grave\nBrain banks stopped taking donations as their contract expiration date approached.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s push to cut billions of dollars in government contracts is rattling the niche community of scientists who collect, study and share human brains.\nTwo of the country\u2019s brain banks, which have worked with the government to store and distribute specimens to researchers studying diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and ALS for more than a decade, told POLITICO they had temporarily stopped taking new donations for fear the administration would not renew their contracts. Even though both facilities \u2014 home to nearly 8,000 brains between them \u2014 eventually received six-month extensions from the National Institutes of Health, the relief came too close to a May 1 deadline.\nThe director of the University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank said it turned away as many as 30 brains from people hoping to do something positive with the remains of a loved one who lived with a neurological disease. The Mount Sinai Brain Bank in New York would have accepted roughly 10 more if it had known its contract was being renewed, according to its program director.\nThe funding whiplash demonstrates some of the practical consequences of the Trump administration\u2019s rapid-fire approach to cutting federal spending, where even the potential for funding lapses create real setbacks.\n\u201cNot knowing when, or even if this extension was going to happen, it was very problematic,\u201d said Tom Blanchard, director of Maryland\u2019s brain bank. The window for collecting a brain for research after death is short: just 24 hours, so families of would-be donors had little choice but to give up.\nUnsure whether it\u2019d be able to pay staff after April, Mount Sinai Brain Bank sent layoff notices to its nearly two dozen employees, then revoked them when it learned of the funding extension less than 18 hours before the deadline, said program director Harry Haroutunian.\nIn the month before the contract expiration, the program, which stores 2,640 brains in 43 freezers set at minus 80 degrees Celsius, stopped taking them. Mount Sinai typically takes two brain donations a week.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t about to accept a donation and then not be in a position to actually characterize the brain and distribute it to our investigators,\u201d Haroutunian said.\nWhen asked to respond to researcher concerns about funding uncertainty, a spokesperson at the Department of Health and Human Services said that leaders at HHS, the parent agency of the National Institutes of Health, maintain continuous communication with NIH leadership to ensure smooth funding. The spokesperson said NIH remains committed to \u201crigorous, Gold Standard Science.\u201d\nFrustrated donors\nSusan Mojaverian felt heartened by the idea of donating her brother James\u2019 brain to the NIH. She\u2019d discussed the plan with him prior to his death last month. James, who died at 72, was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 16.\nFurthering research into schizophrenia was important to them. Susan and James participated in an NIH schizophrenia sibling study where they traveled to the agency\u2019s Bethesda, Maryland, campus for days of psychological tests and MRIs.\nResearch on donor brains has helped scientists understand the genetic risk for schizophrenia, shown distinct scarring patterns on the brains of servicemembers who suffered blast injuries and helped identify cells that contribute to developing Down syndrome.\nThrough the NIH\u2019s NeuroBioBank, researchers around the world can search an inventory of thousands of brains across the six repositories, refine their search by diagnosis, age, race, gender and brain region, then order brain tissue by volume, weight or number of brain sections. The NIH manages researcher requests, while the repositories collect and prepare the donor brains, fulfill orders and mail out tissue. All scientists pay is shipping.\nWithout the NIH program, brain donor research would be prohibitively expensive, said Blanchard. A single piece of brain tissue could cost $250 through a commercial lab, he explained, and researchers need to purchase enough samples to produce statistically significant results \u2014 plus buy control group samples. Without the federally funded network saving them millions of dollars a year, researching human tissue might be too expensive for some scientists.\nThe loss of the brains at Maryland and Mount Sinai could have consequences for research, he added, pointing to the brains of Parkinson\u2019s patients: \u201cEverybody wants to study the same small region of the brain, the substantia nigra,\u201d Blanchard said, adding, \u201cEven though we have the whole brain, for the Parkinson\u2019s research community, they get exhausted quickly.\u201d\nWhen Mojaverian contacted the director of the NIH\u2019s Human Brain Collection Core by email, he offered his condolences and the Maryland brain bank\u2019s phone number. He added a note in his reply, stressing the importance of James\u2019 donation. \u201cFor UMD: the decedent was extensively studied at NIH as a participant with schizophrenia. It would be important to acquire this brain if at all possible.\u201d\nLater that day, Mojaverian approached Maryland about making the donation, and was told it wouldn\u2019t be possible.\nMaryland\u2019s donor portal was clear about the reason why: \u201cDue to the uncertainty of federal funds UMBTB is anticipating a funding gap, that will impact our ability to collect donations. We cannot anticipate how long this funding gap will be.\u201d\nBy the time Maryland learned of its contract extension 16 days later, the window to accept James\u2019 brain had passed.\nMojaverian, who said she\u2019s had a good experience with NIH researchers and doctors over the decades, blamed the Trump administration for her loss.\n\u201cThis is the contribution that my brother, who had so much potential in this world and was never able to achieve it because of this severe and persistent mental illness \u2014 that he could be making this major contribution to science and somebody else would benefit from it,\u201d she said.\nMembers of Congress, including Republicans, have also complained about the administration\u2019s approach to cost-cutting.\n\u201cStability is a key aspect of the American formula because it allows scientists to focus their work knowing that they will have the support they need to pursue and test their ideas from start to finish,\u201d Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) said during an Appropriations Committee hearing last month.\nVice Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) put it more directly. \u201cTrump is committing deliberate sabotage at NIH and creating indefensible uncertainty that is making it impossible for researchers to do their jobs,\u201d Murray told POLITICO.\nA broader problem\nThe ambiguity and eleventh-hour funding decisions at the brain banks are indicative of a larger phenomenon the NIH-funded research ecosystem is grappling with as Trump reconsiders its work.\nAnother program that suffered funding whiplash was the Women\u2019s Health Initiative, an ongoing long-term national women\u2019s health study backed by an NIH institute.\nOn April 21, initiative investigators reported that HHS was terminating the program\u2019s regional center contracts. A few days later, following widespread news coverage, an HHS spokesperson told POLITICO the funding was being restored. It wasn\u2019t until May 5 that contractors received official confirmation.\nWithout timely communication, investigators were left to wonder whether HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s public comments calling the centers\u2019 work \u201cmission critical for women\u2019s health\u201d and the cuts \u201cfake news\u201d meant that HHS would maintain current funding levels, impose some funding reductions or whether nothing had changed and the cuts were still coming.\nHHS said that government procedures and bureaucratic processes held up officially notifying the group of restored funding.\nWhile renewing and restoring research funding have run up against the red tape of government processes and procedures, cuts have come more swiftly, with few signs that bureaucracy is holding them up.\nRegardless of the cause of the notification delay, the uncertainty had a chilling effect. Investigators, especially early career researchers, were reluctant to pitch new projects to the Women\u2019s Health Initiative. Staff worried about losing their jobs. Managers wondered how they\u2019d quickly wind down the 32-year-old project, notify the 42,000 participants and destroy or negotiate transfer of 4 million vials of frozen biospecimens.\nMeanwhile, the administration\u2019s decision to extend the brain bank contracts for six months doesn\u2019t end the banks\u2019 uncertainty. While Blanchard said he\u2019s optimistic in the wake of the renewal, if a month or two passes without word of the next review or funding meeting, his anxiety will return. While the October contract renewal should be for five years, he\u2019s concerned that his funding level could be cut, likely causing him to reduce donations once again or cut staff.\nNIH program officers told Mount Sinai\u2019s Haroutunian that maintaining the program\u2019s resources is an agency priority and that they expect to be able to renew the funding in October, he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s guesswork on everybody\u2019s part,\u201d he added.",

        "Content": "RFK Jr., DOGE gutted legally required offices. Courts may undo it all.\nFederal workers, Democratic lawmakers, state officials and independent legal experts say keeping offices afloat in name only \u2013 with minimal or no staff \u2013 is an unconstitutional power grab.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s purge of the health department is cutting so deep that it has incapacitated congressionally mandated programs and triggered legal challenges.\nThe administration insists the cuts are a lawful \u201cstreamlining\u201d of a \u201cbloated\u201d agency, but federal workers, Democratic lawmakers, state officials and independent legal experts say keeping offices afloat in name only \u2014 with minimal or no staff \u2014 is an unconstitutional power grab.\nWhile agencies have some discretion over how to fulfill Congress\u2019s demands, the upheaval inside the Department of Health and Human Services has claimed a host of programs the agency is required by Congress to maintain \u2014 cuts that are especially vulnerable to lawsuits and could upend Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s goal of slimming down a workforce he has repeatedly said is rife with waste, fraud and abuse.\nA federal judge Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping layoffs at several agencies, including HHS, saying that cooperation of the legislative branch is required for large-scale reorganizations.\nKennedy eliminated thousands of jobs in early April, paralyzing programs across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and particularly in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, that monitored health threats, researched cures and investigated everything from toxic fumes in fire stations to outbreaks of gonorrhea.\nThe layoffs at NIOSH have halted the National Firefighter Cancer Registry, Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program, Health Hazard Evaluation Program, Respirator Approval Program and Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program. All are required by law, but their government websites explain they are no longer operating because of the layoffs.\n\u201cIf the law requires you, the executive, to do this work, you have, in a back door way, thumbed your nose at Congress by firing the people who are actually necessary to get that work done,\u201d said Max Stier, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, whose mission is supporting the federal workforce. \u201cThe executive branch is supposed to execute \u2014 the name says it all. It doesn\u2019t have the right to determine where money is spent and how much money is spent. \u201d\nHHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told POLITICO that \u201ccritical initiatives under NIOSH will remain intact.\u201d\n\u201cThe Trump administration is committed to taking care of coal miners and firefighters, who play a vital role in supporting this nation,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cHHS remains fully committed to supporting American families and delivering critical services as part of its reorganization to better serve the nation\u2019s health.\u201d\nThe CDC was aware, however, that the moves could be legally problematic. In early April, Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency team \u2014 which pushed federal agencies across the government to slash their workforce by thousands \u2014 flagged to the agency\u2019s leadership that many programs on the chopping block were mandated by Congress and that cutting them posed a \u201clitigation risk,\u201d according to a memo sent to CDC and viewed by POLITICO.\nAnd while the administration has pledged that \u201cessential services \u2026 will remain fully intact and uninterrupted\u201d and has repeatedly claimed that core programs will transfer to the yet-to-be-created Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, interviews with staff and public notices on the CDC\u2019s website show that the programs are no longer operational.\n\u201cThe idea that you can have a program with no people in it and no money in it, and that somehow, then you have not eliminated it \u2014 that\u2019s just smoke and mirrors,\u201d a high-level CDC official, granted anonymity for fear of retaliation, told POLITICO. \u201cAHA, apparently, is where programs go to die.\u201d\nThe \u201cconfidential\u201d DOGE memo lists \u201cstatutory minimum requirements\u201d for several CDC offices, including NIOSH, and details which programs are mandated by Congress and for which the health secretary has discretion. Some workplace health and safety programs, DOGE stressed, only have to be maintained \u201cto the extent feasible.\u201d\n\u201cWe could argue this delegation is no longer feasible,\u201d the document says. \u201cBut there is a significant risk that a court would disagree.\u201d\nDays after the memo was sent, the Trump administration eliminated most or all of the staff running several programs mandated by Congress, bringing their work to a halt. Some employees were brought back in early May but told their jobs would be gone again in the coming months.\nThe budget request the White House sent Congress on May 2 proposed slashing more than a quarter of HHS\u2019 budget, a reduction of tens of billions of dollars, while allocating $500 million to the new \u201cAHA\u201d office that Kennedy said will take over many of the programs impacted by cuts. The budget also urges Congress to get rid of \u201cduplicative, DEI, or simply unnecessary programs,\u201d including the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control \u2014 which the DOGE memo said the department is legally required to maintain.\nSome congressionally mandated programs saw their entire staff dismissed, including the firefighter cancer registry that was created by legislation President Donald Trump signed in his first term. Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, said she and every other member of the National Firefighter Registry for Cancer team received notices that their jobs would be eliminated this summer.\nThe cancer registry, along with NIOSH\u2019s Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program, Health Hazard Evaluation Program, Respirator Approval Program and Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program, all state on their government websites that they are no longer operating because of the layoffs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how they\u2019re planning on actually doing \u2026 a meaningful scientific study, like it\u2019s supposed to be, if there aren\u2019t any scientists to work on that study,\u201d Niemeier-Walsh said.\nOther programs lost most but not all of their staff, but federal workers said those layoffs have left those who remain unable to do their work.\nAn official in NIOSH\u2019s National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, granted anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said all but seven of the more than 75 workers in that office were given layoff notices, rendering it \u201cno longer functioning.\u201d A notice on the lab\u2019s website reads: \u201cDue to the reduction in force across NIOSH, no new respirator approval applications can be accepted.\u201d\nThe official warned that the cuts have not only wiped out their ability to test and certify new types of respirators \u2014 as required by Congress since 2001 \u2014 but also to inspect the thousands of breathing masks the lab already approved. The official predicted this will lead to an influx of shoddy or counterfeit respirators and the loss of the public\u2019s trust in NIOSH\u2019s certification.\nBeyond the laws requiring these programs exist, there are federal laws that require workers wear NIOSH-approved protective gear, including health care workers who use filtering facepiece respirators and firefighters who use self-contained breathing apparatuses.\nStier, an attorney, believes these Trump administration cuts go \u201cbeyond their legal institutional authority.\u201d But stopping the layoffs and preventing new ones \u201creally requires the courts to do their jobs, and Congress, to stand up to an executive invading their prerogatives,\u201d he said.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration over the cuts, along with other unions representing federal workers and local government officials. They argued last week that \u201conly Congress has the power to change the federal government in the ways the President has directed.\u201d\nSenior U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco agreed, noting in her Friday ruling, which blocked Trump\u2019s executive order, that while the president may reorganize the executive branch, \u201che must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch.\u201d\nThe Department of Justice appealed the ruling, and the next hearing is scheduled for May 22.\nNearly two dozen Democratic state attorneys general have also sued over the \u201cevisceration of the Department\u2019s statutorily mandated work promoting public health\u201d in a Rhode Island federal court. Their complaint points in particular to cuts that have shuttered the CDC\u2019s Atlanta-based lab that analyzes samples of sexually transmitted infections from around the country, citing a notice the agency posted April 11 listing nearly 100 kinds of tests that are \u201cno longer performed at CDC\u201d \u2014 including those for gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis.\nSome lawmakers, including those who drafted the legislation that created and funded the now-gutted programs, are also pushing back.\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sponsored the 1992 bill that created the CDC\u2019s Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance System when he served in the House. Every employee working on the program, which tracks the safety and success rates of every fertility clinic in the country, was put on administrative leave in April and told they would lose their jobs this summer.\n\u201cCongress has the power of the purse,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cThis law has been on the books \u2014 I\u2019ve watched it carefully over the years. \u2026 It is stunning that somebody would call himself essentially Mr. Fertilization and then walk back [this] program,\u201d he added, referencing Trump\u2019s campaign statements in support of IVF.\nWyden joined with a dozen Democratic colleagues on a letter to Kennedy on Thursday demanding answers by May 16 to several question about cuts to the CDC team, including the justification for each worker\u2019s termination, whether and when they will be reinstated, whether Elon Musk was involved in the decision to cut the team, and what will happen to the data IVF clinics continue to submit to the now-shuttered office.\nSome Senate Republicans, including Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, are also telling administration officials and the public that they oppose the cuts, casting them as harmful to their constituents and a violation of Congress\u2019 power. But other lawmakers, while expressing fear about the impact of the layoffs on workers in their states, said they trust the president to make things right without Congress\u2019 involvement.\nWest Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice told POLITICO that he\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d but not \u201csuper nervous\u201d about the layoffs in NIOSH\u2019s Morgantown office that have hampered the congressionally mandated program which has screened coal miners for black lung disease for more than 50 years.\n\u201cThere is just plain no way that Donald Trump is going to do something to endanger the health of our coal miners \u2014 especially at the same time that we\u2019re asking more of them,\u201d he said, citing Trump\u2019s call to increase domestic coal production. \u201cEven if the jobs left us, which we don\u2019t want to believe, I do believe they\u2019re going to be merged into another organization. It may look a little different, but it will serve the purpose.\u201d",

        "Content": "\u2018Dismantling one of the strongest tools we have\u2019: Conservatives fret HHS cuts\nFired employees and conservatives say the gutted research teams\u2019 work aligned with the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpro-family\u201d messaging.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s decision to gut reproductive health research is alarming some conservatives, who worry it undercuts the president\u2019s pro-family agenda.\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. laid off thousands of federal employees last month, including about 80 who worked at the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s Division of Reproductive Health, according to three former CDC staffers granted anonymity to speak candidly on agency dynamics.\nThe office collected state and national data on live births, abortion trends and fertility treatment outcomes \u2014 the kind of information policymakers rely on to assess and improve maternal and infant health care, said Isaac Michael, a former HHS statistician who worked on the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System before he was laid off.\n\u201cIf you cut PRAMS, this is dismantling one of the strongest tools we have to prevent maternal deaths, to reduce infant mortality and to close socioeconomic health gaps,\u201d he said.\nMichael \u2014 who said he voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 based on his anti-abortion stance and supports the president\u2019s push to rein in federal spending \u2014 said ending PRAMS contradicts the administration\u2019s pro-family messaging. By tracking maternal health behaviors before, during and after pregnancy, Michael said the PRAMS team helped identify health disparities, evaluate the effectiveness of Medicaid and Women, Infant and Children (WIC) programs for pregnant people and understand causes of preterm birth and infant death.\n\u201cWithout it, we are flying blind,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWe lose the ability to see where we are failing mothers and babies until it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nTrump and members of his administration have been silent on the cuts. The White House did not respond to requests for comment about the future of the division\u2019s gutted programs.\nHHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in a statement to POLITICO that \u201ccritical programs\u201d from the CDC\u2019s Division of Reproductive Health \u201cwill continue under the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA) alongside multiple agencies and programs to improve coordination of health resources for American.\u201d\nPRAMS was one of multiple research teams within the division\u2019s women\u2019s health and fertility branch, which was wiped out by the layoffs, former CDC employees said. A fertility epidemiology studies team within the branch helmed projects like the CDC\u2019s contraception guidance for healthcare providers and an annual abortion surveillance report, which collected voluntary data about legal abortions. The division\u2019s field support branch, which deployed epidemiologists to states to improve maternal care, is also gone.\nThe cuts come as more American women died around the time of childbirth last year, reversing a two-year decline, according to provisional data released last month.\nPatrick T. Brown, a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, called the layoffs \u201cshort-sighted,\u201d suggesting it could backfire on the Trump administration\u2019s pro-family message.\n\u201cEspecially if we\u2019re going to be pumping more money or more rhetorical power into IVF or \u2026 maternal mortality, an area with a lot of bipartisan support, we should be investing in the kind of research that helps inform those debates and approaches,\u201d he said.\nBrown, whose work focuses on pro-family economic policy, said the cuts may force conservatives to rely on abortion surveillance data from groups like the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights think tank. On IVF, Brown noted that while not all conservatives support expanding its access through federal mandates, basic data on usage and success rates is still necessary to inform proper policymaking.\n\u201cThis is the kind of basic statistics gathering that there\u2019s just not really a good free market solution for,\u201d Brown said. \u201cCollecting data like this is a pretty classic function of government and it\u2019s not something that you can rely on private industry or even academic institutions to do in the same scope or scale.\u201d\nStill, Brown is not convinced the programs are \u201cgone for good.\u201d He said he suspects the Trump administration will eventually reconsider the cuts.\nEven groups hesitant to criticize Trump directly are sticking up for PRAMS.\n\u201cTools like PRAMS have real value when they\u2019re used to support vulnerable populations and guide evidence-based care,\u201d Mary Hodges, vice president of the National Association of Pro-Life Nurses, said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cIf this program is being phased out, we would encourage the development of new, transparent systems that preserve those strengths while aligning with a pro-life framework.\u201d\nPRAMS was temporarily paused earlier this year while HHS reviewed the program\u2019s compliance with the Trump administration\u2019s executive orders, according to Michael and the three other former CDC staffers. The team was greenlit to resume some operations in April \u2014 but then the workforce reduction hit, one former CDC staffer told POLITICO.\nA congressionally-mandated team working on assisted reproductive technology \u2014 the most common type being in vitro fertilization \u2014 was also a casualty of the layoffs.\nWhile some conservatives support the cuts as part of an overarching goal of shrinking the federal government, others fear it could weaken public health policy efforts that align with their values. Trump has made boosting birth rates and access to IVF a key plank in his agenda, referring to himself as the \u201cfertilization president,\u201d during a Women\u2019s History event at the White House in March. And in February, Trump signed an executive order aimed at expanding access to IVF and reducing out-of-pocket costs.\nBut those critical of the cuts are largely reluctant to criticize the Trump administration to avoid jeopardizing higher-profile goals, like reinstating strict FDA regulations on the abortion drug mifepristone.\nOne leader at a national anti-abortion organization, granted anonymity to discuss sensitive dynamics without upsetting allies in the Trump administration, said while he personally was \u201creally sad to see\u201d the programs eliminated, neither he nor anyone else he knows in the movement is planning to speak out against them.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just be the party of cutting,\u201d this leader said. \u201cWe also need to support life and support women.\u201d\nMayra Rodriguez, state director for the anti-abortion group Moms for Arizona, said when she voted for Trump she hoped he would purge federal agencies of ideological bias \u2014 not cut maternal and infant health research.\n\u201cTheir data needs to be better, but again, it is their data that has helped us pass a lot of legislation that protects life,\u201d said Rodriguez, who worked for Planned Parenthood before joining the anti-abortion movement.\nRodriguez said the CDC\u2019s abortion surveillance report has helped identify the gaps and inconsistencies in state-level abortion reporting, aiding the passage of legislation that monitors post-abortion complications among women.\nShe pointed to an Arizona law passed in 2018 that revised the state\u2019s abortion reporting requirements, mandating health care providers to report specific complications, including \u201cincomplete abortion retaining part of the fetus requiring reevacuation.\u201d\n\u201cIf we truly care about women and children, we need the data to improve health outcomes, and removing groups or organizations that do that contradicts the pro-life stance that we value both the mother and the child,\u201d she said.\nFor now, the division\u2019s Maternal and Infant Health branch remains \u2014 spared from the layoffs. But according to an HHS announcement about the department restructuring, the so-called Administration for a Healthy America will tackle maternal and child health issues, leaving the future of the branch uncertain. One former staffer warned that the remaining employees can\u2019t absorb the lost workload.\n\u201cThey won\u2019t be able to do it,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cThere are so few experts in this topic area throughout the country \u2026 they don\u2019t have the time or ability or institutional knowledge to continue these programs.\u201d\nAlice Miranda Ollstein contributed to this report.",

        "Summary": "Casey Means and brother Calley are favorites of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
        "Content": "The MAGA backlash to Trump\u2019s MAHA surgeon general pick\nCasey Means and brother Calley are favorites of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s new pick for surgeon general \u2014 wellness influencer Casey Means \u2014 is already the target of MAGA vitriol, underscoring a split inside the president\u2019s base over the future of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement.\nTrump\u2019s decision to select Means came just hours after news broke about his decision to withdraw Janette Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor, for the post.\nHer brother, Calley Means, reportedly helped connect Kennedy with Trump last summer before Kennedy dropped his own presidential bid and endorsed Trump. He is now a White House adviser.\nBoth siblings promote the idea that many chronic conditions can be prevented with lifestyle changes \u2014 like eating healthy and exercising \u2014 and, like Kennedy, often speak out against the food and pharmaceutical industries.\nThe siblings caught Kennedy\u2019s attention last year, when they appeared on an episode of Tucker Carlson\u2019s podcast. But Casey has proved a controversial pick. In an opaque post to X late Wednesday, Kennedy\u2019s former presidential running mate, philanthropist Nicole Shanahan, said Kennedy had promised her he wouldn\u2019t bring the siblings to HHS.\nLaura Loomer, a conservative influencer close to Trump who urged him to pull Nesheiwat\u2019s nomination, also criticized Means for not having an active medical license. In a post to X, Loomer accused Means of praying to \u201cinanimate objects\u201d and communicating with \u201cspirit mediums.\u201d However, several other MAGA influencers have lined up in support of the pick.\nCalley Means did not respond to a request for comment. An HHS spokesperson said the agency would respond to requests for comment on Casey Means\u2019 behalf, and directed POLITICO to Kennedy\u2019s post on X.\n\u201cThe absurd attacks on Casey Means reveal just how far off course our healthcare conversations have veered, and how badly entrenched interests \u2014 including Big Food and its industry-funded social media gurus \u2014 are terrified of change,\u201d Kennedy wrote.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Means:\n1. She graduated medical school, but dropped out of her residency\nMeans was trained at Stanford Medical School as a head and neck surgeon. But she dropped out of her surgical residency in the fifth year, a decision she has attributed to disillusionment with the medical system. She says it has not done enough to address the root cause of disease.\n2. She\u2019s echoed some of Kennedy\u2019s vaccine misinformation\nIt\u2019s not clear if Means shares all of Kennedy\u2019s concerns about vaccines \u2014 Kennedy has long argued that there\u2019s a link between rising autism cases and the childhood schedule of shots \u2014 but she has written in her newsletter that she wants to see the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 \u201creformed\u201d to allow lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers from patients with vaccine-related injuries. That\u2019s also a Kennedy priority.\nIn the same newsletter, she claimed, in defiance of medical consensus, that \u201cthere is growing evidence that the total burden of the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule is causing health declines in vulnerable children. This needs to be investigated.\u201d\n3. \u201cImpeccable \u2018MAHA\u2019 credentials\u201d\nMeans has dedicated her post-medical-school life to promoting healthy eating and lifestyle as a tactic to prevent chronic conditions \u2014 a world view in line with Kennedy\u2019s. She wrote a book with her brother called \u201cGood Energy\u201d \u2014 which makes the same case.\nMeans also co-founded Levels, a biowearables and health-tracking company funded by Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm whose founders endorsed Trump last year. One of Levels\u2019 co-founders, Sam Corcos, reportedly is now the Treasury Department\u2019s chief information officer.\nTrump summed up her academic and professional history as \u201cimpeccable \u2018MAHA\u2019 credentials\u201d in a Truth Social post Wednesday, and Kennedy called Means \u201ca breath of fresh air.\u201d\n4. She\u2019s already facing MAGA backlash \u2026.\nSince Trump announced Means\u2019 selection, she has become a target of Loomer, a social media personality who often has Trump\u2019s ear.\n\u201cMaybe @marcorubio can be Surgeon General and save us from this WOO WOO WOMAN,\u201d Loomer posted on X Thursday, referencing Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is concurrently serving as national security adviser following Trump\u2019s decision to remove another Loomer target, Mike Waltz, from the job.\nLoomer also came after Means for not having an active medical license: \u201cI would call her a Witch Doctor, but she doesn\u2019t even have a valid active medical license. So I\u2019m not going to call @CaseyMeansMD doctor.\u201d\n5. \u2026 and MAHA backlash\nMeans also attracted the (negative) attention of Kennedy\u2019s former running mate during his 2024 presidential bid, Shanahan. A lawyer, she was married to Google co-founder Sergey Brin until their divorce two years ago, Shanahan called the Means siblings \u201cartificial and aggressive\u201d like \u201cthey were bred and raised to be Manchurian assets,\u201d an apparent reference to the 1962 film \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate\u201d in which an Army sergeant is brainwashed by communists.\n\u201cI was promised that if I supported RFK Jr. in his Senate confirmation that neither of these siblings would be working under HHS or in an appointment (and that people much more qualified would be.),\u201d Shanahan wrote on X. \u201cI don\u2019t know if RFK very clearly lied to me, or what is going on.\u201d",

        "Content": "Navy set to rename ship honoring Harvey Milk amid DEI purge\nThe step furthers Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s agenda to stomp out DEI initiatives at the Pentagon.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to rename a naval vessel named after gay rights activist Harvey Milk, with several other ships honoring civil rights activists and women also potentially being rechristened.\nThe move targeting the ship named after the gay rights icon comes as LGBTQ+ communities kick off pride month celebrations across the country. The step furthers Hegseth\u2019s agenda to stomp out DEI initiatives at the Pentagon, which has included removing books from service academies and scrubbing some mentions of women and people of color in the armed services from DOD websites.\nTwo defense officials, who were granted anonymity to discuss a situation that is still evolving, said that USNS Harvey Milk name change will likely be announced around June 13, and that six other John Lewis-class replenishment and resupply ships \u2014 all named after civil rights leaders and prominent women \u2014 could also be renamed in the coming weeks and months.\nThe officials said that more ships might follow in the coming months. Military.com and CBS News first reported some details of the plans.\n\u201cSecretary Hegseth is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s priorities, our nation\u2019s history, and the warrior ethos,\u201d Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement. \u201cAny potential renaming(s) will be announced after internal reviews are complete.\u201d\nThe other ships in the class are the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, USNS Harriet Tubman, USNS Cesar Chavez, USNS Medgar Evers, USNS Dolores Huerta and the USNS Lucy Stone. There is no timeline yet for the renaming of these ships, one of the officials said.\nMilk served in the Navy before his political career. A member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, he was assassinated along with Mayor George Moscone in City Hall in 1978 by a former member of the board.\nThe planned erasure of barrier-shattering historical figures from the vessels is just the latest move in Hegseth\u2019s mission to stamp out any trace of diversity, equity and inclusion in the Defense Department.\nPrevious efforts in that direction have proven controversial for Hegseth, who came under scrutiny for stripping mentions of key figures from military websites \u2014 including baseball legend and World War II veteran Jackie Robinson \u2014 eventually prompting the reinstatement of some webpages and even eliciting an admission of error from the Department of Defense.\nCalifornia politicians quickly criticized the Navy\u2019s planned renaming.\nRep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who shares a home city of San Francisco with Milk, sharply criticized the move as a \u201cshameful, vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American Dream\u201d in a statement on Tuesday.\n\u201cOur military is the most powerful in the world \u2013 but this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the \u2018warrior\u2019 ethos. Instead, it is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country,\u201d Pelosi said, encouraging the Navy to \u201creconsider this egregious decision.\u201d\n\u201cStripping his name from a Navy ship won\u2019t erase his legacy as an American icon,\u201d Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement, \u201cbut it does reveal Trump\u2019s contempt for the very values our veterans fight to protect.\u201d",

        "Content": "Pentagon to redraw command map to more closely align Greenland with the US\nThe Pentagon\u2019s move to shift its oversight of Greenland under U.S. Northern Command aligns with President Trump\u2019s pledge to take control of the autonomous Danish territory.\nThe Pentagon is poised to shift its oversight of Greenland by putting it under U.S. Northern Command, a symbolic gesture that would more closely align the island territory with the U.S. as President Donald Trump continues to show interest in taking control over the Arctic landmass.\nThe shift in oversight, which could come as soon as this week, could also help the U.S. broaden its Golden Dome missile shield by providing more radars for coverage.\nUnder the plan, Greenland would shift from European Command\u2019s jurisdiction to Northern Command, which is responsible for overseeing the security of North America, according to a DOD official and two people familiar with the planning. The people were granted anonymity to discuss the move ahead of its announcement.\nThe switch is the most concrete step yet in the Trump administration\u2019s months-long effort to gain ownership over Greenland, an autonomous island aligned with Denmark. Trump briefly brought up buying Greenland during his first term, but has talked about it repeatedly since winning the election last November, alarming the island\u2019s 58,000 inhabitants and frustrating the Danish government, which says it has no interest in selling.\nMaking Greenland part of Northcom will be heavily scrutinized in Denmark and throughout NATO, which has been uneasy over Trump\u2019s months-long campaign to take control over the island and his refusal to rule out military action to seize territory. Denmark and the semi-autonomous Faroe Islands will remain under European Command, creating a symbolic and operational split between those territories and Greenland.\n\u201cFrom the perspective of geography, the move makes some sense,\u201d said one of the people familiar. \u201cFrom a political perspective, however, this clearly is going to worry Europe,\u201d the official added.\nThe switch in jurisdiction is part of the Pentagon leadership\u2019s review of the Unified Command Plan, which outlines the areas of responsibility for the department\u2019s six geographic combatant commanders. While the Greenland split doesn\u2019t involve any major shifts in leadership, other proposals \u2014 including combining Northern Command and Southern Command and pulling the Africa Command back under the Germany-based European Command \u2014 would have deep impacts on the number of three- and four-star officers serving in the military, and on how many assets are assigned to different areas of the globe.\nThe Trump administration has for months talked about the strategic importance of Greenland for U.S. security, pointing out that its location in the North Atlantic makes American control critical for stepped-up missile defense programs and monitoring Russia and Chinese shipping in the Arctic.\nThe change opens the possibility of adding more Golden Dome radar systems on Greenland and expanding that network of sensors, while more closely aligning the island with Canadian and American regional defense plans.\nThe Danish embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. A DOD official deferred to the White House, which did not respond to a request for comment.\nNorthern Command is chiefly responsible for protecting U.S. territory and oversees missions such as the southern border, air and missile defense, and working with Canada and Mexico on joint security matters.\nPutting Greenland under Northern Command would, in effect, cleave Greenland from Denmark when it comes to how the island is prioritized in policy discussions at the Pentagon and the White House.\nThe second person familiar with the planning said the Danish government has not been formally briefed on the upcoming move.\nThe U.S. has long had a military presence on the island. In March, Vice President JD Vance and then-national security adviser Mike Waltz visited the Pituffik Space Base, which boasts the Pentagon\u2019s northernmost deepwater port and has long functioned as a strategic location to watch Russia and China.\nIn Greenland, Vance urged the Arctic island to \u201ccut a deal\u201d with Washington, saying, \u201cI think that you\u2019d be a lot better coming under the United States security umbrella than you have been under Denmark\u2019s security umbrella.\u201d\nIn January, the Danish government pledged to spend an extra $2 billion on Greenland security initiatives, in part to placate Trump\u2019s security concerns. But NATO and European officials have been cautious about the American president\u2019s interest in the island.\nTrump\u2019s comments on the importance of the Arctic have caught the attention of NATO leaders. The alliance\u2019s secretary general, Mark Rutte, said last week that \u201cfor NATO, we\u2019re getting more involved\u201d in Arctic security issues. He added that Trump calling attention to Russian and Chinese moves in the region marked a positive development.\nIn an interview with NBC last month, Trump said he would not rule out taking Greenland by military force. \u201cI don\u2019t say I\u2019m going to do it, but I don\u2019t rule out anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need Greenland very badly.\u201d",

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said Thursday at POLITICO\u2019s Security Summit. \u201cI would love to be able to build a system that actually worked 100 percent of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cTo build a system over the entire country would be incredibly hard and we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s going to work.\u201d\nPrevious administrations have considered putting more missile interceptors on the East Coast. But officials have repeatedly scuttled the idea given the cost and length of time it would take to complete the project.\nThe administration argues this effort is different. \u201cGolden Dome is not one big umbrella we buy that protects the homeland from a number of threats,\u201d Space Force chief Gen. Chance Saltzman said Monday at a Council on Foreign Relations event.\nMany of the sensors and systems for the effort already exist, he said, but need to be connected by a software backbone.\n\u201cWhat Golden Dome is doing is allowing us to do a more holistic mission analysis,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cHere are the gaps, where are the issues? Where can we be more credible in our defense of the homeland?\u2019\u201d",

Could they be wrong? Could a judge possibly be wrong?\u201d Gorka said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a terrorist of a [foreign terrorist organization], it\u2019s not a traffic ticket. You don\u2019t go to county court, you\u2019re a member of a federally designated terrorist organization. It\u2019s really that simple. If you\u2019re a wife beater and a human trafficker, goodbye.\u201d\nGorka\u2019s comments follow decisions by federal judges that have contradicted President Donald Trump\u2019s deportations of suspected gang members not yet convicted of a crime.\nBut he was referring specifically to the high-profile case of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the administration has accused of being a member of the MS-13, which it has designated a foreign terrorist organization. Officials have also accused him of having \u201cinvolvement\u201d in human trafficking. He has not been charged with a crime.\nAbrego Garcia entered the country illegally around 2011 and lived in Maryland for more than a decade. He was deported from the U.S. in March and sent to a prison in El Salvador. He currently remains there, although the Supreme Court has upheld a lower court\u2019s order to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. due to a legal directive preventing his deportation because of threats to his life.\nThe U.S. designated eight cartels and criminal organizations as foreign terrorist organizations in February, a strong sanction that allows American authorities to remove suspected members from the country in certain circumstances.\n\u201cWhen an organization is designated by the secretary of State as a foreign terrorist organization, every single stinking member is a terrorist by U.S. law,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cThere is no need for them to be adjudicated as a terrorist.\u201d\nSince the administration has designated cartels and gangs as terror groups, Trump has not made an end-around due process rights, Gorka said. \u201cDue process has never been skirted; this is another fake news canard,\u201d he said, criticizing POLITICO\u2019s coverage of the case.\nThe groups listed by the Trump administration include Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel, MS-13, and Tren de Aragua. Gorka said that as many as 110,000 Americans die from illicit drugs imported by criminal gangs annually, including fentanyl.\n\u201cWe have tens of thousands of criminals here,\u201d Gorka said, but did not provide specifics on how the Trump administration is identifying suspected gang members. \u201cWe actually treat these people as illegals. We\u2019re going to use the full force of the law to identify, neutralize, and remove them.\u201d",

Lisa Franchetti, who was unceremoniously fired by the Trump administration as leader of naval operations for the United States, has teamed up with Rahm Emanuel on a program that encourages young people to continue their ROTC service in college.\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on and am passionate about developing the next generation of leaders,\u201d Franchetti said of the Children First scholarship fund that Emanuel, a former ambassador to Japan and critic of President Donald Trump, started with Chicago Public Schools to benefit students in the ROTC programs.\nIt\u2019s Franchetti\u2019s first public statement since Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired her in a management shift with the new administration.\nIn an exclusive interview, Franchetti declined to talk about her controversial exit or recent executive orders affecting the military \u2014 but she opened up about promoting military service no matter who sits in the White House.\n\u201cROTC and, more broadly, military service, opened the doors of opportunity for me 40 years ago, and I am confident it will do the same for today\u2019s scholarship recipients,\u201d said Franchetti, who met Emanuel while he was ambassador of Japan and was pushing for an overhaul of the Navy\u2019s Japanese shipyard used by allied countries. The project was completed earlier this month.\n\u201cI think there are opportunities available to anyone who wants to raise their hand,\u201d Franchetti said.\nPressed on the new policy that bans transgender people from the military, Franchetti said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make comments on any specific policies because I think the military is a great opportunity for everybody to serve.\u201d\nOn Monday, Franchetti is set to join Emanuel at Rickover Naval Academy, a high school in Chicago, to announce 12 recipients of the inaugural Admiral Lisa Franchetti ROTC Scholarship.\nThe scholarship program has special meaning to Franchetti. She was an ROTC graduate who studied journalism at Northwestern University, where a chance meeting with ROTC students led to her getting a scholarship. \u201cI was the eldest of seven, and my dad said, \u2018Look around and see if there are any scholarship possibilities so everyone [in the family] can go to college,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\u201cI signed up and I never planned to make the military a career,\u201d Franchetti said, describing the scholarship offering free books, tuition and a chance to see the world. She said she stuck with the military \u201cto serve something bigger than myself.\u201d\nAfter 40 years of service, she said she hopes the new scholarships in her name help provide similar opportunities.\nThe scholarship has meaning for Emanuel, too. His son joined the Navy, which helped influence the former Chicago mayor\u2019s decision to start a scholarship program for students interested in national service.\nEmanuel, who also studied at Northwestern, said \u201cit\u2019s frustrating\u201d that Franchetti\u2019s military career ended so abruptly.\n\u201cI think this is wrong on a thousand levels,\u201d Emanuel said of her firing. \u201cThe Navy was better. Our Armed Forces were better and our values and our interests were better protected when Lisa Franchetti was on point.\u201d\nBut he adds, \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have her thinking and protecting and caring about service men and women\u201d through the scholarship program.",

        "Content": "Judge lets CIA fire doctor who pushed mandatory Covid vaccines for military\nThe doctor had argued her looming termination was the result of public attacks by some of Trump\u2019s most vocal social media defenders.\nALEXANDRIA, Virginia \u2014 A federal judge has cleared the way for the CIA to fire a doctor criticized by some of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters for her role in the mandatory vaccination of military service members against coronavirus.\nAt a hearing Friday, U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff declined Dr. Terry Adirim\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order blocking the CIA from dismissing her as director of the spy agency\u2019s Center for Global Health Services. The judge, a Biden appointee, also lifted an administrative stay he issued last week putting Adirim\u2019s firing on hold.\nAdirim had argued that her impending termination was the result of public attacks by some of Trump\u2019s most vocal social media defenders, who had highlighted her role in the Biden-era Covid policy shortly before her termination. She pointed, in particular, to posts on X by Ivan Raiklin, who publicly characterized her as the \u201carchitect\u201d of the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cJab Genocide Mandate.\u201d\nAdirim\u2019s suit alleges, citing \u201ccommon sense\u201d and evidence to be acquired through the litigation, that Raiklin asked prominent pro-Trump activist Laura Loomer to encourage Trump to have Adirim fired, and that Loomer relayed this to the president during an April meeting in the Oval Office. Raiklin, who attended the hearing, flatly denied to reporters that he urged Loomer to ask Trump to fire Adirim.\nA lawyer for Adirim, Kevin Carroll, also argued that a post on X from Donald Trump Jr. welcoming Adirim\u2019s firing amounted to the CIA publicly endorsing claims that she acted illegally or unethically.\nThe CIA, however, has sharply rejected any connection between the public campaign against Adirim and its decision to fire her. The agency indicated that it had received \u201cmultiple complaints by several different CIA officers\u201d about Adirim\u2019s conduct and that those complaints had caused concern among agency leadership.\n\u201cThere is no reason other than the close timing of Ms. Loomer\u2019s White House visit and the CIA\u2019s communication of its termination decision to Plaintiff to suggest the two are linked,\u201d the Justice Department argued in advance of the hearing.\nNachmanoff zeroed in Friday on the post by the president\u2019s son, saying that it did not appear to amount to evidence that the CIA was defaming her. and could not justify a temporary restraining order keeping her in her job, Carroll said. However, according to the lawyer, the judge said he was not expressing any judgement about the underlying legal merits of Adirim\u2019s suit.\nSpeaking to reporters following the hearing Friday, Raiklin said he did not communicate with Loomer in the months prior to Adirim\u2019s firing.\nRaiklin also said documents make clear that Adirim was involved in executing the Biden administration\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy for members of the armed forces. He pointed to a Sept. 14, 2021, memo Adirim issued while serving as the acting principal deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Health Affairs that instructed health providers to use Pfizer and Comirnaty vaccines to carry out the vaccination mandate.\nRaiklin also noted that on Wednesday a senior Pentagon official issued a memo calling the 2021 mandate \u201cunlawful as implemented.\u201d\nRaiklin rejected claims that he was tipped off to Adirim\u2019s role at the CIA. He pointed to her LinkedIn post last year announcing that she was \u201cstarting a new position as Senior Executive at US Federal Government!\u201d He said that language is often used by people referencing their work for the CIA.\nA CIA spokesperson declined to comment.\nNachmanoff started the hearing before the scheduled time Friday, leading to several reporters arriving just as the court session ended.",

        "Content": "Trump announces US will stop bombing Houthis\nThe military has struck at least 800 targets in Yemen and killed hundreds of Houthis since March, according to U.S. Central Command.\nThe United States will stop strikes against Yemen\u2019s Houthi group, President Donald Trump announced Tuesday, after a nearly-two-month bombing campaign.\nTrump, ahead of a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, said the halt would start immediately. The Houthis approached the administration on Monday night indicating \u201cthey want to stop the fighting,\u201d he said.\nThe military has struck at least 800 targets in Yemen and killed hundreds of Houthis since March, according to U.S. Central Command.\nTrump framed the move as a handshake agreement to end the Pentagon\u2019s bombing campaign in exchange for the Houthis no longer attacking American ships. It\u2019s not a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Please don\u2019t bomb us anymore and we\u2019re not going to attack your ships.\u2019\u201d\nThe threat of Houthi attacks on the Red Sea waterway has forced commercial ships to divert course, causing lengthy delays and extending maritime trading routes thousands of miles around the tip of Africa. A senior Houthi leader told DropSiteNews in April that the group would cease attacks if the Trump administration halted bombings.\nBut the arrangement is unlikely to calm tensions in the region if it\u2019s limited to protecting American ships. Israel escalated strikes against the Houthis on Monday night with 20 fighter jets bombing the rebel-held port city of Hodeidah. Israeli forces were responding to a ballistic missile strike against the Jerusalem airport by the group. The Trump administration also labeled the Houthis a terror group in March, changing a Biden-era policy.\nThe Defense Department and U.S. Central Command did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTrump special envoy Steve Witkoff worked to reach a ceasefire over the weekend with Oman serving as a mediator, said a person familiar with the matter, who was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues. Witkoff has also been leading talks with Iran, which is backed by the Houthis, over its nuclear program. The Houthi ceasefire could help improve the environment for those discussions, which are meant to reconvene soon.\nOmani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi confirmed on the social media platform X that his country mediated talks between the Houthis and the U.S. \u201cIn the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping,\u201d he wrote.\nMohammed al-Bukhaiti, a senior Houthi official, told Bloomberg News that the group would stop attacking U.S. military ships if Washington halts its strikes, \u201cbut we will definitely continue our operations in support to Gaza.\u201d\nHe said Houthi operations would continue \u201cuntil the end of the aggression on Gaza and blockade on its people.\u201d\nThe Houthis have launched more than 500 strikes on commercial ships in the Red Sea and against Israel since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, according to the International Crisis Group, an independent conflict monitor. But Houthi strikes against the waterway have declined significantly in recent months, and the group hasn\u2019t targeted a commercial vessel since late December.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, following Trump\u2019s announcement, said the Houthi strikes were a freedom of navigation issue.\n\u201cThese are a band of individuals with advanced weaponry that were threatening global shipping,\u201d he said. And the job was to get that to stop.\u201d\nThe Trump administration\u2019s military effort, dubbed \u201cOperation Rough Rider\u201d by the Pentagon, has helped reduce ballistic missile launches by 69 percent this year and cut launches of one-way attack drones by 55 percent.\nBut the costs have continued to pile up with an extraordinary display of U.S. military force. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth extended the deployment of the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group in the region and sent a second carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, in a major allocation of resources. The Pentagon also sent six B-2 bombers to the U.S. airbase at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean \u2014 a third of the entire U.S. fleet.\nThe strike halt comes before Trump heads to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates next week. Trump said he will make a \u201cvery, very big\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d announcement before the trip, but did not specify what that would mean.",

        "Content": "Trump\u2019s contract-cutting blitz rattles a once-flourishing DC industry\nThe General Services Administration, which oversees government contracting, is leading a review of more than 20,000 consulting agreements for what is \u201cnon-essential.\u201d\nA Trump administration project to revisit thousands of federal agreements is starting to sink a vast ecosystem of contractors that deploy jobs across the Washington economy.\nIt\u2019s an effort \u2014 launched in February \u2014 that\u2019s already produced claims of big savings, including $43 million for oversight and protection of private information in the federal insurance marketplace. Contracts worth $14 million for health care support within the Department of Veterans Affairs and $16 million for assisting relief efforts in Texas following last year\u2019s Hurricane Beryl and other natural disasters have also been marked as terminated.\nAt least 2,775 out of more than 20,000 contracts for consulting and investment advice under review have been cut as of May 11, worth $3.1 billion in claimed savings, according to an analysis of DOGE\u2019s list of terminations and government data obtained by POLITICO.\nBut the reach of the review \u2014 looking back at contracts that have already gone through a competitive bidding process overseen by career civil servants \u2014 is nonetheless unprecedented. It has frozen hiring, triggered layoffs and sparked chaos across the consulting industry, a vast shadow workforce across Virginia, Washington and Maryland that often weathers broader economic slumps.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s going to force [contractors] into a race to the bottom,\u201d said Stan Soloway, a former procurement official at the Defense Department who later ran the Professional Services Council, a trade association for federal contractors. \u201cThese are consequences that happen when the process leading up to them is not appropriately deliberative and thoughtful and insightful.\u201d\nFor decades, the government has grown increasingly reliant on the private sector to perform functions once handled by federal employees, a shift done ostensibly to control costs by having companies compete.\nIt also created today\u2019s opportunity: The Trump administration has brought a new intensity to slashing contractors partly because they\u2019re easier to cut than federal workers, many of which have civil service protections. In the same breath, the government is renegotiating contracts to get better deals for relatively greater work, according to three lobbyists representing large and small consulting firms who, like others in this report, were granted anonymity for fear of retribution.\nThe General Services Administration, which oversees government contracting and is leading the review, is systematically targeting business deals it can retroactively deem \u201cnon-essential\u201d \u2014 \u201cany contract that merely generates a report, research, coaching, or an artifact,\u201d according to an agency memo obtained by POLITICO.\nThe early stages of the economic fallout for the D.C. region are starting to trickle out. Consulting firms included in GSA\u2019s list of 20,000-plus contracts have reported layoffs for nearly 3,600 employees in Washington, Maryland and Virginia alone since the start of the Trump administration, according to publicly available data. And consulting industry giant Deloitte, which has not yet announced layoffs in the DMV area, is widely expected to shed staff as well.\nTrump administration officials say the undertaking is determined to make sure the agreements provide good value to taxpayers. It\u2019s exactly the sort of mission conservatives elected President Donald Trump to do \u2014 shrink the federal government in a way that previous administrations have failed to deliver.\nThey have also said these cuts would not impact essential services and instead target redundancies.\nVeterans Affairs spokesperson Peter Kasperowicz said the agency has so far canceled \u201chundreds\u201d of the 130,000 contracts it is reviewing and won\u2019t cancel those that \u201cdirectly support Veterans, and beneficiaries or provide services VA cannot do itself.\u201d\nJosh Gruenbaum, GSA\u2019s commissioner for the federal acquisitions division, also downplayed the fears of the administration\u2019s critics.\nThe contract review, he said, \u201cis simply identifying the right private industry partners who take the deficit as seriously as we do and are willing to provide quality goods and services at competitive prices.\u201d\nWhite House DOGE adviser Katie Miller did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nTo get out of a contract early, the government can simply pay companies a \u201ckill fee\u201d that varies by contract, said Christine Harada, who oversaw procurement in the White House and GSA during the Obama and Biden administrations. But it\u2019s against federal business practices for agencies to cut a contract midway just to get a better deal, she said.\nBut taking the government to court comes with enormous risks, said Darrell West, a senior fellow at the center-left Brookings Institution who studies government contracting.\n\u201cIf you sue this White House, you\u2019re never going to get a future contract. Everybody knows that,\u201d he said.\nAs part of its review, Trump\u2019s GSA instructed agencies to provide one-sentence justifications for essential contracts worth keeping, according to the GSA memo. It has also asked every agency to review their contracts with the 10 consulting firms it says receive the most government funds and terminate any non-essential agreements.\nPOLITICO is tracking updates to DOGE\u2019s \u201cWall of Receipts,\u201d which already claims nearly $32 billion in savings from all contract terminations it has posted publicly, and $170 billion in savings overall from cuts government-wide, as of May 11 \u2014 though DOGE\u2019s logs have been riddled with errors.\nAmong those terminations are at least 2,775 of the consulting contracts highlighted by GSA. The actual number of consulting contracts DOGE claims to have canceled may be higher, as the group has masked identifying information from hundreds of contracts on its page due to \u201clegal reasons\u201d and describes its termination list as a \u201csubset\u201d of its activity.\nHowever, what DOGE claims to have cut is not always the same as what the agencies themselves claim. One of the largest contracts listed as canceled is a $1.3 billion agreement with New York-based Deployed Resources originally intended to help construct and furnish an immigration processing center along the southern border. But the contract, initially with the Department of Homeland Security, is active and was taken over by the Department of the Army, according to Army public affairs specialist Ryan Mattox.\nIn recent weeks, GSA has signaled to some contracting firms that it wanted far deeper reductions, said one agency official who was granted anonymity for fear of retribution.\nAnd while contracts with behemoth companies like Booz Allen Hamilton, General Dynamics and Deloitte are under the government\u2019s microscope, smaller, little-known companies could also have their work cut or reduced.\nOne contract with a roughly 50-person research firm, MEF Associates, that helped states improve employment and other supportive services for welfare recipients facing domestic violence, mental health, substance use and other issues was cut in April. That\u2019s made it unclear if families on welfare are more likely to miss out on service improvements.\nContractors and former government officials are also worried there could be unintended cancellations for a broader sweep of projects because GSA\u2019s spreadsheets labeled contracts \u201cconsulting\u201d even if, in practice, they were used for construction and other unrelated services.\nDetailed descriptions for each contract are not always available in public federal spending data sets, nor in the data obtained by POLITICO. But some contracts that have been under review, identified through a series of GSA documents, include a $33 million contract for logistical support following Tropical Storm Helene in Asheville, North Carolina (which DOGE claims to have canceled), a $155 million award to build out a system to help prevent veteran suicide and $132 million toward human resources services to help veterans transition back to civilian life.\nAt IBM, another large contractor whose deals GSA is scrutinizing, executives noted the contract review and cancellations prompted them to be \u201cprudently cautious around consulting for the year,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh said on an earnings call in late April.\n\u201cWe actually process veterans benefits claims. We help process how the GSA does procurement. We help implement payroll systems,\u201d Arvind Krishna, IBM\u2019s president and CEO, told investors. \u201cI don\u2019t think of these as optional.\u201d\nMany lobbyists, contractors and current and former federal officials acknowledged in interviews there are redundancies within consulting contracts. But some of these redundancies, they noted, are fail-safes that help keep important systems running smoothly and prevent service outages.\nHarada, the Obama and Biden procurement official, said the Trump administration\u2019s penchant for making broad cuts and then backtracking makes her worry it could wipe out important programs and unnecessarily imperil thousands of private sector jobs.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the ones that are operating the Medicare call centers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones that are administering your Medicaid payments, your veterans benefits. They\u2019re the ones that are actually doing some of the medical services for veterans.\u201d\nConsulting firms aren\u2019t sitting by passively.\nSome have spent the first months of the Trump administration lobbying lawmakers and federal agencies including GSA to stave off contract cuts. Companies including Guidehouse and Booz Allen, which have been singled out by GSA, are working with agencies to make strategic carve-outs, according to three lobbyists and contractors familiar with the matter.\nBut these firms have hit a wall. As DOGE and GSA hack away at contracts, the businesses are having trouble breaking through, they said. A congressional staffer familiar with the matter told POLITICO that lawmakers\u2019 ability to intervene in the contract review is limited because appropriations laws don\u2019t dictate whom the executive branch hires or what contracts agencies need to issue.\nDuring the lobbying blitz, contractors have learned the Trump administration is looking to \u201crescope\u201d the size of preexisting contracts with the ultimate goal of squeezing lower prices and greater productivity from these consultancies, the three lobbyists and contractors said.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s so desperate for work now,\u201d said a former staffer at a major consulting firm GSA targeted. \u201cSo they\u2019re going and they\u2019re basically lowball[ing] their price. \u2026 And as long as it\u2019s not ungodly low, they\u2019ll win on price.\u201d\nIt\u2019s left the contractors in a precarious position: Do they put forward the cheapest bids to secure a deal, unsure if the money they are asking for is enough to fulfill the work, or forgo a contract entirely?\n\u201cWe\u2019re heading toward an unhealthy dynamic. Would you use low price to choose your heart surgeon?\u201d said Soloway, the former Pentagon procurement official, who now runs Celero Strategies, a federal market consulting firm. \u201cThe end result is it ends up costing the taxpayer more. You get a lot less for your money.\u201d\nMethodology\nPOLITICO obtained 53 spreadsheets that GSA circulated to federal agencies, along with a memo instructing them to conduct a review of \u201cnon-essential consulting\u201d contracts. In total, those spreadsheets amounted to 22,150 rows of data, most of which refer to single contracts, though some individual contracts were repeated across rows. That data is shown in full in the table above, though some columns, including those with personal identifying information, have been removed.\nPOLITICO compared this data to DOGE\u2019s publicly available contract termination list posted on May 11 in order to identify contracts that DOGE claims to have canceled. When available, old versions of the DOGE data were used for USAID contract cancellations that are now stripped of identifying information on the DOGE website due to \u201clegal reasons.\u201d As a result, there may be additional USAID consulting contracts on GSA\u2019s list that have been canceled by DOGE.",

        "Content": "Trump\u2019s chaotic economy is causing headaches for Democrats in New Jersey\u2019s governor race\nThe crowded contest in the Garden State shows how hard it is to address pocketbook issues.\nA promise to cut property taxes 15 percent. A blueprint to build 200,000 affordable homes. Support for a universal basic income.\nDemocrats vying to be New Jersey\u2019s next governor are desperate to prove they care about driving down costs and winning back voters who may have been swayed by President Donald Trump\u2019s populist economic message.\n\u201cJersey is just way too expensive,\u201d Rep. Josh Gottheimer, one of the six Democrats vying for the post who has based his campaign on being the \u201clower taxes\u201d candidate, said during a debate this week. \u201cPeople are getting crushed.\u201d\nWhoever makes it out of the June 10 primary will likely face Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican who nearly unseated term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021. Murphy saw that tight race as \u201cthe canary in the coal mine\u201d after Trump (who earlier this week endorsed Ciattarelli) made a surprisingly strong showing in the blue state last fall.\nTrump\u2019s 2024 victory \u2014 and the seismic changes he\u2019s unleashed during his first months in office \u2014 has left Democrats struggling to figure out the path forward.\nNew Jersey is one of Democrats\u2019 first chances to set the tone. The state will hold one of only two gubernatorial elections this year, making the race a proving ground for the midterms; depending on Democrats\u2019 success, it could give members of the minority party across the country a blueprint for how they can hang on in states where Trump made gains in 2024.\nIt\u2019s a crowded, formidable group of gubernatorial contenders, including two members of Congress, mayors of two of the state\u2019s largest cities, a former state Senate president and the head of one of the state\u2019s most powerful unions.\nThey\u2019re hoping to seize on dissatisfaction with Trump\u2019s economy to propel them to victory this year. But things aren\u2019t so great in the Garden State, so selling that message could be a hard row to hoe.\nAnd as Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs cause the stock market to swoon and soar and potential slashes to federal spending trickle down, Democrats in New Jersey have few options to alter the massive economic forces affecting the pocketbooks of voters in the state.\n\u201cPoliticians always say, \u2018We want to make life more affordable,\u2019\u201d said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit focused on the public sector. \u201cThey have some tools in their toolbox, but their powers are limited. Really, politicians can\u2019t influence the national inflation rate. They really can\u2019t do very much to the price of gasoline.\u201d\nIn fact, Murphy signed a law last year raising the state\u2019s gas tax, one of several cost of living increases that are clouding his own middle class legacy and throwing a wrench in Democrats\u2019 pitch.\nNew Jersey utility customers are just weeks away from seeing new electric rates that could add about $30 per month to their summer power bills. Republicans are blaming those rising prices on Murphy energy policies, like a big bet on offshore wind that went nowhere. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to villainize the organization that operates the region\u2019s energy market, an uphill battle that requires voters to first learn what PJM Interconnection LLC is and then blame it for skyrocketing utility bills.\nOn top of that, highway tolls have gone up and Murphy\u2019s administration will have hiked fares for NJ Transit commuters by some 18 percent since last summer, just as the agency\u2019s trains began to have high-profile mechanical issues. The same agency is now days away from a strike that would idle its trains.\nIt\u2019s not as if New Jersey Democrats haven\u2019t tried to win over voters with tax cuts and promises of more to come: Following his close call with Ciattarelli and stinging losses down-ballot, Murphy rolled out a property tax rebate program called ANCHOR that gives households up to $1,500 a year. In 2023, Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin rolled out a plan to slash senior property taxes in half, dubbed Stay NJ. His Democratic majority grew in a year that Republicans had hoped to make major gains. Now, questions are swirling about how that program will be funded in the long-term.\nAll of that is on top of potential Medicaid cuts from Washington, which the Murphy administration has warned repeatedly would cause crushing fiscal impacts. Other federal cuts could further complicate the state\u2019s in-progress budget, which the next governor will pick up halfway through. But those are things Democrats have been clear they think they can blame on Trump and help them.\n\u201cSince Donald Trump is sticking it to the middle class by rolling back lower prescription drugs for seniors and pushing tariffs that raise prices on everyday products, our residents need relief,\u201d former state Senate President Steve Sweeney said in a statement earlier this year when he proposed a one-time $400 check to every household with an income that does not exceed $150,000.\nNormally, the off-cycle election for governor favors candidates from the party that isn\u2019t in the White House. So, while Democrats have their work cut out for them, they may have an advantage heading into the fall \u2014 especially given what\u2019s happening federally.\nDemocrats\u2019 willingness to focus so much of the primary on the economy is a recognition of just how important this issue is to voters.\nIn the 2021 race, national debates seeped into the campaign, including over abortion rights and critical race theory. But \u201cat the end of the day for New Jerseyans, it once again came down to that economic message,\u201d said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University. \u201cIt really would be to the detriment of any candidate to ignore that as the number one issue, especially in this economic climate.\u201d\nIt\u2019s to be seen whether Democrats can sell the narrative that they\u2019re the best ones to tackle affordability to unhappy voters in a state where Murphy has been governor seven years with majorities in both legislative chambers. And, if elected, it\u2019s also an open question whether a Democrat can fix the problems candidates are promising to solve.\nThey\u2019ll also be tested on whether they can stay on message \u2014 or whether their base wants to talk about other things. Immigration has been a point of contention on both sides of the aisle during the campaign as the Trump administration has enacted sweeping deportations.\nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested last week at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, bringing the conversation even more to the forefront. Democrats have consistently framed their messaging as anti-Trump, and most of the Republican candidates have sought to compare themselves to the president.\nAt the ballot box, it\u2019s unlikely that those national issues will motivate voters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s that taxes and property taxes issue that New Jerseyans really want to hear about and want to see if a candidate can do something about,\u201d Koning said. \u201cComing out against Trump is only going to do so much for the candidate. Voters are going to want to hear plans and how it\u2019s uniquely going to affect them within New Jersey.\u201d\nRepublicans are riding high on Trump\u2019s narrow loss in the traditionally blue-leaning state, and the eventual Republican gubernatorial nominee is likely to try to replicate the president\u2019s strategy. The GOP candidates have taken inspiration from the Trump administration, consistently echoing plans to cut back on \u201cgovernment waste,\u201d like the federal Department of Government Efficiency.\nWhile Democrats agree with the concept of making government more efficient, they have pushed back on those GOP plans to have a New Jersey DOGE.\n\u201cFundamentally, the concept of DOGE or efficiency is not the problem with efficiency, it\u2019s the problem with the cruelty of how it\u2019s been approached by the Trump administration,\u201d Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said at the debate earlier this week. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference.\u201d\nDemocrats instead have rolled out proposals of varying specificity to make the state more affordable. Gottheimer has released dozens of pages of policy suggestions, including promising to cut property taxes by close to 15 percent. Fulop similarly has unveiled lengthy policy proposals, and in part wants to consolidate municipal services to cut spending. Part of Sweeney\u2019s proposal is that he will build 200,000 affordable units in five years and won\u2019t implement any tax increases. Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) has emphasized building more housing, as has New Jersey Education Association President Sean Spiller.\n\u201cI talk incessantly about it because I hear about it incessantly,\u201d Sherrill, who is narrowly leading the pack in scarce public polling, said of her push to build more housing. \u201cThis state is not affordable for anyone.\u201d\nAnd Baraka, who is running as an unabashed progressive, has universal basic income in his economic platform.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what \u2018too progressive\u2019 means \u2014 that I want to lower people\u2019s health care costs, that I want to build affordable housing, that I think we should be talking about a public option, a single payer system, that we need equity in this state?\u201d Baraka said in response to criticisms that he is too far to the left. \u201cThat people should have opportunity to have a pathway into the middle class, that home ownership should be advanced?\u201d\nA recent Eagleton poll found that New Jerseyans have a negative perspective of both the national and state economies, though the state\u2019s rating is slightly better than what\u2019s happening across the country. Democratic strategists have suggested that in order to capitalize on those voter sentiments, candidates need to not just attack Trump \u2014 they need to propose their own economic policies.\nRachael Russell, director of polling and analytics at Democratic group Navigator Research, said that policies that address price gouging, building more homes, implementing homebuyers assistance and making child care more affordable are popular.\n\u201cThe bigger problem that I see is promising on things that maybe can\u2019t be delivered or kind of risking a vision that\u2019s too big and not achievable,\u201d Russell said. \u201cBut I do think the backwinds are going to be strong for Democrats. I don\u2019t know that it means that they have a vision that people are sold on.\u201d",

        "Content": "Democrats look to Trump\u2019s poor economic numbers with anxious optimism\nFollowing its latest round of focus groups, Navigator Research is urging Democrats to proactively push their own economic policies.\nPresident Donald Trump is taking a hit with some of his former voters on the economy \u2014 and one Democratic group is advising its party not to pile on, but to offer an alternative. Now.\nA trio of focus groups of 2024 Trump voters \u2014 backed by the Democratic group Navigator Research and shared first with POLITICO \u2014 reinforces a heap of public polling in recent days that shows an electorate increasingly frustrated by Trump\u2019s approach to tariffs and the cost of living. It\u2019s a dynamic that congressional Democrats are hoping to capitalize on ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nBut it may not be enough.\nFollowing its latest round of focus groups, Navigator Research is urging Democrats to proactively push their own economic policies. Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t just assume that because [voters] are upset with Trump right now, that anyone\u2019s coming back to them,\u201d but must give \u201ctheir vision of what an economy that works for everybody looks like, and it can\u2019t just be that the economy sucks,\u201d said Rachael Russell, director of polling and analytics at Navigator Research, a project within the Hub Project, which is a Democratic nonprofit group.\n\u201cNow is the time to provide real solutions that people can look to as an alternative because we\u2019re seeing that splintering right now, we\u2019re seeing people say, \u2018this isn\u2019t necessarily what I voted for,\u2019\u201d Russell said.\nThe problem for Democrats, she said, is that not many of them are offering an alternative yet. \u201cEveryone\u2019s kind of like, we\u2019re not in power, we can\u2019t do anything,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think the proactive nature of presenting a vision is much more inspirational and brings people in a way that we\u2019re not currently doing,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThere\u2019s people out there doing this on their own, but as an entity, as a party, it doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a real vision that\u2019s being expressed.\u201d\nPublic opinion has been shifting against Trump in recent days. A majority of Americans said Trump\u2019s policies worsened economic conditions, up 8 percentage points since last month, according to a CNN poll, while participants in Navigator\u2019s focus groups described his first 100 days as \u201cchaotic,\u201d \u201cdisappointing\u201d and a \u201cmixed bag.\u201d\nOne Black woman in the Pennsylvania focus group said she \u201cspecifically voted for him because of the economy,\u201d but \u201cnow that we gave him a second term, I just feel like now it\u2019s just downhill from there, and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018What the fuck?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHe promised he was going to help with the economy,\u201d said a white woman from Pennsylvania. \u201cI definitely feel like he\u2019s not keeping his promises and I regret voting for him.\u201d\nThe reams of polling and focus group data are timed with Trump\u2019s first 100 days of his second administration, which have found his approval ratings sink to the lowest levels of any president in decades during the same period. A New York Times/Siena College poll found that voters disapprove of his handling of every issue, including on immigration and the economy \u2014 longstanding areas of strength for the president.\nIn a lengthy post on Truth Social on Monday, Trump responded to the recent polling data from The New York Times, ABC and The Washington Post, calling them \u201cFAKE POLLS FROM FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS.\u201d\nBut the results from public polls are reflected in three Navigator focus groups with 2024 Trump voters in the key swing states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan, who were particularly concerned about the cost of living not improving since Trump took office \u2014 a core campaign promise of Trump\u2019s.\nOn tariffs, most of which were announced over the last month, several of these Trump voters said they liked them in theory, but not the \u201cout-of-control\u201d rollout.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea, but if the implementation is flawed, then \u2014 you can\u2019t turn it on and turn it off like it\u2019s air conditioning,\u201d said one college-educated man from Michigan. \u201cIt creates too much instability.\u201d\nOther Trump voters said they were willing to accept that short-term pain. A few said Trump had about a year to implement his policies, even if they had to swallow higher prices.\n\u201cIt might be painful for a little bit, but we can\u2019t continue to have trade deficits with China, and Canada, Mexico,\u201d he said. \u201cI really believe that he\u2019s trying to level the playing field and try to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.\u201d\nWhen the moderator told the participants that tariffs could cost American families an additional $4,700 a year, based on a study by Yale University, several of them scoffed at it. One North Carolina voter called the idea \u201ccrazy,\u201d while another said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that, no, I don\u2019t see it going that high,\u201d adding that he blamed that kind of information on \u201ca lot of fake news out there.\u201d\n\u201cWhat they were willing to accept as fact versus not, I do think that\u2019s going to be an ongoing issue,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe\u2019re in very different [information] ecosystems and that\u2019s not new, but if we\u2019re not willing to come to the table with the same set of facts, it\u2019s only going to get increasingly harder.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s moves on immigration \u2014 particularly his focus on deportations \u2014 was seen generally positively by focus group attendees. One man from North Carolina said the \u201cmost glaring positive, to me, is that the border is closed.\u201d\nWhen presented with the details of the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident deported to El Salvador, several of the Pennsylvania voters, a group of women, raised concerns about it.\n\u201cPeople are seeing this happen to someone else who the family and friends and coworkers or whatever is saying that they\u2019re wrong and they could be in the same position. That could be them. That could be their family,\u201d one woman said. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s definitely where the fear is swirling around and I don\u2019t know how to contain that if he\u2019s going to keep doing it.\u201d",

        "Content": "Supreme Court limits agency environmental reviews\nThe high court ruled the National Environmental Policy Act requires agencies to consider only the direct effects of a project rather than its broader impacts.\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that federal agencies conducting environmental reviews can take a more limited view of the impacts of transportation and energy infrastructure projects they are permitting.\nThe 8-0 ruling follows years of lower courts demanding broader consideration of the effects of projects like liquefied natural gas export terminals and energy-moving projects like rail lines and pipelines to account for the climate effects of fossil fuels that move through them and will later be burned.\nBut the decades-old National Environmental Policy Act, one of the nation\u2019s landmark environmental laws, is not that far-reaching, and generally does not determine an agency\u2019s final decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote.\n\u201cNEPA is a procedural cross-check, not a substantive roadblock,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cThe goal of the law is to inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.\u201d\nThe ruling follows years of complaints from industry and Republicans \u2014 and some Democrats \u2014 that NEPA reviews had ballooned in scope and become a legal hurdle in some cases. Lawsuits launched by environmental groups against major energy projects have sometimes led to delays or approvals being overturned after courts dinged agencies for not sufficiently studying the impacts of climate change or environmental justice \u2014 a reference to the disproportionate pollution impacts experienced by communities of color, low-incomes residents and rural areas.\nThe Trump administration has also sought to limit NEPA as part of its anti-regulatory push.\nCitizens cannot use judicial review of NEPA compliance \u201cto delay or block agency projects based on the environmental effects of other projects separate from the project at hand,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote.\nThe case involved approval of a new 88-mile rail line in Utah that will be used to move waxy crude oil from the Uinta Basin to market \u2014 often to refineries along the Gulf Coast.\nThe Surface Transportation Board considered the direct effects of building the rail line. But environmental groups challenged its NEPA review, arguing the agency should have considered other \u201cdownstream\u201d effects such as how the line will likely boost Uinta oil production, and \u201cupstream\u201d effects such as how its refinement\u2019s emissions will impact Gulf Coast residents.\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the STB should have considered those impacts, as well as things like the increased risk of oil train derailment and spills along existing rail lines.\nNot so fast, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday.\n\u201cNEPA requires agencies to focus on the environmental effects of the project at issue. Under NEPA, the Board\u2019s EIS did not need to address the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling or downstream oil refining. Rather, it needed to address only the effects of the 88-mile railroad line. And the Board\u2019s EIS did so.\u201d\nNEPA should factor into permitting decisions, but not be used to delay or block projects though court battles, he said.\n\u201cCourts should review an agency\u2019s [environmental impact statement] to check that it addresses the environmental effects of the project at hand. The EIS need not address the effects of separate projects,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cIn conducting that review, courts should afford substantial deference to the agency as to the scope and contents of the EIS.\u201d\nIn a concurrence, the court\u2019s liberal bloc wrote they agreed with the outcome but felt a 2004 Supreme Court ruling \u2014 the last time the high court weighed in on NEPA \u2014 could resolve this dispute just fine. That 2004 ruling, known as Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, held that agencies don\u2019t have to study environmental effects that they have no control over.\n\u201cHere, the Board correctly determined it would not be responsible for the consequences of oil production upstream or downstream from the Railway because it could not lawfully consider those consequences as part of the approval process,\u201d wrote Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case shortly before arguments in December. The court did not say why, but it followed a public pressure campaign from environmental groups and Democrats who argued his close connections to the owner of oil and gas producer Anschutz \u2014 which filed a brief in the case saying NEPA\u2019s scope was critical to developing oil and gas reserves \u2014 disqualified him.\nJay Johnson, an attorney at law firm Venable who represented a coalition of Utah counties supportive of the rail line, praised the ruling, saying in a statement it \u201crestores much-needed balance to the federal environmental review process.\u201d\nVaru Chilakamarri, a partner at K&L Gates, predicted the ruling will help agencies implement congressional directives to speed up reviews and write shorter NEPA studies.\n\u201cThis decision tells lower courts to take Congress seriously and likely means that more projects will make it to the finish line,\u201d she said in a statement.\nBut environmental groups quickly lashed out at the decision.\n\u201cFossil fuel infrastructure projects do not exist in a vacuum and have far-reaching impacts on communities, especially those on the frontlines of climate change or those who face serious health harms from increased pollution,\u201d Nathaniel Shoaff, a senior attorney at the Sierra Club, said in a statement.\nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s ruling in the STB case was in line with multiple rulings it made against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past eight years. In those rulings, the appeals court concluded FERC\u2019s approval of pipelines and LNG export terminals should consider their \u201cdownstream\u201d impacts \u2014 that is, the climate effects of burning fossil fuels that move through them, even though those emissions will occur at an entirely different project.\nAnd last August the D.C. Circuit overturned FERC\u2019s approval of two LNG export projects in Texas after finding it hasn\u2019t done enough to analyze the environmental justice impacts, among other things. The court later partially backtracked in March, reinstating the permits after finding the deficiencies were serious but not \u201cfundamental.\u201d\nLast November, however, the D.C. Circuit ruled in a separate case that the White House\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality lacks authority to make its NEPA guidance binding on agencies, leaving decisions about how to carry out NEPA reviews to each agency. And in February, a federal judge appointed by Trump ruled a Biden-era NEPA implementation rule was \u201cirrational\u201d anyway.\nAnd just this week, CEQ yanked Biden-era guidance calling on agencies to consider climate change in NEPA reviews, calling such considerations \u201cinconsistent\u201d with President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-fossil fuel executive orders.\nThe Trump administration is also seeking to dramatically speed up NEPA reviews, which can drag on for years. Last week, the Interior Department approved a uranium mine in Utah after just 11 days of review, drawing criticisms from environmental groups arguing the government can\u2019t possibly have considered the complexities of a project like that so quickly.",

        "Content": "DOGE appointee sparks turf battle at Interior: \u2018Ignore the email from HR\u2019\nThe Interior bureau that holds the key to Trump\u2019s fossil fuel agenda is riven by feuding between career staff and an emissary from Elon Musk\u2019s budget-cutting operation.\nDOGE-driven staff cuts inside the Interior Department have set off a turf battle over how to deploy personnel at the Bureau of Land Management \u2014 raising concerns the vacancies would undermine President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to boost domestic fossil fuel and minerals production.\nA memo issued this month by a DOGE appointee at Interior set off a tussle over how employees at BLM should fulfill the duties for the thousands of jobs that now sit empty, but which people inside the agency say are critical for its day-to-day operations.\nThe May 2 memo, obtained by POLITICO, was signed by Stephanie Holmes, a former staffer for Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency who is now embedded as Interior\u2019s acting chief human capital officer. It ordered most staff to stop doing \u201cdetail\u201d work \u2014 temporarily filling in for vacant positions \u2014 and return to their official permanent positions by May 18.\nBut BLM Deputy Director for Administration and Programs Michael Nedd, a 30-year veteran of the bureau, instructed career staff to ignore the Holmes memo, saying it would have resulted in fewer positions being filled, three people familiar with the situation told POLITICO.\nThe bureau oversees the 245 million acres and the oil, gas, coal and minerals produced on that land, making it a critical player in fulfilling Trump\u2019s pledge of rapidly expanding the nation\u2019s fossil fuel and mineral production.\nBLM employees said Nedd\u2019s direction to staff marked a boiling over of career staff distress over the steep loss of bureau personnel after DOGE first attempted to fire agency employees, a move that courts ruled to be unlawful. Interior has since offered deferred buyouts and early retirements and is now planning a potentially massive reduction in force to be carried out in coming weeks. A bureau spokesperson declined to comment on how many people have left so far.\nNedd told staff \u201cto ignore the email from HR\u201d because \u201cthe work is too important and these people in detail are doing the work of the Administration,\u201d said one person familiar with Nedd\u2019s directive who was granted anonymity to discuss internal department affairs.\nA second person working at BLM confirmed Nedd\u2019s direction to staff, as did a person outside the agency who interacts with the bureau. Those people were also granted anonymity to protect working relationships.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a battle of HR versus Mike Nedd,\u201d one of the people inside the agency said. The administration is \u201cshooting themselves in the foot,\u201d this person said of the Interior HR memo. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of people.\u201d\nNedd did not respond to inquiries. A BLM spokesperson declined to comment.\nAn Interior Department spokesperson said Nedd did not tell people to ignore the memo.\nLawmakers of both parties have criticized Interior\u2019s overall staffing cuts, saying the steep headcount reductions were leaving critical positions unfilled.\nMaine Rep. Chellie Pingree, the top Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee for Interior\u2019s budget, said the department has lost more than 10 percent of its staff through buyouts and early retirements offered by the Trump administration.\n\u201cI am very worried about the state of Interior,\u201d Pingree told Interior Secretary Doug Burgum during the subcommittee\u2019s hearing Tuesday on the department\u2019s proposed budget. \u201cThere\u2019s been a stunning decline in its ability to do its mission.\u201d\nNevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei also said he was concerned that an exodus of staff from Interior would hurt efficiency.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can sit there and hold people\u2019s feet to the fire when you\u2019ve got so many empty desks,\u201d Amodei said during the hearing.\nBurgum defended the department\u2019s overall efforts to cut its staff at the hearing, saying the goal was to peel away layers of bureaucracy and move more staff to the local level.\nIf BLM were run like a private company \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have five layers between headquarters and the front lines\u201d Burgum told the committee. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to streamline, to get more people out there to get it done.\u201d\nThe BLM\u2019s roughly 10,000 employees manage vast swaths of land in Western states such as Utah, New Mexico and Alaska. Bureau staff are in charge of processing applications to drill for oil and natural gas, mine for coal and uranium, develop wells for geothermal energy and carry out other energy-related projects on federal land.\nBut BLM still doesn\u2019t have a director after Trump\u2019s first nominee, Kathleen Sgamma, withdrew her nomination last month following the surfacing of an essay she wrote years ago criticizing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by a throng of the president\u2019s supporters on the U.S. Capitol.\nInterior\u2019s human relations staff told employees at the end of April to upload their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in preparations for job cuts that could see hundreds or thousands pushed out. The reductions are coming even as Burgum has pledged to slash the time the department takes to process permits \u2014 reducing it from years to in some cases less than a month.\nThe DOGE-led staff reductions have led to a growing number of vacant positions that more employees have to fill in to perform basic jobs, according to three bureau employees granted anonymity to discuss internal bureau affairs. So far, they said, Burgum has been content to let Holmes and Tyler Hassen, a former oilfield services executive and former DOGE staffer who is now Interior\u2019s acting policy chief, run the department\u2019s staffing policy.\nBLM leadership has been forced to assign temporary roles to staff, as shown by another email bureau leadership sent to employees in early May and obtained by POLITICO.\nAmong the changes in duties added to several people\u2019s existing roles laid out in that email, BLM\u2019s main chief of staff, Jill Moran, was named as the temporary chief of staff for the assistant secretary of land and minerals. Mitchell Leverette, the bureau\u2019s director for its Eastern States office, was named to also serve as assistant director for energy, minerals and realty management, a position that became vacant after the previous person took a buyout. Karen Kelleher, who had served as another deputy director of state operations after working as Idaho state director, was named as temporarily working as acting Alaska state director after that position became vacant.\nThe temporary work isn\u2019t just for high-level staff, employees said. With more senior staff being given temporary assignments, mid- and lower-level staff have had to take on more work to backfill leadership responsibilities, employees told POLITICO.\n\u201cMost of the folks I work with are juggling at least two offices at the moment without any extra incentive,\u201d said an employee at one of the bureau\u2019s state offices who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",

GAO rulings are nonbinding but could influence Congress\u2019 response to President Donald Trump\u2019s freezing of billions of dollars lawmakers intended to flow to specific programs and projects, as well as the many ongoing lawsuits challenging the president\u2019s tactics.\nAs Trump and his top advisers argue that the decades-old law is unconstitutional, GAO notes the Constitution \u201cspecifically vests Congress with the power of the purse.\u201d\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement the GAO decision \u201caffirms what we\u2019ve long known: the President is breaking the law to block funding Congress passed on a bipartisan basis and that is owed to the American people \u2014 simply because he disagrees with it.\u201d\nThe department has said that pausing the charger program was necessary as it rewrites rules for using the grant money, but the federal watchdog dismissed that argument.\nIf the Trump administration \u201cwishes to make changes\u201d to funding under the program, GAO wrote, the president needs to send Congress a so-called rescissions request or propose new legislation to make changes to funding mandates already signed into law.\nGAO also ruled the Transportation Department erred in its interpretation of when funds were \u201cobligated\u201d under the program \u2014 a key factor because DOT allowed states to keep spending money that was already obligated when it ordered the pause in February.\nUnder the Trump administration\u2019s interpretation \u2014 which it said matched the way it operated other highway aid programs \u2014 the funding for electric vehicle infrastructure was considered obligated when states signed project agreements with the Federal Highway Administration to build a charging station. That meant $526 million was obligated when it suspended the program, according to DOT.\nBut GAO said that under its interpretation of the infrastructure law, NEVI funds are considered obligated when they become available to states under the statute each fiscal year \u2014 meaning more than $3.2 billion should be considered obligated.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget called GAO\u2019s opinion \u201cwrong\u201d and said the Transportation Department is \u201cappropriately using the authority granted to it by statute to review state plans.\u201d\nA DOT spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe Trump administration is also facing a lawsuit from 17 states over the frozen EV charger funding.\nThe GAO ruling came the same morning Senate Republicans voted to overturn a California emission standards waiver issued by the Biden administration, despite the GAO and Senate parliamentarian ruling the waiver did not qualify for reversal using the Congressional Review Act process.",

        "Content": "China\u2019s head start on clean energy is shaping the debate on the Republicans\u2019 megabill\nEfforts to preserve Biden-era tax breaks for green technology are running into an administration focused on fossil fuels \u2014 and unwilling to play on what it sees as Beijing\u2019s turf.\nThe Republican clean-energy feud complicating President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d megabill comes down to a fundamental divide in Washington over how to confront China.\nOne camp wants the United States to compete with Beijing in the race to dominate the energy technologies of the future, from solar panels and wind turbines to batteries and electric cars.\nThe other side says China has already won the clean energy race, due in part to practices such as forced labor, massive subsidies and intellectual property theft \u2014 and playing in that game would make the United States the loser. They want the U.S. to focus on energy sources it already dominates, including oil, natural gas and coal.\nThis intra-party rift has become a significant stumbling block for the GOP\u2019s tax and spending bill, which is caught up in demands by hard-line conservatives for a wholesale gutting of hundreds of billions of dollars in Biden-era clean energy tax incentives. That push threatens to alienate moderate Republicans whose communities stand to gain from factories and other projects enabled by the tax breaks \u2014 and green-tech advocates who had hoped they could sway Trump by framing the incentives as the key to edging out China.\nThe message they\u2019ve gotten instead: When it comes to winning on clean energy, Trump just isn\u2019t interested.\n\u201cThe second administration is really not about taking half-measures,\u201d said Daniel Simmons, who ran the Energy Department\u2019s energy efficiency and renewable energy office in Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cTo all appearances, it is not a battlefield that they care about.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s Energy Department confirmed as much in a statement to POLITICO that focused largely on oil \u2014 an energy source that the U.S. produces more of than any other country.\n\u201cThanks to President Trump, America is leading the way in lowering costs by removing red tape and unleashing affordable, abundant, and reliable American energy,\u201d the department said Friday, adding: \u201cAs the world\u2019s largest oil producer, the United States welcomes a secure and stable global supply of oil that promotes economic prosperity at home and promotes peace and stability around the world.\u201d\nThe White House referred questions about its clean-energy worldview to the Energy Department.\nTrump officials have argued that putting money into green technology boosts China, which dominates major slices of the global battery, electric vehicle, solar and wind energy supply chains.\nTrump\u2019s zero-sum assessment of the clean energy market has forged an energy strategy even more reliant on fossil fuels than he pursued in his first term. Following this approach would jeopardize a U.S. clean energy manufacturing industry that is just beginning to sprout \u2014 and, green tech advocates say, all but ensure that China will command the global sector.\nThat vision is coming to a head in Congress, where Republicans are working to slash the clean energy incentives created by President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. While not proposing to erase the tax breaks altogether, GOP lawmakers in the House have floated tight restrictions outlawing Chinese sourcing in energy projects\u2019 supply chains. Those limits would render most of the tax credits unusable for projects that have not yet been built, effectively squelching the nascent U.S. clean manufacturing sector.\nThe changes remain in limbo as part of the broader budget reconciliation bill, the legislative vehicle for greenlighting Republicans\u2019 and Trump\u2019s policy agenda that can pass with a simple majority vote in Congress. House Republicans are trying to forge a compromise among fiscal conservatives and blocs of GOP lawmakers that want to preserve clean energy credits and raise tax deductions caps for state and local taxes.\nTrump\u2019s presence looms over the negotiations. He has repeatedly vowed to end Biden\u2019s programs \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest-ever investment in clean energy and fighting climate change \u2014 while labeling them the \u201cgreen new scam.\u201d Cutting many of those policies, such as consumer credits to purchase electric vehicles, would fund a small portion of his administration\u2019s other priorities, including trillions of dollars in tax breaks.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t see climate change as a problem,\u201d George David Banks, who ran Trump\u2019s first-term climate portfolio, said of the current team\u2019s outlook. He added, \u201cThey don\u2019t want to essentially create a jobs program for China.\u201d\nDefenders of the IRA tax credits say killing them would wipe out an American jobs program, one whose benefits would flow to heavily Republican communities as well as Democratic strongholds. Private-sector manufacturing projects seizing on Biden\u2019s incentives had been projected to create roughly 160,000 jobs, according to analyses published last year.\nOverturning the subsidies would eliminate a potential U.S. export market for solar modules and batteries that could be worth as much as $50 billion by 2030, according to another analysis by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Other countries would fill an $80 billion investment gap left by shuttered U.S. solar facilities, electric vehicle shops and battery gigafactories.\nMany countries stand to benefit from the U.S. vacating the space, the Johns Hopkins researchers wrote. But governments outside the U.S. would face risks as well: Those that fail to encourage clean tech investments at home could fall even further behind China, which would likely benefit in every industrial category.\nThe researchers also raised the prospect of a transition of intellectual property to China: As U.S. business shuttered, they said, foreign companies could purchase their technical knowledge at fire-sale prices.\nTrump\u2019s barrage of tariffs against nations worldwide would limit some of the advantage countries could gain by selling clean technology to the U.S., said Tim Sahay, one of the authors of the study. Still, he said, the upshot from Trump\u2019s policies was clear \u2014 including for European allies that had erupted in fury over Biden\u2019s use of protectionist tax breaks to move clean energy manufacturing to the United States.\n\u201cChina would be the biggest winner but not the only winner. \u2026 The rest of the world wins,\u201d Sahay said. It\u2019s \u201cbasically the IRA in reverse. When the IRA passed, foreigners were like, \u2018Oh my God, Americans are stealing our jobs and investments because of their superior fiscal space.\u2019 Well, now the IRA is gone, then foreigners are like, \u2018Well, more for us.\u2019\u201d\nSome conservative clean energy supporters still hope they can persuade Trump to back tax credits that have sprung solar manufacturing and battery-making plants across Republican strongholds in the Sun Belt and Rust Belt.\nThose advocates criticized the IRA for being too lenient on allowing Chinese content into the supply chains of products receiving the tax incentives. But they believe Trump would bless tweaks that tighten foreign content requirements to retain incentives that support blue-collar jobs in the U.S.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous and rapidly growing market for low-carbon technologies around the world, and right now the U.S. is a secondary player,\u201d said Greg Bertelsen, CEO of the Cleaner Economy Coalition, a business advocacy organization that promotes low-carbon manufacturing at the state and federal level. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition within the Trump administration that we need to be competing in these markets for these technologies.\u201d\nTrump officials have been making a very different case.\nLast month, Energy Secretary Chris Wright flew to Eastern Europe to propose that ministers from Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and other regional governments join \u201cTeam Energy Freedom,\u201d urging them to embrace oil, gas and nuclear energy and reject what he framed as climate dogma.\n\u201cClimate alarmism has reduced freedom, prosperity and national security,\u201d he said, adding \u2014 in language that carried a particular charge addressed to former communist bloc countries \u2014 that it may be a Trojan horse to \u201cgrow centralization and re-establish top-down control.\u201d\nWright\u2019s subordinate Tommy Joyce was even more blunt when he told a gathering of 60 governments last month in London that the pursuit of climate policy was a gift to Beijing.\n\u201cThere are no wind turbines without concessions to or coercion from China,\u201d he said.\nPeople outside MAGA world also acknowledge the dominance China has built over decades of developing its clean energy supply chains.\nIn solar, batteries, electric vehicles and to some extent wind power, \u201cChina started early. China is the biggest,\u201d said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\nThese are the core clean technologies the world is going to need en masse in the coming decades as it shifts towards a cleaner energy system. And in all of these fields, Li said, \u201cthe Chinese lead is significant and irreversible.\u201d\nIn the past months, for example, two rival Chinese companies \u2014 BYD and CATL \u2014 made potentially game-changing claims when they announced they had developed electric vehicle batteries that could get 400 or even 500 kilometers (roughly 250 to 310 miles) from just a five-minute charge. Tesla boasts that its \u201csuperchargers\u201d can give drivers around 320 kilometers in about 15 minutes.\nRepublican proposals would also hamstring some clean energy technologies that the Trump administration has touted, such as next-generation nuclear, fusion and geothermal, according to an analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group. The proposed tweaks to subsidies would essentially eliminate the long-term price signals that early-stage technologies covet, eroding their business case. Beyond that, the administration\u2019s massive spending and job cuts across federal agencies and science research threaten to constrain U.S. innovation.\nRather than focusing on clean energy technologies such as batteries and EVs, the Trump administration has so far made critical minerals the forefront of its strategy to combat China, said a State Department official who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Those efforts focus on extracting and processing raw materials rather than supporting the value-added industries like battery-making or electric vehicles.\nThe official said the administration\u2019s opposition to subsidies for green technology doesn\u2019t mean it opposes the technologies writ large \u2014 apart from wind energy, which Trump has made clear for years that he despises.\nApart from the current U.S. government, no other major power has determined that China\u2019s dominance means that action to fight climate change needs to take a backseat. The Biden administration\u2019s argument, one still being pursued in Europe, was that a targeted industrial strategy could claw back some share of those industries.\nThose strategies have often come cloaked in pledges to make this country or that country a \u201cclean energy superpower.\u201d But Li said there was a danger of \u201cmaking too big of a promise. A promise that cannot be entirely fulfilled.\u201d\nLi said he had long feared that someday a U.S. president would ask: If China\u2019s lead is so big, \u201cthen why do we play the game?\u201d\nThat is the conclusion being drawn in the White House during Trump\u2019s second term. And it helps explain why the administration has shut down government funding for future projects, kneecapped agencies that deal with clean energy and reversed regulations.\n\u201cWhat has surprised me is the extent to which the administration hasn\u2019t just pursued an agenda but has thrown sand in the gears of the parts of agenda that they don\u2019t agree with,\u201d said Thom Woodroofe, a former Australian diplomat in Washington who now works at the Smart Energy Council. \u201cEven when it costs American jobs.\u201d\nZack Colman reported from Washington.

        "Summary": "But two Trump-appointed judges indicated they may consider this a contract claim that would have to be heard by a different court.",
        "Content": "Appeals court questions EPA\u2019s termination of $20B climate grants\nBut two Trump-appointed judges indicated they may consider this a contract claim that would have to be heard by a different court.\nA panel of appellate judges on Monday appeared skeptical of EPA\u2019s reasons for terminating $20 billion in Biden-era climate grants, but it indicated the dispute could end up in a different court.\nDuring over two hours of oral arguments, the three judges questioned the timing and authority of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin\u2019s termination of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants, which were intended to support climate and affordable housing projects using funds from Democrats\u2019 climate law.\n\u201cThe facts here are not great for the government,\u201d said Judge Nina Pillard, an Obama appointee, pointing to EPA\u2019s abrupt termination of the grants in March, on the eve of an initial hearing in a recipient\u2019s lawsuit and while the agency was still in the midst of its own fact-finding probe.\nThe panel\u2019s other two members, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both of whom were named to the bench by President Donald Trump in his first term, expressed more skepticism about allowing recipients to spend money while litigation plays out.\n\u201cIf the money were to go out, and then the government were to ultimately prevail, the government would be out of these billions of dollars,\u201d Rao said while trying to determine what is in the public interest.\nBut Katsas and Rao also had hard questions for EPA, including over its concession that it has made no specific allegations of wrongdoing by the recipients themselves.\n\u201cWhat is your claimed basis for termination on the theory that there\u2019s no breach, there\u2019s no waste, fraud or abuse \u2014 but there\u2019s a contract structure that might facilitate that?\u201d asked Katsas. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I see that in the grant agreement.\u201d\nYaakov Roth, acting assistant attorney general for EPA\u2019s civil division, replied that EPA can cite \u201cstructural risk of waste and abuse\u201d rather than specific instances.\nEPA and the grant recipients have been fighting over the funds for over two months. Things came to a head in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia last month, when Judge Tanya Chutkan, an Obama appointee, ruled that EPA had terminated the grants unlawfully and that the recipients should be able to access their funds. The groups have at least $625 million in transfer requests pending, though that number has likely risen since it was disclosed in mid-April.\nThe legal fight will decide the future of one of the Biden administration\u2019s signature climate achievements, and one that Democrats in the Inflation Reduction Act structured to be obligated before Trump could return to power. The Trump administration has plowed ahead with canceling these and around 800 other smaller grants nonetheless.\nHouse Republicans included a repeal of the GGRF authority in their reconciliation bill that passed out of committee last week, but it has not yet cleared the House or gone before the Senate.\nAlthough EPA argues its terminations were lawful, its primary legal argument is that the terminations can only be challenged as a breach of contract, which under a federal law called the Tucker Act would have to be heard by a specialized tribunal, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n\u201cWe have a dispute over whether the contract has been terminated consistent with the terms,\u201d said Roth. \u201cIf we\u2019re right about that, they get nothing. If they\u2019re right about that, they get damages. And we\u2019re not disputing that. But that has to be a different court.\u201d\nChutkan disagreed and held she had jurisdiction, and EPA immediately appealed to the D.C. Circuit.\nEarlier this month, Katsas and Rao ruled that terminated grants from the U.S. Agency for Global Media to several radio outlets were contract claims that must go before the Court of Federal Claims. Pillard dissented in those cases, and the full D.C. Circuit subsequently stayed their ruling.\nThe two judges made similar statements during Monday\u2019s arguments over EPA\u2019s actions.\nRao argued the case was \u201ca dispute about who has title\u201d to the money \u2014 the recipients or EPA. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t that a contract question that should go to the Court of Federal Claims?\u201d she asked.\nAdam Unikowsky, an attorney at Jenner & Block representing the grant recipients, replied that the groups believe EPA has a \u201csecurity interest\u201d but that otherwise \u201cit\u2019s our money, and we\u2019re seeking to vindicate our property interest in that money.\u201d\nBut Katsas also indicated he was struggling to see the difference.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure the line between contract and property matters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the Tucker Act and contract claims, and it doesn\u2019t really matter whether the government\u2019s obligation is to pay money out of the treasury, which triggers all sorts of other issues, or whether it\u2019s just any old contract obligation. If it\u2019s a contract claim, it\u2019s a contract claim.\u201d\nPillard offered the hardest questions for EPA, noting the Trump administration asked for a one-day extension of the initial hearing in the case, during which time Zeldin terminated the grants \u201cwith zero substantiation that any fraudulent activity is occurring.\u201d She also noted EPA did not wait until the deadline for the grant recipients to respond to questionnaires the agency sent about their activities.\nRoth said the litigation over the freeze and EPA\u2019s decision to terminate the grants quickly \u201cwere two completely separate processes that were playing out at the same time.\u201d\nIn fact, he added, the very need for EPA to send a questionnaire to the recipients \u201creally confirms the problem with the way these grants are structured, because they should not need to do that. They should have that information available to them.\u201d\nBut Pillard appeared unconvinced, later telling the grant recipients she felt they were on \u201cfairly solid ground\u201d in their theory that EPA really terminated the grants as a \u201cpretextual\u201d reason to shutter a program the Trump administration simply didn\u2019t like.\nShe also pushed back on EPA\u2019s assertions that the structure of the GGRF program was suspect.\nThe Biden administration set up the grant programs in this way so that the recipient groups could leverage private funds and expand the impact of the spending, Pillard argued. \u201cI mean, if there\u2019s something illegal about that model, we should know. But I don\u2019t see anything to that effect, and I don\u2019t see after how many months actually any evidence of the structural problems that the government purported to rely on here.\u201d\nRoth responded that it could be set up so that the money could be used that way, but EPA would have \u201cadditional rights in terms of being able to approve the expenditures to sub-grantees and sub-sub-grantees.\u201d\nCriminal investigations into Biden officials\u2019 actions in setting up the program and distributing the funds has not found any \u201cmeaningful evidence\u201d of wrongdoing, The New York Times reported Friday. The launching of that probe back in February prompted the resignation of a senior prosecutor who disagreed there was sufficient basis.\nZeldin has long argued that Biden officials had guided the funds to former employers or groups connected to powerful Democrats. But the officials and recipients say appropriate ethical safeguards were in place to prevent self-dealing.\nThe Times\u2019 report was not raised at Monday\u2019s argument.\nIf EPA should lose before the D.C. Circuit, Zeldin made it clear last week that he will appeal.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, so if a district court judge makes a decision, we are not going to assume that the United States Supreme Court is going to agree with that district court,\u201d he said at a Senate appropriations hearing.",

        "Content": "The clean energy boom that could snarl the GOP megabill\nArizona Rep. Juan Ciscomani and other rank-and-file Republicans are facing a tough choice: resist Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to gut Democrats\u2019 climate law or incur the wrath of constituents who could lose billions in investments and thousands of new jobs.\nCASA GRANDE, Arizona \u2014 An Arizona Republican\u2019s swing district is experiencing a clean energy boom. He may have to buck Donald Trump to protect it.\nSince Rep. Juan Ciscomani took office in 2023, electric car manufacturer Lucid Motors quadrupled the size of its plant in Casa Grande, bringing thousands of additional jobs to his economically struggling district. Further east, across Tucson\u2019s suburbs and beyond, utilities, farms and residents are flocking to install solar in a bid to temper rising electricity prices.\nAnd the SunZia transmission line, part of the country\u2019s largest clean energy project, is set to carry gigawatts of wind power across the northern half of his district, transporting much-needed power to Phoenix and California.\nBut that growth is partly driven by incentives in Democrats\u2019 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump has derided as the \u201cGreen New Scam\u201d and Republican leaders are looking to cut to help pay for a massive tax, border security and energy package.\nThat is going to force dozens of rank-and-file Republicans like Ciscomani to make a difficult decision: resist Trump\u2019s efforts to gut the IRA or incur the wrath of constituents who could lose billions of dollars in clean energy investments and tens of thousands of new jobs. But these lawmakers also risk drawing the ire of the president and his allies if they slow the final package or vote against it. The House Ways and Means Committee portion of the bill, released this week, would gut many of the IRA\u2019s clean energy tax credits.\nFor Ciscomani, a rising star in the GOP who holds one of the most competitive House seats in the nation, the decision could be a pivotal one for his political future \u2014 and that of his party. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the House, Trump endorsed Ciscomani\u2019s bid for a third term last month. But Democrats \u2014 who have identified him as one of their top targets \u2014 are already preparing their attacks if he votes to cut clean energy programs or limit safety-net programs like Medicaid in the reconciliation package.\nSo far, Ciscomani has looked to toe the line. He has signed onto two letters urging leadership to preserve at least some of the IRA\u2019s credits, and met recently with Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.), whose committee holds jurisdiction over the credits, to make his case.\n\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear what I\u2019m going to be fighting for,\u201d Ciscomani said in an interview.\nBut he\u2019ll have to make a decision once Republicans bring the full package to the floor, which they aim to do by Memorial Day. Ciscomani, along with other Republicans who have called to preserve the IRA, in March voted for the budget resolution that is allowing the GOP to attempt to pass the package without Democratic votes.\nKirsten Engel, a University of Arizona environmental law professor and former Democratic candidate who narrowly lost to Ciscomani in 2022 and 2024, said the climate law has been transformative for the district \u2014 and residents will be closely watching whether Ciscomani votes to protect it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that you support this \u2014 it\u2019s another thing to actually vote in a manner that\u2019s going to make sure that this money actually is available,\u201d said Engel, who is not currently planning another run. \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s trying to have his cake and eat it too.\u201d\nCiscomani acknowledged he hasn\u2019t yet drawn any red lines on the clean energy credits. But he emphasized how important they are to companies such as Lucid Motors, which he helped recruit to Arizona a decade ago as an aide to then-Republican Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\u201cAs much as there are other aspects of the IRA we [Republicans] can disagree with, these tax credits have had an impact in my district \u2014 and on job creation, on investment, also national security, because of energy production and having wanted to bring that more domestically,\u201d he said.\nThe clean energy boom has opened new doors for many of Ciscomani\u2019s constituents, like Ruben Subia. When Subia left the military and returned home to Casa Grande, he figured he would have to follow many of his high school classmates to Phoenix or Tucson for a higher-paying job. But Lucid was hiring for its new factory, offering high-paying jobs right in town and a chance to put his skills in the trades to work. Subia became one of the first 1,000 employees at the plant, which has since expanded to 2,800 after it quadrupled its footprint last year.\nThe jobs at Lucid have been \u201clife-changing\u201d for many in Casa Grande, giving them the opportunity to buy a car or a house for the first time, said Subia, who now works in human resources. His two brothers, who are also veterans, have joined him at Lucid.\nThe IRA helped supercharge a manufacturing boom in the city of 64,000, a former agricultural and mining town. Proctor and Gamble and several semiconductor chemical manufacturers have followed Lucid to the area. Two copper mines that could eventually supply Lucid are in development on the city\u2019s outskirts. And Central Arizona College launched a training center just outside town that has prepared thousands of locals to work at Lucid and the other factories.\nPopulation and median income are up, and businesses are streaming back, buoyed by the wages from Lucid, which is now Pinal County\u2019s largest employer. Target announced in February it would reopen a store in Casa Grande it closed in 2016.\nCasa Grande Mayor Lisa Navarro Fitzgibbons, who has lived in the area since the 1970s, said the partisanship around the IRA credits \u201cdrives me crazy\u201d because they have only brought jobs and growth to towns like hers.\n\u201cAs we continue to see some of these cuts and changes in legislation, we are the ones that are struggling and scrambling,\u201d said Fitzgibbons, who signed a letter alongside 15 other mayors in April urging lawmakers to preserve the full suite of credits. Fitzgibbons\u2019 position is nonpartisan.\nHouse Republicans\u2019 proposal would eliminate all of the IRA\u2019s consumer EV credits within two years and curtail the advanced manufacturing credit that has spurred a wave of factory investments across the country.\nWhile Lucid\u2019s factory was planned before the IRA passed, it benefits from the manufacturing incentive for the battery packs it assembles and the consumer EV tax credit for leased vehicles. The company also hopes to claim the EV credit for its upcoming cheaper midsize SUV, planned for 2026 release.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we won\u2019t be here [if the credits are eliminated], but the growth curve will be a lot slower, the job opportunities will be less,\u201d said Adrian Price, Lucid\u2019s senior vice president of operations.\nPrice said the company aligns well with the Trump administration\u2019s goals of bringing vehicle manufacturing back to the United States. Unlike many other manufacturers, Lucid does its stamping in-house in Casa Grande \u2014 meaning its cars enter the factory as massive coils of U.S.-sourced aluminum and drive out ready to be delivered.\nBut \u201cmanufacturing is a hugely capital-intensive business \u2026 and you have to be careful about how you invest and grow,\u201d Price said. \u201cThose credits and those opportunities are part of the fabric of how we structure the business to enable us to grow at the fastest rate we can.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just Lucid that could feel the pain of the cuts in Ciscomani\u2019s district. The region\u2019s thriving solar industry is helping temper electricity prices amid surging power demand \u2014 but a combination of the uncertainty around tariffs and the tax credits has already led companies to pull back, said John Mitman, president of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association.\nUtility rates in the region have surged in recent years, Mitman noted. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see even higher rate increases if [the credits for solar] go away, because it is really the primary source of most of that new generation capacity,\u201d he said.\nMitman is founder and CEO of solar developer Obodo Energy, which just completed a 4-megawatt solar installation at a commercial farm in Willcox, an agricultural town in the heart of Ciscomani\u2019s district.\nThe project, which benefits from the tech-neutral clean electricity credit in the IRA, aims to fully offset power demand from three greenhouses, taking strain off the local grid and allowing the farm to grow more cucumbers and tomatoes, according to Mitman.\nAs produce-laden trucks make their way to Interstate 10, they pass under the hulking towers of the nearly-complete SunZia transmission line. The 550-mile-long project, expected to begin operations in 2026, will carry 3 gigawatts of wind energy from central New Mexico to power-hungry customers in Arizona.\nA SunZia spokesperson said the line itself is not receiving IRA subsidies, but the wind project is eligible for the clean electricity credit for the power it generates. Republicans have proposed restricting that credit and moving up its sunset date.\nJust a few miles south of Willcox, Sal Tirrito and his wife Yuri are building their dream property: a farmstead retreat focused around sustainable practices. Opposite the six luxury yurts for overnight guests, Tirrito has plans for a solar canopy over the parking lot, which would power the onsite cafe.\nTirrito was recently awarded a grant for the project under the Agriculture Department\u2019s Rural Energy for America Program, which received a huge infusion from the IRA. But with the future of the funding uncertain, he has decided to hold off for now rather than front the money and hope to get reimbursed given its half-million dollar price tag.\nDemocrats and advocates say tough decisions like these are only the beginning if the climate law is gutted \u2014 and they are pressuring Ciscomani to defend the incentives.\nJoAnna Mendoza, a Marine veteran and Democrat who has filed to challenge Ciscomani, said her campaign will highlight the real-world impacts of the IRA, from job opportunities to lower energy bills. Ciscomani, she argued, has only provided \u201clip service\u201d by failing to challenge Trump\u2019s funding freezes and cuts to clean energy programs.\nCiscomani \u201cshows up for the ribbon cuttings and then turns around and cuts funding,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cI think voters, the constituency, is starting to see that.\u201d\nChris Donat, another Democratic candidate, pointed to the regular demonstrations against the Republican budget bill that Democrats and others are holding outside Ciscomani\u2019s office in Tucson, saying voters are angry their lawmaker has not bucked Trump on clean energy and other issues and is \u201cobviously afraid to stand up for what he at least originally believed in.\u201d\nNational Democrats are also turning their attention to the tightly contested district. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.) drew more than 10,000 people to a March rally in Tucson for their \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour while Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) held a town hall in April to highlight the impacts of potential Medicaid cuts \u2014 and point out Ciscomani has not held his own in-person town halls for constituents.\nThe cuts and limitations to the safety-net health program proposed by House Republicans to help pay for their bill further complicate Ciscomani\u2019s calculus on the clean energy cuts. More than 30,000 adults in Ciscomani\u2019s district are at risk of losing coverage while hospitals could be closed if federal funds dry up, according to research from Daniel Derksen, director of the University of Arizona Center for Rural Health.\nCiscomani was among the dozen Republicans to declare in April they would not vote for a bill that cuts Medicaid for vulnerable populations.\nCiscomani said in the interview that Medicaid is his only red line \u201cso far,\u201d but he dismissed his Democratic opponents\u2019 claims that he would fold on the clean energy credits.\n\u201cThese Democrats, they\u2019re straight up just grasping at straws at this point,\u201d Ciscomani said.\nGOP state Sen. T.J. Shope, who represents Casa Grande and serves as president pro tempore, said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d Ciscomani \u2014 whom he has known for a decade \u2014 will be able to navigate the difficult decisions on the reconciliation bill.\n\u201cIf history serves as any indicator, he does a very good job of walking a tightrope,\u201d Shope said. \u201cHe does a very good job listening to his constituents.\u201d",

        "Summary": "The administration said it wants to rescind and reconsider whether limits are needed for four PFAS that chemical companies are still producing and using in the U.S. \u2014 despite known health risks.",
        "Content": "Trump EPA moves to weaken drinking water limits on toxic \u2018forever chemicals\u2019\nThe administration said it wants to rescind and reconsider whether limits are needed for four PFAS that chemical companies are still producing and using in the U.S. \u2014 despite known health risks.\nThe Trump administration said Wednesday it intends to roll back first-ever limits set by the Biden administration on four toxic \u201cforever chemicals\u201d contaminating water supplies across the country.\nEven low levels of the chemicals known as PFAS are linked with cancer, immune system problems, developmental effects and other health ailments. EPA-mandated testing has found them in nearly half of Americans\u2019 drinking water.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency will leave in place and continue to defend limits for the two most notorious types of PFAS \u2014 PFOA and PFOS \u2014 which have been phased out of use. But EPA will ask a federal court to let the agency \u201crescind the regulations and reconsider\u201d the decision to regulate four of their close cousins that were designed to replace them. Zeldin also said he will craft a regulation to give water utilities two more years to comply with the remaining limits and will provide technical support to water systems, especially those in small and rural communities, as well as opportunities to request exemptions from the regulation.\n\u201cWe are on a path to uphold the agency\u2019s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,\u201d he said in a statement.\nZeldin, who pushed for aggressive regulation of PFAS chemicals when he was a representative from Long Island, New York, has said addressing the country\u2019s PFAS problem is one of his top priorities as administrator. He recently announced plans to boost research and address industrial releases of the chemicals.\nBut the drinking water regulation presents a politically treacherous decision for the administration, with some of the country\u2019s most powerful business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Chemistry Council, fiercely opposing it.\nMany of those groups\u2019 members have used or produced the chemicals for decades in everything from stain-resistant carpeting to nonstick cookware to firefighting foam, and could face significant liability for cleanups and personal injury lawsuits. They are also continuing to profit from that production and use, including in politically important sectors such as semiconductors and defense technology.\nThe American Chemistry Council, the main trade group for chemicals manufacturers, argued in a statement Wednesday that the 2024 drinking water rule was flawed and said the Trump administration\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t sufficiently resolve the problems.\n\u201cEPA\u2019s actions reflect efforts to address the concerns of water utilities and local governments, focus on national drinking water priorities, minimize the impact on water bills, and ensure consistency with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. However, EPA\u2019s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,\u201d the group said.\nACC spokesperson Tom Flanagin declined to comment on whether the group would continue its challenge to the remaining parts of the rule.\nDrinking water utilities have also sued over the Biden-era limits, arguing the cost of system upgrades to comply with it would be almost twice the $1.5 billion annual cost EPA estimated and would exceed the $12.5 billion settlement water utilities and chemical manufacturers reached over the chemicals.\nThe heads of two drinking water utility trade groups said in a statement they don\u2019t anticipate the reworking of just the standards for the four newer chemicals to have much of an impact on that price tag.\n\u201cWhile today\u2019s announcement does not appear to substantially reduce the costs of the PFAS rule, it does acknowledge the very substantial challenges communities face in finding alternative sources of water or installing treatment,\u201d American Water Works Association CEO David LaFrance and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies CEO Tom Dobbins said in a joint statement.\nA spokesperson for AWWA said the group is awaiting more details from EPA in the coming weeks before determining whether it will proceed with its lawsuit challenging the Biden-era regulation.\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s move is a clear victory for industries that still actively produce and use the newer PFAS. Those chemicals include GenX, PFHxS and PFBS, as well as PFNA, a longer chain chemical that has largely been phased out. The 2024 regulation set a 10 parts per trillion limit for three of those chemicals and regulated mixtures of all four.\nPulling those limits stands to have a particularly significant impact on communities near military bases and industrial sites, which have faced some of the most acute contaminations and have been struggling to understand the health impact of the brews of PFAS their families have been exposed to for a generation.\nThat includes communities along the Cape Fear River in North Carolina, where the company Chemours for years discharged GenX and dozens of other PFAS directly into the water supply for roughly 200,000 people.\nEmily Donovan, whose group Clean Cape Fear has advocated for eliminating PFAS exposure and boosting scientific research, blasted the Trump administration\u2019s move.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disrespectful to PFAS contaminated communities who have suffered debilitating illnesses and devastating losses. This is a clear victory for the trillion dollar chemical industry\u2014not public health,\u201d she said in a statement.\nNorth Carolina is one of the 39 states that do not have their own enforceable limits for some PFAS.\nThree of the four PFAS whose limits EPA wants to pull back are structurally different from the two whose limits the Trump administration wants to leave in place. That raises the prospect that drinking water utilities that upgrade their systems to treat for PFOA and PFOS could select technologies that don\u2019t effectively treat for other PFAS. If the Trump administration decides to issue regulations for those chemicals in the future, water utilities may need to reengineer their systems.\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is also facing another hot-button decision around PFAS: whether to continue defending a Biden-era regulation listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous under the nation\u2019s Superfund law. That rule is seen as key to forcing chemical companies and others responsible for the pollution to pay for cleanup \u2014 something Zeldin has said he supports. But it also stands to create massive financial liabilities for major companies and the Defense Department.",

        "Content": "\u2018How come I can\u2019t breathe?': Musk\u2019s data company draws a backlash in Memphis\nThe company\u2019s turbines \u2014 enough to power 280,000 homes \u2014 run without emission controls in an area that leads Tennessee in asthma hospitalizations.\nMEMPHIS, Tennessee \u2014 Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company is belching smog-forming pollution into an area of South Memphis that already leads the state in emergency department visits for asthma.\nNone of the 35 methane gas turbines that help power xAI\u2019s massive supercomputer is equipped with pollution controls typically required by federal rules.\nThe company has no Clean Air Act permits.\nIn just 11 months since the company arrived in Memphis, xAI has become one of Shelby County\u2019s largest emitters of smog-producing nitrogen oxides, according to calculations by environmental groups whose data has been reviewed by POLITICO\u2019s E&E News. The plant is in an area whose air is already considered unhealthy due to smog.\nThe turbines spew nitrogen oxides, also known as NOx, at an estimated rate of 1,200 to 2,000 tons a year \u2014 far more than the gas-fired power plant across the street or the oil refinery down the road. That\u2019s according to calculations by the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonpartisan legal advocacy group that focuses on the South, which used turbine manufacturer spec sheets to estimate xAI\u2019s annual emissions and compare them with pollution that other South Memphis plants have reported to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s National Emissions Inventory.\nThe turbines were necessary to get the third version of the company\u2019s AI chatbot up and running in time, Musk said at the product\u2019s launch in February, adding: \u201cWe have generators on one side of the building, just trailer after trailer of generators until we can get the utility power to come in.\u201d He has not publicly addressed the pollution concerns and did not respond to requests for comment about the turbines powering the plant and their lack of pollution controls.\nJust three miles away is Boxtown, a secluded neighborhood that officially became part of the city of Memphis in 1968, the year that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel downtown. While the annexation had come with the promise of connecting Boxtown to municipal utilities, many homes still had no running water or sewage service as late as the 1970s.\nToday, more than 90 percent of residents living in Boxtown\u2019s ZIP code are Black, with a median household income of $36,000, according to the Census Bureau. It\u2019s also home to more than 17 industrial facilities \u2014 some of which share an industrial park with xAI \u2014 that release enough toxic pollution to require registration with EPA\u2019s Toxics Release Inventory.\n\u201cI can\u2019t breathe at home, it smells like gas outside,\u201d Boxtown resident Alexis Humphreys said through tears, holding up her asthma inhaler during a public hearing about the turbines on April 25. \u201cHow come I can\u2019t breathe at home and y\u2019all get to breathe at home?\u201d\nTogether the turbines produce enough energy to power 280,000 homes. XAI has been relying on them because the data processing center\u2019s voracious appetite for energy has outpaced electric utilities\u2019 ability to serve it.\nThe turbines are only temporary and don\u2019t require federal permits for their emissions of NOx and other hazardous air pollutants like formaldehyde, xAI\u2019s environmental consultant, Shannon Lynn, said during a webinar hosted by the Memphis Chamber of Commerce. The argument appears to rely on a loophole in federal regulations that environmental groups and former EPA officials say shouldn\u2019t apply to the situation.\nIn January, facing pressure from neighbors and environmental groups, xAI applied for permits for 15 of its turbines, which it says will be permanent.\nBut Lynn said the company will wait until its application is approved before it installs pollution controls on the turbines it keeps onsite. That installation \u201cwill make xAI the lowest-emitting facility in the country,\u201d the company\u2019s local representative, Brent Mayo, said at a permit hearing about the turbines.\nMayo and Lynn didn\u2019t respond to calls and texts from POLITICO\u2019s E&E News requesting comment and have not said publicly how much longer the \u201ctemporary\u201d turbines will remain onsite. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe strategy violates the Clean Air Act, argued Bruce Buckheit, who formerly directed EPA\u2019s air enforcement division. At a minimum, he said, the turbines that will remain onsite should have had pollution controls from the start.\n\u201cThere needs to be a permit beforehand,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just get that first year for free.\u201d\nThe Memphis xAI showdown could become a national test case for artificial intelligence, which demands more electricity than regular internet searches to complete even simple tasks. Utilities across the country have struggled to keep up with the electricity demands of \u201chyper users\u201d like data centers, which are often left to find their own power sources behind the meter.\nThe Trump administration, while allowing Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to eliminate programs dedicated to reducing the disproportionate amount of pollution in communities of color, has also vowed to support artificial intelligence. Before EPA said it would fire or reassign some 450 employees working on environmental justice initiatives late last month, the agency listed making \u201cthe United States the artificial intelligence capital of the world\u201d among five agency priorities \u201cthat will guide EPA\u2019s work.\u201d EPA has also issued new guidance easing pollution rules for some internal combustion engines commonly used by data centers.\n\u201cData centers are a highly competitive space, and other companies are watching what xAI does,\u201d said Amanda Garcia, senior attorney for the SELC, which has advocated for data centers to use more renewable energy to reduce their pollution and draw from the grid. \u201dRight now, what xAI is doing is essentially running a power plant without a permit, and it has a real risk of harming people\u2019s health.\u201d\nXAI\u2019s main product is Musk\u2019s chatbot, Grok, which also generates images. It has become known for having fewer user guardrails than other artificial intelligence programs, like ChatGPT, which often prevent users from requesting images that violate copyright standards or are deemed insensitive. Grok allows users to make deepfakes depicting things like Mickey Mouse wearing a Nazi uniform. Musk has called it \u201cthe most fun AI in the world.\u201d\nBoxtown residents say they have been paying for the images with their health.\nAt a public hearing on the xAI permits at Fairley High School on April 25, multiple residents described cases of asthma and cancer in their families they attribute to air pollution, asking for the Shelby County Department of Health to deny xAI\u2019s permit and shut down all the turbines. Many have health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, that predate xAI\u2019s arrival in South Memphis. But NOx emissions are known to worsen lung conditions, and residents fear that the sheer volume released by xAI will further harm their health. Some, like Humphreys, showed their inhalers and portable oxygen tanks as proof of the damage.\nMany see xAI as just the latest example of Memphis designating their community as a \u201csacrifice zone,\u201d said KeShaun Pearson, who leads the nonprofit Memphis Community Against Pollution. Both his grandmothers died of cancer in their 60s, and Pearson blames pollution for their deaths.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you grow up and realize how redlining has allowed these industries to kill your family,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cElon Musk is a representation of the oligarchy we already knew was operating under Jim Crow. It\u2019s a familiar evil.\u201d\n\u2018Elvis is in the building\u2019\nThe Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce heralds xAI\u2019s arrival as a success.\nAn organization dedicated to economic development, the chamber actively courted xAI last spring, its President Ted Townsend said in an interview. But the decision about where to host the supercomputer powering Musk\u2019s company came down to electricity. Colossus, as Musk calls it, contained some 100,000 computer chips at the time and demanded 150 megawatts of power.\nTownsend and the head of Memphis Light, Gas and Water signed nondisclosure agreements with xAI and in private meetings helped the company craft a plan, Townsend told POLITICO\u2019s E&E News in an interview. They directed xAI to a former oven factory vacated just a couple of years prior that was already equipped with a gas hookup and a substation that could immediately supply 8 MW of power. During the meetings, the utility agreed to support xAI\u2019s request for 150 MW, which would need approval from the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s board of directors.\n\u201cThe AI race is just that, it\u2019s a race,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cSo expediting and building out infrastructure as quickly as possible in the most appropriate ways, within the lines of regulations and laws, that is how we have been instructed and guided.\u201d\nThe Memphis utility declined to make its president, Doug McGowen, available for an interview or answer written questions about xAI\u2019s power supply, referring all comment requests to the Chamber of Commerce.\nLeft out of those negotiations were the Memphis City Council; the county Board of Commissioners; and TVA, whose board ultimately had to approve any requests for more than 100 MW of power.\nThey only learned about the deal in early June, after the deal was done, when Musk announced it with a post on X referencing Memphis\u2019 illustrious music history: \u201cElvis is in the building.\u201d\nAlmost immediately after becoming public, the deal sparked concerns about how xAI\u2019s power use would affect Memphis residents. As recently as 2022, high demand during winter storms has forced TVA to undergo rolling blackouts on some of the coldest days.\nMemphis Light, Gas and Water officials told the public not to worry, saying xAI had brought its own gas generators to power the data center before the TVA board voted on the power request. The company could also rely on the turbines when the authority called on industrial users to reduce their draw during times of high demand.\nTypically, stationary gas turbines need permits before they can be turned on due to the levels of NOx and other pollutants they generate. The permitting process helps ensure that emitters use technology to limit air pollution. There are more stringent guidelines for NOx emissions in an already smoggy area like Shelby County. Smog, a mixture of gases and chemicals, can exacerbate lung diseases like asthma and increase hospital visits.\nOther data centers have sought permits for the same make and model of gas turbines used by xAI before beginning construction.\nBut in August, the Shelby County Health Department said it had not issued any permits for the turbines, writing in a letter that EPA had agreed the department \u201cdoes not currently have authority regarding those mobile gas burning turbines\u201d because they were only temporary.\nThe letter included a copy of the request that department Director Michelle Taylor had made to EPA earlier that month saying that \u201ca statement acknowledging mobile source gas-powered turbines do not require a local Title V permit until they have remained in the same location for more than 364 days would be advantageous to all parties concerned.\u201d\nThat explanation didn\u2019t make sense to the SELC\u2019s Garcia. The Health Department seemed to be referencing an exemption in the law for smaller gas generators, like those used to power asphalt crushers for road projects. But Garcia said the turbines at xAI were big enough and generated enough electricity that they should instead have had to obtain permits as stationary sources, even if they were portable.\nThe SELC told the Health Department as much in multiple letters, but neither Shelby County nor xAI has cited a legal argument for why the turbines should be exempt.\nLocals feared Memphis had become yet another example of Musk\u2019s companies pushing fast-paced development while disregarding environmental regulations. There was Tesla, which in 2021 was cited for 33 air quality violations in California; SpaceX, which has been fined by Texas for allegedly dumping industrial wastewater without a permit; and Musk\u2019s underground tunneling business, The Boring Co., which was also fined by Texas for failing to get a permit to discharge industrial stormwater.\nSince August, the number of gas turbines at the xAI site has only grown, with information only coming to light after community pushback.\nMemphis Light, Gas and Water and chamber officials initially suggested last summer there were 18 turbines of varying sizes. But then, when xAI filed a permit application in January, it listed 15 machines, at 16 MW each. Then, at the end of March, environmental groups flew over the facility and came back with aerial photos showing 35 turbines onsite. Memphis Mayor Paul Young defended the company, saying only 15 were actually running and that the rest were for backup.\nBut in late April, environmental groups sent a plane with thermal cameras to fly over the facility and found 33 turbines giving off significant amounts of heat \u2014 a sign they were also generating electricity and pollution.\n\u201cThe way they have come into the city, it\u2019s like, oh, you think we are unintelligent, you think that the people in these communities aren\u2019t able to comprehend what you are doing and will take this assault on our health lying down,\u201d 15-year-old Boxtown resident Jasmine Bernard said.\nYoung did not respond to an interview request.\nLynn, the environmental consultant listed on xAI\u2019s permit application, also didn\u2019t respond to emails and phone calls for comment. He did speak at a webinar hosted by the Chamber of Commerce in late April to answer community concerns about the turbines. Lynn didn\u2019t disclose his connection to xAI during the webinar and was introduced as only \u201can expert \u2026 who brings decades of experience on environmental compliance issues.\u201d\nIn the webinar, Lynn said xAI did not need air permits for 35 turbines already onsite because \u201cthere\u2019s rules that say temporary sources can be in place for up to 364 days a year. They are not subject to permitting requirements.\u201d\nIf a permit is approved, only seven of the current turbines will remain onsite, and they will be \u201cretrofitted\u201d with selective catalytic reduction pollution controls that will limit NOx pollution to 2 parts per million. By contrast, that make and model of turbine emits NOx at a rate of 9 parts per million, while emissions from other models of turbines onsite can be as high as 25 parts per million, according to their manufacturers. Another eight turbines, also with pollution controls, will be brought in.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re filing a permit because you have to have a permit for a stationary source,\u201d Lynn said.\nThe other 28 turbines currently onsite are \u201ctemporary,\u201d he said, and will be \u201cslowly\u201d moved out as xAI completes work building two substations. But the timeline for that is unclear, because only one of the substations has received the required approval of the TVA board. Townsend, the Chamber of Commerce president, said he doesn\u2019t know what xAI\u2019s timeline is.\n\u2018How does the county know?\u2019\nThe SELC says xAI\u2019s turbines are too large to take advantage of the temporary permitting loophole and should be regulated as stationary sources of pollution, even if they are technically portable. John Walke, a former attorney in EPA\u2019s Office of General Counsel who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, agrees that all the turbines require stationary source permits.\n\u201cXAI\u2019s position is quite suspect \u2014 I mean, they\u2019re huge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe temporary or not temporary argument is irrelevant.\u201d\nNeither Walke nor Buckheit, the former EPA enforcement official, is involved in the case. Buckheit says that at a minimum, the seven turbines that will remain onsite should have had a permit before they were running. The Health Department, he said, should have asked for proof upfront that xAI\u2019s turbines would be removed within a year before accepting the company\u2019s position that they were temporary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been many months. Unless they are going to be shutting them down soon, they will have violated the law,\u201d he said. \u201cHow does the county know that they are going to be done within a year? Does the county care?\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear what steps Shelby County took in determining that the turbines didn\u2019t require permits or when that decision was made.\nTownsend maintained the Health Department \u201cwas involved from day one.\u201d Taylor, the Health Department director, declined an interview request but has publicly implied she was also left in the dark.\nAt the April permit hearing, Taylor said her office became aware of the turbines when the SELC asked for a copy of the air permit. She said she wanted to \u201cremind everybody in this room\u201d to \u201cengage the Shelby Health Department early regarding new projects so that we can look into what the environmental impacts will be.\u201d\n\u201cIf we do not know if something is coming, we cannot do that research,\u201d she said. \u201cShelby County Health Department cannot assist with projects it is not aware of at the inception.\u201d\n\u2018All very important to President Trump\u2019\nEPA\u2019s role is also unclear.\nThe Health Department had a brief consultation with EPA in early August on the matter, during which the Health Department says the federal regulator agreed with the decision not to require a permit for the turbines.\nBut last November, EPA Region 4 Air and Radiation Director Denisse Diaz wrote to Taylor saying that although the agency\u2019s understanding was \u201cthe turbines are expected to cease operations in the next few months,\u201d it would conduct a more formal review process to confirm. She also suggested the county set up air monitoring to confirm emissions from the turbines. That hasn\u2019t happened.\n\u201cThe EPA will need more specific information about the generator units operating at the xAI site,\u201d says the letter obtained by E&E News.\nThe letter was sent just days before the presidential election.\nEPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said the agency is reviewing a \u201crequest for assistance\u201d from Shelby County.\nSince taking office in January, the Trump administration has made efforts to boost the nation\u2019s burgeoning artificial intelligence industry. Vaseliou said her agency is \u201ceager to work with AI leaders as it begins work to streamline permitting and regulations that will help accelerate American data center development.\u201d\nShe added that EPA \u201clooks forward to working with AI leaders\u201d as it begins to roll back some 31 pollution-limiting regulations announced in March. EPA has also billed its move to relax pollution rules limiting how long reciprocating internal combustion engines can run without a permit as one to help boost AI. The engines are commonly used to power pumps and compressors in power and manufacturing plants, often during emergency events. New EPA guidance would allow some of those engines to operate for up to 50 hours per year outside of emergencies in a move it is billing as \u201cthe first and certainly not the last step\u201d to ensuring data centers and utilities have reliable power.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin himself vowed to support AI while \u201cunleashing American energy dominance\u201d in an appearance on Fox News shortly after the massive rollback was announced.\n\u201cThese are all very important to President Trump, so they are important to me,\u201d he said.\nXAI\u2019s Mayo reposted a clip of the interview on X, adding, \u201cPreach.\u201d\nPowering the recent surge of data centers has become a struggle for utilities nationwide due to supercomputers\u2019 massive energy requirements and related strain on the electric grid.\nMost utilities typically offer electricity to commercial users at discount rates in recognition of their high demand and the economic impact industrial users can have on a community. But data centers have a voracious appetite for power and create comparatively few jobs, leading some utilities to consider higher rates for \u201chyper users.\u201d\nThat includes the TVA board, which was planning to consider new rates for data centers, including xAI, at its May board meeting. But the board can no longer approve resolutions after President Donald Trump fired two of its members. Consideration of the data center measure has been postponed, TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe proliferation of data centers has also contributed to a gas turbine shortage, as utilities look to build up power generation to serve the supercomputers and as other companies, like xAI, turn to producing their own electricity.\nXAI\u2019s demand for power has only grown since it came to Memphis last June. After months of tests, Colossus came fully online in September. That same day, Musk posted on X that it would double the number of computer chips onsite to 200,000 \u201cin a few months.\u201d\nHe has said Colossus will require 2,000 MW to power its expansion. So far, TVA has only approved xAI\u2019s initial request for 150 MW. The 15 turbines it wants permitted produce only 420 more. In October, xAI asked Memphis Light, Gas and Water to study the possibility of supplying an additional 260 MW through a new substation on another swath of land xAI recently leased in South Memphis, but the substation can\u2019t be built until TVA approves sending electricity to it, which could take months.\n\u201cIt will be the most powerful training cluster in the world,\u201d Musk said of the expansion in February while announcing the latest iteration of Grok. \u201cWe are not stopping here.\u201d\n\u2018Our lungs \u2026 on the auction block\u2019\nFor residents of Boxtown and South Memphis, xAI\u2019s arrival was a setback after a series of recent environmental victories.\nTwo years ago, local opposition stopped a planned 50-mile oil pipeline planned to run from a South Memphis Valero refinery through and around neighborhoods like Boxtown. It was meant as a key final piece of a 1,000-mile plan to bring North Dakota crude to the Gulf Coast for export, but it was stopped after the City Council passed a law to restrict development.\nThen, in April, a medical sterilization plant that had been emitting carcinogenic ethylene oxide closed after decades of residents blaming it for high cancer rates in the area.\nThe Memphis Chamber of Commerce\u2019s support of xAI and the turbines\u2019 lack of permits felt like a betrayal to many in the community.\n\u201cThey put our lungs and our air on the auction block and sold us to the richest man in the world,\u201d state Rep. Justin Pearson, a Democrat and KeShaun Pearson\u2019s brother, said at a protest in late April.\nAt the permit hearing, Taylor said city zoning laws and historical racism were really to blame for the sheer number of polluters in South Memphis. She showed a slide with a zoning map next to a redlining map that real estate lenders used in the 1930s to restrict investment in majority-Black neighborhoods.\n\u201cRight now, we are still using a 1953 zoning map to make zoning decisions, and it looks very much like the 1930s redlining map,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are several levels of government responsible for what those maps look like.\u201d\nMore industry could be coming soon.\nSince landing xAI, the Memphis chamber has rebranded the city as a \u201cDigital Delta,\u201d and chip manufacturer Nvidia, as well as Dell and Super Micro, has expressed interest in coming to Bluff City, according to the chamber and xAI.\n\u201cWe have established the efficiency, the partnership, really the culture of \u2018yes\u2019 that we are able to get to what you need and really provide for our community,\u201d Townsend said.\nCompanies don\u2019t need residents\u2019 permission to locate industry in South Memphis, he said, \u201cas long as they are going through the correct process of permitting.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t always require a community to say, \u2018Well, we are OK with that or we are not,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a capitalistic thing. Companies come in and they operate.\u201d\nDriving past xAI in April, a loud, high-pitched buzzing filled the air, coming from the dozens of turbines that line the side of the building, which is as large as 13 football fields. The air above the semitrailer-sized turbines seemed to shimmer as heat escaped, along with the products of burning methane gas.\nJust a few minutes away, the sidewalk-free streets of Boxtown had an almost-rural feel. Peppered with modest homes and surrounded by leafy trees, Boxtown is a sleepy neighborhood \u2014 until chemical and sewage smells waft over from the industrial park.\nSitting in a neighbor\u2019s garden, a few residents debated what to make of the world\u2019s richest man, his turbines and their community.\nThat the latest pollution in this neighborhood was coming from a company owned by Musk added insult to injury for Sarah Gadney.\n\u201cIf he\u2019s the richest man in the world, buy this whole community up, make us millionaires, pave those streets with gold,\u201d she joked.\nBut Easter May Knox shook her head. The 74-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lowered the KN95 mask she wore to protect herself from the pollution.\n\u201cHe may be a millionaire, a billionaire \u2014 whatever kind of \u2018aire he is,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we need here is clean air.\u201d",

        "Content": "GOP may be closer than ever to enacting a massive rule-busting bill\n\u201cFor those who say it would make a radical change ... I\u2019d say, \u2018Thank heaven above for that,\u2019\u201d says Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee.\nConservative Republicans have spent more than a decade working toward a wholesale rollback of federal regulations \u2014 and now they think they have the legislative battle plan to make it happen.\nAdvocates of the rule-shredding proposal are seeking to give their legislation a coveted spot in the GOP\u2019s party-line energy, tax and border security megabill, a maneuver that would defuse the filibuster threat that has repeatedly thwarted their dreams. They say they have spent the better part of the past year crafting ways to ensure their latest iteration can pass muster in the Senate.\nThe proposal would turn Congress into a gatekeeper for certain major rules and allow lawmakers to roll back countless regulations for the remainder of President Donald Trump\u2019s term, drastically transforming the way the federal government oversees everything from businesses and banks to health care and energy development. The House Judiciary Committee advanced it last week as part of the Republicans\u2019 broader budget reconciliation package \u2014 a potentially major step toward finally catapulting the deregulatory proposal to Trump\u2019s desk.\n\u201cFor those who say it would make a radical change, a radical departure from the status quo of rulemaking, I\u2019d say, \u2018Thank heaven above for that,\u2019\u201d said Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah).\nThe language moving forward is based on the \u201cREINS Act\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cRegulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny\u201d \u2014 which has become a rallying cry for the Republican base.\nBut even though it\u2019s popular with conservatives, the provision\u2019s biggest challenges are yet to come. Moderates could balk at the proposal. It could also run afoul of strict Senate rules governing the reconciliation process, which allows the majority party to bypass the filibuster on fiscal-related matters.\nWhen asked by POLITICO\u2019s E&E News on Wednesday whether he expects the REINS Act to be in the final budget package, House Speaker Mike Johnson said simply, \u201cI sure hope so!\u201d\nModerate Republicans with the power to sink the bill \u2014 such as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine \u2014 declined to weigh in on whether they would back it. And Democrats didn\u2019t put up much of a fight during the House Judiciary deliberations.\nThe proposal would require any \u201cmajor rule that increases revenue\u201d to be approved via a joint resolution of the House and Senate before taking effect. It would also allow lawmakers to retroactively terminate countless rules that federal agencies have already implemented by requiring them to submit them to Congress for review. Rules that Congress does not approve would automatically sunset.\nThe legislation would also allow Congress to repeal numerous recently finalized regulations through the use of a single resolution rather than repealing them one by one, as is current practice.\n\u201cIt would be a war on regulations,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the minority whip. \u201cTo take that authority away from the executive branch would be a serious mistake.\u201d\nDemocrats and progressive advocates argue that the REINS Act could empower congressional majorities to reject regulations they oppose, allowing partisan divisions to effectively sideline rules crafted by dedicated experts across federal agencies.\nSupporters say lawmakers need to be able to sign off on certain agency regulations in order to check the executive branch\u2019s broad powers and ensure increased congressional oversight over rules that have significant impacts on individuals and industry.\n\u2018Countless meetings\u2019\nThe House has passed the REINS Act a number of times in recent years, but the threat of the Senate filibuster has tanked the legislation each time. That\u2019s why backers think the reconciliation package is their best shot for the foreseeable future.\nLee, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) and other conservatives have met numerous times over the better part of the past year, holding \u201ccountless meetings, running hypothetical scenarios\u201d to make the provision palatable to the Senate parliamentarian, Cammack said.\n\u201cThe trick with this is to get it through the Byrd bath,\u201d Cammack said, referring to lawmakers\u2019 shorthand for the reconciliation rules developed by the late Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd.\n\u201cThe House is its own animal,\u201d Cammack said. \u201cThe Senate is subject to [other] tests \u2026 and so it really was just about rearranging the language to make it so that it could survive the Byrd tests.\u201d\nPaul, who introduced the Senate version of the REINS Act earlier this year, said Republicans are prepared to defend the provision before the Senate parliamentarian, if needed.\n\u201cOur hope is to make that argument,\u201d he said.\nCammack and Lee, who voices support for the bill in the bio of his personal X account, declined to discuss the specifics of the defense strategy before having to deploy it. But they said they expect some version of the REINS Act \u2014 even if heavily modified \u2014 to make it into the final package.\nModerate Republicans like Murkowski and Collins, who bucked their party on reconciliation-related votes earlier this year, declined to say Wednesday whether they would support the inclusion of the proposed language in the final bill.\nMurkowski said she is \u201cfamiliar with\u201d the REINS Act but declined to answer questions about it. Collins said she did not want to speculate about provisions that may or may not be in the final product.\nOther Republicans have said they will back the provision, even if it remains unclear that it will stay in in the end.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it would survive Byrd, but I support the effort,\u201d said Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), who first introduced the legislation in the House over a decade ago. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) called the push to get it into the GOP megabill \u201ca splendid idea.\u201d\nBut Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, said during the markup that Republicans are \u201ctrying to handcuff the agencies that work to make sure that our food and drugs are safe and our air and water are clean.\u201d\nRaskin also blasted the provision that would allow Congress to repeal numerous regulations through the use of a single resolution, asserting that such action would be used to \u201chide the most destructive deregulatory votes among dozens of others, completely burying it in darkness.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not what the American people are looking for,\u201d he said.\nTrump seen as on board\nREINS Act backers in Congress expect Trump to be on board.\nOn Wednesday, as the Senate was preparing to vote on Congressional Review Act resolutions to overturn Biden administration rulemakings on vehicle emissions, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said regulatory rollbacks would continue under his leadership.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made progress on reining in excessive regulation, and the American people can count on Republicans to continue our efforts,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe believe that regulatory power should be used judiciously,\u201d he added, \u201cand it\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to eliminating rules that impose unjustified burdens.\u201d\nTrump has not explicitly endorsed the REINS Act. But Cammack said the proposal has been \u201cbrought to him multiple times\u201d and suggested that the president\u2019s deregulatory zeal all but guarantees his support.\n\u201cPresident Trump is one of the most aggressive regulatory reform advocates out there \u2014 if not the most,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say I\u2019m pretty damn aggressive, but I\u2019ll take No. 2 after President Trump.\u201d",

        "Content": "FEMA cleared of punishing pro-Trump hurricane victims\nA recent investigation found \u201cno evidence\u201d that the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Joe Biden deliberately avoided helping homes in Florida that backed Donald Trump.\nFive months after Republicans accused the Biden administration of deliberately denying disaster aid to Donald Trump supporters in Florida, a federal investigation has cleared former administration officials of wrongdoing, a new document shows.\nThe investigation found \u201cno evidence\u201d the Federal Emergency Management Agency ordered employees to skip homes displaying support for Trump as they were going door-to-door in October to help victims of Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\nRepublicans in Congress and in Florida assailed FEMA after an agency employee directed a small FEMA disaster team to avoid pro-Trump houses in a central Florida community and said she was \u201csimply following orders.\u201d\nTrump noted the employee\u2019s accusation in a January executive order. It created a council to review FEMA and claimed \u201cthere are serious concerns of political bias in FEMA.\u201d\nFlorida\u2019s attorney general sued then-FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell in November, accusing her of acting \u201cto deny Trump supporters emergency relief\u201d and engaging \u201cin a series of discriminatory acts.\u201d\nRepublicans in Congress launched their own investigation into \u201cpotential discrimination against disaster victims.\u201d They cited a comment in a media interview by the FEMA employee that \u201cpoints to a possibly systemic bias within FEMA against individuals that support President-elect Donald J. Trump.\u201d\nBut a probe by FEMA\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility \u201cfound no evidence that this was a systemic problem, nor that it was directed by agency or field leadership.\u201d\nCompleted in March, the probe was disclosed in a settlement document the Justice Department filed Monday in Florida ending the federal lawsuit against Criswell. The case was settled with both parties agreeing not to pursue claims against each other and without any punitive damages the state attorney general had sought.\nThe lawsuit was brought by Ashley Moody, a Republican who was Florida\u2019s attorney general until Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed her to the U.S. Senate seat that former Sen. Marco Rubio left when he became secretary of State in January. Attorney General James Uthmeier, a Republican, took over the lawsuit.\nAlthough Uthmeier settled the case against Criswell, the attorney general is continuing to pursue claims against the former FEMA worker, Marn\u2019i Washington, for punitive damages.\nCriswell fired Washington shortly after learning she had directed her disaster team to skip houses displaying support for Trump in Lake Placid, Florida, a small community about halfway between Tampa and Miami. The former FEMA administrator strongly condemned Washington\u2019s actions and said they were isolated.\nFEMA acting Administrator Cameron Hamilton, a Trump appointee, said in a separate letter in March that he fired three additional FEMA employees as a result of the agency\u2019s \u201cexhaustive\u201d investigation into Washington\u2019s claims.\nHamilton said in a letter to Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) that FEMA employees were receiving \u201ccomprehensive additional training\u201d to reinforce that \u201cpolitical affiliation should never be a consideration in the rendering of assistance.\u201d\nIn February, the federal Office of Special Counsel filed a complaint against Washington after finding that she \u201crepeatedly told her subordinate crew members not to visit properties with Trump 2024 campaign signage.\u201d\nThe complaint accuses Washington of violating the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in political activity while on duty. It was filed with the Merit Systems Protection Board, which investigates allegations of partisan political action by federal employees.\nHouse Homeland Security Chair Mark Green (R-Tenn.), who launched the congressional investigation into FEMA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Their \u201cshort-term objective\u201d was to block the money while those probes play out, a senior Justice Department attorney wrote in one email.\nThe government\u2019s approach \u201cis believed to have significant legal vulnerabilities,\u201d veteran EPA career attorney Jim Payne wrote to 14 career staff and political appointees at the environmental agency, the Treasury Department and the Justice Department late on the night of March 9.\nThe emails, never before made public, offer a rare glimpse at the administration\u2019s internal qualms as EPA, DOJ and Treasury wage one of the most aggressive battles in President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to throttle his predecessor\u2019s clean energy and climate agenda.\nThe fight over the $20 billion stands out for one reason: The administration is seeking to pull back money that is already out the door \u2014 cash that President Joe Biden\u2019s agencies had awarded, and placed in accounts for the recipients at Citibank, before Trump took office. EPA lawyers have asserted in court that they can terminate the grants without needing to offer any specific evidence of wrongdoing by the eight nonprofits.\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule as soon as this week on whether the Trump administration can continue freezing the money, which had been meant to pay for solar power, energy efficiency upgrades and other clean-energy projects in lower-income communities. Washington-based U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has chastised EPA\u2019s handling of the case, saying the agency \u201cnever proffered ... adequate evidence\u201d to support its claims of wrongdoing.\nEven before then, the career EPA lawyer\u2019s email warning about \u201csignificant\u201d risk already offered agency leaders a red flag about their strategy, according to one legal expert who reviewed the emails for POLITICO.\n\u201cTo me, this is a signal that they think this is probably a loser,\u201d said Gary Jonesi, who retired in January after a 39-year career in enforcement at EPA under administrations of both parties.\nAn EPA attorney would not use that adjective \u201cvery lightly,\u201d said Avi Garbow, who served as the agency\u2019s general counsel in the Obama administration.\n\u201cIt is not unusual at all that for policy directives ... there is some assessment by the Office of General Counsel that it presents some legal vulnerability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is less normal, I think, to phrase it as having \u2018significant\u2019 legal vulnerabilities.\u201d\nOther legal experts who reviewed the emails for POLITICO called it striking that they show the administration trying to block the money before finding certain evidence of wrongdoing to back it up. In one of the March 9 emails, Matthew Galeotti, a career official who at the time was serving in the office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, shared DOJ\u2019s analysis of the situation after interagency discussions throughout the day.\n\u201cThe short-term objective is to prevent disbursement of the grant funds, so that ongoing criminal and civil investigations into the program can proceed without risk that the funds will permanently disappear,\u201d Galeotti wrote, outlining DOJ\u2019s position.\nThat\u2019s an unusual approach, veteran EPA official Stan Meiburg told POLITICO.\n\u201cWhat I take from [DOJ\u2019s] line is, they\u2019re still trying to find ways to claw back the money, and they want to give themselves as much time as possible to do fishing expeditions to find any evidence in criminal or civil investigations that might give them a plausible reason for arguing that there was fraud going on, and therefore they should do this,\u201d said Meiburg, who retired after 37 years at EPA only to return a few months later as acting deputy EPA administrator in the Obama administration. \u201cAnd right now they haven\u2019t got one.\u201d\nIn a statement Wednesday, EPA reiterated several allegations it has made publicly about the grants in recent months, including \u201cserious potential conflicts of interest,\u201d concerns about the ability of the grant recipients to handle the funds, statements by internal watchdogs of concern about oversight of the spending, and changes made by the Biden administration to the grant agreements that Zeldin says limited EPA\u2019s oversight, a claim with which the grant recipients disagree.\n\u201cIt\u2019s telling that you cling to the narrative of \u2018no evidence\u2019 even as EPA has directly outlined evidence regarding serious concerns about self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified grantees, and reduced agency oversight tied to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t vague suspicions \u2014 they\u2019re the foundation for ongoing DOJ and FBI and IG investigations, and the reason the fatally designed program was terminated.\u201d\nEPA added that the emails obtained by POLITICO show government attorneys seeking to stop the grant recipients from \u201cincreasing their efforts to access and offload these tax dollars to third parties\u201d after the Trump administration increased its scrutiny of the program. Such withdrawals \u201cwould be certain to cause irreparable harm to the U.S. taxpayer amounting into the billions of dollars,\u201d the agency added.\nPayne, who is serving as EPA\u2019s acting general counsel, also issued a statement characterizing the email exchange as a typical discussion.\n\u201cOn their face, the alleged emails you reference appear to involve privileged discussions and ordinary deliberations among government attorneys,\u201d Payne said. \u201cSuch an exchange of views is an important part of the government\u2019s work, and an unauthorized disclosure would be highly inappropriate and have potential legal consequences.\u201d\nThe Justice Department declined to comment for this story, while the White House referred questions to EPA and DOJ. The FBI referred questions to DOJ. EPA\u2019s inspector general declined to comment on the existence or status of any investigations.\n\u2018Investigations may fill that out\u2019\nThe emails circulated weeks after Zeldin launched his first public attacks on the $20 billion grant program Feb. 12, contending that the Biden-era EPA had \u201cparked\u201d the money at Citibank as part of a \u201cscheme\u201d to evade federal oversight. \u201cThe days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\u201d Zeldin said, vowing to bring the money back under direct EPA control.\nEPA and Treasury soon pressed Citibank to freeze the grant money, while DOJ and the FBI pushed forward with a criminal probe and EPA said its independent inspector general has launched a review of the program. The road to get there was choppy, however: In February, a top federal career prosecutor in Washington resigned after arguing that not enough evidence existed to justify opening a criminal investigation or freezing the Citibank accounts.\nUnder the terms of the grants, EPA can terminate the awards under three circumstances: if a recipient isn\u2019t spending the money how it\u2019s supposed to; if it misleads EPA about its eligibility to receive the grant; or if EPA has \u201ccredible evidence\u201d of criminal activity.\nOne of the grant recipients, Climate United Fund, sued EPA over the freeze on March 8, and other spurned groups were drafting their own lawsuits. By the evening of March 9, DOJ\u2019s Galeotti warned that the clock was ticking: At midnight, less than four hours later, Citibank would have \u201cno basis\u201d to continue blocking the accounts under the Trump administration\u2019s previous requests.\nDOJ\u2019s recommendation was that both Treasury and EPA should each write to Citibank that evening to direct that the accounts remain frozen \u2014 a step that DOJ\u2019s analysis acknowledged could lead to more litigation.\n\u201cAt some point, we will need to raise defenses, but the criminal and civil investigations may fill that out over the intervening period,\u201d Galeotti wrote.\nParticipants in the email exchange included a mixture of career employees and political employees, with other staffers copied as recipients. One person who chimed in was Emil Bove, a former Trump defense attorney who is now the principal associate deputy attorney general, and who had pressed for a criminal investigation of the climate grants. Copied on the emails was Blanche, another Trump defense attorney who had been sworn in as deputy attorney general just days before.\nThe emails show that the officials were concerned with stopping the climate grants, not with stopping any specific, evidence-based incidents of waste, fraud or abuse, government watchdog group executive Jillian Blanchard argued after reviewing the messages for POLITICO.\n\u201cIt just seems to me that this is end-justifies-the-means logic, that there\u2019s no evidence that\u2019s being cited,\u201d said Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government, a group that has criticized the grant terminations. \u201cIt\u2019s just, \u2018how do we protect ourselves in this moment, while we terminate grants without evidence?\u2019\u201d\nOnce the Trump administration officials decided on a specific course of action to order Citibank to keep the funds frozen, Payne \u2014 who has worked at EPA since 2016 and before that worked in environmental enforcement at DOJ \u2014 raised some concerns.\nHe warned that the grant recipients could file for monetary damages in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, a tribunal that has exclusive jurisdiction over monetary claims against the federal government. Payne asked DOJ to assess whether the government could prevail in that legal fight, \u201cto help ensure EPA senior leadership is well informed since there are potential multi-billion dollar damage claims.\u201d\nYaakov Roth, the acting assistant attorney general for civil matters, replied that DOJ couldn\u2019t make that assessment until it knew the outcome of the investigations.\n\u201cIt depends on what the investigations uncover in terms of criminal conduct or other improprieties. It also depends on whether EPA ultimately terminates the grants,\u201d he wrote to Payne. \u201cAll of that will bear on our defenses and rights.\u201d\nIf the courts found that EPA\u2019s withholding of the funds was unlawful, the agency could be on the hook for that money, \u201cand perhaps interest or related relief,\u201d Roth added.\nIn an interview, Blanchard said it was \u201cwild\u201d to see the Trump administration acknowledge \u2014 and apparently dismiss \u2014 the risk of being liable for damages when Zeldin routinely says he terminated the grants to protect taxpayer money.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t about the money,\u201d said Blanchard. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it, I believe, to be able to say they stopped this program, they stopped what the Biden administration wanted to do. That\u2019s the main goal, to be able to say they stopped this.\u201d\nGarbow, the former EPA general counsel, said he would have been wary of such extreme risk.\n\u201cI cannot envision a scenario, had I been the general counsel, where my office had determined there were significant, multibillion-dollar damage claims, and I had not received substantial reassurance from the Justice Department about the merits of our potential defenses \u2014 that certainly, in my experience, would have warranted a conversation directly with the administrator to ensure that he or she was comfortable proceeding this way,\u201d Garbow said.\nIt is unclear to what extent Zeldin was consulted on the matter on the evening the emails were sent. Just 44 minutes passed between Payne sharing the draft order to freeze the funds and Zeldin\u2019s chief of staff, Eric Amidon, sending it to Citibank.\nWaiting on the courts\nEPA\u2019s strategy to kill the climate grants has already fallen flat before one judge.\nLast week, Chutkan \u2014 a Barack Obama nominee who previously drew Trump\u2019s wrath while overseeing his now-dismissed election conspiracy criminal case \u2014 found that EPA\u2019s March 11 termination violated the law, the Constitution and the agency\u2019s own procedures.\nEPA\u2019s primary defense is that the grant terminations are effectively a breach of contract, which under the law would have to be heard in the Court of Federal Claims, not in Chutkan\u2019s courtroom. It would likely take a year or more for the climate groups to push their case in that venue, and in the meantime they would go without any of that funding, said Blanchard. The recipients have already warned that without access to the money, some will soon face layoffs and others could shut down.\nChutkan rejected EPA\u2019s interpretation of the law, writing that this is no simple contract dispute and \u201cthe government is not just another contracting party.\u201d\nAnd on the merits, the Justice Department has conceded that the government did not cut off the grants because any of the recipients\u2019 actions. \u201cEPA did not terminate for Plaintiffs\u2019 noncompliance,\u201d the agency wrote in a brief in late March.\nChutkan\u2019s order to reopen the taps has been temporarily stayed while EPA appeals to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. At least $625 million in requests from the recipients is already pending, mostly earmarked to pay for clean energy projects, housing and community lending.\nEven if EPA prevails in moving the dispute to the Court of Federal Claims, it could still find itself potentially liable for paying the $20 billion, Payne wrote in one email on March 9.\nIn the email, the EPA attorney shared a draft copy of a directive that Amidon would send directing Citibank to maintain the funding freeze. But that approach, Payne reiterated, \u201cis believed to have significant legal vulnerabilities including for potential future substantial monetary damage claims before the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d\nAdding the word \u201csignificant\u201d is a subtle but clear message to other lawyers, Jonesi \u2014 the former EPA enforcement official \u2014 told POLITICO after reading the emails.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got Trump\u2019s criminal defense lawyers, now senior people at the Justice Department, on this email chain, you choose your words carefully, and you don\u2019t want to lose credibility by overstating the case,\u201d he said. Jonesi is now the executive director of CREEDemocracy, a group he founded this year to promote clean energy development and scrutinize Trump\u2019s policies.\nAt 12:28 a.m. on Monday, March 10, Amidon sent the order to Citibank to continue freezing the funds, according to documents shared in court. He made only minor tweaks to Payne\u2019s draft language.\nBove, the principal associate deputy attorney general, expressed happiness with the outcome.\n\u201cGrateful to all involved for the coordination on this,\u201d he wrote at 1:41 a.m. \u201cThanks very much.\u201d\nThe agency had contemplated going further by terminating the grants, not just freezing them, but that step \u201cis not being effectuated at this time,\u201d Roth wrote the night of March 9. Amidon\u2019s order to Citibank said the agency was waiting to alter the program until it received responses to oversight questions it had sent to the recipients, which were due March 28.\nInstead, EPA told Climate United and the other recipients on March 11 that Zeldin has terminated their grants. The email exchange does not reveal any reasons for the abrupt change of strategy.\nMyron Ebell, a longtime critic of climate spending and regulation who led Trump\u2019s 2017 EPA transition team, said he supports the administration being \u201cambitious\u201d in canceling funding such as the $20 billion Biden program, and said he doesn\u2019t fear a court overturning the grant terminations.\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll be where we are now. I don\u2019t see that that\u2019s a loss,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to the status quo, and if the administration wants to end these various green grant programs, they will have to go to Congress and say \u2018Well, we tried to do it.\u2019\u201d",

        "Content": "Elon Musk bankrolled a $100M climate contest. Now critics say it\u2019s \u2018tainted.\u2019\nThe billionaire funded an XPrize for carbon removal. But he won\u2019t be at the ceremony announcing the winner Wednesday.\nTime magazine selected Elon Musk as its \u201cperson of the year\u201d in 2021 after the billionaire entrepreneur upended the car market, reinvigorated the space industry and funded a $100 million competition for climate technologies that would remove carbon dioxide from the air and sea.\nBut Musk won\u2019t attend Time\u2019s event in New York City on Wednesday to fete the winners of that groundbreaking contest. The $50 million grand prize will go to Mati Carbon, a Houston-based startup founded three years ago that works with crushed rocks and subsistence farmers to soak up climate pollution.\nIt\u2019s unclear why Musk \u2014 an environmental hero turned MAGA diehard \u2014 is skipping the capstone event for a climate contest bankrolled via his eponymous foundation. Neither he nor Time responded to requests for comment. The XPrize will be announced at the Time100 Summit, the magazine\u2019s annual event featuring 100 influential people.\nIn addition to running electric-vehicle-maker Tesla and the aerospace firm SpaceX, Musk is leading President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to downsize the federal government. The Department of Government Efficiency has slashed climate funding for research, projects and agencies.\n\u201cWe live in very complicated times,\u201d said Nikki Batchelor, who led the Musk-funded carbon removal competition at the XPrize Foundation. Prior to joining the nonprofit, she worked as an innovation adviser for the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 the first federal bureau effectively shuttered by Musk. (Musk has no ties to the three-decade-old foundation aside from being a donor.)\n\u201cHe was one of the leading voices trying to push clean energy forward and think about innovative solutions to tackling climate change,\u201d she said of Musk, the world\u2019s richest person. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued on with that.\u201d\nBatchelor spoke with POLITICO\u2019s E&E News before XPrize publicly announced the final carbon removal contest winners, each of which removed at least 1,000 tons of CO2 in a year and provided a business plan for how they\u2019ll reach 1 million tons annually. Since 2019, carbon removal companies have locked away about 650,000 tons in total \u2014 less than the annual emissions of two natural gas power plants.\nThe runners-up were NetZero, Vaulted Deep and Undo Carbon, which netted prizes of $15 million, $8 million and $5 million respectively. Undo Carbon uses an enhanced rock weathering approach similar to Mati to remove CO2 from the air faster than the natural carbon cycle. NetZero and Vaulted Deep both lock away CO2 by preventing carbon-rich organic matter from biodegrading.\nCommercializing carbon removal technologies is important because the world is unlikely to reduce the burning of oil, gas and coal quickly enough to prevent the buildup of dangerous levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and oceans. As a result, climate scientists have concluded that it will be necessary in the coming decades to increase the Earth\u2019s carbon removal capacity by billions of metric tons annually.\nDuring the course of the four-year XPrize competition, then-President Joe Biden signed legislation and oversaw the establishment of programs that sought to reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels and spur carbon removal innovation. Now the Trump administration \u2014 with help from Musk and a Republican-controlled Congress \u2014 is moving to undo many of those federal climate initiatives, which Trump has derided as a \u201cgreen new scam.\u201d\nAs a result, critics say Musk has gone from one of the carbon removal industry\u2019s earliest supporters to perhaps its biggest threat.\n\u201cMusk sold himself out, and I think that\u2019s reprehensible,\u201d said Wil Burns, the co-director of the Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal at American University, who helped set up guidelines for the XPrize contest.\nMusk\u2019s $100M tweet\nMusk announced the contest four years ago with a cryptic tweet that seemed to conflate technologies to remove carbon that\u2019s already been emitted with ones that capture CO2 from smokestacks.\n\u201cAm donating $100M towards a prize for best carbon capture technology,\u201d he wrote in January 2021. \u201cDetails next week.\u201d\nOn Earth Day that year, XPrize founder Peter Diamandis joined Musk near Cape Canaveral, Florida, for a livestreamed conversation about the carbon removal contest. Musk, who wore a black T-shirt and no shoes, downplayed the risks of climate change and said he was more concerned about \u201csuper-advanced\u201d artificial intelligence and \u201cpopulation collapse.\u201d\nAt that point, carbon removal technologies were widely viewed as theoretically possible rather than scientifically sound.\nThe consensus began to shift later in 2021 when the Swiss firm Climeworks opened the world\u2019s first commercial-scale carbon removal facility outside of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland. In the U.S., lawmakers passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that included $3.5 billion to establish four hubs capable of removing 1 million tons of CO2 per year using the direct air capture technology Climeworks had pioneered.\nThe following year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that deploying tech to filter CO2 from the air and oceans would be necessary to avoid catastrophic global warming.\nThe economic case for carbon removal got a boost in 2022 when a coalition of tech companies committed to purchasing $925 million for carbon removal by the end of the decade and U.S. lawmakers expanded subsidies for direct air capture.\nCrushed rock and small farms\nMusk helped set in motion a wave of support from big business and U.S. policymakers that led to a surge in carbon removal startups. Of the 1,300 teams that took part in the Musk-funded carbon removal competition, XPrize estimates that half were formed after the contest began.\nThat includes Mati, the grand prize winner, which is a public benefit corporation owned by a nonprofit. The unusual legal structure allows the company to prioritize its mission to deploy carbon removal while benefiting subsistence farmers in the Global South, according to CEO Shantanu Agarwal. He is a former oil field services engineer and venture capitalist who previously founded the direct air capture firm Sustaera.\n\u201cI saw the potential of enhanced rock weathering as a much more scalable pathway right now, in the current world, and the significant co-benefits, which it brings to the smallholder farmers,\u201d Agarwal said.\nMati works with farmers in India, Zambia and Tanzania to spread locally sourced minerals on their fields. The crushed rocks soak up carbon and reduce runoff for the rain-dependent farms. The company also sells carbon removal credits and shares the revenue with the farmers, who are vulnerable to drought, extreme weather and other climate perils.\n\u201cWe have to create business models which add value to human life [and] at the same time solve for climate,\u201d Agarwal said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do climate in isolation. It just doesn\u2019t work. It cannot be done because humans are not wired that way, to go and clean a common good.\u201d\nMati\u2019s $50 million prize is five times more than the company had previously raised, Agarwal said. The infusion of cash should allow it to expand to several new countries faster than it had planned and reduce the cost of its removals to $100 per ton, down from nearly $400 today.\nThe Musk effect\nBut the potential good Mati can do for farmers and the climate pales in comparison to the work previously done by the federal government via agencies like USAID, which spent a combined $11 billion on humanitarian and agricultural assistance in fiscal 2024.\nMusk in February called USAID \u201ca criminal organization\u201d and said it was time for the agency \u201cto die.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s 2026 budget request is expected to complete the dismantling of the six-decade-old agency and roll its remaining programs into the State Department.\nMati and other carbon removal companies have also benefited from collaborations with researchers in academia and the federal government. The Trump administration has canceled thousands of university research grants and purged the U.S. bureaucracy of much of its carbon removal know-how.\n\u201cThe funding cuts that Musk is effectuating, and lopping off expertise in government that\u2019s really critical to drive this development, certainly outweighs whatever benefits we get from the XPrize,\u201d said Burns, the carbon removal expert who is also an environmental policy professor at Northwestern University. Those efforts have \u201ctainted it, to be associated with him.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Burns added, acknowledging the significance of the capital and publicity the competition has provided for the winners. \u201cA lot of people are going to hear Musk and just walk away.\u201d\nXPrize, which previously collaborated with the divisive billionaire on a global education contest, seems ready to move past Musk.\nBatchelor, the group\u2019s executive director of carbon removal, said \u201cthere are no conversations\u201d at this time with the Musk Foundation about supporting future competitions.\nXPrize hopes the announcement of the winners can be \u201ca bright spot for folks in climate and the carbon removal industry, especially, to rally around how much progress we\u2019ve made in four years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can also be a jumping off point for others to build momentum around scaling, despite some of those distractions in the background.\u201d",

Jared Polis said in an interview following the announcement of $7 million in state wildfire mitigation grants. \u201cSo it\u2019s really important that states up the bar on preparation.\u201d\nTrump has cut 10 percent of workers at the Forest Service, an agency that manages 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands, with more firings and a steep reorganization likely coming. About 75 percent of agency staff are trained in wildland firefighting. That means there are fewer workers around the country clearing brush and thinning trees to reduce the risk and intensity of wildfires. And when fires do break out, there will be fewer workers available to stop the spread.\nThe cuts have prompted alarm bells in state capitals as attention on wildfires and forestry policy has arguably never been higher in the wake of devastating fires that ripped through Los Angeles earlier this year. Record drought, heat waves and sluggish prevention work have exacerbated fires in recent decades: An average of 3 million acres burned nationwide each year in the 1990s, but the average is now nearly 7 million, according to data from the National Interagency Fire Center.\nNow, with that critical prevention work at risk of slowing, states and cities are weighing drastic actions to safeguard against the threat of potentially more fire-prone national lands \u2014 since fire doesn\u2019t respect federal, state and private land boundaries.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be headed into what could be a big fire season in the state of Nevada,\u201d Nevada state forester and firewarden Kacey KC told POLITICO, adding that she can exercise emergency hiring authority if needed. The federal government owns 86 percent of Nevada\u2019s land. \u201cI\u2019m nervous about our ability to maintain those public lands with the people who work on the ground, doing the important, critical work that actually helps lessen the risk of catastrophic loss from fire.\u201d\nThe shrinking of the Forest Service is hitting the agency both on the ground and at the leadership level, with Biden-era Chief Randy Moore retiring in the wake of the mass layoffs and more than half of regional heads also departing. POLITICO first reported that Trump is weighing an executive order to create a new agency for wildfire response and overhaul fire funding, and is separately considering a broader reorganization of the Forest Service.\n\u201c[The chaos] caused us to spend time and attention focused on trying to figure out how to get our grants, instead of doing the work of them,\u201d said Washington Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove.\nThe pullbacks represent a major change from the Biden administration, which poured more than $3 billion into wildfire prevention. They are also notable given that Trump has repeatedly faulted Western officials for not doing enough on forest management dating back to his first term, only to now take away funding and staff for such work. That could also jeopardize his ambitious goals to boost domestic logging.\nIn addition, the cuts threaten to poison a bipartisan bill that\u2019s already cleared the House and is under consideration in the Senate that would fast-track forest management projects, said Sens. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.).\n\u201cThe threat of these changes is significant,\u201d Vicki Christiansen, who served as Forest Service chief during Trump\u2019s first term, previously told POLITICO. \u201c$40 million in savings now just to have an additional $4 billion in wildfire expenses is crazy.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the United States Department of Agriculture, the parent agency of the Forest Service, said in a statement that it is \u201cincredibly proud of our firefighters and we will ensure they have the training, tools, and resources they need to work alongside our state and local partners, as well as private landowners, to continue the work to protect lives and livelihoods.\u201d\nEven before Trump\u2019s changes, many Western states were taking steps to increase their own funding for forest management \u2014 efforts that now have a greater sense of urgency. Utah\u2019s governor signed legislation in March that creates a $150 million wildfire fund, along with another bill to join an inter-state wildfire fighting compact with other Great Plains states.\nIn Oregon, a task force convened last year issued three proposals now under consideration in the Legislature to add nearly $200 million to the state\u2019s fund for wildfire preparedness. New Mexico\u2019s state forestry division last year launched two new \u201chot shot\u201d fire crews, which are specialized wildland firefighters. And California \u2014 which has nearly doubled its firefighting workforce and budget since 2019 \u2014 may allocate more of a $10 billion climate bond passed by voters last November to wildfire preparedness and recovery.\nPolis said that over the last few years, Colorado has purchased its own aircraft for aerial firefighting instead of relying solely on a shared fleet with other states. And the state has created the Forest Restoration and Wildfire Risk Mitigation grant program, which awarded $7 million to 37 projects earlier this month \u2014 though it could only approve less than a third of the applications it received for the most recent round of funding.\nHe argued that it\u2019s the most vulnerable regions of Colorado that are likely to face the brunt of the federal cuts. Some counties consist of 80 or 90 percent public land, leaving them without the tax base necessary to care for that much land.\n\u201cThose (lands) are not producing any tax revenue for the state or county government or the fire district, and yet they are very much part of where the largest fire risks are,\u201d Polis said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the federal government needs to be involved and at the table.\u201d\nIn Spokane, Wash. voters approved a new sales tax in November that would boost fire readiness, including fire station improvements, infrastructure and potentially new stations designed to handle fires at the wildland-urban interface. Democratic Mayor Lisa Brown said she had Trump in mind when the proposal went to the ballot.\n\u201cWe were certainly aware of the potential for a different authorizing environment at the federal level,\u201d she said.\nEven in New Jersey \u2013 the country\u2019s most densely populated state \u2014 officials are getting squeamish. Bill Donnelly, the leader of that state\u2019s fire service, said his firefighters are called in by the federal government to help fight fires outside of New Jersey. He wonders if there may be more work now.\n\u201cI guess if there\u2019s not as many of them, we might find ourselves needing to possibly send more people, more equipment, or just spend longer durations out there if necessary to help,\u201d Donnelly said.\nOf course, that only happens when the state has firefighters to spare. Right now, it\u2019s been dealing with frequent fires itself, including a major fire that broke out late last year along the border with New York that prompted evacuations and killed one New York state park employee.\nWestern-state congressional Republicans are navigating the cuts, too, facing warning signs from officials back home.\n\u201cFederal government needs to step up,\u201d said Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah, where the federal government owns two-thirds of the land. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to take responsibility for it, give it to us. We\u2019ll be responsible. But as long as the federal government has two-thirds, they\u2019ve gotta take the responsibility for that.\u201d\nRep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), who served as Interior secretary during the first Trump term, said he\u2019s been advocating to the White House on behalf of federal grantees in his home state. Multiple recipients of Community Wildfire Defense grants, a program funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law, confirmed to POLITICO that their grants had been frozen shortly after Trump took office but the funding has since been released.\nZinke said he spoke with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and the Department of Agriculture about frozen grants and seasonal firefighters. \u201cI\u2019m helping the ones in my district,\u201d he said.\nMore than two months after the first federal cuts were announced, fire prevention is still a patchwork of funding and resources \u2014 creating chaos and uncertainty as the west speeds toward fire season.\n\u201cThe conversation in recent years has been, \u2018Are we paying them enough?\u2019\u201d said Bend, Ore., Mayor Melanie Kebler. \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s, \u2018Are we even going to have the bodies? Are we going to have the people to respond?\u2019 That\u2019s a huge threat. I\u2019m extremely concerned. Fire is on everyone\u2019s mind.\u201d\nRy Rivard contributed to this report.",

        "Content": "World Bank climate message shifts amid Trump era uncertainty\nThe bank\u2019s messaging on climate represents a delicate balancing act between the institution and the U.S., its largest shareholder.\nThe World Bank has softened its once-vocal cheerleading for climate action as the Trump administration evaluates its support for international organizations and works to cut funding for climate programs.\nAs head of the largest public development financier, World Bank President Ajay Banga has been emphasizing jobs and Republican-friendly energy sources like nuclear power and natural gas. He\u2019s also defended its climate work when asked, saying recently that the bank\u2019s climate investments don\u2019t interfere with its core mission of poverty reduction. But that messaging signals a break with Banga\u2019s robust public defense of the bank\u2019s climate record under President Joe Biden, who nominated Banga in part to bolster green lending.\nFormer officials and at least five people familiar with the thinking inside the institution, some of whom were granted anonymity to speak candidly, said the bank is downplaying its messaging of climate work out of self-preservation even as its underlying climate policy has not changed.\n\u201cNow, do you want to scream this all loudly? Probably not in this environment. You don\u2019t get much from doing that,\u201d said Samir Suleymanov, a former World Bank official who directed its strategic initiatives unit.\nThe bank\u2019s messaging on climate represents a delicate balancing act between the institution and the U.S., its largest shareholder. The U.S. has provided significant support for the arm of the bank that serves the world\u2019s poorest nations, with the Biden administration pledging $4 billion before leaving office. That funding is still subject to approval in a Republican-controlled Congress, and withholding it would crimp investments to poorer nations struggling with multiple crises ranging from climate change to inflation to food insecurity.\nBanga says he hasn\u2019t changed anything and is still using the words \u201cclimate finance\u201d to refer to the bank\u2019s commitment to put 45 percent of its annual lending toward climate-related projects in fiscal year 2025.\n\u201cRemember, we have a board which has representatives of all our shareholders and all these words and thinking go through their system,\u201d Banga said on a call with reporters ahead of the bank\u2019s annual spring meetings that start Monday in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThis is a fair debate to have at the board, and then we\u2019ll figure out what may change or not change.\u201d\nBut in recent weeks, he has also talked about an \u201call of the above\u201d energy strategy he wants to take to the board in June and has emphasized a two-year effort to restart investments in nuclear energy, in part, he says, to help power data centers.\n\u201cThere is no reason why a country in Africa should not care about affordable, accessible electricity,\u201d Banga told reporters Wednesday. \u201cAnd it includes gas, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, wind and nuclear where it makes sense.\u201d\nBanga has previously talked about natural gas, often as an example of the divide between developed countries that have grown wealthy on fossil fuels and oil- and gas-rich poorer nations now being told not to exploit those resources.\n\u201cThe rules of energy access are not applied equally,\u201d he has said. He\u2019s also talked about gas as a transition fuel and said in 2023 that \u201call we\u2019re trying to do is reduce investment in fossil fuels.\u201d\nThe bank\u2019s climate work is occurring as several of the Trump administration\u2019s allies want the U.S. to exit the World Bank entirely, arguing that its mission runs counter to American national interest and does China\u2019s bidding. A Trump administration review of U.S. participation in international organizations like the World Bank is due in August.\nIt\u2019s a high-stakes game for the World Bank, which must balance previous commitments to put nearly half of its financing toward climate initiatives while avoiding stoking Trump\u2019s anger. The bank\u2019s green initiatives include measures to help countries adapt to rising temperatures by strengthening infrastructure or supporting drought-resistant agriculture, and aid for the transition to cleaner energy and transportation.\nA spokesperson for the World Bank Group said the bank\u2019s agenda has long been clear and consistent.\n\u201cFor two years, we\u2019ve been working to make the Bank faster, more efficient, and focused on creating jobs,\u201d the spokesperson said, noting that jobs are intertwined with clean air and water, reliable power and support for the private sector.\n\u201cThe realities of the countries we serve\u2014and the diversity of the challenges they face\u2014mean we match solutions to context and rely on every tool at our disposal to deliver,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cClimate finance\u2014like shifting freight to rail or building drip irrigation\u2014is part of that mix, but no more and no less important than the rest. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\nBanga, during last week\u2019s press conference and in recent speeches, has stressed that projects under the bank\u2019s climate financing have broader benefits to a country\u2019s economy, leading to job creation and stemming migration.\nBanga\u2019s climate boosterism only deepened Trumpworld\u2019s animosity toward the bank, said Stephen Moore, the conservative economist who co-authored the Project 2025 chapter imploring a U.S. exit from the World Bank. He said the bank\u2019s climate agenda diverted it from its development mission, claiming it became harder to finance fossil fuel projects even for people who lack electricity access.\n\u201cIt was so outrageous that this is what they were doing. It was almost like they wanted to keep countries poor,\u201d Moore said in an interview.\nThe chances of a U.S. withdrawal from the bank are unlikely, in part because doing so would mean giving up its shares to countries willing and able to buy them, namely China.\nBut the bank\u2019s work on climate and its international focus broadly aren\u2019t likely to be overlooked entirely by an administration that has put American energy dominance at the center of its agenda.\nThat\u2019s different from Trump\u2019s first term, said Karen Mathiasen, a former acting U.S. representative to the World Bank from 2017-2018 who is now project director at the Center for Global Development.\n\u201cThere was a much more open attitude towards working with these institutions and kind of focusing on traditional Republican issues like fiscal responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cNow everything feels very hostile and adversarial.\u201d\nBanga has made a case for the bank\u2019s utility, highlighting its efficient use of capital, work to engage the private sector and his moves to refocus toward its core mandate, poverty reduction.\n\u201cOur ultimate goal is to help countries build dynamic private sectors that convert growth into local jobs \u2013 not by shifting work from developed countries, but by unlocking opportunity where people already live,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece in the Financial Times published April 1.\nThe opinion piece was focused on jobs and made no mention of climate change, a marked contrast with Banga\u2019s earlier op-eds and speeches that mentioned \u201cintertwined challenges\u201d of poverty, climate and other issues. In an address at the World Bank and IMF\u2019s annual meetings in October 2023, Banga said the world \u201ccannot endure another period of emissions heavy growth\u201d and filled it with examples of why the bank needed a new playbook to tackle global challenges, of which climate change was central.\n\u201cIn addition to the efforts already underway to bring more efficiency and focus on core mandates, which may partly address Trump administration concerns, I think there is willingness to go further, especially when it comes to greater flexibility in how the institutions think about energy investments,\u201d said Matt Swinehart, a former Treasury official now a managing director at Rock Creek Global Advisors.\nThe IMF, the bank\u2019s sister organization, has also toned down talk of climate.\nKristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund and a former environmental economist, didn\u2019t mention climate once in her curtain raiser speech on Thursday, focusing instead on trade and global growth.\nAn IMF spokesperson said the speech \u201cunderstandably focused on the most pressing issue facing the global economy at this juncture \u2013 the impact of ongoing trade tensions, market volatility and uncertainty on the outlook, and how policymakers should respond in this context.\u201d The spokesperson noted that climate-related events are on the spring meetings schedule.\n\u201cI think the institutions right now are walking a tightrope between policing the biggest shareholder and having legitimacy with the rest of the members,\u201d said Kevin Gallagher, director of the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University.\nThe bank has rolled out changes to extend its lending capacity and introduced Climate-Resilient Debt Clauses, a way for countries to defer loan payments following disasters, as part of its Biden-era reform agenda. It also amended the bank\u2019s mission of ending poverty to include the words \u201con a liveable planet.\u201d Many of those moves have earned the backing of other shareholders. Banga has also acknowledged that his new energy strategy requires shareholder approval.\nSeveral countries have doubled down on their commitment to support climate through the multilateral banks. France last month said \u201ca massive scaling up of public finance is needed both to alleviate poverty and protect the planet,\u201d in its \u201cParis Pact for People and the Planet,\u201d which vowed to overcome divisions on multilateral development bank boards and the IMF.\nSome have welcomed the shift in messaging.\nThe language around and emphasis on clean energy felt restrictive, boxing out other projects that can reduce emissions, said Suleymanov. The rhetorical shift is merely additive for the bank\u2019s climate portfolio, he said, noting that it would not come at the expense of renewable projects the bank has spent years planning with other governments.\n\u201cIt may sound funny, but there is sort of a relief that this kind of pretend thing is over,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ideological underpinning took so much space. Everybody had the feeling they were caught in the game, like this is something that they have to do, but not necessarily with a clear practical outcome in mind.\u201d",

        "Content": "Nashville ICE raid reignites city\u2019s turmoil with GOP leaders\nThe feud comes with real potential consequences for Nashville and other blue cities in red states being targeted over their immigration policies.\nAn unsteady truce between Nashville\u2019s Democratic mayor and Tennessee\u2019s Republican leaders just collapsed after an ICE dragnet in the city.\nTension began to build in early May, when ICE started making traffic stops in partnership with the state highway patrol in the immigrant-heavy neighborhood of South Nashville, leading to the arrests of nearly 200 suspected undocumented immigrants.\nMayor Freddie O\u2019Connell quickly condemned the action as damaging to the community. And a GOP firestorm resulted, with Republicans accusing O\u2019Connell of interfering with federal immigration enforcement.\nFour weeks later, a simple public policy spat has turned into a major conflict between some of the most powerful leaders in Tennessee, breaking a fragile peace between the city and the GOP supermajority legislature \u2013 and exposing Nashville to the wrath of the Trump administration. The feud, which shows no signs of ending soon, comes with real potential consequences for Nashville and other blue cities in red states being targeted over their immigration policies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that he\u2019s willing to support the law breakers instead of supporting us as the lawmakers,\u201d state Rep. Rusty Grills, a Republican, said of the mayor.\nO\u2019Connell, who has worked to calm long-running tensions with Republicans since his election in 2023, is the latest target of GOP ire over perceived threats to President Donald Trump\u2019s deportations, and the onslaught against the mayor also represents a further escalation in the administration\u2019s attack on local officials. In New Jersey, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested in May on a trespassing charge outside an ICE facility. That charge was later dropped, but U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver is facing assault charges from the same confrontation.\nIn Tennessee, Republicans in the state legislature told POLITICO that O\u2019Connell was putting officers at risk by updating a longstanding executive order mandating that city officials disclose interactions with ICE to the mayor\u2019s office within 24 hours. They have latched onto that as evidence the mayor is impeding law enforcement operations.\nO\u2019Connell, speaking at a press conference following the raids, said the city does not have the authority to enforce immigration laws, and noted that Nashville\u2019s crime rates are down. He has maintained that the city did not interfere with the ICE operation in early May.\nYet GOP outrage has spread from Tennessee to Washington. O\u2019Connell is facing a federal investigation from House Republicans announced last week, and a call for another from the Department of Justice by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who all argue that O\u2019Connell is impeding law enforcement\u2019s ability to crack down on crime committed by illegal immigrants.\nU.S. border czar Tom Homan has warned that Nashville could see larger immigration crackdowns as a result of O\u2019Connell\u2019s opposition.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll flood the zone in the neighborhoods to find the bad guy,\u201d Homan said on Fox News last week. \u201cWe\u2019ll flood the zone at work sites to find the bad guy, but we\u2019re going to do it, and [O\u2019Connell\u2019s] not going to stop us.\u201d\nRepublicans have also gone after O\u2019Connell for highlighting a donations fund that supports individuals affected by the arrests, like children whose parents were detained. Republicans say the fund is an improper use of taxpayer dollars, although the fund was created by a nonprofit that says it exclusively uses private donations.\nTennessee Democrats and immigrant advocates say that Republicans are cheering ICE\u2019s involvement because of a bad-faith view of immigrant communities and that the criticism of O\u2019Connell is purely GOP rhetoric lacking any basis. They also say the sweep shows how the Department of Homeland Security is taking in people that pose no threat to the public. DHS said about half of the people arrested have criminal records, but only identified four of them \u2013 leading Democrats to demand more information about those detained.\n\u201cFor the politicians who care about nothing but the national news, this is a symbolic story,\u201d said Democratic State Sen. Jeff Yarbro. \u201cBut for those of us who represent communities where we\u2019ve seen lawless dragnet policing, there are real life consequences to our community and to our neighbors.\u201d\nThe raid\u2019s scale and scope was \u201cunlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Lisa Sherman Luna, the executive director of the Tennessee Immigrants & Refugee Rights Coalition.\nThe Tennessee Highway Patrol\u2019s cooperation with ICE underscores the role states will play in carrying out the Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda \u2013 especially as DHS struggles to hit its deportation goals. GOP leaders eager to impress the president have taken steps in recent months to deputize local law enforcement as immigration enforcers, like in Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp recently signed a law requiring law enforcement to check the immigration status of detainees.\n\u201cThey are building an infrastructure that we\u2019ve never seen, especially for a non-border state, to really carry out the President\u2019s agenda of mass deportations,\u201d Luna said of the ICE operation in Nashville. \u201cThe devastation for families and local communities is going to be deep and broad, because everyone is a target now, and so it\u2019s really alarming to see our state government being used in this manner.\u201d\nTennessee Republicans have framed the conflict as a matter of law and order \u2013 arguing that the ICE raids were a necessary use of force to crack down on crime they blame on illegal immigrants. Under the leadership of Gov. Bill Lee, Tennessee has emerged as one of the most aggressive non-border states on immigration in the second Trump era.\nLee, to the surprise of many Tennesseans, was the first Republican governor to say in January before Trump\u2019s inauguration he was readying the National Guard should they be called upon to aid in deportations. In January, a few days after attending a governors meeting at Mar-A-Lago, Lee tacked onto immigration legislation as part of a special session on school vouchers. Lawmakers then passed a sweeping law expanding local law enforcement\u2019s immigration purview and making it a felony for state officials to establish sanctuary cities.\nNashville is not a sanctuary city. But Democrats there still view the law as a warning shot from the legislature, which has clashed with city leaders over a range of issues \u2014 from control of the airport to representation in Congress.\n\u201cWe wanted to send a signal that Tennessee was ready to cooperate and welcomed ICE coming into our communities to get these violent people out,\u201d said state Sen. Jack Johnson, a Republican. \u201cSo I\u2019m very, very happy with it and excited, and I hope they do more.\u201d\nAnd many want to see ICE return. State Sen. Brent Taylor has asked Homan to send ICE to Memphis to address \u201cthe violent crime epidemic\u201d that he says is \u201cexacerbated by poor local leadership.\u201d\nShelby County, where Memphis is located, was included on a list of sanctuary cities and counties published by DHS last week that was soon taken down. Leaders of Shelby County, Memphis and Nashville \u2014 which was also on the list \u2013 disputed their designation as sanctuary cities, which have been outlawed by the Tennessee legislature.\nState Sen. Jody Barrett described relations between Nashville and the GOP legislature as a \u201cforced marriage,\u201d complicated by the fact that Nashville serves as the state\u2019s economic engine. Nashville\u2019s population has exploded in recent years, and the city\u2019s tourism industry keeps the state coffers filled.\n\u201cAnd because of that, it\u2019s kind of a love-hate relationship,\u201d he said.",

        "Content": "\u2018It betrays our values': Progressives grapple with deadly shooting\nAfter shooting two Israeli embassy employees outside the Capital Jewish Museum, the suspect yelled \u201cfree, free Palestine.\u201d\nProgressives are grappling with the killing of two people who worked at the Israeli embassy in Washington by a gunman who echoed a slogan that has become a rallying cry for many American liberals since the start of the war in Gaza.\nAfter his arrest, the man suspected of killing the couple outside the Jewish Museum in Washington on Wednesday night exclaimed \u201cfree, free Palestine,\u201d a phrase that has become ubiquitous at peaceful demonstrations and on social media over the past 18 months.\nThe attack brought renewed focus to a strain of violent radicalism on the left, even as progressives pointed out they share nothing with the gunman except his apparent support for Palestinian rights. What the attack did, they said, was hurt their cause.\n\u201cIt betrays our values and hands more power to those already pushing authoritarian crackdowns,\u201d said Layla Elabed, an organizer in Michigan and the leader of the Uncommitted National Movement, which arose in protest of U.S. support for Israel\u2019s response to the Hamas attack launched on Oct. 7, 2023.\nIt\u2019s also putting pressure on progressives to respond.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s our Martin Luther King today? I don\u2019t know where that individual is. Who is that individual?\u201d said a progressive strategist granted anonymity to speak freely. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have big moral leaders in our society, period, let alone on the political front.\u201d\nA fringe, more radical wing of the pro-Palestinian movement has blinked in and out of national attention since the onset of the war in Gaza. Thousands of protesters have been arrested, including dozens who forcibly entered and occupied university buildings. And last year, POLITICO reported that an online network of pro-Palestinian activists in the U.S. included resources on how to \u201cescalate\u201d political actions beyond legal bounds, as well as pro-Hamas content.\nAsked if members of the left are doing any soul searching, Kevin Rachlin \u2014 the Washington director of the Nexus Project, a left-leaning Jewish advocacy group \u2014 said, \u201cI think they are.\u201d\n\u201cThis is more and more proof that we need to address antisemitism as a full society versus addressing [it] on the left or on the right,\u201d Rachlin said.\nAntisemitism historically and in recent years has more closely been associated with fringe groups on the alt-right, including most notably the 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia. President Donald Trump himself dined with white nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022.\nSupporters of the pro-Palestinian movement, including liberal lawmakers, found themselves on the defensive after the shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in a way that conservatives have had to respond to far-right violence in recent years.\nNow, some pro-Palestinian activists worry the shooting, which federal authorities called a targeted act of antisemitism, could set back any progress they\u2019ve made in their policy goals amid an increasingly dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and an expansion of Israel\u2019s military operation in the decimated territory.\n\u201cWe hope and caution against this vigilante violence being used to undermine the movement to end the genocide, a movement of hundreds of thousands of Americans calling for ceasefire and arms embargo,\u201d said Sandra Tamari, executive director of the pro-Palestinian Adalah Justice Project.\nAlex Pascal, a former Biden administration official who helped craft its strategy to combat antisemitism, said, \u201cWe cannot allow this violence to be weaponized by those who might exploit it to further degrade our democratic rights and freedoms.\u201d\nTrump and Republicans for years have cast the pro-Palestinian movement as a group of radical terrorist sympathizers. As the Trump administration has taken increasingly severe steps to suppress the movement and punish its leaders, Democrats and advocates have pushed back on that characterization, framing Republicans\u2019 actions as an attack on free speech.\nPro-Palestinian lawmakers rushed Thursday to condemn the murders and call them acts of antisemitism. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the \u201cheinous act.\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) emphasized, \u201cAbsolutely nothing justifies the murder of innocents.\u201d\nRepublicans were quick to paint the attacks as just part of broader extremism in the movement.\n\u201cThe Palestinian cause is an evil one,\u201d Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) said Thursday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cThe only end of the conflict is total surrender by those who support Muslim terror.\u201d\nAs details about the attack emerged late Wednesday night, the Trump administration jumped into offense. Attorney General Pam Bondi and D.C.\u2019s newly tapped interim U.S. attorney, Jeanine Pirro, visited the scene. And on Truth Social just after midnight, Trump wrote: \u201cThese horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.!\u201d\nThe left has had to walk this line before. Earlier this year, when federal immigration agents detained and moved to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian green card holder and leader in last year\u2019s pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, the Trump administration justified the arrest by claiming Khalil was a supporter of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization.\nDemocrats have largely united around detained pro-Palestinian activists as victims of the Trump administration whose constitutionally protected political speech is under attack \u2014 but also hedged their statements by emphasizing they didn\u2019t endorse Khalil\u2019s opinions on the subject.\n\u201cI abhor many of the opinions and policies that Mahmoud Khalil holds and supports,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said at the time on X. But, he added: \u201cIf the administration cannot prove he has violated any criminal law to justify taking this severe action and is doing it for the opinions he has expressed, then that is wrong.\u201d\nHolly Otterbein contributed to this report.",

I don\u2019t currently see a reason,\u201d he said.\nMusk, who poured over $290 million of his own money into the 2024 election to support Trump and Republicans, had established himself as a major political force, both domestically and abroad.\nAt home, he has sought to influence state elections, including a key Wisconsin Supreme Court race last month. His political operation spent significantly on the contest, which turned into a referendum on Musk\u2019s popularity as he became the face of the Republican campaign.\nBut his efforts failed as the Democratic-backed candidate easily secured victory, marking a turning point for Musk\u2019s political involvement.\nThe billionaire also came under fire for repeatedly attempting to influence various European elections at the end of last year, including throwing his weight behind Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party, a move that drew significant backlash in the country.\nThe Wisconsin blow also came amid heightened backlash against Musk\u2019s slash-and-burn approach to downsizing the federal government under DOGE, which has elicited anger from across the political spectrum.\nDissatisfaction with Musk has bubbled over among Americans, with the adviser receiving only 41 percent approval and 58 percent disapproval of his work with DOGE in polling released last month.\nWhile anti-Musk protesters took out their rage against his government cuts on Tesla cars and showrooms across the country, Republican lawmakers faced waves of angry backlash from constituents during town halls in their home states, prompting the chair of the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm to call for a halt to the open forums at the time.\nAs the brewing anti-Musk storm grew, Democrats seized on the billionaire\u2019s government influence project to rally their base \u2014 a strategy that proved successful in Wisconsin.\nThe once-ubiquitous adviser to the president has since played a less public-facing role in the Republican Party. He\u2019s been less visible in Oval Office appearances and Cabinet meetings with Trump, which had become a hallmark of the early days of his presidency.\nThe president and his top advisers have also gone silent on Musk on their social media platforms in recent weeks, a marked shift away from the stream of praise they once had for the billionaire.\nAs Musk has faded into the background, so too have his DOGE efforts. While the aggressive federal slashing project dominated airwaves at the outset of Trump\u2019s presidency, it has more recently taken a backseat to other controversial issues under the administration, including Trump\u2019s mass deportation policy and tariff scheme.\nMusk, too, has had some notable public breaks with the president. The Tesla CEO, who lost billions after Trump announced his sweeping tariff plan last month, came out swinging against White House trade adviser and key supporter of the president\u2019s tariff policy, Peter Navarro, blasting him as a \u201cmoron\u201d in an unusually public show of dissent.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt downplayed the quarrel at the time, saying \u201cboys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s decision to tone down his political involvement could throw a wrench in Democrats\u2019 plans to continue using the billionaire as a political target, as they appear poised to lose the figure they have portrayed as Washington\u2019s chief villain. But it could also leave a major hole in Republican campaigns\u2019 funds if he does actually slow down spending.\nTuesday\u2019s comments are not the first time Musk has made sweeping pronouncements about his intentions not to involve himself in politics.\nHe said in March 2024 that he wouldn\u2019t be \u201cdonating money to either candidate\u201d in the presidential election. By December 2024, Musk had endorsed Trump and thrown hundreds of million into the election, setting up his meteoric rise as the president\u2019s right hand man.\nAnd Washington hasn\u2019t seen the end of Musk quite yet. He said during his Tuesday speech that he plans to have dinner with Trump on Wednesday, signaling that he hasn\u2019t entirely lost the president\u2019s ear.",

        "Content": "Marjorie Taylor Greene won\u2019t run for Senate\nThe MAGA lightning rod expressed confidence in her ability to win, but said the Senate is broken.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican firebrand and ally of President Donald Trump, is passing on the Senate race in Georgia.\n\u201cI\u2019m not running,\u201d she said in a lengthy post on social media on Friday, citing her frustrations with the Senate as the main reason she didn\u2019t want to run. \u201cEven with a few good Republicans in the Senate, nothing changes.\u201d\nThe two-term Georgia representative\u2019s name had been floated as a potential Republican candidate after popular Republican Gov. Brian Kemp passed on a bid this week to take on incumbent Sen. Jon Ossoff. Greene\u2019s decision loomed large over the race, with many Democrats salivating over the possibility she\u2019d enter the contest in one of the swingiest of swing states in the nation.\nTrump carried Georgia by about 2 percentage points last year, after Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential nominee to win the state since former President Bill Clinton in 1992.\nIn passing on a run, Greene, a prolific fundraiser and darling of conservative media, nevertheless claimed she could have won.\n\u201cWhen I met with the NRSC a few weeks ago, they told me their internal polling shows any Republican can beat Ossoff,\u201d she said in her post. \u201cBut now they\u2019re pushing a public poll of just 800 people claiming only certain Republicans can win.\u201d\nThe outspoken MAGA star\u2019s lengthy statement left open the door for another statewide run. She did not rule out the possibility of running for governor to succeed Kemp, who is term-limited.\nShould she decide to embark on a gubernatorial bid, many questions that hovered over her potential Senate run would remain. Georgia, with its demographic shifts, has become a purple state in recent years, now with two Democratic senators in Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.\nWhile Republicans control the governor\u2019s mansion and both chambers of the state legislature \u2014 and while Trump won in 2024 \u2014 the state is not considered a MAGA stronghold.\nGeorgia Republicans bucked the president in recent elections, including during the 2022 cycle when Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Rafensperger roundly defeated Trump-backed primary challengers after both men rejected efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. They were able to cruise reelection victories in the general election.\nRaffensperger has not signaled if he plans to run again for statewide office, but is likely to be a formidable candidate should he decide to run to succeed Kemp or challenge Ossoff for his seat.",

        "Content": "The Biden administration managed to rack up a long list of major legislative wins in its first two years despite facing one of the most closely-divided Congresses in history.\nFrom bipartisan action on infrastructure, gun safety and same-sex marriage to party-line bills tackling climate change and expanding health care coverage, it\u2019s a record President Joe Biden and Democrats on the ballot were all eager to tout on the campaign trail during the midterms.\nBut far from the spotlight is a woman who helped make all that happen: Louisa Terrell.\nAs the director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, Terrell, 53, leads a team that is the president\u2019s collective eyes and ears in Congress.\n\u201cMaking sure we\u2019re responding, making sure we\u2019re being proactive, figuring out what\u2019s happening here in this building,\u201d Terrell told CNN, explaining her job while standing in front of the Capitol, where she spends a considerable amount of time even though she works for the White House.\nShe describes her role as a conductor for moving Biden\u2019s agenda through Congress.\n\u201cYou want to be talking to committees, caucuses. Who\u2019s talking to leadership? Who are the up-and-comers? What\u2019s the floor action? What\u2019s running quickly? What\u2019s slowing down? And you need all these sort of tentacles out there, and then bringing that back every day.\u201d\nBut unlike an actual conductor who is front and center of an orchestra, Terrell operates very much behind the scenes.\nIn fact, when we sat down for our conversation in the White House Executive Office Building, she said it was her first television interview \u2013 ever.\nTerrell\u2019s years of experience in Washington have been critical to her success. She first started on the Hill over 20 years ago as a staffer for then-Sen. Biden on the Judiciary Committee. Looking back, she describes herself at the time as being just a \u201cgal from Delaware,\u201d in awe of the experienced legal clerks and seasoned staffers surrounding her. She quickly found her footing and thrived, going on to serve as Biden\u2019s deputy chief of staff and later worked in the Obama administration\u2019s Office of Legal Affairs \u2013 the very team she now leads.\nEven with her expansive resume, however, Terrell readily admits that today\u2019s Washington is tougher to navigate than the one she first arrived in two decades ago.\n\u201cThe extremes have gotten extreme and I think that makes it harder,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to really work a lot harder to find where you can meet in the middle.\u201d\nBeing able to call on the personal relationships she\u2019s forged over the years on Capitol Hill proved critical to working across the aisle to find that middle ground, particularly given Democrats\u2019 razor-thin majorities.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be very clear on what the president\u2019s position is and why we want to see what we want to see done,\u201d she said of her conversations with Republican lawmakers. \u201cRepublicans know that when this White House \u2013 and whether it\u2019s us on our team or a senior official \u2013 gives the word, then we stand by our word. And I think that kind of credibility on the Hill has been very important to move things.\u201d\nDeep relationships matter too, she said.\n\u201cYou get fuel from the other people you work with. And I get an incredible amount of fuel from the senior team here at the White House and just people who have years and years of experience and relationships in those matters.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the kind of work that can make or break a president, and even though it\u2019s largely unheralded, that doesn\u2019t mean it goes unnoticed. Following her confirmation to the Supreme Court as its first Black justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson included Terrell in her shout-outs as one of the \u201cbrilliant folks\u201d who helped make the historic achievement possible.\nA lifelong Biden connection\nTerrell\u2019s longest relationship in the White House is with the president himself. Though their professional relationship started when she came to Washington two decades ago, she first met Biden when she was just 5 years old.\n\u201cI met Beau Biden in kindergarten,\u201d Terrell, who is from Wilmington, recalled with a smile. \u201cIt (was) a very quick bike ride from my house to where Beau grew up. So we were childhood friends (and) stayed friends for \u2026 all our adulthood.\u201d\nShe remembers visiting the Biden household as a kid, sharing with CNN a running joke from her childhood.\n\u201cWhen we would go to Beau\u2019s house, there was a fax machine in the living room and all you needed to know (was), do not screw up the fax machine,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cAnd again, this is Delaware and it was probably the first fax machine in Delaware, this is high tech equipment.\u201d\nTerrell\u2019s lifelong relationship with the Biden family means she brings a unique perspective to her work in the White House.\n\u201cHe knows my folks and just being connected that way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know where the person came from and I think that helps.\u201d\n\u201cIt brings a warmth to the work and I feel very, very lucky about that,\u201d she added.\nTerrell said her friend Beau, who died of a brain tumor in 2015, is always on her mind.\n\u201cYou want to represent what \u2026 the President wants you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s always this other question of, what would Beau do? And I think of those things as kind of intertwined and they\u2019re part of the background driver of how we do the work.\u201d\nPaying it forward for women\nTwo years into her work on the Judiciary Committee, Terrell became pregnant. She says Biden\u2019s office maintained a family-first culture. But as she continued her career in Washington, her kids got a bit older, and the balancing act became more complicated.\n\u201cI had the job in the Obama administration when my kids were say, like, around 6 and 8 \u2013 or 4 and 6. It\u2019s all a little bit of a blur,\u201d she joked.\nShe describes her time after work as \u201cbed, bath and beyond,\u201d an entire \u201csecond shift\u201d after a full day at the office. It\u2019s something she\u2019s extra mindful of now, as a senior woman in the administration.\n\u201cI look across the White House, the women whose kids are that age, and you really have to (remember) how long their days and their nights are,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cAnd then to think about the kind of performance and the kind of 100% they\u2019re giving at the office every day. I have so much gratitude and admiration.\u201d\nWomen having a seat at the table is not just a phrase in Terrell\u2019s office. When CNN stopped by one of her team meetings in the West Wing, the room was packed with young staffers \u2013 mostly women. Terrell says that was a conscious decision, not because of their gender, but because they were the best for the job.\n\u201c(The) expectation is, be ready to contribute. And that\u2019s kind of what I mean \u2013 be prepared and ready to play,\u201d she said of the more junior staff. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to do that.\u201d\nBut when asked what advice she would give to young women starting out in government today, Terrell didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\u201cI think that women today are way braver than I was,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really impressive. So, I kind of think they don\u2019t need my advice, actually, so, yeah, they don\u2019t need me. I\u2019m just happy to have drinks and coffee with them when they\u2019ll take me,\u201d she said with a laugh.\nNew challenges ahead\nTerrell and her team are knee-deep in negotiations for the final weeks of a Democratic House majority, which means competing priorities for the rest of the lame duck session \u2013 the most important of which is Congress\u2019 basic function of funding the government.\nAs some Democrats tried to squeeze in legislation to regulate social media companies, Terrell\u2019s stint at Facebook raised some questions among some advocacy groups, though Terrell maintains her stint at the tech giant 10 years ago doesn\u2019t conflict with the president\u2019s legislative agenda.\n\u201cI think the president kind of came into office and campaigned on this about a very pro-competition, pro-accountability and pro-transparency in social media platforms, which obviously, what they are today is not what they were 10 years ago. So we worked really hard, I think, to promote those executive actions, the regulatory actions, the people that we brought into the administration to work on those, and worked hard on legislative pieces, and hope to continue to do that next year.\u201d\nAnd though the Democratic majority in the Senate will slightly expand in January, Terrell\u2019s office is on the front lines preparing for Republicans to take over the House and launch a wave of congressional investigations into Biden officials.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously going to be a big piece of, \u2018This is oversight\u2019 \u2013 you\u2019ve heard this \u2013 \u2018We are watching,\u2019 and that\u2019s just to be expected,\u201d Terrell says. \u201cI think what the perspective of the president and the team here is, you can\u2019t let that kind of swamp the boat.\u201d\n\u201cI think the president said that he\u2019s ready to work with anyone who wants to work with him, hopes that Republicans will do this, and that they will get the people\u2019s work done and not go down the proverbial rabbit holes of oversight.\u201d\nShe insists her team\u2019s relationships with not just Democrats but with Republicans across the aisle will pay off.\n\u201cThe kind of relationships you have with Republicans, we\u2019ve been working on them the whole time,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are folks in our shop, and again, folks here in the White House, who have some of those relationships. And so, it won\u2019t feel like we\u2019re parachuting in. It\u2019ll just feel like a Chapter Two.\u201d",

        "Content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nFormer President Donald Trump has been campaigning in between his many different court appearances for much of the year.\nBut his decision to attend the first day of his $250 million civil fraud trial in New York created another opportunity to appear on camera from inside a courtroom when the judge allowed photographers to document the moment before proceedings got underway.\nKeeping track of the dizzying array of civil and criminal cases is a full-time job.\nHe is charged with crimes related to conduct:\n- Before his presidency \u2013 a hush money scheme that may have helped him win the White House in 2016.\n- During his presidency \u2013 his effort to stay in the White House by overturning the 2020 election.\n- After his presidency \u2013 his treatment of classified material and alleged attempts to hide it from the National Archives.\nTrump denies any wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty in all of the criminal cases. He alleges a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. But each trial has its own distinct storyline to follow.\nHere\u2019s an updated list of developments in Trump\u2019s very complicated set of court cases, beginning with the one playing out in Manhattan this week.\nNew York state civil court: $250 million fraud case\nThe civil fraud trial, unlike Trump\u2019s multiple criminal indictments, does not carry the danger of a felony conviction and jail time, but it could very well cost him some of his most prized possessions, including Trump Tower.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James brought the $250 million lawsuit in September 2022, alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\nJudge Arthur Engoron has already ruled that Trump and his adult sons are liable for fraud for inflating the value of his golf courses, hotels and homes on financial statements to secure loans.\nThe trial portion of the case, playing out in court in Manhattan, will assess what damages will be levied against Trump and how Engoron\u2019s decision to strip Trump of his New York business licenses will play out.\nFederal civil court in New York: E. Jean Carroll defamation lawsuit\nIn May, a federal jury in Manhattan found Trump sexually abused former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in the mid-1990s and awarded her about $5 million.\nA separate civil defamation lawsuit will only need to decide how much money Trump has to pay her. That case for January 15 \u2013 the same day Iowa Republicans will hold their caucuses, the first date on the presidential primary calendar.\nFederal criminal court in DC: 2020 election Interference\nIn August, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigation into the aftermath of the 2020 election. The former president was arraigned in a Washington, DC, courtroom, where he pleaded not guilty.\nThe case is based in part on a scheme to create slates of fake electors in key states won by President Joe Biden.\nIn late September, Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Trump\u2019s request that she recuse herself from the case. Chutkan, a Barack Obama appointee, has overseen civil and criminal cases related to the January 6, 2021, insurrection and has repeatedly exceeded what prosecutors have requested for convicted rioters\u2019 prison sentences.\nChutkan set the trial\u2019s start date for March 4, 2024, the day before Super Tuesday, when the largest batch of presidential primaries will occur. The trial marks the first of Trump\u2019s criminal cases expected to proceed.\nNew York criminal court: Hush money payments\nTrump has been charged in Manhattan criminal court with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels late in the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe former president pleaded not guilty at his April arraignment in Manhattan.\nProsecutors, led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, accuse Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal $130,000 in payments to Daniels made by former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to guarantee her silence about an alleged affair.\nTrump has denied having an affair with Daniels.\nThe trial was originally scheduled to begin in late March 2024, but Judge Juan Merchan has suggested the date could move. The next court date is scheduled for February.\nGeorgia criminal court: Efforts to overturn election results\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is using racketeering violations to charge a broad criminal conspiracy against Trump and 18 others in their efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia.\nThe probe was launched in 2021 following Trump\u2019s call that January with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which the president pushed the Republican official to \u201cfind\u201d votes to overturn the election results.\nThe August indictment also includes how Trump\u2019s team allegedly misled state officials in Georgia; organized fake electors; harassed an election worker; and breached election equipment in rural Coffee County, Georgia.\nOne co-defendant, bail bondsman Scott Hall, has pleaded guilty to five counts in the case.\nFulton County prosecutors have signaled they could offer plea deals to other co-defendants.\nWillis this week issued a subpoena to former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, a Trump ally, who in turn demanded an immunity deal in exchange for testimony.\nTrial for two co-defendants is expected to begin this month and could last three to five months. A trial date has not been set for Trump, who has pleaded not guilty.\nFederal criminal court in Florida: Mishandling classified material\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 37 federal charges brought by Smith over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Smith added three additional counts in a superseding indictment.\nThe investigation centers on sensitive documents that Trump brought to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida after his White House term ended in January 2021.\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records.\nTrump was also caught on tape in a 2021 meeting in Bedminster, New Jersey, where the former president discussed holding secret documents he did not declassify.\nSmith\u2019s additional charges allege that Trump and his employees attempted to delete Mar-a-Lago security footage sought by the grand jury investigating the mishandling of the records.\nTrial is not expected until May, after most presidential primaries have concluded.\nThere are other cases to note:\nTrump Organization: Convicted of criminal tax fraud\nTrump\u2019s namesake business, the Trump Organization, was convicted in December by a New York jury of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors say was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.\nManhattan prosecutors told a jury the case was about \u201cgreed and cheating,\u201d laying out a scheme within the Trump Organization to pay high-level executives in perks such as luxury cars and apartments without paying taxes on them.\nFormer Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to his role in the tax scheme. He was released after serving four months in jail at Rikers Island.\nJanuary 6: Lawsuits by police officers\nSeveral members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police are suing Trump, saying his words and actions incited the 2021 riot.\nThe various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating Washington laws that prohibit the incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.\nIn August, Trump requested to put on hold the lawsuit related to the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, citing his various criminal trials. The estate of Sicknick, who died after responding to the attack on the Capitol, is suing two rioters involved in the attack and Trump for his alleged role in egging it on.\nOther lawsuits have been put on hold while a federal appeals court considers whether Trump had absolute immunity as the sitting president.\nPersonal retaliation: Peter Strzok lawsuit\nFormer top FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, who was fired in 2018 after the revelation that he criticized Trump in text messages, sued the Justice Department, alleging he was terminated improperly.\nIn summer 2017, former special counsel Robert Mueller removed Strzok from his team investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election after an internal investigation revealed texts with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page that could be read as exhibiting political bias.\nStrzok and Page were constant targets of verbal attacks by Trump and his allies, part of the larger ire the then-president expressed toward the FBI during the Russia investigation. Trump repeatedly and publicly called for Strzok\u2019s ouster until he was fired in August 2018.\nTrump is set to be deposed this month as part of the case, according to Politico.\nTrump lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, Democrats, ex-FBI officials is dismissed\nA federal judge dismissed Trump\u2019s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, several ex-FBI officials and more than two dozen other people and entities that he claims conspired to undermine his 2016 campaign with fabricated information tying him to Russia.\n\u201cWhat (Trump\u2019s lawsuit) lacks in substance and legal support it seeks to substitute with length, hyperbole, and the settling of scores and grievances,\u201d US District Judge Donald Middlebrooks wrote.\nTrump appealed the decision, but Middlebrooks also ruled that the former president and his attorneys are liable for nearly $1 million in sanctions for bringing the case.\nTrump launched a Hail Mary bid in July to revive the sprawling lawsuit, relying on a recent report from special counsel John Durham that criticized the FBI\u2019s Trump-Russia probe.\nTrump victory in Michael Cohen\u2019s retaliation suit\nTrump\u2019s former lawyer Cohen sued Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and others, alleging they put him back in jail to prevent him from promoting his upcoming book while under home confinement.\nCohen was serving the remainder of his sentence for lying to Congress and campaign violations at home, due to Covid-19 concerns, when he started an anti-Trump social media campaign in summer 2020. Cohen said that he was sent back to prison in retaliation and that he spent 16 days in solitary confinement.\nA federal judge threw out the lawsuit in November. District Judge Lewis Liman said he was empathetic to Cohen\u2019s position but that Supreme Court precedent bars him from allowing the case to move forward.\nTrump-filed lawsuits: Bob Woodward\nTrump sued journalist Bob Woodward in January for alleged copyright violations, claiming Woodward released audio from their interviews without Trump\u2019s consent.\nWoodward and publisher Simon & Schuster said Trump\u2019s case is without merit and moved for its dismissal.\nWoodward conducted several interviews with Trump for his book \u201cRage,\u201d published in September 2020. Woodward later released \u201cThe Trump Tapes,\u201d an audiobook featuring eight hours of raw interviews with Trump interspersed with the author\u2019s commentary.\nTrump-filed lawsuits: The New York Times, Mary Trump and CNN\nA federal judge in Florida dismissed Trump\u2019s $475 million lawsuit against CNN that accused the network of defaming him by using the phrase \u201cBig Lie\u201d and allegedly comparing him to Adolf Hitler.\nA New York judge dismissed The New York Times from Trump\u2019s lawsuit regarding disclosure of his tax returns and ordered Trump to pay the newspaper\u2019s legal fees. Trump is still suing his niece Mary Trump for disclosure of the tax documents. She had tried to sue him for defrauding her out of millions after the death of his father, but the suit was dismissed.\nCNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Tierney Sneed, Katelyn Polantz and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "Summary": "President Joe Biden's federal student loan forgiveness program, which promises to deliver up to $20,000 of debt relief for millions of borrowers, is on hold indefinitely as legal challenges work their way through the courts.",
        "Content": "The fate of President Joe Biden\u2019s federal student loan forgiveness program, which promises to deliver up to $20,000 of debt relief for millions of borrowers, lies with the Supreme Court.\nThe justices heard arguments on February 28 in two cases concerning the forgiveness program, and a decision is expected by late June or early July.\nAbout 26 million people had already applied by the time a federal district court judge struck down the program on November 10, 2022 \u2013 prompting the government to stop taking applications. No debt has been canceled thus far.\nThe administration officially launched the application on October 17, 2022, following a brief \u201cbeta period\u201d during which its team assessed whether tweaks were needed.\nIf the Supreme Court ultimately allows the program to move forward, not every student loan borrower is eligible for the debt relief. First, only federally held student loans qualify. Private student loans are excluded.\nSecond, high-income borrowers are generally excluded from receiving debt forgiveness. Individual borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 annually could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. Pell grants are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors including their family\u2019s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and end up in default.\nHere\u2019s what else borrowers need to know about the proposed student loan forgiveness plan:\nWhat are the legal challenges to Biden\u2019s forgiveness plan?\nThe Biden administration faced several lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness program, two of which have made it to the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs argue that the Department of Education is overstepping its authority.\nOne of the lawsuits was brought by six Republican-led states, headed by Nebraska, that argue that the student loan forgiveness program violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the process by which federal agencies issue regulations.\nA lower court judge dismissed this lawsuit on October 20, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge. In November, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision and blocked the program.\nThe other challenge that the Supreme Court heard was brought by two individual borrowers \u2013 Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor \u2013 who are not qualified for full debt relief forgiveness and who say they were denied an opportunity to comment on the secretary of education\u2019s decision to provided targeted student loan debt relief to some.\nThe lawsuit was filed with the backing of a conservative group called the Job Creators Network Foundation. A federal judge in Texas ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, striking down the program on November 10.\nLawyers for the government say that Congress gave the secretary of education \u201cexpansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,\u201d like the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a memo from the Department of Justice.\nWhen will I receive my debt relief?\nIt\u2019s unclear when, or if, borrowers will see debt relief under Biden\u2019s program.\nAdministration officials expected to be able to grant relief before January, when payments were set resume after the pandemic-related pause expired. But now debt cancellation won\u2019t occur until at least June when the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling.\nOn November 22, 2022, the Biden administration extended the pandemic-related pause on payments and interest a final time. Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, student loan interest will resume on September 1 and payments will be due starting in October.\nA law passed in early June that addressees the debt ceiling prohibits another extension of the pause.\nThe White House has said that it has already approved 16 million applications for debt relief. The Department of Education will hold on to that information so it can quickly process those borrowers\u2019 relief if the government prevails in court.\nIf and when the program moves forward, an estimated 8 million borrowers may receive debt relief automatically because the Department of Education already has their income on file.\nIf the government restarts taking applications, borrowers can apply online here: https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application.\nApplicants can expect to receive an email confirmation once their application is successfully submitted. Then, borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer when the debt cancellation has been applied to their account.\nBorrowers were expected to have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.\nWhat kind of federal loans are eligible?\nThere are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief if the program is allowed to proceed. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.\nBut federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan by September 29, 2022.\nThe Department of Education initially said these privately held loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action \u2013 but reversed course last September when six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers.\nDefaulted Federal Family Education Loans and defaulted Perkins Loans would be eligible for the debt relief even if they are privately held.\nWhat year is the income threshold based on?\nIf Biden\u2019s program is allowed to move forward, eligibility is based on a borrower\u2019s adjusted gross income for either tax year 2020 or 2021. Adjusted gross income can be lower than your total wages because it considers tax deductions and adjustments, like contributions made to a 401(k) retirement plan.\nA taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income can be found on line 11 of IRS Form 1040.\nHow will the government know what my income was?\nThe Department of Education says it already has income information for nearly 8 million borrowers, likely because of financial aid forms or previously submitted income-driven repayment plan applications. If the program is allowed to move forward, those borrowers will automatically receive the debt relief if they meet the income requirement, unless they choose to opt out. The department has said it will email borrowers who will be considered for debt relief but don\u2019t need to apply.\nMillions of other borrowers will need to apply for student loan forgiveness if the Department of Education doesn\u2019t have their income information on file. When they submit the application, borrowers are required to self-attest that their income is under the eligibility threshold. They are required to certify that the information provided is accurate upon penalty of perjury.\nThe Biden administration has said that applicants who are \u201cmore likely to exceed the income cutoff\u201d will be required to submit additional information, like a tax transcript. Officials expect that just 5% of borrowers with eligible federal student loans would not qualify due to the income threshold.\nWill I have to pay taxes on the amount of debt canceled?\nBorrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiven, thanks to a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed in 2021.\nBut it\u2019s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven. Most states will not tax the forgiveness as income.\nI\u2019m a current student. Am I eligible for forgiveness?\nYes, some current students would be eligible under Biden\u2019s plan if it\u2019s allowed to take effect. Eligibility for borrowers who filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, as an independent will be based on the individual\u2019s own household income.\nEligibility for borrowers who are enrolled as dependent students, generally those under the age of 24, will be based on parental income for either 2020 or 2021.\nI have student debt from graduate school. Am I eligible for forgiveness?\nYes, if your income meets the eligibility threshold and the program is allowed to be implemented.\nI\u2019m a parent and took out a Parent PLUS loan. Am I eligible?\nYes, you could be eligible if your income meets the threshold. A parent borrower with federal Parent PLUS loans for multiple children is still only eligible for up to $20,000 of loan forgiveness.\nBut a parent is only eligible for up to $20,000 in debt relief if he or she received a Pell grant for his or her own education. If only the child received a Pell grant, the parent is eligible for up to $10,000 in forgiveness.\nHow do I know if I ever received a Pell grant?\nMost borrowers can log in to Studentaid.gov to see if they received a Pell grant while enrolled in college. Information about Pell grants received is displayed on the account dashboard and on the My Aid page. This is also where borrowers can find out how much they owe and what kind of loans they have.\nBorrowers who received a Pell grant before 1994 won\u2019t see their Pell grant information online, but they are still eligible for the $20,000 in student loan forgiveness.\nAs long as borrowers received at least one Pell grant, they are eligible.\nThe Biden administration has said that eligible borrowers who have received Pell grants will automatically receive the additional debt relief.\nAm I eligible for forgiveness if my loans are in default?\nYes, defaulted federal student loans would be eligible for debt relief under Biden\u2019s program.\nFor borrowers who have a remaining balance on their defaulted student loans after the cancellation is applied, there will be an opportunity to get out of default once payments resume later this year as part of what the Department of Education is calling its \u201cFresh Start\u201d initiative.\nHow will my payments change going forward?\nBorrowers who have debt remaining after either $10,000 or $20,000 is wiped away could see their monthly payment amounts recalculated if they are enrolled in a standard repayment plan. Under a standard repayment plan, borrowers pay a fixed amount that ensures loans are paid off within 10 years.\nBorrowers who are already enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan are not likely to see their monthly payment amounts change due to the forgiveness, because their payments are based on household income and family size.\nBorrowers have not been required to make payments on their federal student loans since March 2020 because of the government\u2019s pandemic-related pause.\nWhat about Biden\u2019s new income-driven repayment plan?\nAlong with Biden\u2019s August announcement about canceling some federal student loan debt, he also said he would create a new plan that would make repayment more manageable for borrowers.\nThere are currently several repayment plans available for federal student loan borrowers that lower monthly payments by capping them at a portion of their income.\nThe new income-driven repayment plan proposal will cap payments at 5% of a borrower\u2019s discretionary income, down from 10% that is offered in most current plans, as well as reduce the amount of income that is considered discretionary. It would also forgive remaining balances after 10 years of repayment, instead of 20 years.\nBiden is also proposing that the new plan cover the borrower\u2019s unpaid monthly interest. This could be very helpful for people whose monthly payments are so low that they don\u2019t cover their monthly interest charge and end up seeing their balances explode, growing larger than what was originally borrowed.\nThe new plan is currently going through a formal rulemaking process, and the Department of Education has said it expects provisions of the new plan to take effect later this year.\nCan I get a refund for what I paid during the pandemic pause?\nYes. Borrowers have not been required to make payments on their federal student loans since March 13, 2020, because of the pandemic-related pause. But if borrowers did make payments, they are allowed to contact their loan servicer to request a refund.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

        "Content": "Mom whose son died from fentanyl-laced pill ordered on Snapchat slams CEO apology as \u2018fake\u2019\nFrom CNN's Catherine Thorbecke\nBridgette Norring, a mother whose son died from an accidental fentanyl overdose after ordering a pill off of Snapchat, slammed the apology she received today from Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel as \u201cfake.\u201d\n\u201cIt lacked any heart,\u201d Norring told CNN after the hearing wrapped on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cI think he could have done better in his apology to us.\u201d\nWhen asked what was going through her mind as she listened to the tech CEOs defend themselves, Norring said that it was \u201cvery frustrating to sit and listen to them.\u201d\n\u201cI just feel like for them, our children are just casualties, pawns, in this game to make money,\u201d Norring said.\nNorring appeared on CNN News Central shortly after the hearing concluded alongside Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota. She held a picture of her son, Devin Norring, as she spoke, with the emotion apparent in her voice.\nKlobuchar was visibly shaken during the hearing, calling for lawmakers to finally enact change after what she said was decades of inaction on legislation aimed at reeling in social media companies.\n\u201cI just want to get this stuff done, I'm so tired of this,\u201d Klobuchar told CNN News Central. \u201cIt's been 28 years, what since the internet? We haven't passed any of these bills \u2026 it\u2019s time to actually pass them.\u201d\n3:37 p.m. ET, January 31, 2024\nHere's why it's hard to sue social media platforms\nFrom CNN's Clare Duffy\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, several lawmakers lamented the fact that it's nearly impossible to successfully sue the social media giants to hold them accountable for problematic content on their platforms.\n\u201cI am tired of talking. I\u2019m tired of having discussions,\u201d South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said. \u201cOpen up the courthouse door. Until you do that, nothing will change. Until these people can be sued for the damage they\u2019re doing, it is all talk.\u201d\nThe reason it's so hard to sue social media platforms is a 28-year-old federal law called \"Section 230,\" which holds that tech companies cannot be held liable for the content that users post to their platforms.\nThe statute has for years been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats. But tech companies and digital rights groups have defended as vital to a functioning internet.\nOn Wednesday, lawmakers called for the repeal of Section 230.\n\"It is now time to make sure that the people who are holding up the signs can sue on behalf of their loved ones. Nothing will change until the courtroom door is open to victims and social media,\" Graham said.\n3:33 p.m. ET, January 31, 2024\nSen. Ed Markey blasts tech CEO \u201cexcuses\u201d\nFrom CNN's Brian Fung\nMassachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey went after tech CEOs following Wednesday\u2019s hearing, saying the executives had little to offer besides \u201cexcuses.\u201d\n\u201cTheir CEOs showed up today with even more excuses. It was outrageous,\u201d Markey said.\nMarkey who pioneered the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, a 1998 law that bars the nonconsensual collection of data of kids under age 13, urged his congressional colleagues to pass an update to the law extending those protections to teens.\n\u201cAn apology by Mark Zuckerberg is not enough,\u201d Markey said. \u201cWe need action. We need laws. We need protections \u2026. we're fed up with apologies.\u201c\nAs he concluded his remarks and walked away, onlookers shouted after him urging Markey to support the Kids Online Safety Act, another hot-button bill backed by Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn.\n3:18 p.m. ET, January 31, 2024\nNew Mexico attorney general says Zuckerberg \u201cneeds to start acting like a parent\u201d\nFrom CNN's Brian Fung\nIn a press conference on the Capitol grounds, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez described testimony by Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs as a \u201ccommand performance\u201d but said that parents can attest that the platforms \u201caren\u2019t living up to their promises.\u201d\nZuckerberg, he said, \u201cneeds to start acting like a parent. He has kids himself. He needs to start acting like that.\u201d\n\u201cWhen he builds these platforms, when he makes these decisions, he needs to think about what it would be like to have his son or daughter exposed to this,\u201d Torrez continued. \u201cHe needs to think about what it would be like to live through the pain and heartbreak that these parents have had to endure. He needs to really take a step back and evaluate his priorities and start helping us build a better future and stop fighting, real change.\u201d\nMeta whistleblower Arturo B\u00e9jar expresses disappointment\nFrom CNN's Brian Fung\nArturo B\u00e9jar, a Meta whistleblower who went public last year alleging Mark Zuckerberg ignored internal warnings about child safety, told CNN the company\u2019s behavior in the hearing made clear Zuckerberg does not prioritize the issue.\nInternal documents released by two US lawmakers today highlighted how Zuckerberg did not respond to senior executives\u2019 warnings that inaction could create major risks for the company.\n\u201cThe emails the Senate made available today, and his responses during testimony, show that Mark Zuckerberg and Meta do not care about the harm teens experience on their products,\u201d B\u00e9jar said. \u201c[Meta President of Global Affairs] Clegg writes about profound gaps with addiction, self-harm, bullying and harassment to Mark. Mark did not respond, and those gaps are unaddressed today \u2026 Children are not his priority.\u201d\n2:40 p.m. ET, January 31, 2024\nFamilies and victims were a massive force in today\u2019s hearing\nFrom CNN's Brian Fung\nThe families of people harmed by social media proved to be an immense force in Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\nThrough applause, laughter at CEO testimony, hisses and moments of silence, the parents who say their children suffered or died as a result of social media served as a key foil. They drove tensions higher and in some cases appeared to fuel the attacks of lawmakers against the CEOs.\nCongress has held many tech CEO hearings. But more than any other, the presence of so many parents in the room transformed the hearing and injected an unprecedented sense of urgency.\n2:53 p.m. ET, January 31, 2024\nZuckerberg apology was \"mindblowing,\" Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen tells CNN\nFrom CNN's Brian Fung\nThe Facebook whistleblower who kicked off years of scrutiny on the impact of social media on teens said Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s apology to parents was \u201cmindblowing.\u201d\nToday\u2019s hearing would have been inconceivable just a handful of years ago, she said, when lawmakers were asking Zuckerberg basic questions about how his company makes money.\n\u201cAlmost every hearing since has been substantially more meaningful, and they\u2019ve asked more insightful questions, more relevant questions. This was four hours long, and there were maybe 20 minutes where I was like, \u2018Do you really know what you\u2019re asking?\u2019 And that\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nAsked about the potential for legislation to move forward, Haugen said she would be surprised if \u201cwe make it through another [electoral] cycle where we don\u2019t see something.\u201d\n2:31 p.m. ET, January 31, 2024\nHere's a recap of the key moments from the hearing\nFrom CNN's Brian Fung and Clare Duffy\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee's grilling of four social media executives produced some notable moments. Here are a few:\nZuckerberg, Spiegel personally apologize to families: Meta CEO Zuckerberg stood to apologize to the families in the hearing room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything you have all been through,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should go through the things that your families have suffered and this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry-wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.\u201d\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel also apologized to families whose children have died after they purchased drugs on Snapchat. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that we have not been able to prevent these tragedies,\u201d Spiegel said, before detailing some of the efforts the company takes to protect young users.\n\"The dark side\" of social media products \"is too great\": Social media companies have created products that have an upside, but they also have a dark side that is \u201ctoo great to live with,\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Wednesday while grilling chief executives of four such companies. Until social media companies are sued for the damage they are doing, Graham warned that there will be no change.\nHating social media companies is a rare unifying force on Capitol Hill: Wednesday\u2019s hearing again demonstrates the breadth of criticism for social media companies among lawmakers, a rare bipartisan topic on Capitol Hill. Despite both parties\u2019 appetite for going after tech platforms, however, Congress has yet to pass meaningful legislation to regulate social media companies. Most of the action has taken place in state legislatures and in the courts, which have become battlegrounds for new policies including age minimums for social media.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has wrapped its hearing where lawmakers grilled four tech executives \u2014 Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, TikTok's Shou Chew, X's Linda Yaccarino and Discord's Jason Citron \u2014 on the online child sexual exploitation crisis.",

        "Summary": "The respiratory virus season has started early in kids this year and flooded children's hospitals in many parts of the country -- especially with respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV.",
        "Content": "The respiratory virus season has started early in kids this year and flooded children\u2019s hospitals in many parts of the country \u2013 especially with respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV.\nBut adults can get RSV, too. Although RSV does not typically send as many adults to the hospital, it can be a serious and even deadly disease for seniors and people with underlying health conditions.\nAnd with more kids getting RSV, the chances that adults will be exposed also rise. Some doctors say they are starting to see an uptick in adult patients.\nThis season, about 6 out of every 100,000 seniors has been hospitalized with RSV, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s significantly lower than the rate for children but still uncharacteristically high. In the years before the Covid-19 pandemic, hospitalization rates for seniors were about 10 times lower at this point in the season.\nDr. Ann Falsey, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Rochester Medical Center who has published research on RSV in adults, said RSV rose somewhat in children in the summer and early fall last year, but the US did not see the usual proportional increase in RSV in older adults at the time.\n\u201cI think that older adults were more cautious to continue public health measures like masks and social distance last year because they were still worrying about Covid,\u201d Falsey said. \u201cBut this year, we\u2019re starting to see older people ending up in the hospital again with RSV, because everyone is throwing caution to the wind.\u201d\nVirus flies under the radar in adults\nToo often, RSV flies under the radar in adults, she said. Many people, even doctors, overlook its impact on adults.\n\u201cThey think of it as strictly a pediatric disease, but you know, if you don\u2019t test for it, you\u2019ll never know what somebody actually is sick with,\u201d Falsey said.\nIn the United States, tracking viruses like RSV isn\u2019t nearly as thorough as it is for Covid-19, so it is difficult to know exactly how many adults get sick with RSV. The numbers of RSV cases come from self reports that go to a few dozen labs that only represent about a tenth of the population, and reports are then shared with the CDC.\nBased on best estimates, there are between 10,000 and 15,000 adult deaths in the United States from RSV each year and around 150,000 hospitalizations for RSV, Falsey said.\nA 2015 study of older adults in industrialized countries said the disease burden of RSV is \u201csubstantial\u201d and calculated that about 14.5% of the 1.5 million adults who caught RSV were admitted to hospitals. People who were 65 and older were more likely to be hospitalized than those ages 50 to 64.\n\u201cWhen we compare it to influenza A, it\u2019s not too far behind,\u201d Falsey said, referring to one of the strains of seasonal flu that\u2019s often linked with more severe illness.\nRSV symptoms in adults\nRSV shows up in adults the same way it does in kids. It can look like a common cold and include runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. The symptoms typically last a week or two, and they clear up with rest and fluids.\nBut in some adults, RSV can become dangerous because it can lead to dehydration, breathing trouble and more serious illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs.\nAdults at risk for severe illness from RSV\nThe adults who are most seriously at risk for severe outcomes with RSV are those 65 and older. The virus can spread quickly through a nursing home or long-term care facility, just like Covid-19 and flu.\nAdults with weakened immune systems need to be careful in RSV season. This can include people undergoing treatment for cancer, transplant patients, people with HIV and those who take certain drugs that suppress the immune system for diseases like Crohn\u2019s, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.\nAdults with chronic heart or lung disease like asthma, COPD or heart failure are also more likely to have to go to the hospital if they catch RSV.\nHow RSV spreads\nAn infected person can pass on RSV through a cough or sneeze. If the respiratory droplets land on a surface like a doorknob or desk and someone else touches it and then touches their face, they can get sick.\nIt also spreads because healthy adults often won\u2019t know they have it. It doesn\u2019t typically cause fatigue like the flu or Covid does, so many adults will go to work or jump on a plane or bus, chalking up their symptoms to allergies. As they interact with others, it spreads further.\nRSV can easily spread from children to adults, too.\nWhat do you do if you get RSV\nIf you have been coughing or have any other RSV-like symptoms and you are in a high-risk category, you should go to your doctor and get it checked out, says Dr. Daphne-Dominique Villanueva.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t test everybody right now \u2013 in an ideal world we would want to do that \u2013 but we want to concentrate on vulnerable people,\u201d said Villanueva, an assistant professor in the School of Medicine at West Virginia University who has written studies about RSV.\nDoctors\u2019 offices have swab tests that can determine whether an illness is flu, RSV or Covid.\nThere are specific antivirals for flu and Covid-19 but not for RSV. The trick is getting tested early, even to rule out RSV; getting started on Covid or flu antivirals right away can shorten the time you are sick and keep the virus from progressing to something more serious.\nWith RSV, the treatment is what\u2019s called supportive care: Drink plenty of fluids. Get some real rest. Stay home so you don\u2019t spread it. Wear a mask around others in your home.\nIf you start to wheeze and feel short of breath, Falsey said, those would be clear signals that you should see a doctor or maybe even take yourself to an emergency room quickly. At the hospital, they can give you supplemental oxygen if necessary.\nProtection from RSV\nThere\u2019s no protection from a vaccine for RSV, but that could change by next season. In the US, there are four RSV vaccines that may be nearing review by the FDA, and more than a dozen are going through trials. Some are designed to protect infants, and some are being tested in older adults.\n\u201cSince we have very limited ways of treating it effectively, you should do whatever you can to prevent getting it in the first place,\u201d Villanueva said.\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\nProtective measures for this busy RSV season will sound familiar: Wash your hands frequently, disinfect surfaces, and wear a mask in crowded spaces.\n\u201cYou might want to put off that visit for a week to see your grandkids, or you might want to wear a mask if you are going into a crowded place,\u201d Falsey said. \u201cMasks and hand-washing work. I know people are kind of over it, but if you\u2019re a frail person or you know you have underlying medical conditions, when we know that RSV is surging, you should do those things and use caution around children who are actively sick. It all helps.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.",

        "Content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nThe first photo ever taken of a black hole looks a little sharper now.\nOriginally released in 2019, the unprecedented historic image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy Messier 87 captured an essentially invisible celestial object using direct imaging.\nThe image presented the first direct visual evidence that black holes exist, showcasing a central dark region encapsulated by a ring of light that looks brighter on one side. Astronomers nicknamed the object the \u201cfuzzy, orange donut.\u201d\nNow, scientists have used machine learning to give the image a cleaner upgrade that looks more like a \u201cskinny\u201d doughnut, researchers said. The central region is darker and larger, surrounded by a bright ring as hot gas falls into the black hole in the new image.\nIn 2017, astronomers set out to observe the invisible heart of the massive galaxy Messier 87, or M87, near the Virgo galaxy cluster 55 million light-years from Earth.\nThe Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, called EHT, is a global network of telescopes that captured the first photograph of a black hole. More than 200 researchers worked on the project for more than a decade. The project was named for the event horizon, the proposed boundary around a black hole that represents the point of no return where no light or radiation can escape.\nTo capture an image of the black hole, scientists combined the power of seven radio telescopes around the world using Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry, according to the European Southern Observatory, which is part of the EHT. This array effectively created a virtual telescope around the same size as Earth.\n\u2018Maximum resolution\u2019 achieved\nData from the original 2017 observation was combined with a machine learning technique to capture the full resolution of what the telescopes saw for the first time. The new, more detailed image, along with a study, was released on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\u201cWith our new machine learning technique, PRIMO, we were able to achieve the maximum resolution of the current array,\u201d said lead study author Lia Medeiros, astrophysics postdoctoral fellow in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in a statement.\n\u201cSince we cannot study black holes up-close, the detail of an image plays a critical role in our ability to understand its behavior. The width of the ring in the image is now smaller by about a factor of two, which will be a powerful constraint for our theoretical models and tests of gravity.\u201d\nMedeiros and other EHT members developed Principal-component Interferometric Modeling, or PRIMO. The algorithm relies on dictionary learning in which computers create rules based on large amounts of material. If a computer is given a series of images of different bananas, combined with some training, it might be able to tell if an unknown image does or doesn\u2019t contain a banana.\nComputers using PRIMO analyzed more than 30,000 high-resolution simulated images of black holes to pick out common structural details. This allowed the machine learning essentially to fill in the gaps of the original image.\n\u201cPRIMO is a new approach to the difficult task of constructing images from EHT observations,\u201d said Tod Lauer, an astronomer at the National Science Foundation\u2019s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, or NOIRLab. \u201cIt provides a way to compensate for the missing information about the object being observed, which is required to generate the image that would have been seen using a single gigantic radio telescope the size of the Earth.\u201d\nAdvancing research of black holes\nBlack holes are made up of huge amounts of matter squeezed into a small area, according to NASA, creating a massive gravitational field that draws in everything around it, including light. These powerful celestial phenomena also have a way of superheating the material around them and warping space-time.\nMaterial accumulates around black holes, is heated to billions of degrees and reaches nearly the speed of light. Light bends around the gravity of the black hole, which creates the photon ring seen in the image. The black hole\u2019s shadow is represented by the dark central region.\nThe visual confirmation of black holes also acts as confirmation of Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity. In the theory, Einstein predicted that dense, compact regions of space would have such intense gravity that nothing could escape them. But if heated materials in the form of plasma surround the black hole and emit light, the event horizon could be visible.\nThe new image can help scientists make more accurate measurements of the black hole\u2019s mass. Researchers can also apply PRIMO to other EHT observations, including those of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.\n\u201cThe 2019 image was just the beginning,\u201d Medeiros said. \u201cIf a picture is worth a thousand words, the data underlying that image have many more stories to tell. PRIMO will continue to be a critical tool in extracting such insights.\u201d",

        "Summary": "Since Tupperware, the iconic kitchen brand that's been a household name for decades, signaled recently that it might be going out of business, you might be wondering how long your stash of its food storage containers is safe to use \u2014 especially if it's vintage.",
        "Content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Adulthood, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has tips to help you make more informed decisions around personal finance, career, wellness and personal connections.\nTupperware, the iconic kitchen brand that\u2019s been a household name for decades, recently received a lifeline from its creditors, but the business still faces extreme challenges. Given the brand\u2019s prospects, you might be wondering how long your stash of its food storage containers is safe to use \u2014 especially if it\u2019s vintage.\nFiguring out the answer to that question for any type of reusable plastic food storage products \u2014 not just Tupperware \u2014 often comes down to understanding what they\u2019re made of. Bisphenol A, more commonly known as BPA, is a chemical that, according to the United States Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, has been used for years in the production of certain plastics to make them more durable and shatter-resistant. Unfortunately, BPA can also make them potential health hazards.\nIn human studies, BPA exposure has been associated with a higher risk of a wide range of health conditions or issues, such as infertility, altered fetal growth of the fetus, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and aggression among children, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, and heart disease, said Laura Vandenberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\nIn addition to food containers, BPA has been used in various other products, such as shatterproof windows, water bottles and eyewear, and in resins coating metal food cans, bottle tops and water supply pipes. The composition of your plastic product can depend on the year you bought it, Vandenberg said.\nSince March 2010, items Tupperware sells in the US and Canada are BPA-free, according to its website.\nCNN has contacted Tupperware for comment but has not received a response.\n\u201cWe worry about those hard, shatter-resistant plastics that were made a decade ago, that were made with BPA,\u201d Vandenberg said. \u201cEvery single time that they\u2019re used, they\u2019re leaching small amounts of BPA out of them. \u2026 Even the low levels of BPA that leach from consumer plastics, canned food linings or other consumer goods \u2026 have been shown to be associated with harm, and people certainly should care about it.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not safe the day you buy it, it\u2019s not safe 10 years later,\u201d Vandenberg said. In fact, the longer you own them, the riskier they are for your health, she added.\nRisks of container wear and tear\nPutting stress on plastic food containers by washing them in the dishwasher or with rough scrub brushes \u201cincrease the ability of that plastic to leach whatever it was made out of,\u201d Vandenberg said. Scratches can create deep grooves for bacteria to reside in as well, said James Rogers, director of food safety research and testing at Consumer Reports, a nonprofit research, testing and consumer advocacy organization.\nPutting highly acidic foods \u2014 such as tomatoes or citrus fruits \u2014 in these products does the same thing, Vandenberg said.\nThe \u201cmicrowave safe\u201d label on some plastic containers doesn\u2019t mean the product is totally safe from a health standpoint, she added.\n\u201cSome of the plasticizers and chemicals can transfer from the plastic containers into the food during heating,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cSo we totally advocate that you transfer your food from a plastic container into a glass bowl and microwave it that way.\u201d\nDiscoloration of a container can signal that a chemical change has occurred in the plastic, Vandenberg said. \u201cUsually that is happening because there\u2019s lots of little micro-holes or micro-tears,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd now there\u2019s an interaction with the food and the plastic (because the plastic is degrading). So if the plastic is discolored, it\u2019s telling you that that plastic is breaking down.\u201d\nAny damaged plastic food storage containers should be discarded, said Sam Cole, global director of product certification, food equipment and chemicals at the National Safety Foundation, an organization facilitating development of public health standards and certification programs for the protection of food, water, consumer products and the environment.\nBPA in the body\nThe majority of daily exposure to BPA happens through diet, according to the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. \u201cThe reason why we worry about BPA is that, going all the way back to the 1930s when it was tested for use as a pharmaceutical, it was clear that it acts like an estrogen,\u201d Vandenberg said. \u201cEstrogen is a pretty powerful hormone that is important for reproduction and fertility, but also really important for the development of sex organs, development of the brain and controlling metabolism.\n\u201cIt has a role in muscle development and fat development,\u201d she added. \u201cSo even small amounts of tinkering with the estrogen or estrogen pathways in our body can have really serious outcomes for our health.\u201d\nThe shape of the molecules in BPA make it more likely to bind to estrogen receptors, Vandenberg added. \u201cI avoid using those reusable plastics as much as possible, because I have yet to see good evidence that there are consumer plastics that are free from estrogenic properties.\u201d\nGenerally, plastics with the label \u201cPC\u201d (for polycarbonate) or recycling codes three or seven likely contain BPA, according to Vandenberg and the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\nPlastic food storage alternatives\nSome manufacturers have been phasing BPA and other bisphenols, sometimes called analogues, out of their products due to public attention \u2014 rather than regulatory action \u2014 but not all, Vandenberg said.\n\u201cThink about replacing them with something that\u2019s chemically inert, like glass,\u201d Vandenberg said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford to replace everything all at once, replace them one at a time.\u201d\n\u201cI know it\u2019s heavy, it can break and all the rest of that, but we think that the advantages to using glass containers for storing food and reheating food outweigh the risks,\u201d Rogers said.\nYou can also opt for porcelain, ceramic or stainless-steel containers, especially for hot foods and liquids, according to Vandenberg and the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misspelled Laura Vandenberg\u2019s name.",

        "Summary": "Human-caused climate change has already made heat waves around the world more frequent and intense.",
        "Content": "Human-caused climate change has already made heat waves around the world more frequent and intense.\nScientists who study the role of global warming on weather say that every heat wave today bears the fingerprints of the climate crisis.\nClimate change, driven primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, is worsening global extreme weather in general, but much of that change is related to heat.\nIn the US, heat kills more Americans than any other weather-related disaster, and it will only continue to worsen as the world heats up from burning fossil fuels.\nHere\u2019s what happens to your body in extreme heat, what you need to watch out for and how to stay safe.\nWhat happens to your body\nNormally, your body is used to a certain range of temperatures, usually between 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. When your brain senses a change \u2013 either lower or higher than that \u2013 it attempts to help your body cool down or heat up, according to Dr. Judith Linden, executive vice chair of the department of emergency medicine at Boston Medical Center and a professor in the emergency medicine department at Boston University\u2019s school of medicine.\n\u201cThere are a number of different ways in which (the brain) attempts to cool the body down. One way, the most common way we think of, is that you sweat,\u201d Linden said. \u201cThe pores open, the body sweats and the sweat evaporates, that cools the body.\u201d\nThe second way your body cools itself down is by dilating vessels and upping your heart rate, which helps bring heat and blood to the surface of your body and helps releases that excess heat.\nWhen you\u2019re exposed to high temperatures, it becomes harder for your body to try and keep up with cooling itself down. And if your environment is hot and humid, sweat doesn\u2019t evaporate as easily \u2013 which pushes your body\u2019s temperature even higher, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\u201cThe higher the humidity, the lower temperatures you need for extreme heat,\u201d Linden said.\nHigh body temperatures can lead to damage to the brain and other vital organs, the CDC says. They can also lead to several heat-related illnesses.\nTypes of heat-related illnesses\nMild-heat related illnesses, including heat cramps, are most common, Linden said. Heat cramps can develop in people who sweat a lot, including during exercising. The excessive sweating uses up all of the body\u2019s salt and moisture and can lead to muscle pains or spasms, usually in the abdomen, arms or legs, according to the CDC.\nA heat rash can also develop. That\u2019s a skin irritation caused by too much sweating in hot and humid weather, and is most common in young children, the CDC says. It is usually a red cluster of pimples or blisters, and tends to be in places including the neck, upper chest or in elbow creases.\nWhen your body\u2019s beginning to exceed its ability to cool itself down, you can develop what\u2019s known as heat exhaustion.\n\u201cIn this case you\u2019re going to see excessive sweating because your body is really going to try and keep up with that extra heat. You\u2019re going to feel light-headed, you may feel dizzy, often people present with nausea, headaches and their skin often looks pale and clammy and their pulse is often fast,\u201d Linden said.\n\u201cThis is the body\u2019s last attempt to cool itself before it really goes into a point of no return.\u201d\nA heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness, and, if left untreated, can lead to death.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where your body\u2019s temperature goes above 104 to 105 degrees or so, and this is where your mechanisms are starting to fail,\u201d Linden said.\nWarning signs may include extremely high body temperatures, red and dry skin, a rapid pulse, headache, dizziness, nausea or loss of consciousness, according to the CDC.\nThe hallmark of a heat stroke is confusion and agitation, Linden said.\n\u201cSo when somebody\u2019s in the heat and they become confused and agitated, that\u2019s heat stroke until proven otherwise and you need to call 911 for that or get help immediately and get the person out of the heat.\u201d\nWho is most at risk\nElderly, people with chronic medical conditions as well as children are at higher risk for severe heat-related illnesses.\nThe elderly and people with chronic medical conditions may be less likely to sense and respond to temperature changes and may be taking medication that make the heat effects worse, the CDC said.\n\u201cVery young (people) as well, because they\u2019re less likely to recognize heat-related illness and they\u2019re less likely to get out of the heat if they\u2019re starting to feel overheated,\u201d Linden said.\nStudent-athletes and pets are also at higher risk, she added.\n\u201cIn this weather, you must never, ever, ever leave a child or a pet in the car for even a minute,\u201d Linden added.\nHow to stay safe\nWhen your community is facing extreme heat, there are several things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.\nFirst, keep an eye out for symptoms of heat exhaustion or other illnesses. \u201cIf somebody starts feeling light-headed, dizzy, nausea or headache, that is the time to act immediately,\u201d Linden said. \u201cThat means getting them out of the heat and into a cool environment.\u201d\nPutting water on someone who may be experiencing symptoms and giving them fluids can help cool them down. If someone is starting to lose consciousness or has nausea or vomiting, call 911.\n\u201cIf you see anybody with any type of confusion, that\u2019s an immediate red flag,\u201d Linden added.\nWhen it\u2019s hot outside, try to avoid outdoor activities \u2013 especially between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to Linden. If you have to go outside, wear light-colored clothing, cover your head and drink plenty of fluids.\nDon\u2019t wait until you\u2019re thirsty to drink water \u2013 as that can be a sign of dehydration. Linden recommends drinking at least one glass of water \u2013 or more \u2013 an hour.\n\u201cIf you do start to feel light-headed, dizzy, sweating, fast pulse, get out of the heat immediately,\u201d Linden said.\nTry to find air conditioning, or places in your area where you can go to stay cool, according to Ready.gov. Even spending a few hours in a shopping mall or public library can help.\nWhen you\u2019re home, fans can help, but don\u2019t rely on them as your only way of cooling down \u2013 while it may feel more comfortable, they won\u2019t help prevent heat-related illness.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a super hot room, if you\u2019ve got a fan, is it helpful? No. I think, if you\u2019ve got a fan, and you\u2019re able to mist yourself \u2026 then fans can be helpful,\u201d Linden said. \u201cFans are not foolproof.\u201d\nFinally, make sure you\u2019re checking on your neighbors, parents and friends \u2013 especially older individuals who may be living alone or are isolated, Linden said.\nCNN\u2019s Rachel Ramirez contributed to this report",

        "Summary": "An expert in medication abortion describes how mifepristone and misoprostol work and what to expect after using these medications known as the \"abortion pill.\"",
        "Content": "Mifepristone, one of two drugs used for medication abortions, can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor following the US Supreme Court rejection of a lawsuit challenging regulation of the abortion pill.\n\u201cWhile many women obtain medication abortion from a clinic or their OB-GYN, others obtain the pills on their own to self-induce or self-manage their abortion,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\u201cA growing body of research indicates that self-managed abortion is safe and effective,\u201d he said.\nMifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks\u2019 gestation, which is \u201c70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period,\u201d according to the US Food and Drug Administration.\nIn a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.\nTogether, the two drugs are commonly known as the \u201cabortion pill,\u201d which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.\n\u201cSome people do this because they cannot access a clinic \u2014 particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion \u2014 or because they have a preference for self-care,\u201d said Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a woman\u2019s health.\nWhat happens in a medication abortion\nWhat happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nCNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences?\nDr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation.\nAn injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, there\u2019s nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo.\nThe aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes. Then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding.\nA medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration.\nNausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain.\nIn fact, the pain of medication abortion can be quite intense. In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled.\nThe level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain.\nCNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion?\nGrossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed.\nSome people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts.\nAnother successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription.\nAnother study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. That\u2019s something people could get without a prescription.\nPain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, we\u2019re not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as we\u2019ve been doing more research on people\u2019s experiences with medication abortion, it\u2019s become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients.\nCNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise?\nGrossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. It\u2019s rare, happening in about 2 out of every 100 pregnancies \u2014 and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion.\nPeople who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization.\nIf a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of steroids is another contraindication for using the abortion pill.\nAnyone using an intrauterine device, or IUD, must have it removed before taking mifepristone because it may be partially expelled during the process, which can be painful.\nPeople with chronic adrenal failure or who have inherited a rare disorder called porphyria are not good candidates.\nCNN: Are there any signs of trouble a woman should watch for after undergoing a medication abortion?\nGrossman: It can be common to have a low-grade fever in the first few hours after taking misoprostol, the second drug in a medication abortion. If someone has a low-grade fever \u2014 100.4 degrees to 101 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 that lasts more than four hours, or has a high fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit after taking the medications, they do need to be evaluated by a health care provider.\nHeavy bleeding, which would be soaking two or more thick full-size pads an hour for two consecutive hours, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge should be evaluated as well.\nOne of the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy is severe pelvic pain, particularly on one side of the abdomen. The pain can also radiate to the back. Another sign is getting dizzy or fainting, which could indicate internal bleeding. These are all very rare complications, but it\u2019s wise to be on the lookout.\nWe usually recommend that someone having a medication abortion have someone with them during the first 24 hours after taking misoprostol or until the pregnancy has passed. Many people specifically choose to have a medication abortion because they can be surrounded by a partner, family or friends.\nMost people know that the abortion is complete because they stop feeling pregnant, and symptoms such as nausea and breast tenderness disappear, usually within a week of passing the pregnancy. A home urine pregnancy test may remain positive even four to five weeks after a successful medication abortion, just because it takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to disappear from the bloodstream.\nIf someone still feels pregnant, isn\u2019t sure if the pregnancy fully passed or has a positive pregnancy test five weeks after taking mifepristone, they need to be evaluated by a clinician.\nPeople should know that they can ovulate as soon as two weeks after a medication abortion. Most birth control options can be started immediately after a medication abortion.\nThis story was originally published in 2023 and has been updated.",

        "Summary": "No air conditioning? Here are 14 methods for cooling your body and buffering your house from the outside heat.",
        "Content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story was first published in 2020 and has been updated.\nWhether you\u2019re without power, enduring extreme heat or trying to save money, there are ways to feel comfortable without artificial cooling.\nHeat can foster fun summer activities, but the body shouldn\u2019t be too hot for too long, as too much heat can harm your brain and other organs, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Sweating is the body\u2019s natural cooling system, but when that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s increased risk for developing the heat-related illness hyperthermia \u2014 signs of which include heat cramps, heat edema and heat stroke. Heat combined with high humidity exacerbates this risk, since the air\u2019s saturation level makes sweat accumulate on the skin, preventing the body from cooling naturally.\nStaying cool can be done by using some basic supplies and knowing how to manipulate your home to control its temperatures. Here are 14 methods for doing so.\nStay hydrated\nWhen you\u2019re hot and flushed, hydrating yourself is the first and foremost step to cooling down, said Wendell Porter, a senior lecturer emeritus in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Florida.\nThe temperature of the water doesn\u2019t matter since your body will heat it, he added. If your body is suffering from the heat and needs to cool itself, it can\u2019t do that without enough moisture, since the body cools itself by sweating.\nTake a cold shower or bath\nTaking a cold shower or bath helps cool your body by lowering your core temperature, Porter said.\nFor an extra cool blast, try peppermint soap. The menthol in peppermint oil activates brain receptors that tell your body something you\u2019re eating or feeling is cold.\nUse cold washrags on your neck or wrists\nPlace a cold washrag or ice bags (packs) on your wrists or drape it around your neck to cool your body. These pulse points are areas where blood vessels are close to the skin, so you\u2019ll cool down more quickly.\nUse box fans\nPlace box fans facing out of the windows of rooms you\u2019re spending time in to blow out hot air and replace it with cold air inside.\nIf the weather in your area tends to fall between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the mornings and evenings, opening the windows on both sides of the house during those times can facilitate a cross-flow ventilation system. If you do this, you can opt to use or not use the fans, but the fans would help cool the house faster, Porter said. The outdoors can pull the hot air from your home, leaving a cooler temperature or bringing in the breeze. Just be sure to close windows as the sun comes out, then open them when the weather is cool again.\nJust resting near a fan would reduce your body temperature as well.\nClose your curtains or blinds\nIf you have windows that face the sun\u2019s direction in the morning through afternoon, close the curtains or blinds over them to \u201ckeep the sun from coming directly into the house and heating up (the) inside,\u201d Porter said.\nYou could also install blackout curtains to insulate the room and reduce temperature increases that would happen during the day.\nIf you do turn the air conditioning on, don\u2019t set it below 70 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to cool the house faster, said Samantha Hall, founder of Spaces Alive, an Australia-based design research company helping to create healthy, sustainable buildings.\n\u201cIt just runs for longer to reach that temp and will keep going until you start to feel a bit chilly and is then hard to balance,\u201d she added. Instead, keep the unit temperature as high as possible while still comfortable.\nSleep in breathable linens\nCotton is one of the most breathable materials, so cotton sheets or blankets could help keep you cool through the night.\nThe lower the thread count of the cotton, the more breathable it is, Porter said. That\u2019s because higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.\nSleep in the basement\nIf you can\u2019t sleep through the night because you\u2019re too hot, try sleeping somewhere besides your bedroom, if that\u2019s an option. Heat rises, so if you have a lower or basement level in your home, set up a temporary sleeping area there to experience cooler temperatures at night.\nDon\u2019t refrigerate or freeze blankets or clothing\nCommon advice for staying cool without air conditioning includes refrigerating or freezing wet socks, blankets or clothing then ringing them out to wear while you sleep. But this isn\u2019t a good idea, Porter said.\nBecause of \u201cthe amount of energy they can absorb from your body that night, they will be warm in just a matter of minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019d have damp stuff that would mold your mattress. So you definitely don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\nClose the doors of unused rooms\nIf no one\u2019s using a room that doesn\u2019t have vents or registers, close the door to that area to keep the cool air confined to only occupied areas of the house.\nUse the exhaust fan in your kitchen and/or bathroom\nFlip the switch for the exhaust fan in your kitchen to pull hot air that rises after you cook or in your bathroom to draw out steam after you shower.\nInstall energy-efficient light bulbs\nIncandescent light bulbs generate a higher temperature than LED light bulbs do. To make the switch, watch for sales on energy-efficient bulbs, then slowly replace the bulbs in your house, Porter said.\nSwitching light bulbs can save money but won\u2019t reduce a lot of heat in the home, Hall said. However, if you focus on switching the bulbs in areas you\u2019re sitting near, that would make a more noticeable difference, Porter said.\nCook in the morning, with a slow cooker or outside\nOven heat can spread throughout your house. Keep the heat centralized in one area, such as a slow cooker. Or, cook outdoors on a grill to keep the heat outside.\nEnjoy frozen treats\nEating an ice pop or ice cream to cool down may help for a moment. But don\u2019t go overboard on the sugar if you\u2019re overheated or at risk of being overheated, Porter said.\n\u201cSugar would run your metabolism up and you\u2019d start feeling internally hot,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the cool treat might be good, but the extra sugar might not.\u201d\nResearch what your state offers\nIf you\u2019ve tried everything and still can\u2019t beat the heat at home, you could look online for any local programs that are offering ductless air conditioners.\nDepending on your state, some cooling centers \u2014 air-conditioned public facilities where people might go for relief during extremely hot weather \u2014 may be open and taking precautions to ensure they\u2019re as safe as possible. You could start by checking with your local utility offices, as they would know who is offering certain programs, Porter recommended.\nREAD MORE: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

Our seven-part guide has tips to help you make more informed decisions around personal finance, career, wellness and personal connections.\nOnce a week, ADHD coach Robin Nordmeyer joins a Zoom meeting with other coaches while she writes blogs, does administrative tasks or works on content for presentations she has been putting off.\nNordmeyer, who has ADHD, isn\u2019t necessarily using the meeting to collaborate with others \u2014 she just needs their presence as a motivator to help her get things done.\n\u201cI run a business, and I have to balance lots of different areas of the business,\u201d said Nordmeyer, cofounder and managing director of the Center for Living Well with ADHD-Minnesota, an ADHD coaching group near Minneapolis serving all ages.\n\u201cSome of those things come very easy \u2014 like, they\u2019re in my wheelhouse, they energize me, I can\u2019t wait to get to them,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cAnd some of those things are a little more tedious, or I have some resistance around them.\u201d\nWhat Nordmeyer does to get through those tougher tasks is sometimes known as \u201cbody doubling,\u201d a productivity and self-help strategy that involves working with another person around to help improve motivation and focus. It has been popular for some time among people with ADHD \u2014 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \u2014 especially during the pandemic.\n\u201cThe idea is that the presence of another is essentially a gentle reminder to stay on task,\u201d said Billy Roberts, clinical director of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cFor folks (with) ADHD whose minds tend to wander and get off task, the body double somehow works as an external motivator to stay on task.\u201d\nBody doubling isn\u2019t just for people with ADHD, but like many \u201ccoping strategies, something that can be helpful for anybody is more central and important for folks with ADHD,\u201d said Dr. J. Russell Ramsay, founding codirector of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s ADHD Treatment and Research Program.\nWhy body doubling works\nA neurodevelopmental disorder commonly diagnosed in childhood but lasting into adulthood, ADHD stems from underdeveloped or impaired executive function and self-regulation skills, according to Harvard University\u2019s Center on the Developing Child. Those skills help us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions and multitask. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity \u2014 so people with this disorder might have trouble concentrating, staying organized, managing their time or controlling their impulses, which can affect both their work and personal lives, Roberts said.\nIf people with ADHD have no intrinsic interest in a task, Roberts said, they typically struggle with a lack of internal motivation to complete it or even to get started. Body doubling provides that motivation, experts said.\n\u201cIt also draws on our social selves,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cA lot of people with ADHD will say, \u2018I have a hard time getting started on this if I\u2019m doing it for myself, but if I know somebody else is relying on me, if somebody else is waiting outside for me to show up to go for our walk, I\u2019m more likely to go and be there because I don\u2019t want to let them down.\u2019\u201d\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be extensive research on body doubling for productivity, according to Roberts and other experts. \u201cBut I do know that the idea of externalizing motivation is a long-standing, evidence-based mechanism for managing ADHD,\u201d Roberts said.\nIn theory, the method is pretty straightforward, but there a few factors to keep in mind to make the most of it.\nHow to use body doubling effectively\nBody doubling can help with pretty much any task you\u2019re having a hard time getting done \u2014 whether that\u2019s work, chores, exercise, schoolwork or paperwork. The other person doesn\u2019t have to be doing the same thing as you, unless the activity you need body doubling for \u2014 such as exercising \u2014 requires that assistance.\nBe choosy about whom you ask to be your body double. The person should be as committed to you completing your work as you are, Roberts said \u2014 not distracting you with conversation or anything else. Choose someone who usually makes you feel comfortable and safe, and who can encourage you when necessary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep a body double session focused on its purpose,\u201d Nordmeyer said. If conversations do come up, table them for later, perhaps during a break or dinner.\nAsking someone to be your body double might feel awkward, but Roberts said the best approach is often a straightforward one. You could say, \u201cIt\u2019s something I heard can help with productivity. Would you mind just being around me while I work on this? Maybe you have something you could work on, too.\u201d\nYou could also barter with them, in a sense, by making an offer such as, \u201cYou help me organize my garage on Saturday; I\u2019ll help you organize your home office on Sunday,\u201d Ramsay said.\nThose small first steps of seeking a partner and setting up the session get you started and keep you going, he added.\nScheduling regular body doubling sessions is one option, Nordmeyer said, or just ask whenever the need arises. How transparent you are about why you need a body double is up to you, as is whether you have more than one body double.\n\u201cIt depends on the individual,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf it turns into a distraction more than mindfulness, accountability or behavioral support, then you just want to rework things. You can kind of tinker with things until you find what works.\u201d\nVirtual body doubling\nIf you don\u2019t have a friend or colleague to be your body double, you aren\u2019t out of luck.\nSome TikTok users, such as Allie K. Campbell, regularly go live while they\u2019re working so others can use them as a virtual body double. There are also body doubling or coworking platforms or apps such as Flown, Focusmate or Flow Club.\nIn virtual sessions, \u201cmost body doubles ask you to share your camera, and a lot of people are real nervous about being visible,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cThe purpose of that is to make sure you\u2019re still in your chair working. \u2026 But there might be other ways you can create that accountability through a chat feature.\u201d\nThe benefits of body doubling are likely why some people like working on things in coffee shops, libraries or coworking spaces \u2014 which can be sources of passive body doubling if you don\u2019t have someone to ask, Roberts said.\n\u201cSome people work better with community support and just the awareness of other people around them,\u201d he added. \u201cYou saw that a lot with the pandemic, like people learning more about the kinds of structure they needed.\n\u201cWe all think and work differently, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d Roberts said.",

        "Content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Ian Kerner is a licensed marriage and family therapist, writer and contributor on the topic of relationships for CNN. He is the author of a guide for couples, \u201cSo Tell Me About the Last Time You Had Sex.\u201d\nA lot of heterosexual male clients are coming into my practice admitting they picked their partner without considering sexual attraction.\nDuring couples therapy sessions with his partner in the room, the man will claim that he doesn\u2019t know why he isn\u2019t experiencing desire. Maybe it\u2019s stress, low testosterone or feeling anxious.\nBut when I meet with him individually, he often tells a different story. He tells me he picked his partner without prioritizing sexual attraction.\nWhy would a person pick a potential life partner without feeling the spark of sexual attraction? And can these relationships survive and thrive? Can something like sexual attraction that wasn\u2019t there in the first place be cultivated later?\nI\u2019ve talked with many men in their 30s who have told me, \u201cWhen I found the woman I wanted to marry, she checked all the boxes. Except one.\u201d\nCharacteristics on that list include \u201cbeing my best friend,\u201d \u201cwill make an amazing mother,\u201d \u201cour friends and families get along so well,\u201d and \u201cshe really loves me.\u201d The one box that didn\u2019t get ticked? Sexual attraction \u2014 and often the men didn\u2019t even list that quality to start.\nI was stunned.\nSexuality is the one thing that really distinguishes a romantic relationship from a platonic one: I find that it\u2019s one kind of \u201crelationship glue\u201d that helps couples stay together through hard times. That\u2019s why I\u2019m puzzled that so many people devalue sex in picking a partner for a long-term relationship.\n\u201cResearch shows that, while physical attractiveness is usually among the most important traits people desire in a romantic partner, it doesn\u2019t actually top the list for men or women,\u201d said Dr. Justin Lehmiller, a research fellow at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, a research center dedicated to sexuality. \u201cTraits like intelligence, humor, honesty and kindness are often at least as important, if not more.\u201d\nSome men have internalized an \u201ceither/or\u201d view of women: those who make great wives and mothers and those who are sexually adventurous, according to Chicago-based sex therapist Dr. Elizabeth Perri.\n\u201cI\u2019ve observed this in male patients who are out in the dating world and feel the pressure to pick someone whom they perceive as \u2018wife material\u2019 but without sexual attraction, rather than waiting to find a partner who is a better fit both emotionally and sexually,\u201d Perri told me.\nHow important is sexual attraction in a relationship?\nGood sex can help protect against psychological distress, including anxiety and depression, helps couples achieve a deeper connection, and improves relationship satisfaction.\n\u201cIf a relationship is a meal, the sexual portion ought to be considered an integral part of it, such as the protein, instead of a frivolous part like dessert,\u201d says Eva Dillon, a sex therapist based in New York City.\n\u201cIn my experience, it\u2019s possible for women to cultivate desire for a partner with considerable effort, but if a man does not have desire for his partner at the beginning of a relationship, he will never desire her,\u201d Dillon told me. Why count on sexual attraction coming later when you can prioritize it in a partner and enjoy the benefits from the beginning?\u201d\nStill, lower levels of sexual attraction aren\u2019t always a problem for couples, said sexologist Dr. Yvonne Fulbright.\n\u201cFor some people, a lack of sexual attraction can lead to infidelity or divorce. For others, a lack of sexual attraction only becomes a problem when one tunes into societal expectations around sex and desire,\u201d said Fulbright, who is an adjunct professorial lecturer in the department of sociology at American University in Washington, DC.\n\u201cA lot of pressure is being put on couples to maintain active sex lives, and hot ones at that. People have the sense that there\u2019s a type and quality of desire that needs to be achieved, with any disinterest in such considered a problem that needs to be solved.\u201d\nSome of my therapist colleagues caution against putting too much emphasis on the importance of immediate sexual attraction.\n\u201cWe have this misconception that we must be physically attracted to someone when we first meet or there is no relationship potential. That\u2019s just not true,\u201d said sex therapist Dr. Rachel Needle. \u201cAttraction can grow as you get to know someone and experience increased closeness and connection.\u201d\nHow to bring the spark back in a relationship\nWhat should you do if you and your partner are running out of sexual steam? Or if you want to turn up the heat on a relationship that didn\u2019t have any to start with?\nFulbright cautioned against giving any sweeping advice. \u201cOnly partners can figure out the best way to manage this challenge in their relationship,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNon-monogamy may work for some, but not others. Couples need to decide how honest to be with each other, how much this matter is a dealbreaker in staying together versus not, and how much weight should be given to this issue in light of other good things they have going for them,\u201d she added via email.\nDon\u2019t feel that all is lost if you\u2019re in a long-term relationship. For some couples, sexual desire can grow over time if they focus on it. \u201cIt often isn\u2019t until our 30s that we get comfortable enough to ask for what we want in bed,\u201d Dillon said.\nBut I refuse to agree with anyone who thinks that married couples will stop having sex anyway so why bother prioritizing sexual attraction.\n\u201cMany couples in their 50s can explore and expand their sexuality thanks to maturity and empty nests. For couples in their 60s, 70s and beyond who are able to expand their definition of sex beyond orgasm and co-create intimacy, sex can continue to be vibrant and rich,\u201d Dillon added via email.\nAnd keep in mind, your sexual health is a barometer of your overall health. So if you really are experiencing an inexplicable drop in sexual interest, consider talking to your medical provider. Maybe your testosterone levels really have fallen.\nWhatever the source of your lack of sexual interest, just be up-front with your partner. Honesty, as it turns out, can be a turn-on (eventually).\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Stress, But Less newsletter.

        "Content": "America is great because of its willingness to accept talented immigrants.\nThat's what Nandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys Technologies, would tell President Trump if he had the opportunity.\n\"If you really want to keep the U.S. ... globally competitive, you should be open to overseas talent,\" Nilekani said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.\nInfosys (INFY) is India's second-largest outsourcing firm, and a major recipient of U.S. H-1B visas. The documents allow the tech firm to employ a huge number of Indians in U.S. jobs.\nThe Trump administration is now considering significant changes to the visa program. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in January that Trump will continue to talk about reforming the H-1B program, among others, as part of a larger push for immigration reform.\nCurbs on the visas could hit Indian workers hardest.\nIndia is the top source of high-skilled labor for the U.S. tech industry. According to U.S. government data, 70% of the hugely popular H-1B visas go to Indians.\nShares in several Indian tech companies -- including Infosys -- plunged spectacularly two weeks ago amid reports of an impending work visa crackdown.\nRelated: Tech industry braces for Trump's visa reform\nNilekani said it would be a mistake for the administration to follow through.\n\"Indian companies have done a great deal to help U.S. companies become more competitive, and I think that should continue,\" Nilekani said. \"If you look at the Silicon Valley ... most of the companies have an immigrant founder.\"\nIndia's contribution to the industry -- especially at top levels -- has been outsized. The current CEOs of Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), for example, were both born in India.\nRelated: India freaks out over U.S. plans to change high-skilled visas\nBut Nilekani, who is also the architect of India's ambitious biometric ID program, suggested that India would ultimately benefit from any new restrictions put in place under Trump's \"America First\" plan. If talented engineers can't go to the U.S., they will stay in India.\n\"This issue of visas has always come up in the U.S. every few years, especially during election season,\" he said. \"It's actually accelerated the development work [in India], because ... people are investing more to do the work here.\"\nNilekani cited his own projects for the Indian government as an example.\nThe Bangalore-born entrepreneur left Infosys in 2009 to run India's massive social security program, which is known as Aadhaar. As a result of the initiative, the vast majority of India's 1.3 billion citizens now have a biometric ID number that allows them to receive government services, execute bank transactions and even make biometric payments.\n\"It was built by extremely talented and committed Indians,\" Nilekani said. \"Many of them had global experience, but they brought that talent and experience to solve India's problems.\"\nNilekani said the country's massive youth population is increasingly choosing to stay home and pitch in.\n\"It's India first,\" he said.",

        "Summary": "The price of crude oil has more than doubled over the past year after bottoming out at $26 per barrel in February 2016.",
        "Content": "It's a good day for OPEC.\nData published Monday by the oil cartel show its members have largely complied with an agreement to slash production.\nThe confirmation caps a remarkable year for OPEC, which was forced to devise a plan to boost prices after they fell to $26 per barrel in February 2016.\nThe price collapse -- to levels not seen since 2003 -- was caused by months of growing oversupply, slowing demand from China and a decision by Western powers to lift Iran's nuclear sanctions.\nSince then, the market has mounted a stunning turnaround, with crude prices doubling to trade at $53.50 per barrel.\nHere's how major oil producers worked together to push prices higher:\nOPEC deal\nOPEC agreed major production cuts in November, hoping to tame the global oil oversupply and support prices.\nThe news of the deal immediately boosted prices by 9%.\nInvestors cheered even more after several non-OPEC producers, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, joined the effort to restrain supply.\nCrucially, the deal has stuck. The OPEC report published Monday showed that its members have -- for the most part -- fulfilled their pledges to slash production. The International Energy Agency agrees: It estimated OPEC compliance for January at 90%.\nUAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told CNNMoney on Monday that the results were even better than he had expected.\nThe production cuts total 1.8 million barrels per day and are scheduled to run for six months.\nRelated: OPEC has pulled off one of its 'deepest' production cuts\nInvestors upbeat\nThe OPEC deal took months to negotiate, and investors really, really like it. The number of hedge funds and other institutional investors that are betting on higher prices hit a record in January, according to OPEC.\nThe widespread optimism is helping to fuel price increases.\nHigher demand\nThe latest data from OPEC and the IEA show that global demand for oil was higher than expected in 2016, thanks to stronger economic growth, higher vehicle sales and colder than expected weather in the final quarter of the year.\nDemand is set to grow further in 2017 to an average of 95.8 million barrels a day, compared 94.6 million barrels per day in 2016.\nThe IEA said that if OPEC sticks to its agreement, the global oil glut that has plagued markets for three years will finally disappear in 2017.\nSaudi oil minister: I don't lose sleep over shale\nWhat's next?\nDespite the stunning growth, analysts caution that prices may not go much higher.\nThat's because higher oil prices are likely to lure American shale producers back into the market. The total number of active oil rigs in the U.S. stood at 591 last week, according to data from Baker Hughes. That's 152 more than a year ago.\nU.S. crude stockpiles swelled in January to nearly 200 million barrels above their five-year average, according to the OPEC report.\n\"This vast increase in inventories is a result of a strong supply response from the U.S. shale producers, who were not involved in the OPEC agreement and who have instead been using the resultant price rally to increase output,\" said Fiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index.\nMore supply could once again put OPEC under pressure.",

        "Content": "Uber's top rival in India has some unsolicited advice for the U.S. startup: Go local.\n\"They have a very cookie-cutter approach in terms of what the model is and how [to] force feed it into any geography,\" Pranay Jivrajka, a top executive at Ola Cabs, said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.\nJivrajka, who until recently served as Ola's COO, said that Uber should ditch its one-size-fits-all approach and instead try to understand \"local nuances\" that would help it to identify services that \"users and drivers actually want.\"\nUber declined to comment on Jivrajka's remarks.\nUber and Ola have for years waged a bitter battle for supremacy in India, a market with 1.3 billion potential customers. The country has taken on increased significance for Uber after a series of recent setbacks elsewhere in Asia.\nThe San Francisco-based company suspended its operations in Taiwan last week, six months after it sold its operations in China to local rival Didi Chuxing. Didi, which is taking the fight to Uber in key foreign markets, is one of Ola's investors.\nIn India, Uber has often found itself playing catch-up with its Bangalore-based rival. Its most recent local product offering -- allowing Indian users to book a car for an entire day -- is already offered by Ola in 85 cities.\nOla also lets users book one of India's ubiquitous three-wheeled auto rickshaws, a service Uber started but then discontinued in 2015.\n\"What has helped us is having an ear to the ground in terms of understanding what the users want,\" said Jivrajka.\nRelated: Uber's rivals are teaming up in Asia\nUber CEO Travis Kalanick insists that his company is not prepared to leave India.\n\"We are losing, but we see a path towards profitability,\" Kalanick said during a December visit to Delhi. \"We see ourselves being here in the long run.\"\nRelated: Uber suspends its service in Taiwan as fines mount\nIndia isn't always a straightforward market for either company -- tens of thousands of drivers representing both Uber and Ola went on strike in Delhi this week, demanding better pay and benefits. The Delhi government has offered to mediate the dispute.\nJivrajka did not comment on the protests, but said that Ola's main focus remains bringing more drivers onto its platform.\n\"We need more drivers because the pace at which demand is increasing is way higher than the way supply is getting aggregated,\" he said.\nRelated: Uber CEO drops out of Trump's business advisory council\nJivrajka also had some advice for another Silicon Valley giant hoping to enter India: electric automaker Tesla.\n\"There are no rules on the Indian roads,\" Jivrajka said. \"One thing a lot of people say is that if you can drive in India, you can drive anywhere.\"\n-- Manveena Suri contributed reporting",

        "Content": "At his pediatrics practice in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Dr. Alaa Al Nofal sees up to 10 patients a day. He's known some of them since they were born. Others, he still treats after they've graduated from high school.\n\"I treat these children for Type 1 diabetes, thyroid problems, thyroid cancer, puberty disorders and adrenal gland diseases,\" he said.\nAl Nofal's expertise is critical. He is one of just five full-time pediatric endocrinologists in a 150,000 square-mile area that covers both South and North Dakota.\nLike most of rural America, it's a region plagued by a shortage of doctors.\n\"We're very lucky to have Dr. Al Nofal here. We can't afford to lose someone with his specialization,\" said Cindy Morrison, chief marketing officer for Sanford Health, a non-profit health care system based in Sioux Falls that runs 300 hospitals and clinics in predominantly rural communities.\nRelated: Visa ban could make doctor shortage in rural America even worse\nYet, Sanford Health may lose Al Nofal and several other doctors who are crucial to its health care network.\nA Syrian citizen, Al Nofal is in Sioux Falls through a special workforce development program called the Conrad 30 visa waiver -- which basically waives the requirement that doctors who complete their residency on a J-1 exchange visitor visa must return to their country of origin for two years before applying for another American visa. The Conrad 30 waiver allows him to stay in the U.S. for a maximum of three years as long as he commits to practicing in an area where there is a doctor shortage.\nAfter President Donald Trump issued a temporary immigration ban restricting people from seven Muslim-majority countries -- including Syria -- from entering the U.S., Al Nofal is unsure about his future in America.\n\"We agree that something more has to be done to protect the country, but this executive order will have a negative effect on physicians from these countries who are badly needed across America,\" said Al Nofal. \"They may no longer want to practice in the United States.\" The action is currently in legal limbo after a federal appeals court temporarily halted the ban.\nRelated: Trump furious after court upholds block on travel ban\nOver the last 15 years, the Conrad 30 visa waiver has funneled 15,000 foreign physicians into underserved communities.\nSanford Health has 75 physicians in total on these visa waivers and seven are from the countries listed in the executive order. \"If we lost Dr. Al Nofal and our other J-1 physicians, we would be unable to fill critical gaps in access to health care for rural families,\" said Sanford Health's Morrison.\nAnd the ban could hurt the pipeline of new doctors, too. The Conrad 30 visa waiver program is fed by medical school graduates holding J-1 non-immigrant visas who have completed their residencies in the U.S.\nMore than 6,000 medical trainees from foreign countries enroll every year in U.S. residency programs through J-1 visas. About 1,000 of these trainees are from countries caught up in the ban, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges. J-1 visa holders who were out of the country when the ban went into effect were prohibited from entering the U.S. and unable to start or finish school as long as the ban is in place.\nThe State Department told CNNMoney that the government may issue J-1 visas to people who are from one of the blocked countries if it is of \"national interest,\" but would not confirm whether a doctor shortage would qualify for such consideration.\n\"The stress and concern generated by the short-term executive order could have long-term implications, with fewer physicians choosing training programs in the states and subsequently magnifying the deficit in providers willing to practice in underserved and rural areas,\" said Dr. Larry Dial, vice dean for clinical affairs at Marshall University's school of medicine in Huntington, West Virginia.\nRelated: Obamacare's impact on this Alaska town with only one doctor's office\nAl Nofal went to medical school in Damascus, Syria's capital, and completed his residency at the University of Texas on a J-1 visa. He proceeded to a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic and then applied for a J-1 waiver, which placed him in Sioux Falls.\nNineteen months into his three-year commitment, Al Nofal is either directly treating or serving as a consulting physician to more than 400 pediatric patients a month on average.\nHe sees most of his patients at the Sanford Children's Specialty Clinic in Sioux Falls, where families often drive hours for an appointment. Once a month, he flies in a small plane to see patients in a clinic in Aberdeen, about 200 miles away.\n\"It's not easy being a doctor in this setting,\" said Al Nofal, citing the long hours and South Dakota's famously frigid winters. \"But as a physician, I'm trained to help people whatever the circumstances and I'm proud of it.\"\nIt's one of the reasons why Al Nofal and his American wife Alyssa have struggled to come to terms with the visa ban.\n\"I have a 10-month old baby and I can't travel to Syria now. My family in Syria can't come here,\" he said. \"Now my family can't meet their first grandson.\"\n\"I know if we leave I probably can never come back,\" he said. Neither does he want to travel anywhere in the country right now. \"I'm afraid of how I will be treated,\" he said. He's also afraid he will be stopped at the airport -- even if he's traveling to another state.\nRelated: Trump travel ban and what you need to know\nAlmatmed Abdelsalam, who's from Benghazi, Libya, had planned to start practicing as a family physician in Macon, Georgia, through the visa waiver program after he completed his residency at the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine in July.\nEverything was going smoothly. Abdelsalam, who treats hospital patients and veterans, applied for the visa waiver and was accepted. He signed an employment contract with Magna Care, which provides physicians to three hospitals in the Macon area and he had started looking at houses to relocate himself, his wife and their two young kids over the summer.\nBut there was one last step. For his J-1 waiver application to be fully completed, it needs to get final approval from the State Department and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\"The executive order came in the middle of that process, stalling my application at the State Department,\" he said.\nBecause he's a Libyan citizen (Libya is also subject to the visa ban), Abdelsalam is fearful of the outcome.\n\"The hospital in Macon urgently needs doctors. Even though they've hired me, I'm not sure how long they can wait for me,\" he said.\n\"No one can argue it's necessary to keep the country safe, but we should also keep the country healthy,\" he said. \"Doctors like me, trained in the U.S. at some of the best schools, are an asset not a liability.\"",

        "Content": "Beth Ford\u2019s first job paid $2 an hour. Early in the morning, she climbed on the school bus to go detassel corn, joining other kids in Sioux City, Iowa, who did it as a summer job.\n\u201cBack then, two dollars an hour, that was real money,\u201d Ford tells CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow in the latest episode of Boss Files.\nNow, as the first female CEO of Land O\u2019Lakes \u2014 and the first openly gay female CEO in the Fortune 500 list of largest US companies \u2014 Ford remembers a conversation with her mother years ago that taught her that \u201cwhile we may not have everything, we have enough, and given what we have, much was expected of us.\u201d\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Do you understand what is expected of you? Do you understand how much you have? Don\u2019t disappoint,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018I\u2019ve gotta work hard to not disappoint,\u2019\u201d Ford says.\nFord has a vision for Land O\u2019Lakes. She wants to transform people\u2019s perceptions of the butter and cream company and refocus attention on the efforts it\u2019s making in the ag-tech space.\n\u201cMy vision is to continue to invest in technology,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to have agility. E-commerce and e-business and technology is disrupting all industries, including agriculture, and there\u2019s an opportunity when you have an insight-driven, technology-focused company, as I believe Land O\u2019 Lakes is.\u201d\nThe future of Land O\u2019Lakes\nIn July, the United States slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move China called the beginning of \u201cthe biggest trade war in economic history.\u201d In response, China imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of US exports, including cotton, dairy and soybeans.\n\u201cGrain farmers, growers, and producers across the US are all affected by the uncertainty churning around trade negotiations and retaliatory tariffs,\u201d Ford says. \u201cExport market access is critical to these farmers and the agriculture industry and we\u2019re seeing a slowdown due to uncertainty in the trade environment.\u201d\nFord says she\u2019s spoken with soybean farmers and others concerned with the tariff politics.\n\u201cWhat I would tell you is that our farmer members are supportive in understanding that the administration is trying to do something on intellectual property theft,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want to make sure that they have appropriate trade agreements, and I think that they\u2019re supportive.\u201d\nMore than anything else, she says, these farmers need resolution and clarity \u2014 quickly.\n\u201cTime is critical,\u201d she says. \u201cSo then what\u2019s the most important thing the administration can do? They can move with speed and resolve these trade issues and resolve those tariff issues.\u201d\nBeing a first\nWhen the announcement about Ford\u2019s promotion to CEO went out, the press release celebrated her achievements, but it made no special mention of an important \u201cfirst\u201d in Fortune 500 history.\nWith Ford\u2019s promotion, she became the first openly gay female CEO to lead a Fortune 500 company.\nIn the months since, she\u2019s heard from people about how much that \u201cfirst\u201d has meant to them.\n\u201cPeople have come up to me and said, \u2018Thank you,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just the LGBTQ community, it is just people in their normal life saying, \u2018Thank you for being your authentic self and encouraging others to do that.\u2019\u201d\nFord says she\u2019s never faced discrimination in her career, but she\u2019s definitely considered its potential impact on herself and her family.\n\u201cI had made deliberate decisions for some places where I felt as though it may not be as friendly,\u201d she says. \u201cI said, \u2018The job looks great. You\u2019re a wonderful leader. I can\u2019t be here because I don\u2019t think this will be great. My spouse is a woman, and I have a daughter.\u201d\nThinking about the dwindling percentage of female CEOs in the Fortune 500, she says progress can\u2019t be truly made until the overall number of women leaders increases \u2014 something that she sees as \u201ca shared responsibility\u201d for management teams and their talent development programs.\nOn that path to the C-suite, she calls back to an important lesson, yet again from her mother: \u201cBeth, if you want something, ask for it.\u201d\n\u201cYou expect you\u2019re going to be recognized because you\u2019ve done the hard work, and that isn\u2019t actually how it always happens,\u201d Ford says.",

        "Content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story originally published on September 30, 2018.\n1. Back to business: The SEC is off Elon Musk\u2019s back. Now he and Tesla can return to that other pesky problem \u2014 making and selling cars.\nTesla will turn in a critical production report on Tuesday that will show investors whether the company can sustain and surpass its long-promised target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week.\nThat report will go a long way toward determining whether Tesla (TSLA) can fulfill Musk\u2019s pledge to turn a profit in the third and fourth quarters.\nSince it went public, Tesla has recorded only two quarters in the black. It posted the largest loss in its history in the second quarter as it cranked up production to clear the 5,000 bar in the last week of June.\nThat seems like a long time ago. In early August, Musk sent the tweet that led to his tangle with regulators \u2014 a cryptic announcement that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share.\nThe SEC said he had no such thing, and sued Musk last week for misleading investors.\nUnder a settlement announced Saturday, Musk agreed to step aside as chairman for three years, and he and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million fines. Musk neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the settlement.\nThe SEC lawsuit may be behind him, but Tesla still has some serious IOUs coming up. A total of $2.7 billion of Tesla debt is due this year and next, according to Goldman Sachs.\nThat\u2019s one reason the production and profit targets are so important: Tesla needs the cash to pay down all that debt.\nThe markets have reflected investors\u2019 worry. Tesla bonds maturing in August 2025 traded at 84.5 cents on the dollar on Friday, close to a record low. And Tesla stock has fallen 31% from its high in the hours after the ill-fated tweet.\nThe stock may bounce back Monday, now that the uncertainty over Musk\u2019s future is removed. But Wall Street still wants something else \u2014 results.\n2. Jobs, jobs, jobs: Analysts expect another month of solid growth when the US Labor Department issues its September jobs report on Friday.\nMore important may be the wage growth figure: Will it hit 3% for the first time since April 2009? If so, will that unnerve investors worried about an overly aggressive Federal Reserve?\n3. Changing of the guard at Goldman: Lloyd Blankfein is ending his run as CEO of Goldman Sachs (GS) on Monday. He will be replaced by Goldman president \u2014 and part-time DJ \u2014 David Solomon.\nThe investment firm\u2019s stock is down more than 10% since beginning of the year. Solomon will need to deal with lower revenue from Goldman\u2019s trading desk, which collects client fees to buy and sell bonds, commodities and currencies.\n4. Earnings watch: It\u2019s a relatively slow week for corporate reports, but among the notable names turning in results are Pepsi (PEP), Stitch Fix, Bon-Ton and Costco.\nFor Pepsi, this will be the last earnings report under CEO Indra Nooyi, soon to be succeeded by the company\u2019s global operations chief, Ramon Laguarta. The stock could use a caffeine boost: It\u2019s down 7% this year.\n5. Rebooting business news: On Thursday, CNNMoney becomes the all-new CNN Business, covering the companies, personalities, and innovations driving business forward.\nThis new initiative will focus on the single biggest financial story of our generation: how technology is upending every corner of the global economy, forcing businesses, workers, and society itself to adapt rapidly, or be left behind.\n6. Coming this week:\nMonday \u2014 Stitch Fix and Wage Works earnings; David Solomon becomes Goldman Sachs CEO; Eurozone unemployment rate\nTuesday \u2014 PepsiCo earnings; US auto sales for September\nWednesday \u2014 Lennar earnings; ADP employment report\nThursday \u2014 Costco (COST) earnings; CNN Business launches\nFriday \u2014 US jobs report",

        "Content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story originally published on September 30, 2018.\n1. Back to business: The SEC is off Elon Musk\u2019s back. Now he and Tesla can return to that other pesky problem \u2014 making and selling cars.\nTesla will turn in a critical production report on Tuesday that will show investors whether the company can sustain and surpass its long-promised target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week.\nThat report will go a long way toward determining whether Tesla (TSLA) can fulfill Musk\u2019s pledge to turn a profit in the third and fourth quarters.\nSince it went public, Tesla has recorded only two quarters in the black. It posted the largest loss in its history in the second quarter as it cranked up production to clear the 5,000 bar in the last week of June.\nThat seems like a long time ago. In early August, Musk sent the tweet that led to his tangle with regulators \u2014 a cryptic announcement that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share.\nThe SEC said he had no such thing, and sued Musk last week for misleading investors.\nUnder a settlement announced Saturday, Musk agreed to step aside as chairman for three years, and he and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million fines. Musk neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the settlement.\nThe SEC lawsuit may be behind him, but Tesla still has some serious IOUs coming up. A total of $2.7 billion of Tesla debt is due this year and next, according to Goldman Sachs.\nThat\u2019s one reason the production and profit targets are so important: Tesla needs the cash to pay down all that debt.\nThe markets have reflected investors\u2019 worry. Tesla bonds maturing in August 2025 traded at 84.5 cents on the dollar on Friday, close to a record low. And Tesla stock has fallen 31% from its high in the hours after the ill-fated tweet.\nThe stock may bounce back Monday, now that the uncertainty over Musk\u2019s future is removed. But Wall Street still wants something else \u2014 results.\n2. Jobs, jobs, jobs: Analysts expect another month of solid growth when the US Labor Department issues its September jobs report on Friday.\nMore important may be the wage growth figure: Will it hit 3% for the first time since April 2009? If so, will that unnerve investors worried about an overly aggressive Federal Reserve?\n3. Changing of the guard at Goldman: Lloyd Blankfein is ending his run as CEO of Goldman Sachs (GS) on Monday. He will be replaced by Goldman president \u2014 and part-time DJ \u2014 David Solomon.\nThe investment firm\u2019s stock is down more than 10% since beginning of the year. Solomon will need to deal with lower revenue from Goldman\u2019s trading desk, which collects client fees to buy and sell bonds, commodities and currencies.\n4. Earnings watch: It\u2019s a relatively slow week for corporate reports, but among the notable names turning in results are Pepsi (PEP), Stitch Fix, Bon-Ton and Costco.\nFor Pepsi, this will be the last earnings report under CEO Indra Nooyi, soon to be succeeded by the company\u2019s global operations chief, Ramon Laguarta. The stock could use a caffeine boost: It\u2019s down 7% this year.\n5. Rebooting business news: On Thursday, CNNMoney becomes the all-new CNN Business, covering the companies, personalities, and innovations driving business forward.\nThis new initiative will focus on the single biggest financial story of our generation: how technology is upending every corner of the global economy, forcing businesses, workers, and society itself to adapt rapidly, or be left behind.\n6. Coming this week:\nMonday \u2014 Stitch Fix and Wage Works earnings; David Solomon becomes Goldman Sachs CEO; Eurozone unemployment rate\nTuesday \u2014 PepsiCo earnings; US auto sales for September\nWednesday \u2014 Lennar earnings; ADP employment report\nThursday \u2014 Costco (COST) earnings; CNN Business launches\nFriday \u2014 US jobs report",

        "Summary": "The implosion of Lehman Brothers -- and the mayhem it unleashed -- was the most terrifying moment for business and the US economy since the Great Depression.",
        "Content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story originally published on September 14, 2018.\nLegendary investment bank Lehman Brothers was on fire \u2014 and no one was coming to put it out.\nBank of America refused to rescue the 158-year-old Wall Street firm without support from Uncle Sam. The British government wouldn\u2019t let Barclays (BCS) buy Lehman Brothers and its toxic balance sheet. And Washington decided against another politically unpopular bailout.\nSo Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. At 1:45 a.m. on Monday, September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nWhat ensued was the largest and most complex bankruptcy in American history. But that doesn\u2019t do justice to the damage Lehman\u2019s demise caused the financial system. The implosion of Lehman Brothers \u2014 and the mayhem it unleashed \u2014 was the most terrifying moment for business and the US economy since the Great Depression.\n\u201cIt was the moment when the financial crisis fully burst upon us, when panic seized the markets,\u201d Phil Angelides, who led the official bipartisan inquiry into the 2008 meltdown, told CNN.\nLehman\u2019s failure shook Wall Street to its core. The Dow plummeted 504 points, the equivalent of 1,300 points today. Some $700 billion vanished from retirement plans and other investment funds. The panic that followed plunged the American economy into a severe downturn, now known as the Great Recession.\nToday, Lehman Brothers and its CEO Dick Fuld are the poster children for the reckless risk-taking that wrecked the economy.\nFrantic talks\nLehman\u2019s final days were marked by frantic last-minute negotiations over its fate.\nRight up until the end, everyone thought someone would rescue Lehman Brothers: Surely the firm wouldn\u2019t be allowed to fail. Bear Stearns, a smaller investment bank, had been saved just six months earlier by Washington and JPMorgan Chase.\nOn Wednesday, September 10, South Korea\u2019s Korean Development Bank dropped out of the running to be Lehman Brothers\u2019 white knight. The news \u2014 combined with Lehman\u2019s announcement of a record $3.9 billion quarterly loss \u2014 sent the bank\u2019s shares cratering 45%.\nWith South Korea out, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson called Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis to ask him to find a creative way to buy Lehman Brothers. Put on your \u201cimagination hat,\u201d Paulson urged Lewis.\nBut by Friday, September 12, Bank of America said it was bowing out unless the government was willing to help. Lehman was simply stuck with too many \u201cilliquid\u201d mortgage assets, and it couldn\u2019t sell them quickly enough to meet other obligations. Bank of America decided instead to buy the next investment bank in line to fail: Merrill Lynch.\n\u201cYou just didn\u2019t know what was going to happen when you got into work on Monday,\u201d said Brady Kim, who worked as an analyst on Lehman\u2019s trading desk. \u201cWere you going to be working for Barclays? Some Korean conglomerate?\u201d\nThe one option few saw coming was bankruptcy. \u201cThey\u2019re not just going to let the bank go under,\u201d Kim said.\n\u2018Not a penny\u2019\nThat Friday evening, Paulson ordered the heads of the big Wall Street firms to meet at the New York Fed\u2019s headquarters. They were told to come up with a private-sector solution to save Lehman.\nAmerican officials had little appetite for another bailout. They had just seized control of teetering mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the weekend before. Fed officials said Paulson made it clear there would be no government help this time, \u201cnot a penny.\u201d\nSaturday brought an apparent breakthrough for Lehman: Barclays agreed to buy Lehman \u2014 as long as Wall Street would take some assets off its hands. But the Barclays deal went up in smoke on Sunday when UK regulators balked at blessing the risky deal.\n\u201cImagine if I said yes to a British bank buying a very large American bank which \u2026 collapsed the following week,\u201d Alistair Darling, the UK\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer, later told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.\n\u2018It was pandemonium up there\u2019\nWith no buyers left, regulators pressured Lehman Brothers to file for bankruptcy on Sunday night, before trading opened in the morning.\nLehman\u2019s lawyers and executives left the New York Fed to inform the board that no rescue was coming.\n\u201cWe went back to the headquarters, and it was pandemonium up there,\u201d Harvey Miller, the bankruptcy counselor for Lehman Brothers, later told investigators.\nThe Fed rejected a last-minute Lehman plea for additional assistance from the central bank, leading to the early-morning bankruptcy.\nThe collapse shocked employees.\n\u201cI never thought the company would go out of business. It was terrible,\u201d said James Chico, who worked as an analyst in the back office at Lehman for more than two decades.\nTom Rogers was on his honeymoon in St. Lucia when the bank, his employer for seven years, went bust.\n\u201cI came back, and it was just mass chaos,\u201d said Rogers, who started as an intern at Lehman and moved up to senior analyst in the firm\u2019s reinsurance business.\n\u2018Cataclysmic proportions\u2019\nThe turmoil showed just how fragile and interconnected the entire system was. The situation was exacerbated by the near-collapse of AIG, the insurance behemoth. Regulators feared AIG\u2019s demise would bring down the whole system \u2014 so AIG was given a $182 billion bailout.\nFear and panic quickly spread through the financial system, causing credit markets to freeze. Even large and iconic industrial companies such as General Motors were unable to receive short-term funding.\n\u201cThe financial crisis reached cataclysmic proportions with the collapse of Lehman Brothers,\u201d the crisis inquiry commission concluded.\nFuld, who had infamously told shareholders in April 2008 that \u201cthe worst is behind us,\u201d emerged as one of the villains of the crisis. He steered Lehman right into the face of an epic storm.\nBetween 2000 and 2007, Lehman\u2019s assets had more than tripled to $691 billion. And its borrowing ratio, known as leverage, jumped to 40 times its shareholders\u2019 equity in the company. The firm had relatively little capital to protect against trouble.\nMadelyn Antoncic, Lehman\u2019s chief risk officer from 2004 to 2007, tried and failed to warn Fuld against taking on more mortgage risk.\n\u201cAt the senior level, they were trying to push so hard that the wheels started to come off,\u201d Antoncic told the commission.\nFor his part, Fuld told lawmakers in 2008 that the pain of Lehman\u2019s failure \u201cwill stay with me for the rest of my life.\u201d\nThe former Lehman Brothers boss, who made and lost a $1 billion fortune on Wall Street, has made few public appearances since the crisis. He did speak at a 2015 event where he admitted he would do some things differently.\n\u201cI missed the violence of the market and how it spread from one asset class to the next,\u201d Fuld said.\nWhere were the regulators?\nFuld doesn\u2019t deserve all the blame. The firm\u2019s demise underscored the wild risk-taking that regulators and CEOs had allowed to become rampant across Wall Street.\nConsider, for example, the 2000 deregulation of exotic financial instruments known as derivatives. Regulators had little window into how these trades linked banks to one another. When one bank failed, other financial institutions fell in a kind of domino effect.\nEven a month before Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy, officials at the Fed were still seeking information on the bank\u2019s 900,000 derivative contracts. And they were clueless about the risk posed by AIG\u2019s enormous book of derivatives.\n\u201cThe people charged with overseeing our financial system were flying blind as the crisis developed,\u201d Angelides said.\nOnly in 2010, with the passage of the sweeping Dodd-Frank financial reform law, were derivatives required to be bought and sold on exchanges.\nRegulators also failed to get Lehman Brothers to slow its headfirst dive into mortgages. The firm kept buying real estate assets well into the first quarter of 2008.\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Thrift Supervision didn\u2019t issue a report warning of Lehman\u2019s \u201coutsized bet\u201d on commercial real estate until two months before its collapse. The OTS was abolished by Dodd-Frank.\nLikewise, the SEC declined to call Lehman Brothers out for exceeding risk limits \u2014 even though the agency was aware.\n\u201cThe SEC\u2026knew of the firm\u2019s disregard of risk management,\u201d the commission said.\nLehman Brothers also got away with using accounting gimmicks to mask how much money it borrowed. Bart McDade, Lehman\u2019s president and chief operating officer, wrote in an email at the time that the accounting maneuvers are \u201canother drug we R on.\u201d\nShould Lehman have been saved?\nEconomists will debate for decades whether Washington should have rescued Lehman to prevent the chaos that followed. Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke maintains that regulators had no authority to lend to a failing Lehman.\n\u201cWe essentially had no choice and had to let it fail,\u201d Bernanke told the commission.\nBut others say Bernanke and Paulson should have realized that allowing Lehman to fail would deepen the crisis.\n\u201cOur regulatory system is made of humans \u2014 and humans make mistakes,\u201d said James Angel, a business professor at Georgetown University. \u201cThe Fed clearly could have done a better job of containing the damage.\u201d\nThe inconsistent response by Washington \u2014 deciding not to rescue Lehman after saving Bear and before helping AIG \u2014 \u201cadded to uncertainty and panic,\u201d the financial crisis inquiry concluded.\nCould it happen again?\nToday\u2019s financial system is safer thanks to the reforms put in place after 2008. Banks have bulked up on vast amounts of capital. Regulators are more vigilant.\nBut some worry about the risk of another downturn, even if it doesn\u2019t start with banks.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about now,\u201d said famed Yale professor Robert Schiller, pointing to \u201chighly priced\u201d stocks and rising home values.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already in for what could be a repeat of 2008,\u201d Shiller said. \u201cIt will look different this time, but there could be a decline in home prices and recession coming in.\u201d\nLet\u2019s hope the lessons from the last crisis haven\u2019t been forgotten.\nA Decade Later: It\u2019s been 10 years since the financial crisis rocked America\u2019s economy. In a special yearlong series, CNN will examine the causes of the crisis, how the country is still feeling its effects, and the lessons we have \u2014 and have not \u2014 learned.\nCNN\u2019s Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.",

        "Content": "The stock market appears to like the new trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico.\nStocks popped after all three countries agreed to an 11th hour deal to replace NAFTA.\nThe Dow rose 193 points, a gain of 0.7%. The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, and the Nasdaq lost 0.1%.\nThe reworked trade deal, announced late Sunday night, was reached after Canada agreed to give US dairy farmers greater access to the Canadian market.\nThe United States also agreed to make concessions on some automobile tariffs for cars and trucks built in Canada and Mexico as part of the agreement, which replaces NAFTA and will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\nShares in major automakers rose on the news. GM gained 1.6%, and Ford climbed 0.8%. Fiat Chrysler rose 2.7%.\nStill, some market experts said investors may be overreacting to the USMCA deal. That\u2019s because the United States still faces another major trade battle.\n\u201cWhile the U.S. has reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, growing trade conflict between China and the U.S. threatens economic growth in both countries,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorgan Funds, in a report Monday.\nEric Winograd, senior economist with AB, also thinks that China-US tension will not be resolved this easily.\n\u201cThe US relationship with China is much more complicated than its relationship with Canada. And of course the stakes are considerably higher when dealing with China\u2014the Chinese have leverage over the US that Canada simply doesn\u2019t have,\u201d Winograd wrote, referring to China\u2019s ownership of US Treasury debt as well as the fact that it\u2019s a much bigger market for US exports.\n\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t rule out an agreement being reached with China, but I don\u2019t think that the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement provides a template that can be used in discussions with the Chinese,\u201d Winograd added.\nOthers think that a US-China deal is inevitable, which makes the market\u2019s reaction to the USMCA agreement, a logical one.\n\u201cMany investors are betting there\u2019s room for a market friendly compromise after the US midterm elections in early November when the Chinese will have an incentive to deal to avoid the 25% tariff rate that kicks in on $200 billion in Chinese exports on January 1, 2019,\u201d wrote Alec Young, managing director of global markets research for FTSE Russell, in a report.\nOther market movers\nIt\u2019s not just the trade deal helping move the markets.\nThe surprise ouster of General Electric CEO John Flannery and a deal between Tesla and the SEC are also having a big effect.\nShares of GE jumped 7% following the news that Flannery, who had only been CEO since August 2017, is being replaced by Larry Culp, a former head of industrial conglomerate Danaher.\nCulp, who joined GE\u2019s board in April, faces a difficult task in getting GE back on track. GE also announced Monday that it was taking a charge tied to its struggling GE Power unit. The stock had fallen 35% so far this year prior to Monday\u2019s surge.\nGE\u2019s market value slipped below $100 billion last week for the first time in more than nine years. And the company was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in June after a more than 100-year stay in the iconic market barometer.\nTesla also rallied Monday after the electric car maker reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will require Elon Musk to step down as chairman but allow him to stay on as CEO.\nShares of Tesla climbed 17%. The stock plunged 14% Friday on the news that the SEC had filed a lawsuit accusing Musk of making \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d earlier this summer when he tweeted that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a deal to take Tesla private.\nAs part of Tesla\u2019s deal with the SEC, Musk did not admit to any wrongdoing. The company is also paying a $20 million fine.",

        "Content": "Companies headquartered in California can no longer have all-male boards.\nThat\u2019s according to a new law, enacted Sunday, which requires publicly traded firms in the state to place at least one woman on their board of directors by the end of 2019 \u2014 or face a penalty.\nIt also requires companies with five directors to add two women by the end of 2021, and companies with six or more directors to add at least three more women by the end of the same year.\nIt\u2019s the first such law on the books in the United States, though similar measures are common in European countries.\nThe measure was passed by California\u2019s state legislature last month. And it was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown on Sunday, along with a trove of other bills that look to \u201cprotect and support women, children and working families,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said in a release.\nA majority of companies in the S&P 500 have at least one woman on their boards, but only about a quarter have more than two, according to a study from PwC.\nCalifornia state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson told The Wall Street Journal last month when the legislation passed that \u201cone-fourth of California\u2019s publicly traded companies still do not have a single woman on their board, despite numerous independent studies that show companies with women on their board are more profitable and productive.\u201d\n\u201cWith women comprising over half the population and making over 70% of purchasing decisions, their insight is critical to discussions and decisions that affect corporate culture, actions and profitability,\u201d she told the outlet.\nSome see California\u2019s law as a crucial step toward establishing better parity in corporate leadership.\nBut setting quotas can be controversial, Vicki W. Kramer, lead author of the landmark 2006 study, \u201cCritical Mass on Corporate Boards,\u201d told CNN last month. Opponents argue that pressure from quotas will lead to unqualified female members and potential discrimination against male candidates.\nWhen quotas are not set, however, companies may fail to diversify their ranks. She points to more \u201caspirational\u201d legislation in other states, like in Pennsylvania, where a 2017 resolution urged both public and private companies to have a minimum of 30% women on their boards by 2020. But without teeth in the law, Kramer said, better numbers won\u2019t follow.\nKramer said California\u2019s legislation is weak compared to the laws in Norway and other European countries, which require a certain percentage of women on boards. For larger Norwegian companies, the legislation requires that women make up as much as 40% of the board.",

        "Summary": null,
        "Content": "One of the things that makes Warren Buffett a widely admired investor is his willingness to share how he does it. Buffett has been a student of the market since his first stock purchase more than 80 years ago. He shares mistakes made and lessons learned every year in his letter to Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) shareholders and at the annual shareholder meeting.\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\nInvestors also gain insights into his and his team's investments through Securities and Exchange Commission filings disclosing Berkshire's portfolio changes.\nBuffett first bought shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016 when it traded at a valuation too low to ignore. Buffett saw the powerful moat created by the iPhone, locking hundreds of millions of consumers into the Apple ecosystem, and Berkshire Hathaway poured tens of billions of dollars into the stock duringthe next couple of years. At one point, Apple accounted for more than half of Berkshire's marketable equity portfolio. After selling a significant chunk in 2024, it now accounts for 22% of the portfolio.\nAs mentioned, Apple benefits from a wide competitive moat thanks to the success of its iPhone. Apple's iPhone sales topped $200 billion in each of the past three years, and sales are on track to grow in 2025. The iPhone is the center of Apple's growing ecosystem of devices and services, helping the rest of the business grow.\nThe services segment is a particularly bright spot for Apple, currently boasting a $100 billion annual run rate. Apple's services are significantly higher margin sources of revenue than its devices. As one of the fastest-growing segments of the business, Apple's overall profit margins are expanding as a result. When combined with Apple's huge share repurchase program, Apple is capable of producing meaningful growth in earnings per share.\nApple faces some headwinds, though. First of all, it's in the crosshairs of the tariffs planned by the Trump administration. Its supply chain relies heavily on China and Taiwan. As a result, its costs could increase and it may have to pass those expenses on to consumers. That could dent its device sales.\nAdditionally, Apple has been slow to develop competitive artificial intelligence services. It risks losing customers looking for more AI integrated capabilities from their phones and services. Apple customers tend to be locked into the ecosystem, which helps minimize that risk.\nApple stock has fallen from its late-2024 all-time high, trading more than 20% below its peak. At its current price, the stock's valuation is about 28 times forward earnings. While Apple isn't the fast grower it once was, it holds a lot of potential to unlock value with AI services in the future while its iPhone and services businesses remain rock solid today. As such, it looks like a fair price to pay for the tech giant.\n2. American Express (16%)\nAmerican Express(NYSE: AXP) is a longtime holding for Buffett. He put about $1.3 billion into the stock in the 1990s and hasn't touched it since. Today, those shares are worth nearly $45 billion.\nAmex separates itself from other credit card companies by operating as both the card issuer and as the payments network. Most issuing banks partner with Visa or Mastercard to remit payments to vendors from customer accounts. Doing both allows Amex to exercise more control over the business and capture more of the economics of card payments. To that end, it's done extremely well, commanding higher interchange fees from businesses by attracting affluent households to its high-fee products.\nAmex has successfully raised the fees on its cards during the past few years. It reported an 18% year-over-year increase in net card fees during the first quarter, while its customers spent just 6% more compared to the first quarter of 2024. That said, the fees collected from processing payments is still its biggest source of revenue.\nDuring the past few years, Amex has shifted strategies to offer more credit products to customers. Its charge cards historically required customers to pay their full balance each month, but Amex now lets customers pay over time with interest. Its interest income grew quickly from 2021 through 2024, but slowed to just 11% growth in the first quarter. That's mostly due to the law of large numbers, as interest income now accounts for nearly a quarter of its revenue.\nAmex may be a bit more insulated from an economic slowdown compared to other banks and payment processors due to its focus on high-income households and lesser focus on interest income. As such, it's less susceptible to loan defaults. Amex trades for a significant premium relative to its most comparable competitor, Capital One Financial, but it arguably deserves a premium due to the strength of its customer base, its scale, and its ability to boost revenue through fee increases and more interest-bearing services.\n3. Coca-Cola (10%)\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is another stock Buffett bought more than 30 years ago and has no plans to sell anytime soon. His original $1.3 billion investment in the company (yes, the same amount he invested in Amex) is now worth about $29 billion. Not to mention, Coke's paid out more and more each year in dividends. Berkshire shareholders will collect roughly $816 million in dividends from Coca-Cola this year.\nThe appeal of the company is two-fold.\nFirst of all, it has one of the strongest global brands in history. The red Coca-Cola logo is known the world over transliterated into practically every language known to man. Its brand strength extends well beyond its flagship product, though, to include top-selling carbonated drinks, water, juice, and sports drinks. That gives it considerable pricing power, which it has used to help offset inflation in recent years.\nThe second factor is its huge scale, which has made it cost-effective to create localized supply chains for producing and packaging its products. That's come to the fore in recent months as global trade policies put pressure on other global companies. Coca-Cola has managed to avoid the impact of tariffs more than its competitors, enabling it to keep its costs down. During its first-quarter earnings call, management warned it's not immune to global trade dynamics, but it's better positioned than most businesses.\nBoth of those advantages helped Coke produce strong first-quarter results while reaffirming its forecast for the full year. Revenue grew 6% and earnings per share grew 1%. Those numbers might not seem impressive, but they look great compared to Coke's biggest rival PepsiCo, which saw revenue and earnings per share shrink in the first quarter.\nCoke's relative strength hasn't gone unnoticed. The stock price has climbed 15% year to date as of this writing, and the shares trade at 24 times forward earnings. That's higher than its historic average, but not outrageously so. With its strong position in the current economic environment, it might be worth paying a premium for Coca-Cola stock. You'll also collect a nice 2.8% dividend yield at the current price.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Content": "Investors want more than just a bit of bitcoin.\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs amassed inflows of nearly $9.6 billion from April 21 through May 27, according to data compiled by Morningstar Direct. With the price of the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency reaching all-time highs of more than $100,000 lately and the Trump administration championing digital assets, advisors might now want to expand their focus beyond just bitcoin.\n\u201cThe capitalization of the crypto space right now is more than $3 trillion. How can you ignore that?\u201d said Campbell Harver, Duke University professor and partner at Research Affiliates. \u201cIt\u2019d be like ignoring a couple of companies in the Magnificent Seven.\u201d\nREAD ALSO: Advisors Say $1,000 \u2018Trump Accounts\u2019 Won\u2019t Benefit Families Who Need Help Most and RIA Headcount, AUM Shattered Records in 2024\nBitcoin Blinders\nWhile spot Bitcoin ETFs have been seeing plenty of momentum lately, iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is the real winner. Over roughly the past five weeks, IBIT has taken in $8.7 billion, per Morningstar. That\u2019s about 80% of its total inflows year-to-date. Bitcoin and ETFs that track it may be a new corner of portfolios, but advisors are quickly growing more comfortable with it. \u201cMost of my clients have a 5-10% allocation to Bitcoin,\u201d said Mike Casey, founder of AE Advisors. \u201cSome are allocated significantly higher.\u201d\nBitcoin and IBIT are clearly the biggest players in the space, but advisors should have a wider view when considering crypto allocations, Harvey said, recommending wealth managers consider stablecoins \u2014 digital currencies pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar or gold. \u201cIn my vision of the future, almost all assets will be tokenized \u2014 stocks, debts, mortgages, all this stuff,\u201d he told Advisor Upside. \u201cWe\u2019re going in that direction, and stablecoins are the first step.\u201d\nBut of course, stay away from meme coins. \u201cThey have no fundamental value whatsoever,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThey\u2019re like trading cards.\u201d\nGolden Hour. Amidst the current economic uncertainty, some have begun viewing Bitcoin as a safe haven similar to gold, but that\u2019s still debated territory, given that their volatility profiles are drastically different, said Joy Yang, head of product management at MarketVector Indexes. \u201cGold is more of a slow and steady type of asset and has been quietly outperforming US equities over the past 20 years,\u201d she told Advisor Upside. \u201cBitcoin has done it, too, but in a much more rollercoaster type of movement.\u201d\nIn the same five-week span, Gold ETFs have experienced almost $2.8 billion in outflows, with State Street\u2019s SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) accounting for nearly all of that, according to Morningstar. The precious metal\u2019s price per ounce is down from an all-time high of $3,500 in late April. However, gold is still outperforming Bitcoin, up 28% YTD compared with Bitcoin\u2019s 12% as of Monday.",

        "Content": "(Corrects paragraph 14 to remove reference to Google and Amazon declining to comment. This line also appeared in an earlier version of this story.)\nBy Anna Tong and Krystal Hu\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Two years after the launch of ChatGPT, return on investment in generative AI has been elusive, but one area stands out: software development.\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\nSo-called code generation or \u201ccode-gen\u201d startups are commanding sky-high valuations as corporate boardrooms look to use AI to aid, and sometimes to replace, expensive human software engineers.\nCursor, a code generation startup based in San Francisco that can suggest and complete lines of code and write whole sections of code autonomously, raised $900 million at a $10 billion valuation in May from a who\u2019s who list of tech investors, including Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Accel.\nWindsurf, a Mountain View-based startup behind the popular AI coding tool Codeium, attracted the attention of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is now in talks to acquire the company for $3 billion, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nIts tool is known for translating plain English commands into code, sometimes called \u201cvibe coding,\u201d which allows people with no knowledge of computer languages to write software. OpenAI and Windsurf declined to comment on the acquisition.\n\u201cAI has automated all the repetitive, tedious work,\u201d said Scott Wu, CEO of code gen startup Cognition. \u201cThe software engineer\u2019s role has already changed dramatically. It\u2019s not about memorizing esoteric syntax anymore.\u201d\nFounders of code-gen startups and their investors believe they are in a land grab situation, with a shrinking window to gain a critical mass of users and establish their AI coding tool as the industry standard.\nBut because most are built on AI foundation models developed elsewhere, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepSeek, their costs per query are also growing, and none are yet profitable.\nThey\u2019re also at risk of being disrupted by Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, which all announced new code-gen products in May, and Anthropic is also working on one as well, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe rapid growth of these startups is coming despite competing on big tech's home turf. Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot, launched in 2021 and considered code-gen\u2019s dominant player, grew to over $500 million in revenue last year, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nMicrosoft declined to comment on GitHub Copilot\u2019s revenue. On Microsoft\u2019s earnings call in April, the company said the product has over 15 million users.\nLEARN TO CODE?\nAs AI revolutionizes the industry, many jobs - particularly entry-level coding positions that are more basic and involve repetition - may be eliminated.\nSignalfire, a VC firm that tracks tech hiring, found that new hires with less than a year of experience fell 24% in 2024, a drop it attributes to tasks once assigned to entry-level software engineers are now being fulfilled in part with AI.\nGoogle\u2019s CEO also said in April that \u201cwell over 30%\u201d of Google\u2019s code is now AI-generated, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last year the company had saved \u201cthe equivalent of 4,500 developer-years\u201d by using AI.\nIn May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at a conference that approximately 20 to 30% of their code is now AI-generated. The same month, the company announced layoffs of 6,000 workers globally, with over 40% of those being software developers in Microsoft\u2019s home state, Washington.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on creating AI that empowers developers to be more productive, creative, and save time,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said. \u201cThis means some roles will change with the revolution of AI, but human intelligence remains at the center of the software development life cycle.\u201d\nMOUNTING LOSSES\nSome \u201cvibe-coding\u201d platforms already boast substantial annualized revenues.\nCursor, with just 60 employees, went from zero to $100 million in recurring revenue by January 2025, less than two years since its launch. Windsurf, founded in 2021, launched its code generation product in November 2024 and is already bringing in $50 million in annualized revenue, according to a source familiar with the company.\nBut both startups operate with negative gross margins, meaning they spend more than they make, according to four investor sources familiar with their operations.\n\u201cThe prices people are paying for coding assistants are going to get more expensive,\u201d Quinn Slack, CEO at coding startup Sourcegraph, told Reuters.\nBoth Cursor and Windsurf are led by recent MIT graduates in their twenties, and exemplify the gold rush era of the AI startup scene. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen people working this hard since the first Internet boom,\u201d said Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, an investor in Anysphere, the company behind Cursor.\nWhat\u2019s less clear is whether the dozen or so code-gen companies will be able to hang on to their customers as big tech moves in.\n\u201cIn many cases, it's less about who's got the best technology -- it\u2019s about who is going to make the best use of that technology, and who's going to be able to sell their products better than others,\u201d said Scott Raney, managing director at Redpoint Ventures, whose firm invested in Sourcegraph and Poolside, a software development startup that\u2019s building its own AI foundation model.\nCUSTOM AI MODELS\nMost of the AI coding startups currently rely on the Claude AI model from Anthropic, which crossed $3 billion in annualized revenue in May in part due to fees paid by code-gen companies.\nBut some startups are attempting to build their own models. In May, Windsurf announced its first in-house AI models that are optimized for software engineering in a bid to control the user experience. Cursor has also hired a team of researchers to pre-train its own large frontier-level models, which could enable the company to not have to pay foundation model companies so much money, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\nStartups looking to train their own AI coding models face an uphill battle as it could easily cost millions to buy or rent the computing capacity needed to train a large language model.\nReplit earlier dropped plans to train its own model. Poolside, which has raised more than $600 million to make a coding-specific model, has announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services and is testing with customers, but hasn\u2019t made any product generally available yet.\nAnother code gen startup Magic Dev, which raised nearly $500 million since 2023, told investors a frontier-level coding model was coming in summer 2024 but hasn\u2019t yet launched a product.\nPoolside declined to comment. Magic Dev did not respond to a request for comment.\n(Reporting by Anna Tong and Krystal Hu in New York. Editing by Kenneth Li and Michael Learmonth)",

        "Content": "Trump administration revokes guidance requiring hospitals to provide emergency abortions\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it would revoke guidance to the nation's hospitals that directed them to provide emergency abortions for women when they are necessary to stabilize their medical condition.\nThat guidance was issued to hospitals in 2022, weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court upended national abortion rights in the U.S. It was an effort by the Biden administration to preserve abortion access for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies and needed an abortion to prevent organ loss or severe hemorrhaging, among other serious complications.\nThe Biden administration had argued that hospitals \u2014 including ones in states with near-total bans \u2014 needed to provide emergency abortions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. That law requires emergency rooms that receive Medicare dollars to provide an exam and stabilizing treatment for all patients. Nearly all emergency rooms in the U.S. rely on Medicare funds.\nThe Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it would no longer enforce that policy.\nThe move prompted concerns from some doctors and abortion rights advocates that women will not get emergency abortions in states with strict bans.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration would rather women die in emergency rooms than receive life-saving abortions,\u201d Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. \u201cIn pulling back guidance, this administration is feeding the fear and confusion that already exists at hospitals in every state where abortion is banned. Hospitals need more guidance, not less, to stop them from turning away patients experiencing pregnancy crises.\u201d\nAnti-abortion advocates, meanwhile, praised the announcement. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the Biden-era policy had been a way to expand abortion access in states where it was banned.\n\u201cDemocrats have created confusion on this fact to justify their extremely unpopular agenda for all-trimester abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cIn situations where every minute counts, their lies lead to delayed care and put women in needless, unacceptable danger.\u201d\nAn Associated Press investigation last year found that, even with the Biden administration\u2019s guidance, dozens of pregnant women were being turned away from emergency rooms, including some who needed emergency abortions.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which provides oversight of hospitals, said in a statement that it will continue to enforce the federal law that, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d\nBut CMS added that it would also \u201crectify any perceived legal confusion and instability created by the former administration's actions.\u201d\nThe Biden administration sued Idaho over its abortion law that initially only allowed abortions to save the life of the mother. The federal government had argued before the U.S. Supreme Court last year that Idaho's law was in conflict with the federal law, which requires stabilizing treatment that prevents a patient's condition from worsening.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court issued a procedural ruling in the case last year that left key questions unanswered about whether doctors in abortion-ban states can terminate pregnancies when a woman is at risk of serious infection, organ loss or hemorrhage.",

        "Content": "Cadets who met all Air Force Academy graduation standards denied commissions because they\u2019re transgender\nThey stood in formation at Falcon Stadium, diplomas in hand, having met every standard of physical endurance, academic excellence, and military discipline. But, on Thursday, when the time came for the U.S. Air Force Academy\u2019s class of 2025 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to commission as second lieutenants, three cadets were quietly held back.\nKeep up with the latest in LGBTQ+ news and politics. Sign up for The Advocate's email newsletter.\nThey are the first out transgender cadets to graduate from the Academy. And under a newly reinstated Trump administration ban, they will not be allowed to serve.\nOne of them, Hunter Marquez, had spent years preparing to become a combat systems officer. He earned dual degrees in aeronautical engineering and applied mathematics. He passed the Air Force\u2019s fitness standards for men. And he did so as himself, having transitioned while enrolled at the Academy. \u201cI really want to stay in for as long as possible, fight this out,\u201d Marquez told The Colorado Springs Gazette.\nBut the rules changed. On May 6, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to begin enforcing Executive Order 14183, which bans transgender people from military service. The unsigned order\u2014issued without full argument and over the dissent of the Court\u2019s three liberal justices\u2014overturned a Washington state lower court\u2019s preliminary injunction and gave the Pentagon the green light to begin separations.\nMarquez, along with the two other graduates, was placed on administrative absence, barred from taking the oath, and warned he might need to repay the cost of his education if he refused to leave voluntarily, the paper reports. That education\u2014funded by taxpayers\u2014is valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. According to The Gazette, Marquez was later told by Air Force officials that if he is involuntarily separated, he won\u2019t be billed. But the message was clear: his government does not want him in uniform.\nAnd yet, there is no question he met the standard. \u201cWe want warfighters. We want people with grit, that are resilient. They have done all that,\u201d a U.S. Air Force Academy staff member told The Gazette, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. All three cadets passed physical fitness tests for both men and women. All three graduated with distinction.\nWhat disqualifies them is not their performance but their identity.\nMarquez is a plaintiff in Talbott v. United States, one of the central legal challenges to the policy. In a sworn statement, he wrote that the executive order describes people like him as \u201cundisciplined, selfish, and dishonest.\u201d \u201cNone of those are correct descriptions of my character or my abilities,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have achieved alongside my peers throughout my time at the Academy.\u201d\nThe policy is not theoretical. It is personal. It has required cadets like Marquez to trek across dorms to find gender-compliant restrooms and showers. It has forced them to race through final semesters in case they\u2019re expelled before graduating. And it has turned what should have been a joyful week of ceremonies into a lesson in resilience.\nMarquez, now 23, is applying to the University of Colorado Boulder to earn an advanced degree in aerospace engineering. He is still receiving medical benefits and cadet pay, but he knows that may be temporary. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of anger and frustration and sadness,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because I have worked so hard to be a second lieutenant in the Air Force, and at the very end that was taken from me.\u201d\nAcademy alumni have responded with solidarity. Nearly 1,000 graduates have signed an open letter defending transgender cadets and midshipmen. \u201cBeing transgender is in no way incompatible with any of our Academies\u2019 cherished virtues and values,\u201d the letter reads, according to Military.com.",

        "Content": "Trump\u2019s Education Secretary Schooled in Reading and Math by Senators\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon would have received a failing grade for her answers to questions posed on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.\nThe cringeworthy moments came while she was being questioned by senators about the GOP spending bill.\nClose Trump ally Senator Markwayne Mullin asked McMahon about previous U.S. reading and math rankings.\n\u201cWhat was we ranked in reading and math in 1979?\u201d the senator asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry what?\u201d McMahon responded.\n\u201cWhat was we ranked national in math and reading in 1979?\u201d he repeated.\n\u201cWe were very very low on the totem pole,\u201d the education secretary declared.\n\u201cWe were number one in 1979,\u201d Mullin corrected her.\n\u201cOh, 1979, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d McMahon said, trying to recover, despite having had the question repeated twice.\n\u201cIn 1979 we were ranked number one around the world. Today in reading, we\u2019re ranked 36 and mathematics we\u2019re ranked 28,\u201d the senator told her. \u201cIt\u2019s not working. What we\u2019re doing is not working.\u201d\nThe top Trump official was put on the spot while testifying about the president\u2019s budget request for the department.\nWhile Trump and his allies have called for closing the Education Department, his budget request for the fiscal year is just over $66 billion. It includes a 15 percent reduction in spending, or a $12 billion cut, from the previous year.\nMore in Politics\nWhile Mullin\u2019s question was a flunking moment for the education secretary, he was actually using the information to thank her for pushing changes.\nHis argument was that the current situation was not working and throwing money at the problem hasn\u2019t fixed it.\n\u201cWe deserve better. Our kids deserve better. Our taxpayers deserve better, and we have to make changes,\u201d Mullin said.\nThe exchange came as Democrats largely blasted McMahon for the Trump administration\u2019s education budget on Tuesday and raised concerns over cutting staff without analysis of the impact and other school resources, such as counselors in schools.\nAnother awkward moment in the hearing came when Democratic Senator Jack Reed also schooled McMahon on some math when it came to education spending.\nThe education secretary was discussing the TRIO grant program to help people with low income and underprivileged backgrounds, and other programs, when she made a substantial math error.\n\u201cWe spend $1.58 billion a year on TRIO?\u201d Senator John Kennedy asked. McMahon confirmed it.\n\u201cHow long have we been spending one thousand five hundred and eighty million dollars a year on this program?\u201d he followed up. McMahon said she was not sure of the length of the program but confirmed spending for more than ten years.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s over $1 trillion we spent on this program,\u201d Kennedy said. That number was repeated multiple times as they went back and forth over how the money was used to help poor kids go to college.\nHowever, when it then became Reed\u2019s turn to grill McMahon, he took issue with the math.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a great mathematician, but I think you were talking about $1 trillion? I believe $1.5 billion times ten is $15 billion. That\u2019s a little bit off from $1 trillion.\u201d\n\u201cI think the budget cut\u2019s $1.2 billion for TRIO,\u201d the education secretary responded.\n\u201cWell, 1.2 that would be $12 billion, not $1 trillion,\u201d Reed pointed out.\n\u201cOk,\u201d McMahon responded.",

        "Content": "A New COVID Variant Is Spreading Quickly \u2014 These Are The Symptoms Doctors Are Warning About\nA new COVID variant known as NB.1.8.1 has made landfall in the United States. The variant, which was first detected in China this past January, currently accounts for 10% of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences tested from around the world, recent surveillance data found. That\u2019s a significant jump from 2.5% four weeks ago.\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson told HuffPost that the agency is in regular contact with international partners about the activity of NB.1.8.1. To date, only 20 NB.1.8.1 sequences have been identified in the US \u2014 that\u2019s below the threshold needed for a variant to appear on the agency\u2019s COVID dashboard. (As soon as its prevalence increases, NB.1.8.1 will pop up on the tracker, the spokesperson added.)\nIt\u2019s nerve-wracking to hear that a new variant is making the rounds, but infectious disease specialists say there are no glaring differences between the symptoms of NB.1.8.1 and those caused by other versions of SARS-CoV-2.\n\u201cCurrently, it appears that NB.1.8.1 would have similar symptoms to other COVID variants that have recently been circulating,\u201d Dr. Zachary Hoy, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Pediatrix Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee, told HuffPost.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the newest COVID variant that\u2019s gaining traction around the world.\nNB.1.8.1\u2019s mutations likely make it more transmissible.\nCompared to the currently dominant variant in the US (LP.8.1), NB.1.8.1 has a handful of new mutations on the spike protein that may enhance its ability to bind to our cells, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThe agency suspects these mutations will increase the virus\u2019s transmissibility and, potentially, diminish the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies that prevent pathogens from latching to our cells. In other words, the variant may be skilled at dodging some of our immune defenses, research suggests.\nHere are the signs and symptoms doctors are seeing with NB.1.8.1.\nAccording to Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, NB.1.8.1\u2019s symptoms are pretty much the same as those seen with other SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nTwo of COVID\u2019s hallmark symptoms are a mild but persistent dry cough and nasal congestion, Hoy said. Many people who come down with COVID are also hit with fatigue and tiredness. \u201cAn infected person can still make it through the day, but they are resting more and feel more tired throughout the day,\u201d Hoy said.\nMore in Health\nOther common symptoms include a fever, chills, a sore throat, and muscle aches. \u201cSome have described recent variants as less intense symptoms as compared to wintertime influenza viruses, but both can have severe symptoms,\u201d Hoy said.\nThere\u2019s no evidence suggesting the variant causes more severe disease or an uptick in hospitalizations or deaths, the WHO states. The only noticeable aspect, as of now, is that it\u2019s rising in prevalence, Adalja said.\nHow effective are the vaccines against NB.1.8.1?\nIt\u2019s too early to know exactly how effective the shots are \u2014 as the research on NB.1.8.1 is limited since it\u2019s so new \u2014 but scientists expect the shots to hold up well. NB.1.8.1 broke off from the Omicron JN.1 lineage, which the 2024-2025 vaccines target. \u201cThe ability of the vaccines to prevent severe illness is intact, though protection versus infection is limited and transient,\u201d Adalja said.\nAnyone who is at risk of severe disease should stay up-to-date with the shots. \u201cThose in older populations or with underlying immune disorders or on immune-decreasing medications would benefit more from vaccination, or those with increased exposure, such as healthcare workers,\u201d Hoy added.\nSo if you have a condition that puts you at risk, it\u2019s worth getting vaccinated if it\u2019s been more than six months since your last vaccine or bout of COVID, Adalja advises. He also added that those who are low-risk likely do not need to go out and get another shot.\nKnow when to treat NB.1.8.1 at home and when to go visit a doctor.\nMost people will be able to recover at home by resting and staying hydrated. While you\u2019re sick, acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help alleviate muscle aches and fevers, Hoy said. And, in most cases, symptoms should clear up within a week.\nFor those who are at risk for severe disease, including older adults and people who are immune-compromised, it\u2019s worth contacting a physician as they can prescribe antivirals \u2014 Paxlovid and Molnupiravir \u2014 that can significantly lower the risk of severe complications and death. As was the case with previous variants, these antivirals work best when started within five days of symptom onset.\nAs for when you should go to an urgent care or emergency room? When you have chest pain, have a hard time waking up or staying awake, or feel confused and disoriented, the CDC advises. Hoy says the most concerning symptom he warns patients about is difficulty breathing. \u201cIf you have COVID or COVID-like illness and have worsening trouble breathing or chest pain, you should be evaluated at your doctor\u2019s office, urgent care, or the ER,\u201d he said.\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.\nAlso in Goodful: 30 Absolutely Wild Medical Facts You've Probably Never Heard Of But Probably Should Hear\nAlso in Goodful: 25 Life-Changing Habits People Added To Their Everyday Routines To Improve Their Lives For The Better",

        "Content": "Trump administration seeks pause of second tariff case after loss\nBy Dietrich Knauth\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -The Trump administration on Monday asked a U.S. appeals court to pause a second court ruling that found the president had exceeded his authority by imposing sweeping tariffs on imports, saying the decision jeopardizes trade negotiations with other nations.\nTrump's tariffs were first declared illegal by the Manhattan-based U.S. Court of International Trade on May 28. A federal court in Washington, D.C. followed with a second ruling the next day, which also found that the tariffs exceeded the president's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law intended to address \"unusual and extraordinary\" threats during national emergencies.\nThe lawsuits which led to those rulings challenged Trump's use of the law to justify the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on imports imposed in early April on most U.S trading partners, as well as a separate set of tariffs levied on China, Mexico and Canada in February. The latter are related to his accusation that the three countries were facilitating the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., allegations the countries deny.\nThe Trump administration has already won a temporary pause of the first court loss, allowing it to reinstate tariffs during the early stages of the appeal. The court is expected to rule on the Trump administration's request for a longer-term pause later this month.\nThe second ruling, from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras had less immediate impact than the Court of International Trade ruling, because it only stopped the Trump administration from collecting tariffs from two small businesses that had sued whereas the trade court ruling blocked the tariffs that had been challenged broadly.\nBut it contained a more direct finding that IEEPA simply does not authorize tariffs, going further than the more nuanced ruling in the Court of International Trade.\nA blunt ruling that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs undercuts Trump\u2019s ability to use tariffs as a \u201ccredible threat\u201d in trade talks, the Department of Justice wrote in an emergency motion to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C Circuit, which has jurisdiction over the D.C. district court.\nFour senior Trump officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Lee Greer had submitted affidavits to Contreras before his May 29 ruling, saying that stopping the tariffs would threaten the United States\u2019 economic and national security by jeopardizing \u201cdelicate\u201d trade negotiations with dozens of other nations.\nThe small businesses that brought the lawsuit, educational toy makers Learning Resources Inc and hand2mind, said they would oppose the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to block the lower court ruling.\n(Reporting by Dietrich Knauth, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Deepa Babington)",

        "Content": "Morning earthquake hits Western Washington, seismologists say. Did you feel it?\nA 2.9-magnitude earthquake shook Western Washington on Tuesday, June 3, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.\nThe 5.4-mile deep quake hit about 2 miles from Mount Vernon at 1:59 a.m., according to the USGS.\nMore than 75 people from as far away as Bellingham and Everett reported feeling the tremor to the agency.\n\u201cFelt in lake Stevens but I thought was truck passing by. It was very faint,\u201d one person commented on Facebook.\n\u201cYep felt it in Bryant. Jolted my bed pretty good,\u201d another person commented.\n\u201cFelt in Victoria. Was looking outside at the time, and it made a loud noise that scared a raccoon away. Mostly just a jerking movement with a little shake,\u201d someone else wrote.\nMount Vernon is in Skagit County, and it has a population of about 35,000 as of 2024, according to the United States Census Bureau.\nWhat to know about earthquakes\nMagnitude measures the energy released at the source of the earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey says. It replaces the old Richter scale.\nQuakes between 2.5 and 5.4 magnitude are often felt but rarely cause much damage, according to Michigan Tech. Quakes below 2.5 magnitude are seldom felt by most people.\nEarthquakes\u2019 sudden, rapid shaking can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides or avalanches. They can happen anywhere, but they\u2019re most common in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Puerto Rico and Washington, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\nIf an earthquake strikes, it\u2019s best to protect yourself right away. Here are tips from experts:\nIf you\u2019re in a car: Pull over and stop. Set your parking brake.\nIf you\u2019re in bed: Turn face-down and cover your head with a pillow.\nIf you\u2019re outdoors: Stay away from buildings. Don\u2019t go inside.\nIf you\u2019re inside: Stay and don\u2019t run outdoors. Stay away from doorways.\nThe best way to protect yourself during an earthquake is to drop, cover and hold on, officials say.\n\u201cWherever you are, drop down to your hands and knees and hold onto something sturdy,\u201d officials say. \u201cIf you\u2019re using a wheelchair or walker with a seat, make sure your wheels are locked and remain seated until the shaking stops.\u201d\nBe sure to cover your head and neck with your arms, and crawl under a sturdy table if possible. If no shelter is available, crawl to an interior wall away from windows.\nOnce under a table, officials say you should hold on with one hand and be ready to move with it.\n\u201cThere can be serious hazards after an earthquake, such as damage to the building, leaking gas and water lines, or downed power lines,\u201d officials say. \u201cExpect aftershocks to follow the main shock of an earthquake.

Whether it\u2019s a celebratory dinner out with friends, grabbing fast food breakfast while rushing to work or simply a salty craving you couldn\u2019t ignore, most of us have indulged in a high-sodium meal (or a few).\nIs it ideal for your heart? Not exactly, and we know that. But when it comes to heart health overall, what you choose to do after that meal may matter even more.\n\ud83e\ude7aSIGN UP for tips to stay healthy & fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends & more delivered right to your inbox twice a week\ud83d\udc8a\nAs for what you should do? \"Generally, after eating a salty meal, you want to assist the body to help clear the salt out of your body by hydrating,\" Dr. Joyce Oen-Hsiao, MD, FACC, a cardiologist at Yale Medicine, tells Parade.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you should reach for just anything to drink\u2014especially not exactly what you might be craving after all that salt. In fact, experts say that\u2019s one of the worst things you can do.\nRelated: Worried About Salt and Your Blood Pressure? Here\u2019s What Cardiologists Want You To Know\nThe One Thing You Shouldn't Do After Eating a High-Sodium Meal\nWhat you really shouldn\u2019t do after a high-sodium meal? Drink a sugar-sweetened beverage, and for a few reasons. \"If you drink a high-sugar drink, it tends to lead you to urinate more, which can lead to dehydration,\" Dr. Oen-Hsiao explains. \"This diuretic effect is the opposite of what the body needs to deal with the high salt load.\"\nWhat's more, while salt and sugar may seem like opposites, your body processes them in surprisingly connected ways\u2014especially when it comes to your heart.\n\"The body\u2019s responses to sodium (salt) and glucose (sugar) are closely linked, and when consumed together, they can have synergistic effects on cardiovascular health,\" says Dr. Marschall Runge, MD, PhD, a cardiologist, CEO and dean at University of Michigan Medicine and executive vice president for medical affairs at the the University of Michigan.\nThat combination can spike blood pressure in the short term and contribute to chronic hypertension over time. It also raises inflammation and damages the inner lining of your blood vessels, which accelerates atherosclerosis, or the hardening of the arteries.\nEven worse? Salt makes your body hold onto water, which increases blood volume, Dr. Runge continues. Follow that with a sugary drink and you're basically doubling down: \"Drinking a high-sugar beverage triggers insulin release, which promotes even more sodium retention and further increases vascular stress,\" he explains. \"These effects are especially pronounced in people with a predisposition to hypertension or prediabetes, compounding their cardiovascular risk.\"\nRelated: 'I'm a Cardiologist, and This Is the One Surprising Food I Would Never, Ever Eat for Lunch'\nAre Artificially Sweetened Drinks Any Better?\nSo are sugar-free drinks any better? Technically, yes. \"Some artificially sweetened drinks still have carbohydrates in them, however, they do not break down into sugars, so they will be less likely to carry the same risk,\" says Dr. Oen-Hsiao.\nBut that doesn't mean you should switch to sugar-free everything. \"[Artificially sweetened drinks] still warrant caution,\" Dr. Lunge explains. \"Emerging research suggests that some artificial sweeteners may disrupt the gut microbiome, leading to impaired glucose metabolism and increasing the risk of prediabetes or diabetes over time.\" Plus, 2024 research found that artificial sweeteners are linked to a 20% higher risk of heart disease.\nBottom line? \"While artificially sweetened drinks are generally a safer choice than sugary beverages after a salty meal, plain water remains the best option,\" Dr. Runge says.\nRelated:Cardiologists Are Begging You Not to Make This One Mistake With Sodium Intake\nWhat You Should Do Instead\nDrink plenty of water\nThe best thing to do after eating a salty meal? \"Drink water,\" Dr. Oen-Hsiao reiterates. \"If you need to flavor it, add slices of cucumber or oranges/lemons. However, sugary drinks and caffeinated drinks should be kept to a minimum.\"\nAs for why that's so important? \"Water supports kidney function and helps flush out excess sodium,\" Dr. Runge explains. \"Aim to drink two to three glasses of water after a salty meal.\"\nEat potassium-rich foods\nDying for dessert? Have a banana. \"Potassium helps counterbalance sodium and relaxes blood vessels, blunting its impact on blood pressure,\" says Dr. Runge. \"Foods like bananas, avocados, sweet potatoes and spinach are excellent sources.\"\nDo some light physical activity\nWalking after eating is one of the best things you can do for over all health, and especially after loading up on sodium. \"A 15 to 20 minute walk after eating can improve blood sugar regulation and circulation, aiding the body in handling the sodium load more effectively,\" Dr\nRunge explains.\nRelated: A Cardiovascular Dietitian Says This Hidden Ingredient Could Be Wreaking Havoc on Heart Health\nWhy This Matters Long-Term\nThe truth is, an occasional salty splurge isn\u2019t the end of the world\u2014but if it's a regular habit, your heart might feel the impact over time.\n\"Chronic high sodium intake is a major contributor to hypertension, a key risk factor for heart attacks and strokes\u2014the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S.,\" Dr. Runge concludes. \"Repeated exposure, especially when paired with other unhealthy dietary habits, raises long-term cardiovascular risk.\"\nFor context, the general sodium recommendation is less than 2,300 mg per day, but if you have high blood pressure or other heart risk factors, the ideal target is under 1,500 mg.\nUp Next:\nRelated: If You\u2019re Craving Salty Foods, You Could Be Deficient in This Key Nutrient\nSources:\nJoyce Oen-Hsiao, MD, FACC, a cardiologist at Yale Medicine\nMarschall Runge, MD, PhD, a cardiologist, CEO and dean at University of Michigan Medicine and executive vice president for medical affairs at the University of Michigan\nArtificial Sweeteners: A Double-Edged Sword for Gut Microbiome.

        "Content": "(Corrects paragraph 14 to remove reference to Google and Amazon declining to comment. This line also appeared in an earlier version of this story.)\nBy Anna Tong and Krystal Hu\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Two years after the launch of ChatGPT, return on investment in generative AI has been elusive, but one area stands out: software development.\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\nSo-called code generation or \u201ccode-gen\u201d startups are commanding sky-high valuations as corporate boardrooms look to use AI to aid, and sometimes to replace, expensive human software engineers.\nCursor, a code generation startup based in San Francisco that can suggest and complete lines of code and write whole sections of code autonomously, raised $900 million at a $10 billion valuation in May from a who\u2019s who list of tech investors, including Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Accel.\nWindsurf, a Mountain View-based startup behind the popular AI coding tool Codeium, attracted the attention of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is now in talks to acquire the company for $3 billion, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nIts tool is known for translating plain English commands into code, sometimes called \u201cvibe coding,\u201d which allows people with no knowledge of computer languages to write software. OpenAI and Windsurf declined to comment on the acquisition.\n\u201cAI has automated all the repetitive, tedious work,\u201d said Scott Wu, CEO of code gen startup Cognition. \u201cThe software engineer\u2019s role has already changed dramatically. It\u2019s not about memorizing esoteric syntax anymore.\u201d\nFounders of code-gen startups and their investors believe they are in a land grab situation, with a shrinking window to gain a critical mass of users and establish their AI coding tool as the industry standard.\nBut because most are built on AI foundation models developed elsewhere, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepSeek, their costs per query are also growing, and none are yet profitable.\nThey\u2019re also at risk of being disrupted by Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, which all announced new code-gen products in May, and Anthropic is also working on one as well, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe rapid growth of these startups is coming despite competing on big tech's home turf. Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot, launched in 2021 and considered code-gen\u2019s dominant player, grew to over $500 million in revenue last year, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nMicrosoft declined to comment on GitHub Copilot\u2019s revenue. On Microsoft\u2019s earnings call in April, the company said the product has over 15 million users.\nLEARN TO CODE?\nAs AI revolutionizes the industry, many jobs - particularly entry-level coding positions that are more basic and involve repetition - may be eliminated.\nSignalfire, a VC firm that tracks tech hiring, found that new hires with less than a year of experience fell 24% in 2024, a drop it attributes to tasks once assigned to entry-level software engineers are now being fulfilled in part with AI.\nGoogle\u2019s CEO also said in April that \u201cwell over 30%\u201d of Google\u2019s code is now AI-generated, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last year the company had saved \u201cthe equivalent of 4,500 developer-years\u201d by using AI.\nIn May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at a conference that approximately 20 to 30% of their code is now AI-generated. The same month, the company announced layoffs of 6,000 workers globally, with over 40% of those being software developers in Microsoft\u2019s home state, Washington.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on creating AI that empowers developers to be more productive, creative, and save time,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said. \u201cThis means some roles will change with the revolution of AI, but human intelligence remains at the center of the software development life cycle.\u201d\nMOUNTING LOSSES\nSome \u201cvibe-coding\u201d platforms already boast substantial annualized revenues.\nCursor, with just 60 employees, went from zero to $100 million in recurring revenue by January 2025, less than two years since its launch. Windsurf, founded in 2021, launched its code generation product in November 2024 and is already bringing in $50 million in annualized revenue, according to a source familiar with the company.\nBut both startups operate with negative gross margins, meaning they spend more than they make, according to four investor sources familiar with their operations.\n\u201cThe prices people are paying for coding assistants are going to get more expensive,\u201d Quinn Slack, CEO at coding startup Sourcegraph, told Reuters.\nBoth Cursor and Windsurf are led by recent MIT graduates in their twenties, and exemplify the gold rush era of the AI startup scene. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen people working this hard since the first Internet boom,\u201d said Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, an investor in Anysphere, the company behind Cursor.\nWhat\u2019s less clear is whether the dozen or so code-gen companies will be able to hang on to their customers as big tech moves in.\n\u201cIn many cases, it's less about who's got the best technology -- it\u2019s about who is going to make the best use of that technology, and who's going to be able to sell their products better than others,\u201d said Scott Raney, managing director at Redpoint Ventures, whose firm invested in Sourcegraph and Poolside, a software development startup that\u2019s building its own AI foundation model.\nCUSTOM AI MODELS\nMost of the AI coding startups currently rely on the Claude AI model from Anthropic, which crossed $3 billion in annualized revenue in May in part due to fees paid by code-gen companies.\nBut some startups are attempting to build their own models. In May, Windsurf announced its first in-house AI models that are optimized for software engineering in a bid to control the user experience. Cursor has also hired a team of researchers to pre-train its own large frontier-level models, which could enable the company to not have to pay foundation model companies so much money, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\nStartups looking to train their own AI coding models face an uphill battle as it could easily cost millions to buy or rent the computing capacity needed to train a large language model.\nReplit earlier dropped plans to train its own model. Poolside, which has raised more than $600 million to make a coding-specific model, has announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services and is testing with customers, but hasn\u2019t made any product generally available yet.\nAnother code gen startup Magic Dev, which raised nearly $500 million since 2023, told investors a frontier-level coding model was coming in summer 2024 but hasn\u2019t yet launched a product.\nPoolside declined to comment. Magic Dev did not respond to a request for comment.\n(Reporting by Anna Tong and Krystal Hu in New York. Editing by Kenneth Li and Michael Learmonth)",

Israel has also moved troops into areas of the southwest, where it has said it won't allow the new government's security forces to deploy.\nThe projectiles Israel reported fired from Syria were the first since longtime Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad was toppled. The Israeli military said the two projectiles fell in open areas.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he held the Syrian president \"directly responsible for any threat and fire toward the State of Israel\".\nA Syrian foreign ministry statement said the accuracy of the reports of shelling towards Israel had not yet been verified.\n\"We believe that there are many parties that may seek to destabilize the region to achieve their own interests,\" the Syrian foreign ministry added, as reported by the state news agency.\nA Syrian official told Reuters such parties included \"remnants of Assad-era militias linked to Iran, which have long been active in the Quneitra area\" and have \"a vested interest in provoking Israeli retaliation as a means of escalating tensions and undermining current stabilization efforts\".\nSeveral Arab and Palestinian media outlets circulated a claim of responsibility from a little-known group named \"Martyr Muhammad Deif Brigades,\" an apparent reference to Hamas' military leader who was killed in an Israeli strike in 2024.\nReuters could not independently verify the statement.\nThe Syrian state news agency and security sources reported Israeli strikes targeting sites in the Damascus countryside and Quneitra and Daraa provinces.\nLocal residents contacted by Reuters said Israeli shelling targeted agricultural areas in the Wadi Yarmouk region. They described increased tensions in recent weeks, including reported Israeli incursions into villages, where residents have reportedly been barred from sowing their crops.\nAn Israeli strike also hit a former Syrian army base near the city of Izraa, a Syrian source said.\nIsrael has said its goals in Syria include protecting the Druze, a religious minority with followers in both countries.\nIsrael, which has occupied the Syrian Golan Heights since the 1967 Middle East war, bombed Syria frequently during the last decade of Assad's rule, targeting the sway of his Iranian allies.\nThe newly-appointed U.S. envoy to Syria said last week he believed peace between Syria and Israel was achievable.\nAround the same time that Israel reported the projectiles from Syria, the Israeli military said it intercepted a missile from Yemen.\nYemen's Iran-aligned Houthis said they targeted Israel's Jaffa with a ballistic missile. The group says it has been launching attacks against Israel in support of Palestinians during the Israeli war in Gaza.\n(Reporting by Jaidaa Taha, Menna Alaa El Din and Enas Alashray in Cairo and Suleiman Al-Khalidi in Jordan; Writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Matthew Lewis, Nia Williams, Philippa Fletcher)",

They are human principles the CCP cannot erase.\"\nTRUMP SAYS XI IS 'VERY TOUGH' AND 'EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH'\nBut the Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday clapped back at Rubio and accused him of \"maliciously distort[ing]\" historical facts.\nChinese spokesman Lin Jian said Rubio had \"seriously interfered in China\u2019s internal affairs,\" and said Beijing had lodged a formal complaint with the U.S.\nThe 36th anniversary marks the day Chinese authorities deployed the People\u2019s Liberation Army to stop a weeks-long student-led demonstration that called for greater political freedoms.\nCHINA ACCUSES HEGSETH OF ESPOUSING 'COLD WAR MENTALITY' FOR LABELING COUNTRY AS A THREAT: 'VILIFIED'\nTanks opened fire on unarmed crowds of pro-democracy demonstrators.\nThe extent of the massacre remains unknown, though hundreds were believed to have been killed, with some estimates ranging as high as 1,000 civilian deaths.\nThe CCP has since sought to cover up the crackdown by refusing to publicly acknowledge the tragedy, scrubbing online references and barring media coverage of the event.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe communist leadership has acknowledged the anniversary by routinely ramping up security at the square, as well as the entrance to Wan'an Cemetery, where some of the victims of the attack were laid to rest, reported AFP.\nImages of security forces lining Tiananmen Square again surfaced on Wednesday, though the square stood relatively empty.",

        "Content": "Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by President Donald Trump, in the country\u2019s presidential runoff election, according to a final vote count issued Monday.\nNawrocki won 50.89% of the vote, gaining a narrow victory over liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%, the Associated Press reported.\nThe first round of voting two weeks ago revealed deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union. Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.\nTrzaskowski conceded defeat and congratulated Nawrocki on Monday, thanking all those who voted for him.\nPOLAND\u2019S SOARING ECONOMY SETS STAGE FOR TIGHT PRESIDENTIAL RACE AS US, EU WATCH CLOSELY\n\"I fought for us to build a strong, safe, honest, and empathetic Poland together,\" he wrote on X. \"I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to convince the majority of citizens of my vision for Poland. I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t win together.\"\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last week stumped for Nawrocki at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Warsaw, where she also slammed \"weak\" European leaders who she argued have allowed mass migration of having \"destroyed their civilizations.\" Noem praised Poland\u2019s strict border enforcement, warning that \"socialists\" like Trzaskowski would take such protections away from the Polish people.\nTrump hosted Nawrocki at the White House in early May during the conservative candidate's campaign.\nUnder the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was among the leaders offering their congratulations to Nawrocki on Monday morning.\n\"Poland, which preserves the strength of its national spirit and its faith in justice, has been and remains a pillar of regional and European security, and a strong voice defending freedom and dignity for every nation,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"By reinforcing one another on our continent, we give greater strength to Europe in global competition and bring the achievement of real and lasting peace closer. I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation with Poland and with President Nawrocki personally.\"\nThe U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president. A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \"normality,\" as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.\nPOLAND ORDERS RUSSIAN CONSULATE IN KRAKOW CLOSED AFTER BLAMING KREMLIN FOR 2024 ARSON\nNawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, has also echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who shares Nawrocki's national conservative worldview, hailed Nawrocki's \"fantastic victory.\"\nMeanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered measured congratulations, emphasizing continued EU-Poland collaboration rooted in shared democratic values: \"We are all stronger together in our community of peace, democracy, and values. So let us work to ensure the security and prosperity of our common home.\"\nNawrocki's victory is a comeback for the Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist coalition.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDuda's veto power has been one obstacle to the pro-European Union Tusk in fulfilling certain electoral promises, such as loosening restrictions on abortion or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples. Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "Content": "A federal judge granted a request Wednesday from more than a dozen major news outlets and publishers to unseal certain records in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Salvadorian migrant and alleged MS-13 member who was deported from Maryland to El Salvador in March in what administration officials have acknowledged was an administrative error.\nSeparately on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted a request from Abrego Garcia's legal team to file a motion for sanctions against the Trump administration. That filing is due June 11, she said in an order.\nThe one-two punch from Xinis could give plaintiffs new ammo to pursue more formal punishments against the Trump administration if officials are found to have been acting in bad faith or knowingly defying court orders.\nIt will also give new access to media outlets covering the case. Xinis agreed to grant in part a request from a group of 14 major media outlets and publishers \u2013 including Fox News, NBC News, CBS News, New York Times, the Washington Post and NPR \u2013 who filed a motion to unseal records in the Abrego Garcia case, citing concerns over the lack of public access, as well as over government efforts, or lack thereof, to facilitate his return to the U.S.\nJUDGE PRESSES TRUMP DOJ ON ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION; ANSWERS LEAVE COURTROOM IN STUNNED SILENCE\nIn her order, Xinis agreed with the contention of the news outlets \u2013 referred to jointly as the \"Press Movants\" \u2013 that the public \"enjoys a presumptive right to access court records, overcome only when outweighed by competing interests.\"\nAs such, Xinis ordered the Trump administration to unseal a handful of documents that have so far been filed under seal, as part of a protracted legal battle over the status of Abrego Garcia.\nXinis also ordered them to unseal a transcript from an April 30 hearing in his case.\n\"The right to public access of court records remains critical to promoting \u2018trustworthiness of the judicial process, to curb judicial abuses, and to provide the public with a more complete understanding of the judicial system, including a better perception of fairness,\u2019\" she said Wednesday.\nThe order comes amid a months-long court fight over the status of Abrego Garcia, who remains in El Salvador.\nXinis in April ordered the Trump administration to comply with an expedited discovery schedule to determine whether they were complying with the directive to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., which was upheld by the Supreme Court earlier this year.\nSince then, she has struggled to ascertain the status of Abrego Garcia, or efforts made to return him to the U.S.\nTRUMP'S REMARKS COULD COME BACK TO BITE HIM IN ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION BATTLE\nTrump officials, for their part, have repeatedly alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, though any formal ties remain unproven.\nLawyers for the government and Abrego Garcia's attorneys have sparred with Xinis in court over what exactly it means to \"facilitate\" his return \u2013 a months-long fight that Xinis most recently described as beating a \"frustrated and dead horse.\"\nXinis previously took aim at what she deemed to be the lack of information submitted to the court as part of an expedited discovery process she ordered last month, describing the government submissions as \"vague, evasive and incomplete\" responses, and which she said demonstrated \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"\nThe order is the latest development in the ongoing feud between Trump officials and the courts over the use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime immigration law used earlier this year to quickly deport migrants from the U.S.\nTo date, the Trump administration has not knowingly complied with any court orders to return migrants who were removed and sent to El Salvador in the early wave of deportation flights, despite earlier court orders from Xinis, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and others.\nIt is unclear whether Xinis plans to begin contempt proceedings against the administration, though the federal judge in D.C. said earlier this year that he had found probable cause to do so.",

        "Summary": "Video platform Rumble is in the midst of an international free speech battle involving the Brazilian Supreme Court, including the Trump Department of Justice sending a letter to the foreign judge.",
        "Content": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) sent an unprecedented letter to a Brazilian Supreme Court justice in May, admonishing the judge for ordering American-based video platform Rumble to restrict the free speech of a user on U.S. soil, describing the orders as international overreach that lack enforceability.\nRumble, a popular U.S.-based video-sharing platform that bucks censorship efforts frequently found on other video and social media platforms, is at the center of an international battle to protect free speech that has been ongoing for months.\nBrazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the suspension of Rumble in the South American country back in February over claims the U.S. company did not comply with court orders, including removing the accounts of a Brazilian man living in the U.S. and seeking political asylum.\n\"If you look at what\u2019s happening around the world, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re living through a perilous moment for anyone who believes in freedom of expression \u2014 a fundamental human right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and recognized globally, even by the United Nations,\" Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski exclusively told Fox News Digital Tuesday following the DOJ's May letter.\nRUMBLE, TRUMP MEDIA DECLARE \u2018COMPLETE VICTORY FOR FREE SPEECH\u2019 IN WIN AGAINST BRAZILIAN JUDGE\n\"The fact that Rumble has become a central player in this global fight for free speech is a powerful validation of our mission. We\u2019re proud to stand at the front lines of this effort and grateful that President Trump and his administration have made this battle a foreign policy priority.\"\nMoraes is now in the U.S. government's crosshairs after the DOJ sent a letter to him in May outlining his reported international overreach into U.S. law affecting the First Amendment, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio revealing in a congressional hearing that the Brazilian judge could face U.S. sanctions.\nMoraes had ordered Rumble to remove a user from its platform as he stands accused of spreading false information online and is considered a fugitive in Brazil. Rumble refused and was threatened with financial penalties for the lack of cooperation.\nThe DOJ letter, dated May 7 and made public Thursday, argued that Moraes' orders are not enforceable in the U.S.\n\"These purported directives to Rumble are made under threat of monetary and other penalties,\" the letter, signed by DOJ official Ada E. Bosque, reads. \"We take no position on the enforceability of the various orders and other judicial documents directing Rumble to act within the territory of Brazil, which is a matter of Brazilian law. However, to the extent that these documents direct Rumble to undertake specific actions in the United States, we respectfully advise that such directives are not enforceable judicial orders in the United States.\"\nThe DOJ did not have additional comment to provide when approached about the letter Tuesday.\nPavlovski described to Fox Digital that the letter is \"unprecedented\" and draws a clear line to foreign nations that they cannot attempt to thwart U.S. laws and the First Amendment.\n\"The letter from the U.S. Department of Justice to a foreign judge over censorship orders is unprecedented,\" Pavlovski said. \"It draws a bright red line: foreign officials cannot issue censorship orders that violate the First Amendment or bypass U.S. law. That kind of extraterritorial overreach is incompatible with American sovereignty. And that\u2019s good news, not just for Americans, but for free societies everywhere.\"\nThe letter continued that there are established channels for international legal proceedings, which the DOJ said the judge bypassed, and directed the Brazilian judge to various proper procedures he could take regarding the court orders.\nRumble facing restrictions in foreign nations is hardly new, with the platform currently disabled in China, Russia and France, as well as Brazil. It has also previously received censorship demands in nations such as the U.K., Australia and New Zealand, but has maintained its free speech objective.\nThe DOJ's letter comes as Rubio revealed in a House Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing in May that the State Department is considering sanctions against Moraes under the Magnitsky Act. The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act authorizes the U.S. government to sanction individuals overseas if determined responsible for human rights abuses or corruption.\n\"We've seen pervasive censorship, political persecution targeting the entire opposition, including journalists and ordinary citizens,\" Republican Florida Rep. Cory Mills asked Rubio at the hearing in May. \"What they're now doing is imminent, politically motivated imprisonment of former President Bolsonaro. This crackdown has extended beyond Brazil's borders, impacting individuals on U.S. soil., the 2023 Financial Times article actually talked about this. What do you intend to do? And would you be looking at Supreme Court justice sanctioning of Alexandre de Moraes under the Global Magnitsky Act?\"\nBRAZILIAN EX-PRESIDENT BOLSONARO ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL OVER ALLEGED COUP PLAN\nRubio responded, \"That's under review right now, and it's a great, great possibility that will happen.\"\nDays later, Rubio posted to X that the State Department will roll out visa restrictions on foreigners found \"complicit\" in censoring Americans.\n\"For too long, Americans have been fined, harassed, and even charged by foreign authorities for exercising their free speech rights,\" Rubio wrote on X. \"Today, I am announcing a new visa restriction policy that will apply to foreign officials and persons who are complicit in censoring Americans. Free speech is essential to the American way of life \u2014 a birthright over which foreign governments have no authority.\"\n\"Foreigners who work to undermine the rights of Americans should not enjoy the privilege of traveling to our country,\" Rubio added, not naming specific individuals responsible for such actions. \"Whether in Latin America, Europe, or elsewhere, the days of passive treatment for those who work to undermine the rights of Americans are over.\"\nMoraes is also overseeing the upcoming trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of allegedly attempting to overturn his 2022 election results.\nBrazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva slammed the U.S. for threatening sanctions against Moraes in comment this week.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"It is unacceptable for the president of any country in the world to comment on the decision of the Supreme Court of another country,\" da Silva said Tuesday, according to Reuters.\nThe Brazilian president added that the U.S. should understand the importance of \"respecting the integrity of institutions in other countries.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Moraes' office Tuesday but did not immediately receive a reply.",

        "Summary": "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., had a heated exchange with a liberal law professor over the spike in nationwide injunctions against Trump&apos;s executive orders.",
        "Content": "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., clashed Tuesday with a University of Pennsylvania law professor over the number of nationwide judicial injunctions imposed by district judges against President Donald Trump\u2019s executive actions on matters including deportations, tariffs, and cuts to federal funding and the federal workforce.\nDuring the Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing titled \"The Supposedly \u2018Least Dangerous Branch\u2019: District Judges v. Trump,\" Hawley displayed a bar chart to argue that nationwide injunctions against the executive branch, which had not been used until the 1960s, surged when Trump came into office for his first term and then dramatically dropped again during former President Joe Biden\u2019s time at the White House.\n\"Now, you don't think this is a little bit anomalous?\" Hawley asked University of Pennsylvania law professor Kate Shaw.\nTRUMP CRITICIZES RAND PARL OVER TAX BILL OPPOSTION: \u2018VOTES NO ON EVERYTHING\u2019\nShaw, a Supreme Court contributor for ABC News who previously worked for former President Barack Obama\u2019s White House Counsel\u2019s Office, responded, \"A very plausible explanation, senator, you have to consider is that [Trump] is engaged in much more lawless activity than other presidents. Right?\"\n\"This was never used before the 1960s,\" Hawley said. \"And suddenly Democrat judges decide we love the nationwide injunction. And then when Biden comes office, no, no.\"\nShaw cited Mila Sohoni, a Stanford Law School professor, as suggesting that the first nationwide injunction came in 1913 and others were issued in the 1920s.\n\"The federal government was doing a lot less until 100 years ago,\" she said. \"There\u2019s many things that have changed in the last hundred or the last 50 years.\"\n\"So as long as it is a Democrat president in office, then we should have no nationwide injunctions?\" Hawley shot back. \"If it's a Republican president, then this is absolutely fine, warranted and called for? How can our system of law survive on those principles?\"\nShaw said she believes a system where there \"are no legal constraints on the president is a very dangerous system of law,\" but the Republican from Missouri contended that\u2019s not what the law professor believed when Biden was president.\n\"You said it was a travesty for the principles of democracy, notions of judicial impartiality and the rule of law,\" Hawley said. \"You said the idea that anyone would foreign shop to get a judge who would issue a nationwide injunction was a politician, just judges looking like politicians in robes. Again, it threatened the underlying legal system. People are just trying to get the result they wanted. It was a travesty for the rule of law. But you're fine with all of that if it's getting the result that you want.\"\nJUDGE TO BLOCK TRUMP ADMIN'S HARVARD FOREIGN STUDENTS BAN\nHawley cited Shaw\u2019s stance in a specific abortion pill ruling during Biden\u2019s presidency. In April 2023, U.S. District Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk of the Northern District of Texas issued a nationwide injunction on the Biden Food and Drug Administration\u2019s mifepristone rules, which Shaw described at the time as \"a travesty for the principles of democracy, notions of judicial impartiality and the rule of law.\"\nHawley said she had failed to offer a legitimate principle for issuing nationwide injunctions now.\n\"I understand you hate the president,\" the senator told Shaw. \"I understand that you love all of these rulings against him. You and I both know that's not a principle. You're a lawyer. What's the principle that divides when issuing a nationwide injunction is OK and when it is not? When the Biden administration was subject to nationwide injunctions, you said that they were travesties for the principle of democracy.\"\n\"When it's Biden, it's OK. When it's Biden, oh, it's a travesty. When it's Trump in office, it's a no holds barred, whatever it takes,\" the senator added.\nHawley said Shaw and his Democratic colleagues were raising \"very principled injunctions\" to nationwide injunctions issued against Biden just nine months ago and \"all that's changed in nine months is the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n\"I realize that my colleagues on this side of the aisle very much dislike that individual,\" Hawley said, referring to Trump. \"And I realize that you think that the rulings that he has lost are fundamentally sound.\"\n\"I disagree with all of that, but we can put that to one side. The question we're talking about here is, \u2018Should judges, single judges, district court judges be able to bind nonparties who are not in front of them?\u2019 And you used to say no. Now you say yes,\" he said. \"Let's be consistent. I would just suggest to you our system of government cannot survive if it's going to be politics all the way down.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShaw responded that \"democracy is not as simple as majority rule,\" but Hawley interjected, saying, \"You would have it as simple as majority rule. When you get the majority you like, you\u2019re for the nationwide injunction. When you don't, you're not.\"",

        "Content": "Education Secretary Linda McMahon and the conservative group Moms for Liberty took to the Supreme Court steps Tuesday to recognize the 100-year anniversary of a landmark case that they said gave parents more control over their children\u2019s education.\nBut advocates who spoke at the event are also anticipating decisions in two other pivotal cases that could affect the conservative-led parental rights movement.\nRosalind Hanson, who is part of a group of plaintiffs in Mahmoud v. Taylor, told Fox News Digital in an interview after the rally that she is optimistic about a forthcoming decision from the high court on the key religious liberty case. She said it came from Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland refusing to allow parents to opt their elementary school children out of being exposed to books containing gender and sexuality concepts.\n\"We are not trying to change the curriculum,\" Hanson said. \"We are not trying to say what you teach.\u2026 The majority of states across the country have said you can have an opt-out for these very sensitive issues and topics, especially because of the religious component, but also because of the age appropriateness.\"\nSUPREME COURT LIKELY TO SIDE WITH PARENTS IN LETTING THEM OPT OUT OF LGBTQ STORYBOOKS, EXPERT SAYS\nMontgomery County Public Schools attorneys argued to the Supreme Court that courts have long held that \"mere exposure to controversial issues in a public-school curriculum does not burden the free religious exercise of parents or students.\" Still, the attorneys stood by the school system\u2019s decision to incorporate what they described as a \"handful of storybooks featuring lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer characters\" for use in language arts lessons.\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case in April, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks.\nAlso on Moms for Liberty\u2019s radar is United States v. Skrmetti, one of the most closely watched cases of the court\u2019s term.\nThe case arose from the Biden administration suing over a bill Tennessee passed in 2023 to ban puberty blockers and hormone therapy as treatments for minors who identify as transgender. The Supreme Court is now poised to decide within the next few weeks if states can restrict such medical treatments for minors.\nMARYLAND MOM TAKING FIGHT TO OPT CHILD OUT OF LGBTQ STORY BOOKS BEFORE SUPREME COURT\nScarlett Johnson, who has a leadership role in Moms for Liberty, called the case a \"big one\" and told Fox News Digital she also urges members of her group to advocate legislation that \"will protect children from the puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries for minors regarding the issue of gender identity.\"\nMcMahon, meanwhile, reflected on Pierce v. Society of Sisters, a landmark decision issued 100 years ago that struck down Oregon\u2019s law requiring all children to attend public school. McMahon called it \"one of the most impactful education-related cases in American history\" but said the parental rights movement remains necessary.\nWATCH LIVE: MOMS FOR LIBERTY RALLY WITH LINDA MCMAHON AT SUPREME COURT\n\"Special interest and progressive activists still try to agitate for the government to override moms and dads in education,\" McMahon said. \"Whether it\u2019s through ideological indoctrination, sexually explicit curriculum, or hiding health and safety risks from parents, the progressive left always wants to come between you and your kids.\"\nThe speakers' remarks could be heard clearly over livestreams online, but in person in front of the Supreme Court building, they were drowned out entirely by a single protester screaming profanities and bashing a string of officials, including McMahon, Justice Clarence Thomas and President Donald Trump.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nRep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., elicited laughs when she thanked the protester, who was holding a sign reading \"Let's TACO \u2018bout tariffs,\" a reference to an acronym Democrats\u2019 adopted for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"\n\"I'd also like to thank our lone protester for highlighting the mental health crisis in our country.

        "Content": "A team of scientists at the Institute for Advanced Study School of Natural Sciences in Princeton, New Jersey, might have found a new dwarf planet, potentially leading to more evidence of a theoretical super-planet.\nThe scientists announced in a news release that they have found a trans-Neptune Object(TNO), code-named 2017OF201, located past the icy and desolate region of the Kuplier Belt.\nThe TNO, which are described as minor planets that orbit the sun at a greater distance than Neptune, were found on the edge of our solar system.\nWhile there are plenty of other TNOs in the solar system, what makes 2017OF201 special is its large size and extreme orbit.\nNASA LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DESTROY ASTEROID THAT COULD STRIKE EARTH, KILL CITY\nOne of the team leads, Sihao Cheng, along with Jiaxuan Li and Eritas Yang from Princeton University, made the discovery.\nThe team used advanced computational methods to identify the object\u2019s distinctive trajectory pattern in the sky.\n\"The object\u2019s aphelion \u2014 the farthest point on the orbit from the Sun \u2014 is more than 1600 times that of the Earth\u2019s orbit,\" Cheng said in the release. \"Meanwhile, its perihelion \u2014 the closest point on its orbit to the Sun \u2014 is 44.5 times that of the Earth\u2019s orbit, similar to Pluto's orbit.\"\n2017OF201 takes about 25,000 years to orbit the sun, making Yang suggest that \"It must have experienced close encounters with a giant planet, causing it to be ejected to a wide orbit.\"\nNEWLY DISCOVERED ASTEROID TURNS OUT TO BE TESLA ROADSTER LAUNCHED INTO SPACE\nCheng also added that there may have been more than one step in its migration.\n\"It\u2019s possible that this object was first ejected to the Oort cloud, the most distant region in our solar system, which is home to many comets, and then sent back,\" Cheng said.\nThis discovery has significant implications for the current understanding of the layout of our outer solar system.\nAccording to NASA, California Institute of Technology (Caltech) astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown in January 2016 announced research that provided evidence for a planet about 1.5 times the size of Earth in the outer solar system.\nHowever, the existence of Planet X or Planet Nine is strictly theoretical as neither astronomer has actually observed such a planet.\nThe theory puts the planet at around the same size as Neptune, far past Pluto somewhere near the Kuiper Belt, where 2017OF201 was located.\nIf it exists, it is theorized to have a mass of up to 10 times as much as Earth\u2019s with a distance of up to 30 times further than Neptune to the Sun.\nIt would take between 10,000 and 20,000 Earth years to make one full orbit around the Sun.\nHowever, the area beyond the Kuiper Belt, where the object is located, had previously been thought to be essentially empty, but the team\u2019s discovery suggests that this is not so.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCheng said in the release that 2017OF201 only has about 1% of its orbit visible to us.\n\"Even though advances in telescopes have enabled us to explore distant parts of the universe, there is still a great deal to discover about our own solar system,\" Cheng said.\nNASA mentioned that if Planet Nine exists, it could help explain the unique orbits of some smaller objects in the distant Kuiper Belt.\nAs of now, Planet Nine remains all but a theory, but the existence of this far-off world rests on gravitational patterns in the outer solar system.\nNick Butler is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

We\u2019re not the first to consider ferrihydrite as the reason for why Mars is red, but we can now better test this using observational data and novel laboratory methods to essentially make a Martian dust in the lab.\"\nNASA'S MARTIAN HELICOPTER PROMISES UNPRECEDENTED VIEWS OF THE RED PLANET\nSenior author of the study, Jack Mustard, called the study a \"door-opening opportunity.\"\n\"It gives us a better chance to apply principles of mineral formation and conditions to tap back in time,\" Mustard, a professor at Brown University, said. \"What\u2019s even more important, though, is the return of the samples from Mars that are being collected right now by the Perseverance rover.

To understand that, you need to understand the conditions that were present during the time of this mineral\u2019s formation. What we know from this study is the evidence points to ferrihydrite forming and for that to happen there must have been conditions where oxygen from air or other sources and water can react with iron. Those conditions were very different from today\u2019s dry, cold environment. As Martian winds spread this dust everywhere, it created the planet\u2019s iconic red appearance.\"",

        "Content": "A U.S. startup company is reportedly offering wealthy couples the chance to screen their embryos for IQ and other favorable genetic traits, which has raised ethical concerns.\nHeliospect Genomics is charging up to $50,000 to test 100 embryos and claims their technology can help couples undergoing IVF pick children with IQ scores six points higher or more over babies conceived naturally, The Guardian reports.\nThe company has already worked with more than a dozen couples, undercover video footage reviewed by the outlet reveals.\n\"Everyone can have all the children they want, and they can have children that are basically disease-free, smart, healthy; it\u2019s going to be great,\" CEO Michael Christensen said on a video call in November 2023, according to the report. The call was recorded by an undercover researcher for Hope Not Hate, an antifascist group that works to \"expose and oppose far-right extremism.\"\nDESIGNER BABIES MAY BE \u2018MORALLY\u2019 ACCEPTABLE, UK ETHICS COUNCIL DECIDES\nOn the call, Heliospect employees reportedly walk prospective parents through the experimental genetic selection techniques advertised by the company. One employee explained how couples could use polygenic scoring to rank up to 100 embryos based on \"IQ and the other naughty traits that everybody wants,\" including sex, height, risk of obesity and risk of mental illness, according to The Guardian.\nHeliospect says its prediction tools use data from UK Biobank, a publicly funded genetic repository with half a million British volunteers. The database permits approved researchers and scientists around the world to access it for \"health-related research that is in the public interest.\"\nUnited Kingdom law prohibits parents from selecting embryos on the basis of predicted high IQ, but the practice is currently legal in the U.S., even if the technology is not yet commercially available.\nExpert geneticists and bioethicists told The Guardian the prospect of selecting embryos for favorable genetic traits is ethically questionable since it could reinforce the idea of \"superior\" and \"inferior\" genetics. Hope Not Hate went further in its own reporting, tying a handful of Heliospect employees to people and publications that have purportedly promoted so-called scientific racism, or the contested belief that human races have innately different levels of physical, intellectual and moral development determined by their genetics.\nTRUMP PLEDGES COVERAGE FOR IVF TREATMENT\nKatie Hasson, associate director of the Center for Genetics and Society in California, warned in comments to The Guardian that embryo selection technology could mainstream \"the belief that inequality comes from biology rather than social causes.\"\nHeliospect Genomics did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nHeliospect managers told The Guardian the U.S.-based company operates within the bounds of all applicable law and regulations. The company said it is currently in \"stealth mode\" and is still developing its services before a planned public launch. They added that couples who have screened fewer embryos were charged around $4,000 for the service.\nOn the calls recorded by Hope Not Hate, Heliospect's team described how its \"polygenic scoring\" service uses algorithms to analyze the genetic data given by parents to predict the specific traits of their individual embryos. The company does not offer IVF services, according to The Guardian.\nChristensen presented an ambitious vision for how the technology could develop, even suggesting that \"lab-grown eggs would allow couples to create embryos on an industrial scale \u2013 a thousand, or even a million \u2013 from which an elite selection could be handpicked,\" the report said.\nAccording to The Guardian, he suggested that future technology might be able to screen for personality types, including what he referred to as \"dark triad\" traits, namely machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy.\nAI BABIES: NEW TECHNOLOGY IS HELPING FERTILITY DOCS CHOOSE THE BEST EMBRYOS FOR IVF\n\"Beauty is something lots of people actually ask about,\" he reportedly added.\nHeliospect told The Guardian it does not condone industrial-scale egg or embryo production or elite selection and that it does not plan to offer personality screening services.\nAmong Heliospect's senior staff is Jonathan Anomaly, a controversial academic who has defended so-called \"liberal eugenics,\" or the idea that parents should use genetic technology to enhance their children's prospects.\nAnomaly told The Guardian that as a professor of philosophy, he has published provocative articles intended to stimulate debate and that \"liberal eugenics\" was an accepted term by bioethicists.\nRecords show Heliospect gained access to UK Biobank's data in June 2023. In its application, the company said it planned to use advanced techniques to improve the prediction of \"complex traits.\" But Heliospect did not disclose screening embryos as an intended commercial application or mention IQ, The Guardian reported.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nUK Biobank told the outlet Heliospect's use of its data appeared to be \"entirely consistent with our access conditions.\"\nExperts suggested to The Guardian that restrictions on access to databases like UK Biobank may need to be strengthened in light of the ethical concerns around embryo screening.\n\"UK Biobank, and the UK government, may want to think harder about whether it needs to impose some new restrictions,\" said professor Hank Greely, a bioethicist at Stanford University.\nHeliospect emphasized that its use of UK Biobank data is lawful and complies with relevant regulations. The company told The Guardian it supports addressing concerns about preimplantation embryonic screening through public education, policy discussions and properly informed debates about the technology, which it strongly believed had the potential to help people.",

        "Summary": "A Harvard study finds that caffeinated coffee may support healthy aging in women, with benefits not seen in decaf or tea, despite some study limitations.",
        "Content": "A popular morning beverage could do more than provide a perk. It could also help women stay healthy as they age.\nThat\u2019s according to new research from Harvard University, which followed a group of nearly 50,000 women from the Nurses' Health Study for a 30-year period.\nThe researchers found that drinking coffee every morning could help women stay mentally sharp and physically strong later in life, according to a press release from the American Society of Nutrition.\nTHE OPTIMAL TIME TO DRINK COFFEE ISN'T WHEN YOU NORMALLY HAVE IT\nThe benefits were seen in middle-aged women who drank caffeinated coffee. Decaf coffee and tea did not have the same effect.\n\"'Healthy aging' here meant surviving to older age without major chronic diseases and with good physical, mental and cognitive function,\" Sara Mahdavi, Ph.D., a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, told Fox News Digital.\n\"Importantly, this relationship persisted even after accounting for key lifestyle factors like diet quality, physical activity and smoking \u2014 each of which are also strongly associated with healthy aging in their own right.\"\nThe women who qualified as \"healthy agers\" were found to consume an average of 315 mg of caffeine daily, primarily via coffee-drinking.\nWHAT IS MUSHROOM COFFEE? CAFFEINE ALTERNATIVE OFFERS SURPRISING HEALTH BENEFITS\nEach additional cup of coffee was linked to a 2% to 5% greater chance of healthier aging, the study found.\nAlthough soda also contains caffeine, people who drank it every day were shown to have a 20% to 26% reduced chance of healthy aging.\n\"The health benefits appeared specific to coffee, rather than caffeine more broadly,\" Mahdavi noted.\n\"We didn\u2019t see the same associations with decaf coffee, tea or caffeinated soda \u2014 suggesting that coffee\u2019s unique combination of bioactive compounds may play a key role.\"\nThe findings were set to be presented on Monday at NUTRITION 2025, the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held in Orlando.\nWOMEN MAY HEAR BETTER THAN MEN, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS\n\"While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee's impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,\" said Mahdavi.\n\"The findings suggest that caffeinated coffee \u2026 may uniquely support aging trajectories that preserve both mental and physical function.\"\n\"The health benefits appeared specific to coffee, rather than caffeine more broadly.\"\nThe researcher acknowledged that the study has some limitations.\n\"As with all observational studies, we cannot establish causality,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"While we adjusted for many factors, unmeasured confounding is always possible.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nMahdavi also pointed out that the study group mostly included white, educated female health professionals.\n\"Further work is needed to confirm generalizability to broader populations.\"\nCoffee\u2019s benefits are \"relatively modest\" compared to the benefits of overall healthy lifestyle habits, according to the researcher.\n\"These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long\u2011term health,\" said Mahdavi. \"Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"We don\u2019t recommend starting coffee if you don\u2019t already drink it or if you\u2019re sensitive to caffeine,\" she went on.\n\"But for people who already consume moderate amounts \u2014 typically two to four cups per day \u2014 this study adds to the evidence that coffee can be part of a healthy lifestyle.\"\nMahdavi emphasized, however, that nutrition, regular exercise and not smoking are the \"most powerful and proven contributors\" to healthy aging.\nThe team is now planning to explore how coffee\u2019s bioactive compounds \u2014 particularly polyphenols and antioxidants \u2014 might influence molecular aging pathways, including inflammation, metabolism and vascular health, Mahdavi said.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\"Genetic and hormonal differences may also shape how individuals respond, which could pave the way for more personalized guidance in the future.\"",

        "Summary": "An Adidas data breach through a third-party vendor exposed customer details like emails and phone numbers, raising concerns about phishing and identity theft risks.",
        "Content": "Hackers are no longer targeting only tech giants or hospitals. Any business that collects valuable personal information, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses or even basic financial details, is now a target.\nCompanies that rely heavily on third-party vendors or outsourced customer support are even more at risk, especially if they are not particularly strong in the technology sector.\nGerman retailer Adidas learned this the hard way. The company recently confirmed a data breach involving one of its external partners, and although it has acknowledged the issue, many important details are still missing.\nAdidas confirms vendor breach: Here\u2019s what we know\nAdidas has officially acknowledged that a third-party vendor suffered a breach, resulting in unauthorized access to consumer data. In a public notice titled \"Data Security Information,\" the company revealed that a \"third-party customer service provider\" had been compromised. While the brand was initially silent on the scope, it had already been reported earlier this month that customers in Turkey and Korea had received breach notifications.\nMASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS\nAdidas posted this information on both its German and English websites. However, no specific region or number of affected individuals has been confirmed. The company\u2019s statement did clarify that no payment information, such as credit card details, nor passwords were included in the breach. Instead, it involved contact details submitted by users to Adidas\u2019 help desk in the past.\nData obtained reportedly includes names, phone numbers, email addresses and dates of birth. While this might seem limited compared to financial data, this type of information can be exploited for phishing scams and identity theft.\nWhat Adidas told customers after the breach\nIn the wake of the breach, Adidas began notifying potentially affected customers directly. The company's email to customers below aimed to reassure recipients and clarify what information was involved. Here is the full text of the notification sent to affected individuals.\nDear customer,\nWe are writing to inform you of an issue that we recently became aware of which may have impacted some of your data.\nWhat happened\nadidas recently learned that an unauthorized external party gained access to certain customer data through a third-party customer service provider.\nWhat information was involved\nThe affected data does not contain passwords, credit card or any other payment-related information. Nor have any Social Security numbers been impacted.\nIt mainly consists of contact information relating to customers who had contacted our customer service help desk in the past. This may have included one or more of the following: name, email address, telephone number, gender and/or birth date.\nWhat we are doing\nPrivacy and the security of your data is our priority. Upon becoming aware of this incident, adidas took proactive and immediate steps to investigate and contain the incident. This includes further enhancing security measures and resetting passwords for customer service accounts.\nWhat you can do\nWe are currently unaware of any harm (such as identity theft or fraud) being caused to our customers as a result of this incident. There are no immediate steps that you need to take. Although, as always, please remain vigilant and look out for any suspicious messages. As a reminder, adidas will never directly contact you to ask that you provide us with financial information, such as your credit card details, bank account information or passwords.\nWho you can contact\nIf you have any questions, then please contact our Customer Service team at https://www.adidas.com/us/help\nWe apologise for any inconvenience caused by this incident.\nadidas Team\nTHINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK\nWhat Adidas hasn\u2019t said about the vendor hack\nDespite the official acknowledgment, several questions remain unanswered. Adidas has yet to clarify whether this is a single breach affecting multiple regions or several separate incidents. The lack of transparency around the name of the third-party vendor and the absence of concrete numbers or locations for affected users has created frustration among observers and possibly among customers themselves.\nThe earlier regional reports from Turkey and Korea might suggest that this incident was either global in scale or that similar third-party vendors were independently targeted. In either case, the company's current handling of the situation has left room for speculation. Adidas claims it is in the process of informing potentially affected customers, but it has not detailed the method or timeline for this outreach.\nWe reached out to adidas for a comment, and a representative referred us to this statement on their website. In part, the company said, \"We remain fully committed to protecting the privacy and security of our consumers, and sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern caused by this incident.\"\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\nHOW TO GET RID OF ROBOCALLS WITH APPS AND DATA REMOVAL SERVICES\n6 critical steps to take after the Adidas data breach\nIf you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Adidas data breach:\n1. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service: The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Adidas breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.\n2. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software: With access to your email and phone number, Adidas attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.\n3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection: Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Adidas breach. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.\n4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.\n5. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.\n6. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.\nHACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES\nKurt\u2019s key takeaway\nThe Adidas breach shows that even companies with decades of brand equity and a massive global footprint are not immune to lapses in data security. It underscores the need for companies to go beyond basic compliance and actively evaluate the cybersecurity standards of every partner in their ecosystem. Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the trade-offs they make when sharing their personal information, and brands that fail to meet this moment may find their reputations eroding faster than they expect.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShould retailers be penalized for neglecting basic cybersecurity practices?

        "Summary": "Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson talks about a viral video that shows a $90,000 humanoid robot going wild. A tech nightmare or just a glitch?",
        "Content": "A chilling video circulating on social media has reignited old anxieties about robots turning against their creators. The footage shows a Unitree H1 humanoid robot, a machine about the size of an adult human, suddenly flailing its arms and legs with alarming force during a test, coming dangerously close to two technicians.\nThe scene has sparked heated debate about the safety of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence. But is this truly the beginning of something out of our worst fears, or is there just a straightforward technical explanation for what happened?\nWhat the video shows\nIn the viral clip first posted on Reddit, the Unitree H1 is seen suspended from a crane at a Chinese factory, surrounded by two handlers. Without warning, the robot loses control, thrashing its limbs, knocking over equipment and forcing the technicians to scramble out of harm's way. The chaos is palpable, and the images quickly drew comparisons to movies like \"The Terminator\" and \"I, Robot,\" with many viewers wondering if the age of rogue machines had finally arrived.\nAI HUMANOID ROBOT IS CHANGING THE WAY YOU BUY CARS AT DEALERSHIPS\nThe robot behind the incident\nThe Unitree H1 is not a prototype but a commercially available, general-purpose humanoid robot. Standing 5.9 feet tall and weighing 104 pounds, it's designed to walk, run and even perform dynamic movements like backflips and dancing. Its joints are powerful and capable of generating 365 pound-feet of torque, enough to lift heavy objects or, in the wrong circumstances, cause serious harm.\nCHINESE HUMANOID ROBOT WITH EAGLE EYE VISION AND POWERFUL AI\nWhat went wrong?\nDespite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm.\nThe robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw.\nWHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE\nAI HUMANOID ROBOT LEARNS TO MIMIC HUMAN EMOTIONS AND BEHAVIOR\nPublic reaction and safety concerns\nAlthough no one was seriously injured, the incident set off a wave of panic online. Many viewers saw the video without any technical context, fueling fears of a robot uprising. The imagery alone was enough to make people question whether advanced robots are safe to have around humans.\nExperts, however, were quick to clarify that the malfunction was not evidence of a conscious or rebellious machine. Instead, it highlighted the importance of thorough safety protocols and testing, especially when deploying powerful machines in environments shared with people.\nBEST FATHER\u2019S DAY GIFTS FOR EVERY DAD\nLessons for the future\nThis event highlights some important lessons for both the robotics industry and the public. First, safety protocols are essential. Even with the most advanced hardware, unexpected interactions between software and the physical world can create dangerous situations.\nSecond, transparency from manufacturers plays a crucial role. When companies provide quick and clear explanations, they can help prevent panic and stop misinformation from spreading.\nFinally, it is important to remember that artificial intelligence is not sentient, at least not yet. The Unitree H1's behavior was caused by programming and sensor misinterpretation, not by any independent thought or intent.\nSUBSCRIBE TO KURT'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES\nKurt's key takeaways\nThe viral Unitree H1 video is a reminder that technology, especially when it's powerful and autonomous, demands respect and caution. While the footage is unsettling, the true story is one of technical error, not a robot rebellion. As robots become more common in our workplaces and public spaces, incidents like this will serve as important lessons for engineers, regulators and the public alike. For now, the machines are not plotting against us, but they do need careful supervision and thoughtful design to keep everyone safe.\nIf you saw a robot lose control right in front of you, would you trust having machines like this in your daily life?

        "Summary": "Over 184 million account credentials were exposed in an unsecured database, revealing sensitive information from platforms like Google, Microsoft and Apple.",
        "Content": "Data breaches are no longer rare events but a persistent problem.\nWe\u2019ve been seeing regular incidents at public-facing companies across various sectors, including healthcare, retail and finance. While bad actors are certainly to blame, these corporations aren\u2019t entirely without fault. They often make it easy for hackers to access user data by failing to protect it properly.\nA recent example came to light when a cybersecurity researcher discovered an open database containing over 184 million account credentials.\nHow the database was uncovered and what it contained\nCybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler has revealed the existence of an open database that contains 184,162,718 million account credentials. These include email addresses, passwords, usernames and URLs for platforms such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat.\nThe information also covers banking services, medical platforms and government accounts. Most shockingly, the entire dataset was left completely unsecured. There was no encryption, no authentication required and no form of access control. It was simply a plain text file sitting online for anyone to find.\n19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF\nFowler located the database during routine scanning of publicly exposed assets. What he found was staggering. The file included hundreds of millions of unique records containing user credentials linked to the world\u2019s largest technology and communication platforms. There were also account details for financial services and official portals used by state institutions.\nThe file was not protected in any way. Anyone who discovered the link could open it in a browser and instantly view sensitive personal data. No software exploit was needed. No password was asked for. It was as open as a public document.\n200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH\nWhere did the data come from\nFowler believes the data was harvested using an infostealer. These lightweight tools are favored by cybercriminals for their ability to silently extract login credentials and other private information from compromised devices. Once stolen, the data is often sold on dark web forums or used in targeted attacks.\nAfter reporting the breach, the hosting provider quickly removed access to the file. However, the owner of the database remains unknown. The provider did not disclose who uploaded it or whether the database was part of a legitimate archive that was accidentally published. Fowler could not determine whether this was the result of negligence or an operation with malicious intent.\nTo verify the data, Fowler contacted some individuals listed in the records. Several confirmed that the information was accurate. This confirmation turns what might seem like abstract statistics into something very real. These were not outdated or irrelevant details. These were live credentials that could allow anyone to hijack personal accounts in seconds.\n1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK\nHR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK\n6 ways to protect yourself after a data breach\n1. Change your password on every platform: If your login credentials have been exposed, it\u2019s not enough to change the password on just one account. Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\nOur top-rated password manager delivers powerful protection to help keep your accounts secure. It features real-time data breach monitoring to alert you if your login details have been exposed, plus a built-in data breach scanner that checks your saved emails, passwords and credit card information against known leak databases. A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.\n2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data.\n3. Watch for unusual account activity: After a breach, it\u2019s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions.\n4. Invest in personal data removal services: You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.\n5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser.\nThe best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.\n6. Keep your software and devices up to date: Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even apps need to be updated regularly to patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you\u2019re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system.\nHACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES\nKurt\u2019s key takeaway\nSecurity is not only the responsibility of companies and hosting providers. Users need to adopt better practices, including unique passwords, multifactor authentication and regular reviews of their digital footprint. The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent. In an era where artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and global connectivity are reshaping technology, it is unacceptable that plain text files containing financial and governmental credentials are still left sitting online.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDo you feel that companies are doing enough to protect your data from hackers and other cyber threats?

        "Summary": "The 2025 AI Security Report details how criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to impersonate people, automate scams, and attack security systems on a massive scale.",
        "Content": "Imagine your phone rings and the voice on the other end sounds just like your boss, a close friend, or even a government official. They urgently ask for sensitive information, except it's not really them. It's a deepfake, powered by AI, and you're the target of a sophisticated scam. These kinds of attacks are happening right now, and they're getting more convincing every day.\nThat's the warning sounded by the 2025 AI Security Report, unveiled at the RSA Conference (RSAC), one of the world's biggest gatherings for cybersecurity experts, companies, and law enforcement. The report details how criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to impersonate people, automate scams, and attack security systems on a massive scale.\nFrom hijacked AI accounts and manipulated models to live video scams and data poisoning, the report paints a picture of a rapidly evolving threat landscape, one that's touching more lives than ever before.\nAI tools are leaking sensitive data\nOne of the biggest risks of using AI tools is what users accidentally share with them. A recent analysis by cybersecurity firm Check Point found that 1 in every 80 AI prompts includes high-risk data, and about 1 in 13 contains sensitive information that could expose users or organizations to security or compliance risks.\nThis data can include passwords, internal business plans, client information, or proprietary code. When shared with AI tools that are not secured, this information can be logged, intercepted, or even leaked later.\nDeepfake scams are now real-time and multilingual\nAI-powered impersonation is getting more advanced every month. Criminals can now fake voices and faces convincingly in real time. In early 2024, a British engineering firm lost 20 million pounds after scammers used live deepfake video to impersonate company executives during a Zoom call. The attackers looked and sounded like trusted leaders and convinced an employee to transfer funds.\nReal-time video manipulation tools are now being sold on criminal forums. These tools can swap faces and mimic speech during video calls in multiple languages, making it easier for attackers to run scams across borders.\nAI is running phishing and scam operations at scale\nSocial engineering has always been a part of cybercrime. Now, AI is automating it. Attackers no longer need to speak a victim\u2019s language, stay online constantly, or manually write convincing messages.\nTools like GoMailPro use ChatGPT to create phishing and spam emails with perfect grammar and native-sounding tone. These messages are far more convincing than the sloppy scams of the past. GoMailPro can generate thousands of unique emails, each slightly different in language and urgency, which helps them slip past spam filters. It is actively marketed on underground forums for around $500 per month, making it widely accessible to bad actors.\nAnother tool, the X137 Telegram Console, leverages Gemini AI to monitor and respond to chat messages automatically. It can impersonate customer support agents or known contacts, carrying out real-time conversations with multiple targets at once. The replies are uncensored, fast, and customized based on the victim\u2019s responses, giving the illusion of a human behind the screen.\nAI is also powering large-scale sextortion scams. These are emails that falsely claim to have compromising videos or photos and demand payment to prevent them from being shared. Instead of using the same message repeatedly, scammers now rely on AI to rewrite the threat in dozens of ways. For example, a basic line like \"Time is running out\" might be reworded as \"The hourglass is nearly empty for you,\" making the message feel more personal and urgent while also avoiding detection.\nBy removing the need for language fluency and manual effort, these AI tools allow attackers to scale their phishing operations dramatically. Even inexperienced scammers can now run large, personalized campaigns with almost no effort.\nStolen AI accounts are sold on the dark web\nWith AI tools becoming more popular, criminals are now targeting the accounts that use them. Hackers are stealing ChatGPT logins, OpenAI API keys, and other platform credentials to bypass usage limits and hide their identity. These accounts are often stolen through malware, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks. The stolen credentials are then sold in bulk on Telegram channels and underground forums. Some attackers are even using tools that can bypass multi-factor authentication and session-based security protections. These stolen accounts allow criminals to access powerful AI tools and use them for phishing, malware generation, and scam automation.\nWHAT TO DO IF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS ON THE DARK WEB\nMALWARE STEALS BANK CARDS AND PASSWORDS FROM MILLIONS OF DEVICES\nJailbreaking AI is now a common tactic\nCriminals are finding ways to bypass the safety rules built into AI models. On the dark web, attackers share techniques for jailbreaking AI so it will respond to requests that would normally be blocked. Common methods include:\n- Telling the AI to pretend it is a fictional character that has no rules or limitations\n- Phrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenarios\n- Asking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged\nSome AI models can even be tricked into jailbreaking themselves. Attackers prompt the model to create input that causes it to override its own restrictions. This shows how AI systems can be manipulated in unexpected and dangerous ways.\nAI-generated malware is entering the mainstream\nAI is now being used to build malware, phishing kits, ransomware scripts, and more. Recently, a group called FunkSac was identified as the leading ransomware gang using AI. Its leader admitted that at least 20% of their attacks are powered by AI. FunkSec has also used AI to help launch attacks that flood websites or services with fake traffic, making them crash or go offline. These are known as denial-of-service attacks. The group even created its own AI-powered chatbot to promote its activities and communicate with victims on its public website..\nSome cybercriminals are even using AI to help with marketing and data analysis after an attack. One tool called Rhadamanthys Stealer 0.7 claimed to use AI for \"text recognition\" to sound more advanced, but researchers later found it was using older technology instead. This shows how attackers use AI buzzwords to make their tools seem more advanced or trustworthy to buyers.\nOther tools are more advanced. One example is DarkGPT, a chatbot built specifically to sort through huge databases of stolen information. After a successful attack, scammers often end up with logs full of usernames, passwords, and other private details. Instead of sifting through this data manually, they use AI to quickly find valuable accounts they can break into, sell, or use for more targeted attacks like ransomware.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web\nPoisoned AI models are spreading misinformation\nSometimes, attackers do not need to hack an AI system. Instead, they trick it by feeding it false or misleading information. This tactic is called AI poisoning, and it can cause the AI to give biased, harmful, or completely inaccurate answers. There are two main ways this happens:\n- Training poisoning: Attackers sneak false or harmful data into the model during development\n- Retrieval poisoning: Misleading content online gets planted, which the AI later picks up when generating answers\nIn 2024, attackers uploaded 100 tampered AI models to the open-source platform Hugging Face. These poisoned models looked like helpful tools, but when people used them, they could spread false information or output malicious code.\nA large-scale example came from a Russian propaganda group called Pravda, which published more than 3.6 million fake articles online. These articles were designed to trick AI chatbots into repeating their messages. In tests, researchers found that major AI systems echoed these false claims about 33% of the time.\nHOW SCAMMERS USE AI TOOLS TO FILE PERFECT-LOOKING TAX RETURNS IN YOUR NAME\nHow to protect yourself from AI-driven cyber threats\nAI-powered cybercrime blends realism, speed, and scale. These scams are not just harder to detect. They are also easier to launch. Here\u2019s how to stay protected:\n1) Avoid entering sensitive data into public AI tools: Never share passwords, personal details, or confidential business information in any AI chat, even if it seems private. These inputs can sometimes be logged or misused.\n2) Use strong antivirus software: AI-generated phishing emails and malware can slip past outdated security tools. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.\n3) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): 2FA adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts, including AI platforms. It makes it much harder for attackers to break in using stolen passwords.\n4) Be extra cautious with unexpected video calls or voice messages: If something feels off, even if the person seems familiar, verify before taking action. Deepfake audio and video can sound and look very real.\n5) Use a personal data removal service: With AI-powered scams and deepfake attacks on the rise, criminals are increasingly relying on publicly available personal information to craft convincing impersonations or target victims with personalized phishing. By using a reputable personal data removal service, you can reduce your digital footprint on data broker sites and public databases. This makes it much harder for scammers to gather the details they need to convincingly mimic your identity or launch targeted AI-driven attacks.\nWhile no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\n6) Consider identity theft protection: If your data is leaked through a scam, early detection is key. Identity protection services can monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.\n7) Regularly monitor your financial accounts: AI-generated phishing, malware, and account takeover attacks are now more sophisticated and widespread than ever, as highlighted in the 2025 AI Security Report. By frequently reviewing your bank and credit card statements for suspicious activity, you can catch unauthorized transactions early, often before major damage is done. Quick detection is crucial, especially since stolen credentials and financial information are now being traded and exploited at scale by cybercriminals using AI.\n8) Use a secure password manager: Stolen AI accounts and credential stuffing attacks are a growing threat, with hackers using automated tools to break into accounts and sell access on the dark web. A secure password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, making it far more difficult for attackers to compromise your logins, even if some of your information is leaked or targeted by AI-driven attacks. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.\n9) Keep your software updated: AI-generated malware and advanced phishing kits are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. To stay ahead of these evolving threats, ensure all your devices, browsers, and applications are updated with the latest security patches. Regular updates close security gaps that AI-powered malware and cybercriminals are actively seeking to exploit.\nKurt's key takeaways\nCybercriminals are now using AI to power some of the most convincing and scalable attacks we\u2019ve ever seen. From deepfake video calls and AI-generated phishing emails to stolen AI accounts and malware written by chatbots, these scams are becoming harder to detect and easier to launch. Attackers are even poisoning AI models with false information and creating fake tools that look legitimate but are designed to do harm. To stay safe, it\u2019s more important than ever to use strong antivirus protection, enable multi-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive data with AI tools you do not fully trust.\nHave you noticed AI scams getting more convincing?

        "Summary": "The FBI warns that cybercriminals can exploit old, unpatched routers. Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson urges you to check if yours is listed.",
        "Content": "We stay on top of updates for our phones and laptops. Some of us even make sure our smartwatches and security cameras are running the latest firmware. But routers often get overlooked. If it's working, we assume it's fine, but that mindset can be risky.\nNow, the FBI has issued a warning that cybercriminals are actively exploiting old, unpatched and outdated routers. The alert, released in May 2025, explains how aging network devices with known flaws are being hijacked by malware and used to power anonymous cybercrime operations. A forgotten device in your home can silently become a tool for attackers.\nThe FBI alert\nThe FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center published a public service announcement on May 7, 2025, cautioning both individuals and organizations that criminals are taking advantage of outdated routers that no longer receive security patches.\nDevices manufactured around 2010 or earlier are especially vulnerable, as vendors have long ceased providing firmware updates for them. According to the FBI, such end-of-life routers have been breached by cyber actors using a variant of the \"TheMoon\" malware, allowing attackers to install proxy services on the devices and conduct illicit activities anonymously.\nIn essence, home and small-office routers are being quietly conscripted into proxy networks that mask the perpetrators' identities online. The alert notes that through networks like \"Anyproxy,\" criminals have been selling access to the infected routers as proxy nodes. In these schemes, paying customers can route their internet traffic through unwitting victims' routers, obscuring their own location while the victim's device (and IP address) bears the blame.\nFBI WARNS ABOUT NEW EXTORTION SCAM TARGETING SENSITIVE DATA\nWhich routers are affected?\nThe FBI bulletin even names specific router models as frequent targets, including:\n- Cisco M10\n- Cisco Linksys E1500\n- Cisco Linksys E1550\n- Cisco Linksys WRT610N\n- Cisco Linksys E1000\n- Linksys E1200\n- Linksys E2500\n- Linksys E3200\n- Linksys WRT320N\n- Linksys E4200\n- Linksys WRT310N\nAll of these devices are roughly a decade or more old and have known security vulnerabilities that were never patched once support ended. With their firmware updates long discontinued, any still in use are soft targets for attackers.\nWHAT EXACTLY IS A DATA BREACH? WHY SHOULD I CARE?\nHow hackers exploit these routers\nMany recent infections stem from devices with remote administration exposed to the internet. Attackers scan for such routers, exploiting known firmware flaws without needing passwords. A single crafted web request can trick an older device into running malicious code. Once inside, malware often alters settings, opening ports or disabling security features, to maintain control and connect to external command-and-control servers.\nOne prominent threat is TheMoon, a malware strain first seen in 2014 that exploited flaws in Linksys routers. It has since evolved into a stealthy botnet builder, transforming infected routers into proxy nodes. Instead of launching direct attacks, TheMoon reroutes third-party traffic, masking hackers' identities behind everyday home networks. Cybercrime platforms like Faceless sell access to these infected routers as \"residential proxies,\" making them valuable assets in the digital underground.\nFor users, a compromised router means slower connections, exposure to phishing and spyware, and potential legal trouble if criminals abuse their IP address. For businesses, the risk is even higher: Outdated routers can be exploited for deeper network intrusions, data theft and ransomware attacks. In critical sectors, the consequences can be severe, affecting safety and compliance.\nHOW TO REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL INFO FROM PEOPLE-SEARCH SITES\n200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH\n6 ways to stay safe from router hackers\nGiven the serious threats posed by outdated and compromised routers, taking proactive measures is essential. Here are six practical steps you can follow to protect your network and keep hackers at bay.\n1) Replace your old router if it's no longer supported: If your router is more than five to seven years old, or if you can't find any recent updates for it on the manufacturer's website, it might be time to upgrade. Older routers often stop getting security fixes, which makes them an easy target for hackers. To check, look at the label on your router for the model number, then search online for \"[model number] firmware update.\" If the last update was years ago, consider replacing it with a newer model from a trusted brand.\nIf you're not sure which router to get, check out my list of top routers for the best security. It includes models with strong security features and compatibility with VPN services.\n2) Keep your router's firmware updated: Your router runs software called firmware, which needs to be updated just like your phone or computer. To do this, open a web browser and type your router's IP address (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1), then log in using the username and password (usually found on a sticker on the router). Once inside, look for a section called \"Firmware Update,\" \"System\" or \"Administration,\" and check if an update is available. Apply it if there is one. Some newer routers also have apps that make this even easier.\n3) Turn off remote access: Remote access lets you control your router from outside your home network, but it also opens the door for hackers. You can turn this off by logging into your router's settings (using the same steps as above), then finding a setting called \"Remote Management,\" \"Remote Access\" or \"WAN Access.\" Make sure this feature is disabled, then save the changes and restart your router.\n4) Use a strong password for your router settings: Don't leave your router using the default login, like \"admin\" and \"password.\" That's the first thing hackers try. Change it to a long, strong password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. A good example would be something like T#8r2k!sG91xm4vL. Try to avoid using the same password you use elsewhere. You can usually change the login password in the \"Administration\" or \"Security\" section of the router settings. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.\n5) Look out for strange behavior and act quickly: If your internet feels unusually slow, your devices randomly disconnect or your streaming buffers more than usual, it could mean something is wrong. Go into your router settings and check the list of connected devices. If you see something you don't recognize, it could be a sign of a breach. In that case, update the firmware, change your passwords and restart the router. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, call your internet provider for help.\n6) Reporting to authorities: The FBI asks that victims or those who suspect a compromise report incidents to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, which can help authorities track and mitigate broader threats.\nSUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES\nKurt's key takeaway\nThis isn't just about asking everyone to upgrade their old gear. It's about the bigger issue of who's actually responsible when outdated devices turn into security risks. Most people don't think twice about the router sitting in a corner, quietly doing its job years past its prime. But attackers do. They see forgotten hardware as easy targets.

        "Content": "Trump names nominees to take over commands in the Middle East and Africa\nPresident Donald Trump is nominating Vice Adm. Brad Cooper to take over as the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East\nWASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is nominating Vice Adm. Brad Cooper to take over as the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, the Pentagon said Wednesday. If he is confirmed, it would mark just the second time that a Navy admiral has held the job.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement that Trump also is nominating Air Force Lt. Gen. Dagvin Anderson to head U.S. Africa Command. Anderson would be the first Air Force general to lead the command, which was created in 2007.\nCooper is currently deputy commander of U.S. Central Command and has extensive experience serving and leading troops in the Middle East. The current head of the command, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, is slated to retire after more than three years in the post.\nIt is a crucial role as the region has been shaken by conflict, with the Trump administration pushing to broker a ceasefire deal after 20 months of war in Gaza and pressing for an agreement with Iran in negotiations over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.\nA 1989 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Cooper commanded naval forces in the Middle East for close to three years as the head of the Navy's 5th Fleet in Bahrain. He left in February 2024 to take over as deputy at Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and is based in Tampa.\nArmy and Marine generals have largely held the Middle East job since it was created in 1983. And two of the recent leaders \u2014 former Army Gen. Lloyd Austin and former Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, went on to serve as defense secretary. Central Command covers 21 countries across central and south Asia and northeast Africa and has overseen the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Syria and Yemen.\nThe only Navy officer to ever lead Central Command was Adm. William Fallon, who resigned after a year and retired. At the time, Fallon said he was stepping down due to press reports that suggested he was opposed to then-President George W. Bush's Iran policies. He said the reports were wrong but the perception had become a distraction.\nCooper is a surface warfare officer and served on guided-missile cruisers, destroyers, aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. He commanded a destroyer and a cruiser.\nDuring his time leading the 5th Fleet, Cooper set up the Navy's first unmanned and artificial intelligence task force, and he led naval operations against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. He also oversaw the Navy's role in Operation Prosperity Guardian, the U.S.-led coalition created in late 2023 to counter Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea.\nHe previously served as commander of Naval Surface Force Atlantic and commander of U.S. Naval Forces Korea. Cooper is the son of a career Army officer and got his master\u2019s degree in strategic intelligence from the National Intelligence University.\nAnderson, nominated to lead operations in Africa, is a pilot who has flown the KC-135 tanker, the C-130 transport aircraft and the U-28A surveillance aircraft used largely by special operations forces. He has flown more than 3,400 flight hours, including 738 in combat.\nHe is currently serving as the director of joint force development on the Joint Staff.\nAccording to the Air Force, he commanded a special operations squadron, an expeditionary squadron, an operations group and a special operations wing. He also led the task force that coordinated the repositioning of U.S. forces from Somalia and headed Special Operations Command, Africa, from 2019 to 2021.\nAfrica Command is the newest of the Pentagon's geographic commands and covers the bulk of the African continent. Much of the U.S. military's efforts there have focused on combatting extremist groups and training local forces.\nAnderson would be the seventh general to head Africa Command. To date, four of the previous leaders were Army generals and two were Marines.\nAnderson is from Ypsilanti, Michigan, and graduated from the ROTC program at Washington University in St. Louis.",

A hate crime enhancement was part of the verdict. His attorneys, public defenders Ann Larson and Luke Harrison, didn't immediately return voicemail messages seeking comment.\nVogel faces a mandatory life sentence when he's sentenced on June 27.\nHe is already serving a 20-year prison term handed down in 2018 for repeatedly stabbing his mother, strangling her and attempting to snap her neck, according to an appellate opinion upholding that conviction.\nA guard found Laureano's body hanging from the top bunk of the cell he shared with Vogel on Aug. 27, according to a criminal complaint. Laureano's hands and feet were tied together with orange material.\nVogel, who is white, told the guard that he killed Laureano because Laureano was Black and gay, the complaint said. He said he knocked Laureano out, tied his hands and feet and strangled him.\nInvestigators discovered numerous cut strips of orange cloth around the cell as well as a handwritten note that said, \u201cKill all humans!\u201d followed by profanities directed at Black people and gay people, according to the complaint.\nLaureano was serving a three-year sentence in battery and robbery cases. His mother, Phyllis Laureano, filed a federal lawsuit in February accusing prison officials of failing to protect him from Vogel. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.\nGreen Bay Correctional Institute, a maximum security facility, opened in 1898. Republicans have been calling for years to close the prison along with the Waupun Correctional Institution, another maximum security facility where seven inmates have died since 2023. But concerns over job losses and the cost of building a new prison have stymied any progress on either front.",

But Trump administration social media posts blasting Morales Reyes as a potential presidential assassin remained online.\nAttorneys for Morales Reyes say he isn't a danger to the public, and activists believe he\u2019s a scapegoat in an increasing hostile environment for immigrants. Meanwhile, federal authorities say they\u2019re pushing ahead with deportation in part because the 54-year-old doesn\u2019t have legal permission to live in the country.\nHere are things to know about the case:\nMorales Reyes immigrated from Mexico in the 1980s, according to his attorney. A married man with three U.S. citizen children, he worked as a dishwasher in Milwaukee.\nFederal immigration agents took him into custody last month after he dropped his daughter at school.\nDays later Noem blasted his photo on social media, along with an excerpt of a letter he purportedly wrote in English calling for Trump to be shot at a rally. The arrest was held up by the White House and Trump supporters as a success in the administration\u2019s aggressive crackdown on immigration.\nBut the details quickly unraveled, including the fact that Morales Reyes doesn\u2019t speak English well and can\u2019t write in the language.\nOn Tuesday, authorities in Wisconsin charged Demetric D. Scott of forging the letter in an effort to blame Morales Reyes, a potential witness against him in a 2023 attack. Scott is accused of knocking Morales Reyes off his bicycle, injuring him with a box cutter and then taking the bike, according to court records.\nCourt documents said law enforcement officials listened to calls Scott made about the letters and a plot to have someone picked up by immigration agents, all aiming to have the armed robbery and aggravated battery charges dismissed. He also admitted to police that he wrote the letters, documents said.\nScott, who is in the Milwaukee County Jail, is awaiting a July trial. He's due in court on Tuesday on the newer charges, including felony witness intimidation and identity theft.\nA message left Tuesday for the state public defender\u2019s office wasn\u2019t immediately returned. Scott's attorneys have previously declined comment.\nEarlier this year, Morales Reyes applied for a U visa, which is for people in the country illegally who become victims of serious crimes. The application was pending, according to his attorneys.\nMorales Reyes has been detained at Dodge Detention Center in Juneau, which is about 70 miles (112.65 kilometers) north of Milwaukee.\nHomeland Security officials have not publicly corrected the information on the presidential threat.\nInstead they\u2019ve doubled down on pursuing an immigration case against him. They allege Morales Reyes entered the country illegally at least nine times between 1998 and 2005 and that he has a criminal background.\n\u201cThis criminal illegal alien is no longer under investigation for threats against the President, but will remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings,\u201d DHS said in a statement Wednesday.\nMorales Reyes is accused of two incidents in 1996, according to his attorneys.\nIn one he was arrested for damaging property in a hit-and-run but not charged. In another he was ticketed for disorderly conduct and criminal damage after a dispute with his wife. No one was injured, according to his attorney.\nAttorneys for Morales Reyes said the information on the threat should be corrected quickly as their client and his family are facing harassment and threats.\n\u201cThis administration has jumped quickly to make announcements that they think will play well to their narrative of immigrants being dangerous,\u201d said attorney Cain Oulahan.\nImmigrant rights advocates have rallied around Morales Reyes, including a group who stood outside a downtown Chicago immigration court Wednesday ahead of a brief hearing in the deportation case. Several held a large banner that read, \u201cStop Scapegoating Immigrants.\u201d\nMorales Reyes, wearing a green jail jumpsuit, appeared via livestream. He spoke through a Spanish interpreter, saying he understood the case.\nOulahan told the judge that he was hoping for a quick resolution, considering the public accusations made against Morales Reyes. He\u2019s seeking for Morales Reyes to be released on bond.\nA government attorney told the judge she didn\u2019t have any information about the threat accusation.\nImmigration Judge Carla Espinoza said more time was needed to review documents. She set another hearing for June 10.\nThe situation has been difficult for Morales Reyes and his relatives.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a family man. This has been extremely stressful on him,\u201d said Oulahan. \u201cHe\u2019s very worried.\"",

Xinis described one document as \u201crelatively boilerplate.\u201d It was a request by the Trump administration to temporarily halt discovery, an early phase of a lawsuit where parties share evidence.\n\u201cIt does not disclose any potentially privileged or otherwise sensitive information for which a compelling government interest outweighs the right to access,\u201d Xinis wrote.\nXinis noted that some documents were public before the court was asked to seal them the next day. Those filings contained a back-and-forth between Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys and the U.S. government over efforts to return him from El Salvador.\nTrump administration lawyers often objected to answering questions, arguing that they involve state secrets, sensitive diplomatic negotiations and other protected information.\nFor example, the U.S. attorneys mentioned \u201cappropriate diplomatic discussions with El Salvador.\u201d But they wrote that disclosing the details \u201dcould negatively impact any outcome.\u201d\nXinis also ordered the partial release of a transcript from an April 30 court hearing. Some of it will be reacted to protect potentially classified information.\nWednesday's ruling was unrelated to the Trump administration pending invocation of the state secrets privilege, a legal doctrine often used in military cases. The administration has argued that releasing information about the Abrego Garcia matter in open court \u2014 or even to the judge in private \u2013 could jeopardize national security.\nXinis is yet to rule on the state secrets claim.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys have argued that the Trump administration has done nothing to return the Maryland construction worker. They say the government is invoking the privilege to hide behind the misconduct of mistakenly deporting him and refusing to bring him back.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s deportation violated a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order in 2019 that shielded Abrego Garcia from expulsion to his native country. The immigration judge determined that Abrego Garcia faced likely persecution by a local Salvadoran gang that terrorized his family.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s American wife sued over his deportation. Xinis ordered his return on April 4. The Supreme Court ruled on April 10 that the administration must work to bring him back.\nPresident Donald Trumptold ABC News in late April that he could retrieve Abrego Garcia with a phone call to El Salvador\u2019s president. But Trump said he wouldn\u2019t do it because Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, an allegation that Abrego Garcia denies and for which he was never charged.",

        "Content": "Cyber charter schools in Pennsylvania would see funding cut under bill passed by the state House\nA bill to reduce how much Pennsylvania school districts have to pay for cyber charter students is advancing in the state Legislature\nHARRISBURG, Pa. -- A Democratic-sponsored proposal to limit per-student payments to Pennsylvania's cyber charter schools and make other changes to how they operate narrowly passed the state House on Wednesday over Republican objections that it would imperil the online learning programs.\nThe 104-98 vote, with only two Republicans in favor, sets down a marker on the perennially contentious issue of school funding as state lawmakers work to complete the coming year's state budget for the fiscal year that starts in July.\nThe bill's $8,000 limit on how much public school districts would have to reimburse the cyber charters was the central piece of the sprawling legislation and would be a boost to the districts and the property tax payers who bear much of the cost of public education in Pennsylvania. There currently is no cap for the districts' payments to cyber charters, an amount now linked to how much districts spent on their own students in the prior year.\nSupporters said changes to the cyber charter rules are widely backed among the state's 500 school boards and that cyber school spending has been the subject of critical reviews, including recently by Republican Auditor General Tim DeFoor.\nBut opponents defended the existing system as a critical lifeline to the students and families that for various reasons have sought alternatives to traditional schools.\nThe bill would set annual tuition payments from school districts to cyber charters at $8,000 per student, with potential yearly increases. Special education funding would also see changes.\nCyber charters would not be able to maintain cash balances above 12% of their spending and would not be able to provide payments or gifts to parents as incentives to enroll their children.\nThe bill would bolster disclosure requirements regarding cyber charters' policies, instructional materials and budgets.\nIt would bar the state Education Department from approving any additional cyber charter schools through the 2029-30 school year. A new Cyber Charter School Funding and Policy Council would be set up to make recommendations concerning enrollment, governance and funding.\nDuring floor debate Wednesday, Rep. Martina White, a Philadelphia Republican, said the measure will \u201cclose real schools, displace real students, strip families of the very choices that they depend on to give their children a chance at success.\u201d\nThe moratorium would be highly damaging to cyber charters, said Rep. Craig Williams, a Delaware County Republican.\n\u201cYou limit the number of cyber charters now in existence, you choke off its funding, and eventually you can kill cyber charter. Sixty-plus thousand students in our school system, finding another way to learn, and we\u2019re going to choke it off with this bill,\u201d Williams said.\nThe chair of the House Education Committee, Lehigh County Democratic Rep. Peter Schweyer, enumerated cyber charter spending issues raised in the auditor general's report, including staff bonuses, gift cards, vehicle payments and fuel stipends.\n\u201cGift cards?\u201d Schweyer asked his colleagues. \u201cWe would all get in trouble if we were taking gift cards as part of our compensation.\u201d\nLeaders of existing public cyber charter schools say the measure would cut their funding by about $450 million or more across the state, with a third of the total reductions targeting special education student reimbursements.\nA Democratic analysis put the figure at more than $600 million.\nAbout 65,000 Pennsylvania students currently attend the state's 14 public cyber charter schools, which are public, nonprofit corporations. They do not have to follow all of the requirements mandated of public schools under state law.\nCyber charter school are considered independent public schools, approved to operate with a \u201ccharter\u201d issued by the Education Department. They use technology to provide much of the teaching. Students usually do not need to attend a physical location beyond certain events, such as standardized testing.\nThe proposal was sent over to the Republican majority state Senate for its consideration. The bill becomes part of a wider negotiations to determine the budget before lawmakers recess for the summer.",

Andy Beshear is stepping up his efforts to guarantee preschool access for every 4-year-old in the state\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear stepped up his efforts Wednesday to guarantee preschool access for every 4-year-old in the state, offering assurances his plan would reap widespread benefits \u2014 improving student performance while bolstering employment and family incomes.\nHaving been stymied by the state's GOP-supermajority legislature in recent years when he pitched his universal pre-K plan, Beshear kicked off a campaign in hopes of building grassroots support. It comes about seven months before lawmakers convene in January for their 2026 session, which could be the term-limited governor's last realistic chance to turn his ambitious preschool plan into law. The 2026 session will be highlighted by work to pass the state's next two-year budget.\nBeshear, a two-term governor seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, said every child \u201cdeserves a good start\u201d by ensuring they are prepared for kindergarten. The Bluegrass State is falling short of that goal, he said, pointing to statistics showing more than half of Kentucky children are unprepared for their first day of kindergarten, creating an achievement gap that's difficult to overcome.\n\u201cScripture tells us that children are a gift from God,\" Beshear said during his campaign-style stop in Louisville. \"And I believe that we have a responsibility as adults to build a better state for every single one of them. We all know that we can do this with pre-K for all. Let\u2019s finally get this done.\u201d\nNearly two-thirds of Kentucky's 120 counties lack sufficient child care to serve every family that needs it, the governor said. Workforce participation rates tend to be lower in counties with fewer childcare options, Beshear's administration said.\n\u201cKentucky will never reach its potential if our children\u2019s zip code determines their place in the world by the first day of kindergarten,\u201d said Democratic Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman, a former public school teacher and administrator. \u201cThe time for pre-K is now.\u201d\nThe benefits of his pre-K proposal would be much broader and would include increasing the state's workforce by enabling more parents to go back to work, Beshear said. And it would help ease the financial burden on parents with young children, he said.\n\u201cAmerican families right now are struggling, struggling to pay the bills, and child care is a big part of that,\" Beshear said. \"Pre-K for all could ease the financial burden facing our hardworking families and make paying those bills not just a little but a lot easier.\u201d\nBeshear on Wednesday did not delve into how much state-funded preschool would cost, but he pointed to a study indicating every $1 invested in pre-K generates $10 cycling through the state economy.\nLeading up to the 2024 legislative session, Beshear's budget plan included $172 million each year of the following two-year budget cycle to provide preschool for 4-year-olds. Beshear has said the expense is \u201cmore than affordable,\u201d amounting to a fraction of the massive surplus in the state's budget reserve trust fund. That preschool proposal and others like it have made no headway with GOP lawmakers.\nGuaranteeing preschool access should be nonpartisan, Beshear said Wednesday. He said that some 18 states \u2014 including some run by Republicans \u2014 offer pre-K access for all 4-year-olds.\nBeshear and other top members of his administration planned events in Kentucky's biggest media markets over the coming days to promote the preschool plan.\nIn another sign he's stepping up the public campaign for his pre-K proposal, Beshear issued an executive order creating an advisory committee that will hold statewide public meetings on the issue. The committee \u2014 made up of people with backgrounds in education, workforce development and business \u2014 will make a written report to the governor this fall detailing its findings and recommendations.",

        "Content": "Georgia school district considers property tax hike to pay for school officers after shooting\nOfficials in the Georgia school district where four people were killed in a September school shooting are considering a property tax increase to pay for school-based police officers\nWINDER, Ga. -- Officials in the Georgia school district where four people were killed in a September shooting at Apalachee High School are considering a property tax increase to pay for school-based police officers.\nBarrow County Superintendent Dallas LeDuff told school board members Tuesday that the tax increase would be necessary because county government has informed the school district that it will no longer pay for sheriff's deputies, local news outlets reported.\nThe school district and Barrow County Commission have been splitting the price of deputies assigned as school resource officers since 2017. That number was originally 12, rose to 16 in 2024, and then to 24 after the shooting. That would place at least two officers in the district\u2019s high schools and at least one officer in every other school, although officials haven\u2019t yet been able to hire 24 deputies.\nCounty commissioners sent a letter to LeDuff last month saying county government will for now pay half only 12 salaries, and eventually stop paying any of the costs.\n\u201cWhat they would like to see happen is that we as a school system be responsible for funding 100% of all direct and indirect costs for all 24 officers that we are staffing now, along with future officers we might add,\u201d LeDuff said.\nThe superintendent said the district will cover whatever the officers cost, calling it \u201dnonnegotiable.\u201d The district has been under intense local pressure since the shooting to improve security, agreeing to install weapons detectors at its high schools and middle schools this year after months of community outcry.\n\u201cEspecially in light of Sept. 4, I am deeply concerned with the Board of Commissioners\u2019 underlying notion that 2,000-plus Barrow County school system employees and over 15,000 Barrow County students are no longer included in their definition of public safety,\u201d Barrow County school board member Kayla Hendrix said. \u201cPerhaps we need to ask the county commissioners who qualifies under their definition of public safety.\u201d\nOfficials have said the believe a quick response by officers at Apalachee prevented more victims. The Sept. 4 shooting killed teachers Richard \u201cRicky\u201d Aspinwall, 39, and Cristina Irimie, 53, and students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14. Another teacher and eight more students were wounded, seven of them hit by gunfire. Colt Gray, then a 14-year-old freshman, has been indicted as an adult for murder and other crimes.\nBarrow County commissioners wrote in their letter that voters had approved a plan to exempt some senior citizens from paying school property taxes and that the county therefore believes it is inappropriate to use property taxes collected for county government to subsidize school expenses.\n\u201cIt is imperative that Barrow County government ensure that no county general fund dollars \u2014 for which there is no senior exemption \u2014 are dedicated to areas that would otherwise be funded by school taxes and the associated millage rate,\u201d county spokesperson Brian Stewart said.\nPaying the expenses for next year would cost the school district more than $1 million. The district\u2019s proposed property tax increase would cost the owner of a $100,000 property about $20 a year.\nThe issue could come up at a county commission meeting next week. William Philip said he plans to go to that meeting to protest the decision.\n\u201cThis is a serious issue. This has to do with our kids\u2019 safety,\u201d Philip said. \u201cBad politics. Horrible politics. A lot of parents can\u2019t wait to go to the commissioners meeting and see.\u201d",

        "Content": "Nebraska is the latest state to ban transgender students from girls' sports\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has signed into law a measure banning transgender athletes from girls\u2019 sports\nLINCOLN, Neb. -- Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen signed into law Wednesday a measure banning transgender students from girls\u2019 sports, making the state the latest to keep transgender athletes from competing on women\u2019s and girls\u2019 teams.\nPillen signed the law flanked by dozens of lawmakers, women athletes and other advocates \u2014 including former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines, who has made a name for herself as a vocal advocate of banning transgender athletes from women\u2019s sports.\nThe measure passed by the Nebraska Legislature last week broke a filibuster by a single vote cast along party lines. It was pared down from its initial form, which also sought to bar transgender students from using bathrooms and locker rooms corresponding with their gender identity.\nSponsors agreed to drop the bathroom and locker room ban when one Republican \u2014 Omaha Sen. Merv Riepe \u2014 declared he would vote against it otherwise.\nThe measure was first introduced in 2023 by then-freshman Sen. Kathleen Kauth, but failed to advance as lawmakers angrily argued over Kauth's other bill that sought to bar gender-affirming care for transgender minors under the age of 19. An amended version that banned gender-affirming surgery \u2014 but not all gender-affirming care \u2014 for minors later passed and was enacted that year.\nOn Wednesday, Kauth promised to revive her bathroom and locker room ban next year, reiterating her rejection that people can determine their own gender.\n\u201cMen are men and women are women,\u201d she said, and urged voters in Riepe's district to pressure him to support it.\nRepublicans behind the sports ban say it protects women and girls and their ability to fairly compete in sports. Opponents say with so few transgender students seeking to participate in sports, the measure is a solution in search of a problem.\nFewer than 10 transgender students have participated in middle school and high school sports in the state over the past decade, according to the Nebraska School Activities Association.\nAt least 24 other states have adopted similar bans. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order this year intended to dictate which sports competitions transgender athletes can enter and has battled in court with Maine over that state\u2019s allowing transgender athletes in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska denounced the measure.\nACLU Nebraska Executive Director Mindy Rush Chipman said the ban \u201cslams the door shut\u201d for some transgender students to fully participate in their school communities.\n\u201cThis ban will only create problems, not solve any,\u201d Rush Chipman said, adding that \u201cthe constant targeting of LGBTQ+ Nebraskans must stop.\u201d",

We need Marcelo back home. It\u2019s no family without him,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Paulo Gomes Pereira said in a video released by his son's attorney. \u201cWe love America. Please, bring my son back.\u201d\nMarcelo Gomes da Silva, who came to the U.S. from Brazil at age 7, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday. Authorities have said the agents were looking for the teenager\u2019s father, who owns the car Gomes da Silva was driving at the time.\n\u201cLike any local law enforcement officer, if you encounter someone that has a warrant or \u2026 he\u2019s here illegally, we will take action on it,\u201d Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told reporters Monday.\nGomes da Silva initially entered the country on a visitor visa and was later issued a student visa that has since lapsed, said his attorney, Robin Nice. She described him as deeply rooted in his community and a dedicated member of both the Milford High School marching band and a band at his church.\n\u201cThe actions by ICE do not make the community safer,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThey just sow fear through the immigrant community.\u201d\nA federal judge considering Gomes da Silva\u2019s request to be released while the immigration case proceeds has given the government until June 16 to respond and has ordered that Gomes da Silva not be moved out of Massachusetts without 48 hours\u2019 notice given to the court. A hearing in immigration court is scheduled for Thursday.\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said ICE officers were targeting a \u201cknown public safety threat\u201d and that Gomes da Silva\u2019s father \u201chas a habit of reckless driving at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour through residential areas.\u201d\n\u201cWhile ICE officers never intended to apprehend Gomes da Silva, he was found to be in the United States illegally and subject to removal proceedings, so officers made the arrest,\u201d she said in a statement.\nThe video released Wednesday shows Gomes da Silva's parents and younger siblings in the teen's bedroom. His sister describes watching movies with her brother and enjoying food he cooks for her, including \u201cchicken nuggets in the air fryer.\u201d\n\u201cI miss everything about him,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhen he gets back, I will give him a really big hug,\u201d Gomes da Silva's younger brother says. \u201cBut ICE, please get him out. Please.\u201d\nThe arrest has sparked outrage among Democratic officials, including Gov. Maura Healey, who demanded information about his location and whether he is being afforded due process.\n\u201cThey need to let him go,\u201d Healey said in a video posted Tuesday on the social platform X. \u201cMarcelo belongs in school, not in a detention center.\u201d\nOther supporters wore white and packed the stands of the high school gymnasium Tuesday night, when the volleyball team dedicated a match to their missing teammate.\n\"We will continue to pray and fight for our brother,\u201d the team said in an Instagram post ahead of the match.",

Henry McMaster is talking about all his priorities that the Republican legislature kept in the spending plan like tax cuts, disaster relief and teacher raises\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. -- The invitation from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he was bringing reporters together Wednesday to talk about his vetoes in the state budget.\nBut instead, it was a victory lap for both the Republican governor and the Republican-dominated General Assembly as McMaster spent his time talking about all his priorities that the legislature kept in the spending plan \u2014 not the 11 things worth $10,000 he took out of the 2025-26 fiscal year budget.\nIt was a stark reminder after nine years in office how much different McMaster is than his previous Republican predecessors, governors who relished in fighting the General Assembly, then often ripped into them or ignored their ideas on how to spend the state\u2019s billions of dollars.\n\u201cBack in the old days, nobody was talking to anybody,\u201d McMaster said, repeating his favorite tagline of \u201ccommunication, collaboration and cooperation.\u201d\nMcMaster issued 11 vetoes from the state's $14.5 billion spending plan that starts July 1. Just one struck money from the budget \u2014 $10,000 for what McMaster said was a duplicative effort to review a state agency.\nTen years ago, Gov. Nikki Haley struck 87 items from the $7 billion budget totaling more than $18 million. And in 2005, Gov. Mark Sanford vetoed 163 items worth $96 million from the $5.8 billion spending plan. A year later, an exasperated Sanford vetoed the entire budget and lawmakers quickly overrode him by wide margins.\nInstead of spending, McMaster's handful of vetoes were on rules like getting rid of a requirement that visitors to the new Pine Island State Park make reservations or striking out of the budget a provision allowing some school districts to use private companies for security.\nThere are so few vetoes that lawmakers don't expect to return to the Statehouse to try to override them.\nMcMaster kept what is effectively an $18,000 per year raise for the General Assembly in the budget.\nLawmakers will see their \u201cin-district compensation\u201d \u2014 money set aside for legislative duties that has few limits on how it can be spent \u2014 increase from $1,000 a month to $2,500 a month for all 46 senators and 124 House members.\nThe monthly stipend for lawmakers has not been increased in about 30 years. Their in-district compensation would increase from $12,000 a year to $30,000.\nLawmakers also get an annual salary of $10,400 that has not changed since 1990. In addition, they get money for meals, mileage to drive to Columbia and hotel rooms while in session.\nThe rest of the spending plan was much less controversial. There are pay raises for teachers, and the state\u2019s highest income tax rate will be cut from 6.2% to 6%.\nThere is $200 million to fix bridges, $35 million to pay for cleanup from Hurricane Helene last year and $50 million for a program to let parents use tax money to pay private school tuition that will undergo court scrutiny.\nAbout 80% of the more than $14 billion the state will spend next year is what the governor asked for back in January when he suggested a spending plan to lawmakers, a relationship he has carefully cultivated since 2017.\n\"Many of us are like a family. We go back a long way,\" McMaster said. \u201cYou try to understand the other fellow\u2019s point of view. sometimes he\u2019s right and I\u2019m wrong. sometimes it\u2019s the other way. Sometimes we\u2019re talking about the same things but using different words.\u201d\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that McMaster issued 11 vetoes instead of 10.",

And teachers, you have my word that I stand in support of you.\u201d\nKamoutsas previously served as general counsel and chief staff at the state's Education Department, before moving to the governor's office.\n\u201cStasi Kamoutsas has delivered on important issues like parental rights, school choice, and fighting back against radical ideologies in education,\u201d DeSantis said in a statement. \u201cI am confident that he will continue to serve our state well as the next Commissioner of Education.\u201d\nKamoutsas is expected to help carry out DeSantis' conservative education agenda, from banning public funds for diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, to restricting how schools teach about race and history, and dramatically expanding the state's school voucher system, which provides billions in public funds for scholarships to private and religious schools.\nAmong those who lauded Kamoutsas at Wednesday's meeting was former Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran, who has overseen what critics describe as the \u201chostile takeover\u201d of New College of Florida. He's among the slate of Republican former state lawmakers who are now helming state colleges and universities.\n\u201cEvery single major decision, I don't care if it was elimination of DEI, critical race theory, opening schools, demasking students, changing higher education, Stasi has been in that room, every single time,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cAnd not just as a participant. He's been in the room as a leader.\u201d\n___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, comes three months after the USDA advised states that it was ending the pandemic-era assistance program because it no longer reflected agency priorities.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get what the hell their priorities are if not feeding people and taking care of our farmers,\" Shapiro said at a news conference at a food bank warehouse in Philadelphia.\nThe USDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Harrisburg, asks the court to reverse the USDA's decision to end the reimbursement program.\nShapiro's administration, in the lawsuit, said the USDA's termination of the contract was illegal, saying the USDA didn't explain why it no longer reflected agency priorities and that the contract didn't expressly allow the USDA to terminate it for those reasons.\nShapiro said he was confident that Pennsylvania would win the lawsuit.\n\u201cA deal is a deal,\u201d Shapiro told the news conference. \u201cThey made a deal with our farmers, they made a deal with Pennsylvania and they broke it.\u201d\nThe loss to Pennsylvania is $13 million under a three-year contract, money that the state planned to use to buy food from farms to stock food banks. States also use the money to buy food from farms for school nutrition programs and child care centers. Purchases include commodities such as cheese, eggs, meat, fruits and vegetables.\nThe department, under then-President Joe Biden, announced a second round of funding through the program last year.\n___\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

        "Content": "Judge dismisses murder charges against officer in shooting of unarmed man in closet\nA federal judge has thrown out murder charges against a former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man hiding in a closet\nATLANTA -- A federal judge has thrown out murder charges against a former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man hiding in a closet.\nU.S. District Judge Michael Brown ruled Tuesday that Sung Kim, a 26-year veteran of the Atlanta police department, acted in self defense and shouldn't face charges in the 2019 killing of 21-year-old Jimmy Atchison.\n\u201cThe evidence for self-defense is so overwhelming it is hard to understand how Georgia could have brought these charges in the first place, much less continued with them over the two-and-a-half years since,\" Brown wrote in his ruling. \u201cDefendant's shooting of Mr. Atchison was textbook self-defense.\u201d\nKim was indicted in state court in 2022, but moved his case to federal court because he was assigned to an FBI fugitive task force when the shooting happened and thus was a federal officer.\nAtlanta activists have cited Atchison's death as an example of unjustified police violence against Black people. His name was often chanted by Atlanta protesters during Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020.\nThe shooting also sparked policy changes. The Atlanta Police Department withdrew its officers from federal task forces because task force members weren't allowed to wear body cameras, meaning there is no video of Atchison's shooting. Officers returned after federal agencies began allowing local task force officers to wear cameras.\nAtchison was killed on Jan. 22, 2019, after Kim and other task force members tried to arrest him on charges that he stole a woman\u2019s purse and cellphone in an armed robbery. Kim retired from the Atlanta Police Department several months later. A Fulton County grand jury indicted Kim on charges that included felony murder and involuntary manslaughter.\nOfficers forced their way into an apartment, prompting Atchison to jump out of a window, run through a second building and hide beneath a mound of clothes in a closet in another apartment. In his ruling, Brown rejected claims by a state witness that officers violated generally accepted police practices by entering the other apartment and the bedroom where Atchison was hiding.\nTestimony showed Kim shot Atchison in the face after Kim either yelled for Atchison to not move or show his hands. Atchison suddenly moved his hands from under the clothes. Family members say Atchison was raising his hands to surrender when Kim shot him in the face. Kim and other officers testified that they believed Atchison's move was threatening, as if he had a gun. Brown ruled that fear was reasonable and justified a shooting in self-defense.\n\u201cNothing required defendant to hold off shooting until he literally saw a gun in Mr. Atchison's hand,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cHe had a reasonable belief Mr. Atchison was armed and was going to shoot him. That is all that matters.\u201d\nNabika Atchison, Jimmy Atchison's sister, said in a statement that relatives are \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by Brown's decision, \u201cbut with today's climate surrounding police brutality, I can't say we are surprised.\u201d\nTanya Miller, a Democratic state House member and lawyer representing the Atchison family, said the decision is a \u201cpainful subversion of justice.\u201d\n\u201cThis decision underscores the troubling gap in accountability when local officers operate on federal task forces \u2014 a no-man's land where they can violate their own department's policies, the Constitution, take a young life, and still avoid standing trial,\u201d Miller wrote in a text message.\nDon Samuel, a lawyer for Kim, said via email that the ruling was correct.\n\u201cIt is hard to celebrate when a young man died,\" Samuel wrote, \"but there is no doubt that the decision of the Fulton County DA\u2019s office to compound the tragedy by prosecuting Sung Kim was an inexcusable abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\"\nThe Georgia state conference of the NAACP called on Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to appeal the ruling, saying it unjustly shields officers from accountability when they kill unarmed people.\n\u201cThis ruling is not just a blow to the Atchison family's pursuit of justice \u2014 it's a threat to civil rights and public safety across the nation,\u201d said Gerald Griggs, president of the Georgia NAACP.",

She receives intravenous nutrition through a special backpack for short bowel syndrome, which prevents her from being able to take in and process nutrients on her own, and lawyers said the treatment she receives is necessary at this stage for her to survive and isn't available in Mexico.\nThe family's attorneys from Public Counsel said in a statement that while they were grateful the administration \u201cacted swiftly\u201d to ensure the girl could continue her life-saving treatment, they hoped the case highlighted the need for better communication with federal immigration officials.\n\u201cWe cannot ignore the systemic challenges that brought Sofia to the brink,\u201d the attorneys said, using a pseudonym for the girl. \u201cHer parole was terminated without warning ... It took an international outcry and pressure from elected officials to get a response\u2014something that used to take a single phone call.\u201d\nHumanitarian parole, which doesn\u2019t put migrants on a path to U.S. citizenship, was widely used during the Biden administration to alleviate pressure on the U.S.-Mexico southern border. It was previously used on a case-by-case basis to address individual emergencies and also for people fleeing humanitarian crises around the world including Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos during the late 1970s.\nIn Mexico, the girl was largely confined to a hospital because of her medical condition, said her mother, Deysi Vargas. After joining a program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, she can now receive treatment at home in Bakersfield, California, and go to the park and store like other children, Vargas has said.\nLawyers said the girl's medical treatment, which requires 14 hours a day of intravenous nutrition, will not be necessary indefinitely but that she is not at the point where she could live without it.",

The phone call lasted about 10 minutes, with the president saying that voters will decide whether New Jersey remains a \u201chigh-tax, high-crime sanctuary state.\u201d\n\u201cNew Jersey is ready to pop out of that blue horror show and really get in there and vote for somebody that\u2019s going to make things happen,\u201d the president said.\nTrump's call for early voting echoed the pitch he made to voters in the 2024 presidential election.\nCiattarelli said his first executive order if elected would be to end any sanctuary policies for immigrants in the country illegally. Currently, the state attorney general has directed local law enforcement not to assist federal agents in civil immigration matters.\nThere is no legal definition for sanctuary city policies, but they generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.\nCiattarelli also said the attorney general he appoints if he wins won't be bringing lawsuits against the White House. New Jersey's current attorney general has pursued several high-profile challenges to the president's agenda, including a case challenging Trump's order calling for the end of birthright citizenship.\nCiattarelli is running against former radio talk host Bill Spadea, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac and a southern New Jersey contractor named Justin Barbera.\nEarly in-person voting begins Tuesday and goes through Sunday. Primary day is June 10, though voters have been sending mail-in ballots in since late April.\nThough the primary isn't over, Ciattarelli hinted at what attacks against his eventual Democratic challenger in the general election might be, saying the party's eight years in the governorship and more than two decades of power in the legislature have been a failure.\nThe Democratic field isn't set. There's a six-way contest between Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill; Mayors Ras Baraka of Newark and Steven Fulop of Jersey City; former state Senate President Steve Sweeney; and teacher's union president Sean Spiller.\nNew Jersey tilts Democratic in presidential and Senate elections in particular, and the party has a roughly 800,000 voter registration advantage over Republicans. But independents make up a significant bloc as well, and voters have tended to alternate between Democratic and Republican administrations for governor.",

The GEO Group argued to the Supreme Court that government contractors should be able to argue that issue on appeal quickly.\nThe Florida-based GEO Group is one of the top private detention providers in the country, with management or ownership of about 77,000 beds at 98 facilities.

He's could announce his candidacy later this summer.\nKennedy was first elected to the state Senate in 2014. Majority Republicans elected him president pro tem, the No. 2 position in the Senate, in 2023.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Blake Tillery of Vidalia is raising money for a possible bid. Other Republicans could seek the office as well, including state Sen.

        "Content": "California track-and-field championships draw limited protest over trans student's participation\nThe California high school track-and-field championship has kicked off to a relatively quiet atmosphere\nCLOVIS, Calif. -- A transgender teen will compete in the California high school track-and-field finals on Saturday, one day after advancing in the competition as a protest plane circled above the meet drew national attention, including criticism from President Donald Trump.\nAB Hernandez \u2014 a trans student who on Friday advanced in the girls high jump, long jump and triple jump \u2014 will be in the finals Saturday, competing under a new rule change that may be the first of its kind nationally by a high school sports governing body.\nThe new California Interscholastic Federation announced the new policy earlier this week in response to Hernandez\u2019s success. According to the policy, the CIF will let an additional student compete and medal in the events where Hernandez qualified.\nThe two-day championship kicked off in the sweltering heat at high school near Fresno. The atmosphere was relatively quiet Friday despite critics \u2014 including parents, conservative activists and President Donald Trump \u2014 calling for Hernandez to be barred from girls competition leading up to the meet.\nThere was some pushback Friday. A group of fewer than 10 people gathered outside the stadium ahead of the meet to protest Hernandez's participation. Some of them wore \u201cSave Girls\u2019 Sports\u201d T-shirts. At one point as Hernandez was attempting a high jump, someone in the stands yelled an insult.\nAn aircraft circled above the stadium for more than an hour during the events, carrying a banner that read, \u201cNo Boys in Girls\u2019 Sports!\u201d Two groups, the Independent Council on Women\u2019s Sports and Women Are Real, that oppose transgender athletes participating in women's sports took credit for flying the banner.\nSeparately, one person was arrested outside the competition on Friday after getting in a confrontation with another protester that turned physical, according to the Clovis Police Department.\nThe rest of the night ran smoothly for Hernandez, who finished the triple jump with a mark close to 41 feet (13 meters), nearly 10 inches (25 centimeters) ahead of her closest competitor, San Francisco Bay Area junior Kira Gant Hatcher.\nHernandez also led in the long jump with a mark close to 20 feet (6 meters) to advance to the final. She advanced in the high jump, clearing 5 feet, 5 inches (1.7 meters) with ease.\nShe did not address the press.\nThe CIF rule change reflects efforts to find a middle ground in the debate over trans girls\u2019 participation in youth sports.\n\u201cThe CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law,\u201d the group said in a statement after announcing its rule change.\nA recent AP-NORC poll found that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults think transgender female athletes should not be allowed to participate in girls and women\u2019s sports at the high school, college or professional level. That view was shared by about 9 in 10 Republicans and roughly half of Democrats.\nThe federation announced the rule change after Trump threatened this week to pull federal funding from California unless it bars trans female athletes from competing on girls teams. The CIF said it decided on the change before then.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice also said it would investigate the state federation and the district that includes Hernandez\u2019s high school to determine whether they violated federal sex discrimination law by allowing trans girls to compete in girls sports.\nSome California Republicans also weighed in, with several state lawmakers attending a news conference to criticize the federation for keeping Hernandez in the competition and a Republican gubernatorial candidate planning to attend Saturday's finals.\nCalifornia law allows trans students to compete on sex-segregated sports teams consistent with their gender identity.\nThe federation said the rule would open the field to more \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes. One expert said the change may itself be discriminatory because it creates an extra spot for \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes but not for other trans athletes.\nThe federation did not specify how they define \u201cbiological female\u201d or how they would verify whether a competitor meets that definition.\nHernandez told the publication Capital & Main earlier this month that she couldn\u2019t worry about critics.\n\u201cI\u2019m still a child, you\u2019re an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,\u201d she said.\nCalifornia\u2019s state championship stands out from that of other states because of the number of competitors athletes are up against to qualify. The state had the second-largest number of students participating in outdoor track and field in the nation during the 2023-2024 school year, behind Texas, according to a survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations.\nOlympians Marion Jones and Tara Davis-Woodhall previously set state championship records in the long jump in 1993 and 2017, respectively, both surpassing 22 feet (6.7 meters).\nThe boys 100-meter dash heats were also a highlight Friday. Junior Jaden Jefferson of De La Salle High School in Concord finished in 10.01 seconds, about .2 seconds faster than a meet record set in 2023. Jefferson's time won't count as a record unless he can replicate his results in the final.\n___\nAustin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The move has made the coastal suburb an unlikely flashpoint in the enduring debate over the place of Indigenous imagery in American sports.\nMassapequa, which is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Manhattan, has for years fought a state mandate to retire Native American sports names and mascots.\nBut its lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s 2023 ban on constitutional grounds was dismissed by a federal judge earlier this year.\nState education officials, who have been trying to remove offending mascots and team names for more than two decades, gave districts until the end of this school year to commit to replacing them or risk losing education funding.\nSchools could be exempt from the mandate if they gained approval from a local Native American tribe, but Massapequa never sought such permission, state officials have said.\nResidents who support keeping the mascot have argued the image has been a part of the community\u2019s identity for generations and is meant to honor its Native American past.\nThe town is named after the Massapequa, who were part of the broader Lenape, or Delaware, people who inhabited the woodlands of the Northeastern U.S. and Canada for thousands of years before being decimated by European colonization.\nBut indigenous residents on Long Island and elsewhere in New York have called Massapequa\u2019s mascot problematic as it depicts a Native American man wearing a headdress that was typically worn by tribes in the American Midwest, but not in the Northeast.\nThe cheery mascot also obscures Massapequa\u2019s legacy of violence against Native Americans, which includes the site of a massacre in which scores of Native men, women and children were killed by Europeans in the 1600s, Native American activists have said.\nMassapequa, which is roughly 90% white, has long been a conservative bastion popular with New York City police and firefighters.\nTrump visited the town last year to attend the wake of a New York City police officer and has made frequent visits to Long Island as it has shifted Republican.\nComedian Jerry Seinfeld, Hollywood\u2019s Baldwin brothers and the Long Island\u2019s alleged Gilgo Beach serial killer are also among Massapequa High\u2019s notable alums.\n___\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.",

        "Content": "Rural Democratic lawmaker announces switch to the GOP in the latest setback for Kentucky Democrats\nA longtime state lawmaker in Kentucky has announced that she is switching parties\nFRANKFORT, Ky. -- A longtime state lawmaker announced Friday that she is switching parties, joining Republican supermajorities in the latest setback for Democrats trying to rebuild support across rural Kentucky.\nState Sen. Robin Webb, who represents a four-county swath of northeastern Kentucky, revealed she will join the ranks of GOP lawmakers who control the flow of legislation in the state. Webb was one of the last rural Democrats in Kentucky's legislature, and her defection leaves her ex-party more tethered to urban and suburban districts in a state with large stretches of rural territory controlled by the GOP.\nWebb said in a prepared release that the state's Democratic Party has continued to \u201clurch left.\u201d\n\u201cIt has become untenable and counterproductive to the best interests of my constituents for me to remain a Democrat,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI will continue to be a fearless advocate for rural Kentucky and for the residents of eastern Kentucky who have been so good to me and my family.\"\nWebb has compiled a resume deeply ingrained in Kentucky culture. She has ties to the coal industry and is a well-known gun enthusiast who changed career paths to become an attorney.\nWebb first joined the Kentucky House in 1999, when Democrats controlled the chamber. She spent a decade as a state representative before joining the GOP-led Senate in 2009. Republicans seized total control of the legislature in the 2016 election, when they rode Donald Trump's coattails to win the Kentucky House for the first time in nearly a century. Republicans padded their legislative numbers in subsequent elections, giving them their overwhelming majorities.\nRepublicans attained that dominance by winning in rural districts previously held by Democrats, but Webb's district had remained a blue dot on the map until Friday.\nHer party switch leaves Democrats mostly devoid of a rural presence in the legislature. One exception is Democratic state Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty, who represents an Appalachian district.\nThe state's two-term governor, Democrat Andy Beshear, won a number of rural counties and shrank GOP margins in others in his 2023 reelection. His popularity was built on the state's robust economic growth in his first term and his handling of disasters, from tornadoes and floods to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nKentucky Democrats are trying to spark a rural comeback with a grassroots strategy, evidenced by the state party's ongoing \u201clistening tour\u201d with stops in culturally conservative towns across the state.\nLawmakers will begin their 2026 session in early January, but Beshear has said he will likely call lawmakers back for a special session sometime this year to take up storm-relief funding. Parts of southeastern Kentucky were devastated by deadly tornadoes earlier in May, while other parts of the Bluegrass State were inundated by flooding in April.",

Now in power, he's under pressure to expose it\nPresident Donald Trump has built a coalition by promising to demolish a so-called deep state that he claims is behind dark government conspiracies\nNEW YORK -- As he crisscrossed the country in 2024, Donald Trump pledged to supporters that voting him back into the presidency would be \u201cour final battle.\u201d\n\u201cWith you at my side, we will demolish the deep state,\u201d he said repeatedly on the campaign trail. \u201cWe will liberate our country from these tyrants and villains once and for all.\u201d\nFour months into his second term, Trump has continued to stoke dark theories involving his predecessors and other powerful politicians and attorneys \u2014 most recently raising the specter of nefarious intent behind former President Joe Biden's use of an autopen to sign papers. The administration has pledged to reopen investigations and has taken steps to declassify certain documents, including releasing more than 63,000 pages of records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Yet many of Trump\u2019s supporters say it\u2019s not enough.\nSome who take him at his word are beginning to get restless as they ask why his administration, which holds the keys to chasing down these alleged government secrets, is denying them the evidence and retribution they expected.\nHis Justice Department has not yet arrested hordes of \u201cdeep state\u201d actors as some of his supporters had hoped it would, even as the president has been posting cryptic videos and memes about Democratic politicians.\n\u201cPeople are tired of not knowing,\u201d conservative commentator Damani Felder said on podcaster Tim Pool\u2019s show last week. \u201cWe actually demand answers and real transparency. It\u2019s not that hard to deliver.\u201d\nTrump has long promised to dismantle the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 a supposed secret network of powerful people manipulating government decisions behind the scenes \u2014 to build his base of support, said Yotam Ophir, a communications professor at the University at Buffalo.\n\u201cHe built part of this universe, which at the end of the day is a fictional universe,\u201d he said.\nNow that Trump is in power and has stocked loyalists throughout his administration, his supporters expect all to be revealed. Delivering on that is difficult when many of the conspiracies he alleged aren\u2019t real, said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist who studies conspiracy theories at the University of Miami.\nTo be sure, the president has prioritized retribution in his second administration. He has fired federal workers, installed loyalists in key positions and targeted law firms he disfavors in executive orders. He has ordered the revocation of government security clearances for political rivals and former employees who dissented during his first term. His Justice Department has fired prosecutors who investigated him and scrutinized career FBI agents who investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\nEven so, Trump\u2019s administration hasn\u2019t gone as far as many of his supporters would like. They want to see steps taken against people he has long claimed were involved in sinister plots against him, such as former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey. The administration also hasn\u2019t offered proof of the \u201c egregious crimes \u201d that Trump claims have corrupted the federal government for years.\nTensions erupted this month when FBI Director Kash Patel and his deputy, Dan Bongino, dismissed two of the unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that have animated Trump\u2019s base the most \u2014 that financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein was murdered in a cover-up, and that Trump\u2019s attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania, was a government plot.\n\u201cYou know a suicide when you see one, and that\u2019s what that was,\u201d Patel said about Epstein's death in a Fox News interview.\n\u201cI have seen the whole file,\u201d Bongino added. \u201cHe killed himself.\u201d\nConservatives online demanded to see the evidence, pointing to Bongino's past statements as a podcast host, when he suggested the government was hiding information about Epstein.\n\u201cNo matter who gets elected, you get the same foreign policy, you get the same economic policy, and the Epstein videos remain secret,\u201d right-wing podcaster and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on his show.\n\u201cThey told us for months leading up to the Election that it wasn\u2019t suicide,\" Newsmax host Todd Starnes wrote on X.. \u201cBut now they tell us it was suicide.\u201d He added: \u201cPardon me, but what the heck is going on at DOJ?\u201d\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said this month that FBI officials were poring through \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of videos related to Epstein and would make more materials public once they took steps to protect the victims.\nIn the same Fox News interview, Bongino and Patel said they had been briefed on the attempted assassination of Trump during a rally in July and there was no explosive conspiracy to be revealed.\n\u201cIn some of these cases, the \u2018there\u2019 you\u2019re looking for is not there,\u201d Bongino said.\nBongino appeared to try to throw a bone to Trump\u2019s base this week when he announced the agency would reopen some prominent cases that have attracted public interest. He said the FBI would investigate the planting of pipe bombs found near the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington the day of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, the leak of the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson draft opinion in 2022 that overturned the constitutional right to abortion and the discovery of cocaine in the White House in 2023.\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough for everyone who weighed in on his X account.\n\u201cAnything to detract from the Epstein files,\u201d one user replied to his announcement. \u201cNo results,\u201d wrote another.\nIn an interview Thursday on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Bongino teased that the FBI would soon release video captured outside Epstein's jail cell and materials related to Trump's attempted assassination.\nHe said he understands the public's demands for transparency but called for patience and noted not all information is the FBI's to declassify. That didn't satisfy everyone who wants answers to the conspiracy theories.\n\u201cI am convinced that the deep state can only be defeated by God at this point,\u201d Philip Anderson, a right-wing influencer who participated in the riot at the Capitol, wrote Thursday on X. \u201cKash Patel, Dan Bongino, and Pam Bondi are completely useless.\u201d\nAll the while, Trump has continued promoting conspiracy theories on his Truth Social platform and elsewhere.\nHe shared a video this month about mysterious deaths allegedly being linked to the Clinton family and an image of himself with former President Barack Obama with the text, \u201cALL ROADS LEAD TO OBAMA, RETRUTH IF YOU WANT MILITARY TRIBUNALS.\u201d\nOphir, the University at Buffalo professor, said it's a tactic that distracts Trump's base and helps inoculate him from criticism.\n\u201cWhen something good happens, it\u2019s because Trump is great and his agenda is brilliant,\u201d Ophir said. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it's because of the Obamas or the Clintons or whatever forces are undermining him from within Washington.\u201d\nTrump this week fueled newer theories, without sharing evidence, that Biden\u2019s use of a mechanical device called an autopen during his presidency meant he didn\u2019t sign his executive orders willingly or that aides profited from controlling it. He has called for people who operated it to be charged with \u201cTREASON.\u201d\nThe narrative has gained momentum on the right because of allegations that Biden's aides covered up his mental and physical decline. Presidents have used autopens for years to sign certain documents.\n\u201cWhoever used it was usurping the power of the Presidency, and it should be very easy to find out who that person (or persons) is,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\nAt least one user of his platform was unimpressed and questioned why Trump and his allies, holding all the power, still didn\u2019t have any answers.\n\u201cIF IT\u2019S EASY,\u201d the commenter posted. \u201cWHY HASN\u2019T YOUR ADMINISTRATION FOUND THESE CRIMINAL\u2019S ALREADY.\u201d\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

        "Content": "Track-and-field final in spotlight for rule change after trans athlete's success\nThe California high school track-and-field championship is set to begin Friday amid a controversy over the participation of a transgender female athlete\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California's high school track-and-field state championships starting Friday are set to be the testing ground for a new participation and medaling policy for competitions that include transgender athletes.\nThe California Interscholastic Federation will let an additional student compete and potentially offer an extra medal in three events in which a trans athlete is competing. The athlete, high school junior AB Hernandez, is the second seed in the triple jump and will also participate in the long jump and high jump.\nIt may be the first effort by a high school sports governing body to expand participation when trans athletes are participating, and it reflects efforts to find a middle ground in the debate over trans girls' participation in youth sports.\n\u201cThe CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law,\u201d the group said in a statement after announcing its rule change.\nState law allows trans students to compete on sex-segregated sports teams consistent with their gender identity.\nPresident Donald Trump threatened this week to pull federal funding from California unless it bars trans female athletes from competing on girls teams. The U.S. Department of Justice also said it would investigate the state federation and the district that includes Hernandez\u2019s high school to determine whether they violated federal sex discrimination law by allowing trans girls to compete in girls sports.\nThe meet, which is taking place at a high school near Fresno, will open up the girls triple jump, long jump and high jump to one additional athlete each who would have qualified had Hernandez not participated. Hernandez will compete in the preliminaries Friday for a chance to advance to the finals Saturday.\nUnder the pilot policy, if a transgender athlete medals, their ranking would not displace a \u201cbiological female\u201d student from medaling, the federation said.\nThe federation said the rule would open the field to more \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes. One expert said the change may itself be discriminatory because it creates an extra spot for \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes but not for other trans athletes.\nThe federation did not specify how they define \u201cbiological female\u201d or how they would verify whether a competitor meets that definition.\nMedical experts say gender is a spectrum, not a binary structure consisting of only males and females.\nThe two-day meet is expected to draw attention from a coalition of protesting parents and students. Critics have objected Hernandez's participation and heckled her in qualifying events earlier this month. Leaders from the conservative California Family Council joined Republican state lawmakers Thursday for a press conference blasting the policy change and saying Hernandez shouldn't be allowed to compete.\n\u201cIf they have to create special exceptions and backdoor rule changes to placate frustrated athletes, that\u2019s not equality, that\u2019s a confession,\" Sophia Lorey, the council's outreach director, said in a statement. \u201cGirls\u2019 sports should be for girls, full stop.\u201d\nCIF Executive Director Ron Nocetti urged participants and bystanders to behave respectfully toward all student-athletes in a message shared in the championship program.\nA recent AP-NORC poll found that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults think transgender female athletes should not be allowed to participate in girls and women\u2019s sports at the high school, college or professional level. That view was shared by about 9 in 10 Republicans and roughly half of Democrats. Trump won Fresno County, where the meet will be held, in 2024.\nHernandez told the publication Capital & Main earlier this month that she couldn\u2019t worry about critics.\n\u201cI\u2019m still a child, you\u2019re an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,\u201d she said.\nShe noted that she has lost some of her events, saying that disproved arguments that she can\u2019t be beat.\nHernandez is expected to perform well, particularly in the triple jump, in which she has a personal best of over 41 feet (12.5 meters). That is more than 3 feet (1 meter) short of a national record set in 2019. She's the fifth seed in the long jump but ranked much lower in the high jump.\nCalifornia's state championship stands out from that of other states because of the number of competitors athletes are up against to qualify.\nMore than 57,000 high schoolers participated in outdoor track and field in California during the 2023-2024 school year, according to a survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations. California had the second-largest number of high school outdoor track-and-field athletes, only behind Texas.\nOf the 12 high school athletes who have set national records in the girls triple jump between 1984 and 2019, eight have been from California, according to the national sports governing body.\nDavis Whitfield, the national federation\u2019s chief operating officer, called a state championship \u201cthe pinnacle\u201d for high school student-athletes.\n\u201cIt's certainly a once-in-a-lifetime experience in some cases to participate in a state championship event,\" he said.\n___\nAustin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

        "Content": "Maryland's Wes Moore says he's not running for president but high-profile stops keep chatter alive\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore has been saying for months that he does not plan to run for president in 2028\nANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, often mentioned among Democrats as a potential presidential candidate, has been saying for months that he isn't running for the White House in 2028.\nThat hasn't stopped persistent talk about his future political plans, especially when he continues to make appearances outside Maryland that raise his national profile. On Friday, he\u2019s traveling to speak at the Blue Palmetto Dinner in the early presidential primary state of South Carolina.\nWhen asked about 2028, though, the governor is clear.\n\u201cI\u2019m not running,\u201d Moore told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday. He also said, when asked, that he isn\u2019t trying to get his name in the conversation for a potential vice presidential candidacy, either.\nThe trip to South Carolina includes meetings with business prospects, Moore said.\n\u201cAnd people should get very used to me going all over the country bringing business back to Maryland, because that's exactly what I plan on doing as long as I'm the governor of the state,\u201d Moore said after a dedication in Annapolis for a memorial to former Rep. Parren Mitchell, the state's first Black congressman.\nIn the third year of his first term, Moore plans to run for reelection next year in heavily Democratic Maryland. He says being the state's governor during a challenging time has his full attention.\nThat includes working to navigate the difficulties of dramatic federal downsizing under the Trump administration, which poses an outsized economic impact on Maryland. The state is home to a large number of federal workers toiling in the shadow of the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 about 256,000 Marylanders received a federal W-2 in 2021, representing about 8% of taxpayers, according to an analysis by the state's comptroller.\nEarlier this month, Maryland lost its triple-A bond rating from the Moody\u2019s economic rating agency. State officials had cited the rating for more than 50 years as a sign of strong fiscal stewardship that enabled the state to pay the lowest rates when it sells bonds to pay for infrastructure. Two other rating agencies, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch, have recently affirmed the state\u2019s triple-A bond rating.\nMoore and other leading Democrats in the state blamed the Trump administration's downsizing for the Moody's downgrade.\nThe governor just had the most challenging legislative session of his tenure. Facing a $3.3 billion budget deficit, he worked with the legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, to reach a balanced budget that included about $2 billion in spending cuts throughout state government and about $1.6 billion in new revenues through tax and fee increases.\nMost of the tax increases were imposed on high-income residents, including two new higher tax brackets for people who make more than $500,000 and a new 2% tax on capital gains for people with income over $350,000. The governor has said most Marylanders won't see a tax increase, and some will receive a modest tax cut. Still, Maryland Republicans have been pouncing on the tax increases \u2014 an issue sure to be raised often by the GOP's next nominee for governor.\nMoore, 46, is the state\u2019s first Black governor, and the only Black governor currently serving. He is the former CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, an anti-poverty nonprofit. He also is a Rhodes scholar and a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan.\nThe buzz around Moore has persisted since the bestselling author won Maryland\u2019s governorship in his first bid for public office in a landslide in 2022, after prevailing in a crowded Democratic primary that included former national party chairman and former U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez.\nIn a state that is about 30% Black, Moore was recently criticized by the state's Legislative Black Caucus for vetoing a bill to study potential reparations for slavery. Moore said the idea has been studied enough and now is the time to \u201cfocus on the work itself\u201d of building a better economy for all. That includes narrowing the racial wealth gap, expanding homeownership, uplifting entrepreneurs of color and closing the foundational disparities that lead to inequality \u2014 from food insecurity to education.\nDemocrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 in Maryland, making the state largely safe for Democratic incumbents.\nStill, former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan won the first of his two terms by campaigning heavily against tax increases approved during the tenure of his Democratic predecessor, prompting some to wonder if the popular Hogan might run for governor again. Maryland limits a governor to two consecutive terms, but a former two-term governor could seek another term after sitting out one.",

        "Content": "Leadership shakeups at agency tasked with carrying out Trump's mass deportations agenda\nA staff reorganization is underway at the agency carrying out President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign\nWASHINGTON -- The agency tasked with carrying out President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign is undergoing a major staff reorganization.\nIn a news release Tuesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced leadership changes at the department tasked with finding, arresting and removing immigrants who no longer have the right to be in the country as well as at the agency's investigative division.\nKenneth Genalo, who had been the acting director of Enforcement and Removal Operations, is retiring and will serve as a special government employee with ICE. Robert Hammer, who has been the acting head of Homeland Security Investigations, will transition to another leadership role at headquarters.\nThe agency said Marcos Charles will become the new acting head of ERO while Derek Gordon will be the acting head at HSI. ICE also announced a host of other staff changes at various departments within the agency.\nICE said the changes would \u201chelp ICE achieve President Trump and the American people\u2019s mandate of arresting and deporting criminal illegal aliens and making American communities safe.\u201d\nThe news comes after White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said on Fox News earlier this week that the administration was setting a goal of 3,000 arrests by ICE each day and that the number could go higher.\n\u201cPresident Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every single day,\u201d said Miller.\nThree thousand arrests per day would mark a huge increase in daily arrests from current figures. Between Jan. 20 and May 19 the agency arrested 78,155 people, which translates to an average of 656 arrests per day.\nThis is the latest staff shakeup at an agency that is central to Trump's vision of removing everyone in the country illegally. In February, the acting director of ICE was reassigned as well as two other top ICE officials.\nCarrying out deportations, especially in high numbers, poses logistical challenges.\nThere are a limited number of enforcement and removal officers \u2014 those tasked with tracking down, arresting and removing people in the country illegally \u2014 and the number of officers has remained stagnant for years. ICE also has a limited number of detention beds to hold people once arrested and a limited number of planes to remove them from the country.\nBut the administration is pushing for a major funding boost as part of a package in Congress that could supercharge immigration enforcement. The plan would aim to fund the removal of 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers. The plan also calls for 10,000 more ICE officers and investigators.",

        "Content": "Trump's latest pardons benefit an array of political allies and public figures\nThe latest pardons by President Donald Trump are another example of him flexing his power to bestow clemency on political allies and prominent public officials, including those convicted of defrauding the public\nWASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A governor who resigned amid a corruption scandal and served two stints in federal prison. A New York Republican who resigned from Congress after a tax fraud conviction and who made headlines for threatening to throw a reporter off a Capitol balcony over a question he didn't like. Reality TV stars convicted of cheating banks and evading taxes.\nAll were unlikely beneficiaries this week of pardons, with President Donald Trump flexing his executive power to bestow clemency on political allies, prominent public figures and others convicted of defrauding the public. The moves not only take aim at criminal cases once touted as just by the Justice Department but also come amid a continuing Trump administration erosion of public integrity guardrails, including the firing of the department's pardon attorney and the near-dismantling of a prosecution unit established to hold public officials accountable for abusing the public trust.\n\"He is using pardons to essentially override the verdicts of juries, to set aside the sentences that have been imposed by judges and to accomplish political objectives,\u201d said Liz Oyer, who was fired in March as the Justice Department's pardon attorney after she says she refused to endorse restoring the gun rights of actor Mel Gibson, a Trump supporter. \u201cThat is very damaging and destructive to our system of justice.\u201d\nTo be sure, other presidents have courted controversy with their clemency decisions. President Gerald Ford famously pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton pardoned fugitive financier Marc Rich just hours before the Democratic president left office. More recently, President Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, sparing the younger Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversing his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family.\nBut the pardons announced Wednesday are part of a pattern of clemency grants that began in Trump's first term and has continued in the current one in which bold-faced names, prominent supporters and defendants whose causes are championed by friends time and again have an edge on ordinary citizens who lack connections to the White House.\nIn 2020, for instance, he pardoned allies convicted in the Russia election interference investigation that shadowed his first term as well as his son-in-law's father, Charles Kushner, who was later named ambassador to France.\nOn his first day back in office, he pardoned, commuted the prison sentences or vowed to dismiss the cases of all of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, using his clemency powers to undo the massive prosecution of the unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy.\nTwice indicted by the Justice Department, and entangled in criminal investigations in the White House and in his post-presidency life, Trump has long conveyed public suspicion about prosecutorial power and found common cause with politicians \u2014 including on the other side of the aisle \u2014 he sees as having been mistreated like he believes he was.\nIn February, for instance, the Republican president pardoned former Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich after having earlier commuted his 14-year sentence on political corruption charges. Blagojevich, he said, \u201cwas set up by a lot of bad people, some of the same people I had to deal with.\u201d\nThe most recent pardon beneficiaries include former GOP New York Rep. Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to underreporting wages and revenue at a restaurant he ran in Manhattan. The former Marine and FBI agent resigned from Congress the following year and was sentenced to eight months in prison. Grimm tried to reenter politics in 2018 but lost a primary for his old district.\nOthers include former Republican Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, whose once-promising political career was cut short by a criminal case over gifts and favors from state contractors. Rowland was later convicted and imprisoned a second time for conspiring to hide his work on political campaigns and was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison.\nThe White House also announced pardons for rap artist NBA YoungBoy on gun-related charges and TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, famous for \u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d a reality show that followed their family and extravagant lifestyle that prosecutors said was boosted by bank fraud and hiding earnings from tax authorities. The couple was convicted in 2022 of conspiring to defraud banks out of more than $30 million in loans by submitting false documents.\nThe latest pardons unfold as Trump has departed from the norms and protocols of the clemency process and as the Justice Department has signaled a tweaked approach to public corruption and white-collar fraud.\nThe department, for instance, has long had a pardon attorney tasked with sifting through applications from defendants and recommending clemency to the White House for those seen as having served their debt to society and accepted responsibility for their crimes, including drug offenders serving long sentences and not generally known to the public or connected to the powerful.\nIn place of Oyer, the fired pardon attorney, the administration installed Ed Martin, a Trump loyalist who briefly served as interim U.S. attorney in Washington. He has already pledged to scrutinize pardons that Biden issued on his way out of office and has said he would take a \u201chard look\" at two men serving long prison terms for leading a conspiracy to kidnap Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\nMeanwhile, the department's vaunted public integrity section, created in the post-Watergate era to investigate and prosecute public officials for abusing their powers, has been dramatically slashed, whittled down to just a handful of lawyers.\nThe section endured an exodus of prosecutors after Justice Department leaders demanded the dismissal of a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams in part so he could assist in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\nThe pardons, said Princeton University presidential historian Julian Zelizer, fit \u201cwithin the fold of his presidency, where he uses a lot of his power either for retribution or reward rather than for just kind of pure policy-making. We have to understand the pardons in that framework.\u201d",

        "Content": "Trump's big plans on trade and more run up against laws of political gravity, separation of powers\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s big plans on trade, deportations and more are running up against the laws of political gravity and the separation of powers\nWASHINGTON -- Once again, President Donald Trump\u2019s biggest policy plans were stopped in their tracks.\nOn Wednesday, an obscure but powerful court in New York rejected the legal foundation of Trump\u2019s most sweeping tariffs, finding that Trump could not use a 1977 law to declare a national emergency on trade imbalances and fentanyl smuggling to justify a series of import taxes that have unsettled the world. Reordering the global economy by executive fiat was an unconstitutional end-run around Congress\u2019 powers, the three-judge panel of Trump, Obama and Reagan appointees ruled in a scathing rebuke of Trump\u2019s action.\nThe setbacks fit a broader pattern for a president who has advanced an extraordinarily expansive view of executive power. Federal courts have called out the lack of due process in some of Trump's deportation efforts. His proposed income tax cuts, now working their way through Congress, are so costly that some of them can't be made permanent, as Trump had wished. His efforts to humble Harvard University and cut the federal workforce have encountered legal obstacles. And he's running up against reality as his pledges to quickly end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have turned into slogs.\nThe laws of political gravity, the separation of powers and geopolitical realities are proving to be tougher to conquer than Trump will publicly admit. As various legal skirmishes play out, he may have to choose between bowing to the limits of his power or trying to ignore the judicial system.\n\u201cIf the latter, we may have a constitutional crisis,\u201d said University of Texas history professor H.W. Brands.\nTrump blasted the ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade, writing Thursday on his Truth Social platform, \u201cIf allowed to stand, this would completely destroy Presidential Power \u2014 The Presidency would never be the same!\u201d\nA second federal court on Thursday found Trump's tariffs to be improper. Then a federal appeals court said the government can continue to collect the tariffs under the emergency powers law for now as the Trump administration challenges the ruling, though the government could be obligated to refund the money if the ruling is upheld.\nKevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said there are two baseball caps in the room behind the Oval Office that say \u201cTrump Always Wins\u201d and Trump has been \u201cright\" about everything.\n\u201cTrump does always win these negotiations because we\u2019re right,\u201d Hassett said on Fox Business Network's \u201cMornings with Maria.\u201d \u201cThese activist judges are trying to slow down something right in the middle of really important negotiations.\u201d\nPart of Trump's challenge lies in the nature of the job, in which only the thorniest of problems cross his desk. But there\u2019s also the fact that Trump\u2019s keen instincts for what plays well on TV don't necessarily help with the nitty-gritty of policy details.\nBy unilaterally ordering tariffs, deportations and other actions through the White House, Trump is bypassing both Congress and the broader public, which could have given more popular legitimacy to his policy choices, said Princeton University history professor Julian Zelizer.\n\u201cThe president is trying to achieve his goals outside normal legal processes and without focusing on public buy-in,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cThe problem is that we do have a constitutional system and there are many things a president can\u2019t do. The courts are simply saying no. The reality is that many of his boldest decisions stand on an incredibly fragile foundation.\u201d\nAs Trump sees it, his tariffs would solve genuine problems. His \u201cLiberation Day\u201d taxes on imports would close persistent trade imbalances with other countries, with his 10% baseline tariff providing a stream of revenue to help offset the trillions of dollars in federal borrowing that would be created by his planned income tax cuts.\nBut when the financial markets panicked and the interest charged on U.S. debt shot up, Trump backtracked and ratcheted down many of his tariffs to 10% while negotiations began to take place.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested this had been the plan all along to force new trade negotiations. But Trump shortly undercut him by saying on the White House South Lawn that he backed down because the financial markets were getting \u201cyippy\u201d \u2014 a reminder that Trump's own improvisatory and disruptive style can upend any working policy process.\nTrump still has tariffs in place on autos, steel and aluminum. Those are tied to the premise that imports would create national security risks based on previous investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. He could use other laws to start new investigations or temporarily impose tariffs, but the White House is more focused at the moment on challenging the court rulings.\n\u201cWhat is unprecedented is Trump asserting authority under a 1977 statute that had never been used for tariffs, not just for targeted tariffs, but the largest tariffs since the 1930s,\" said Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served in the Biden White House. \"That\u2019s what is unprecedented and unusual.\u201c\nHarrell said Trump could re-create many of his tariffs using other laws but \u201cit would require more work and be a much more orderly process.\"\nRice University history professor Douglas Brinkley said Trump's sense of the presidency relies on a deep misreading of the office. He mistakenly assumes that the tariffs used in the 19th century to fund a much smaller federal government would now be able to pay for a much larger federal government. But he also assumes that power flows to and from him, rather than from institutions and the rule of law.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to realize that anytime he doesn\u2019t listen to the court orders that he\u2019s making an anti-American statement,\" Brinkley said. \"It\u2019s telling people that I'm bigger than the American Constitution, that judges are just errand boys for me.\u201d\nThe Trump White House blamed its latest setback on the U.S. Court of International Trade.\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro said in a Bloomberg News interview that the judicial branch was part of the problem, keeping Trump from delivering on his promises.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got courts in this country who are basically engaged in attacks on the American people,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cThe president ran on stopping the fentanyl poisoning, stopping international trade unfair practices from stealing our factories and jobs. And courts keep getting in the way of that.\u201d",

And Harrison Ruffin Tyler was born in 1928 when that father was 75 years old and the presidential grandfather had been dead for more than 60 years.\nThe grandson was known for preserving his grandfather\u2019s plantation and nearby Civil War fort. In a statement, Annique Dunning, the executive director of Sherwood Forest, a national landmark of President Tyler's residence, said the president's grandson, whose brother died in 2020, was a \u201cbeloved father and grandfather, he will be missed immeasurably by those who survive him.\u201d\n\u201cHe will be remembered for his considerable charm, generosity and unfailing good humor by all who knew him,\u201d Dunning said.\nOver the course of his life, Tyler preserved Sherwood Forest, his grandfather's plantation that enslaved dozens of people, including 43 people in 1860, just before the Civil War began. The grandson also helped restore and maintain Fort Pocahontas, a Union fort during the Civil War.\nTyler's grandfather was a Democrat nicknamed the \u201cAccidental President\u201d after unexpectedly assuming the presidency when President William Henry Harrison died in office. President Tyler was the first vice president to gain control of the White House in the wake of a death.\nThe University of Virginia's Miller Center described the president as \u201cthe last gasp of the Old Virginia aristocracy in the White House.\u201d He had married twice and had 15 children, including Lyon Gardiner Tyler Sr.\nThe time between the president's birth and his grandson's death spans 235 years.",

        "Content": "A quiet Tiananmen Square anniversary displays China's ability to suppress history\nFor most Chinese, the 36th anniversary of a bloody crackdown that ended pro-democracy protests in China has passed like any other weekday\nBEIJING -- For most Chinese, the 36th anniversary of a bloody crackdown that ended pro-democracy protests in China passed like any other weekday. And that's just how the ruling Communist Party wants it.\nSecurity was tight Wednesday around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, where weeks of student-led protests shook the party in 1989. Under then-leader Deng Xiaoping, the military was sent in to end the protest on the night of June 3-4. Using live ammunition, soldiers forced their way through crowds on the streets that tried to block them from reaching the square. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed, including dozens of soldiers.\nThe party has tried, with some success, to erase what it calls the \u201cpolitical turmoil\u201d of 1989 from the collective memory. It bans any public commemoration or mention of the June 4th crackdown, scrubbing references from the internet.\nIn recent years, that ban has been extended to Hong Kong, where a once-massive annual candlelight vigil is no longer permitted. A former district council member, Chan Kim-kam, said customs officers questioned her at her shop on the eve of June 4 after she advertised small white candles for sale in an Instagram post titled, \u201cJune, we don't forget.\u201d\nIt is only in Taiwan, a self-governing island that is claimed by China but runs its own affairs, that large June 4 gatherings can still take place.\nTiananmen Square is a vast open space in the center of Beijing with monumental, communist-era buildings along two of its sides and the mausoleum of Mao Zedong, who founded the communist era in 1949, on the south end.\nUniversity students occupied this symbolically important site in the spring of 1989. Their calls for freedoms divided the party leadership. In retrospect, the decision to send in the troops marked a decisive turning point in the evolution of modern China, keeping the party firmly in control as it loosened economic restrictions.\nChinese officials have said the country\u2019s rapid economic development since then proves the decisions made at the time were correct.\n\u201cOn the political turmoil that happened in the late 1980s, the Chinese government has already reached a clear conclusion,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Wednesday. He added that China would continue along its current path of what it calls \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics.\"\nTiananmen Mothers, a group formed by relatives of the victims, made an annual online appeal to the government. Signed by 108 members, it called for an independent investigation into what happened on June 4, 1989, including a list of all who died. The group also demanded compensation for the families and a legal case against those responsible for the deaths.\nThe British and German Embassies in Beijing posted videos commemorating the anniversary on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, but they were later taken down, presumably by censors. The Canadian and German Embassies displayed images of a single lit candle on large screens facing the main street.\nIn Hong Kong, a carnival showcasing Chinese food and products was held in Victoria Park, where tens of thousands of people used to gather in the evening for a candlelight vigil to mark the anniversary.\nHong Kong authorities first shut down the vigil during the COVID-19 pandemic and arrested the organizers in 2021. The moves were part of a broader crackdown on dissent following monthslong anti-government protests in 2019 that turned violent and paralyzed parts of the city.\n\u201cYou know, Hong Kongers have become silent lambs after 2019,\u201d said King Ng, who was at the park on Wednesday.\nPolice were out in force to try to prevent any protest. Activist Lui Yuk-lin was stopped at a subway station in Causeway Bay and brought to a police van. It wasn't clear if she had been arrested.\nJailed vigil organizer Chow Hang-tung said she would go on a 36-hour hunger strike to remember the events of the day.\nThe British and Canadian consulates posted social media messages about not forgetting June 4. Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997. The American consulate posted a message from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on its website.\n\u201cThe CCP actively tries to censor the facts,\u201d Rubio said, referring to China's Communist Party. \"But the world will never forget.\u201d\nTaiwan's President Lai Ching-te used the anniversary to position the island he leads on the frontline of defending democracy against authoritarianism. In a Facebook post, he drew a distinction between Taiwan's multiparty democracy and China's one-party rule.\n\u201cAuthoritarian governments often choose to remain silent and forget about history, while democratic societies choose to preserve the truth and refuse to forget those who have contributed to the ideals of human rights and the dreams they embrace,\u201d Lai wrote.\nTaiwan transitioned from authoritarianism to democracy in a process that began in the late 1980s. It relies on support principally from the U.S., along with other democratic partners, to deter China from an invasion. The Communist Party says it favors peaceful reunification but doesn't renounce the use of force.\nA commemoration and candlelight vigil remembering June 4 was planned for Wednesday evening.\n___\nThe year in which British colonial rule ended in Hong Kong has been corrected in this story to 1997. ___\nLeung reported from Hong Kong.",

        "Content": "No kids, excess heat and payment plans. What to know about Hajj 2025\nMuslims from around the world are in the Saudi city of Mecca for this year's Hajj pilgrimage, one of the Five Pillars of Islam\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Muslims from around the world are in the Saudi city of Mecca for the Hajj, one of the Five Pillars of Islam.\nIn the coming days, people will immerse themselves in religious rituals and acts of worship that originated more than 1,400 years ago.\nThey also have to contend with excess heat and other earthly factors, like a ban on children under the age of 12 and a crackdown on unauthorized entry.\nHere\u2019s what to know about this year\u2019s Hajj:\nLast year\u2019s pilgrims struggled through burning sun and suffocating hot weather, with the mercury hitting 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit). More than 1,300 people died.\nThis year, Saudi authorities are advising caution in direct sunlight, telling pilgrims to avoid going out during the day and uncovering their heads, except for rituals, unless necessary.\nAn official safety kit emphasizes the importance of light-colored clothing and umbrellas. It also has details on recognizing and treating the symptoms of dehydration and heat exhaustion.\nBut it\u2019s tough to avoid the heat and crowds when the Hajj is outdoors. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many, elevating the personal stakes further, and temperatures in Mecca are already 41 degrees Celsius (about 106 Fahrenheit).\nAlthough the desert kingdom spends billions of dollars on crowd control and cooling, the sheer number of pilgrims and climatic conditions make it difficult to guarantee people\u2019s safety.\nSaudi Arabia has banned children under 12 from this year\u2019s Hajj \u2014 one of the biggest policy changes in recent years.\nRiyadh reportedly introduced the ban as a precautionary measure to ensure children\u2019s safety during the pilgrimage, which could be a dangerous environment for them because of the huge crowds.\nChildren are exempt from doing the Hajj and are not required to fulfill other Islamic obligations, like prayer and fasting, until they reach puberty.\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop some parents from wanting to take their children to experience the Hajj and see the holiest site in Islam, the Kaaba, the black, cube-shaped structure that is the focal point for daily prayers.\nFather of five Talha Ayub, from the Pakistani city of Lahore, said his kids were staying with their grandparents while he and his wife performed the Hajj in a \u201cmore relaxed way.\u201d\n\u201cEven if children were allowed, we probably wouldn\u2019t have taken them because the weather is extremely harsh this year,\u201d said Ayub, whose children are aged 1 to 13. \u201cI have mixed feelings about leaving them behind. I\u2019ll miss them.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no official age breakdown for pilgrims, but most are between 35 and 64.\nThe price of a Hajj ranges from $4,000 to $20,000, depending on the length of stay, level of comfort, and country of departure. Depreciating currencies, high inflation, and tax hikes in Saudi Arabia also have an impact on how much Muslims end up paying.\nThe countries that typically send the most pilgrims are developing nations. Some have trimmed the price of government-backed Hajj programs to make them more affordable. But this step isn\u2019t always enough.\nFarid Ahmed Majumder, secretary general of the Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh, said the country was allowed to send some 127,000 pilgrims this year but failed to meet this quota, mainly because of higher costs.\nPakistan has reduced the price of the state-run Hajj program. It has also debuted a flexible payment system.\nFarmer and small business owner Zaheer Ahmad said he didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for his Hajj up-front, 1.2 million rupees or about $4,255.\nHe paid in three installments, applying for the Hajj in December with an advance and finishing his payments in February. \u201cOtherwise, I might not have been able to go for Hajj at all,\u201d he said.\nIn Saudi Arabia, which has also introduced flexible payments, domestic pilgrims pay 20% within 72 hours of booking, another 40% during Ramadan and the final 40% the following month.\nAlthough the Hajj is a once-in-a-lifetime obligation, people don\u2019t want to wait a lifetime to fulfill it.\nBut the Hajj has limited capacity, countries have set quotas, and there is only one time each year to do it. Patience really is a virtue and everything needs to align: availability, health, and finances.\nMuslim-majority countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have decades-long waiting lists for the Hajj. Indonesia has 5.4 million people awaiting their turn, with the number increasing each year.\nWhile there is nothing to stop people from performing the Hajj more than once, some governments believe this practice deprives others of the opportunity, especially in countries where demand is high.\nIndia has a ban on \u201crepeaters\u201d and excludes applications from anyone who has previously performed the pilgrimage through the national Hajj committee, although there are exceptions from those accompanying certain categories of people like the elderly.\nWith a restricted supply of Hajj spaces, it's inevitable that people will try to find ways to get to the holy city and stay there.\nIn April, to curb unauthorized Hajj pilgrimages and control inbound travel, Saudi Arabia suspended the issue of short-term visas for 14 countries: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria, Sudan, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Yemen, and Morocco.\nPeople have in the past traveled to Saudi Arabia on short-term visas and entered Mecca without official permission for the Hajj. Authorities said that many of those who died in the heat during last year's Hajj were unregistered and unable to access air-conditioned pilgrim amenities.\nThe Interior Ministry warned in May that a fine of up to 20,000 riyals, or about $5,330, would be imposed on anyone attempting to enter Mecca during the Hajj without the correct visa.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Sheikh Saaliq in New Delhi, Julhas Alam in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Munir Ahmed in Islamabad contributed to this report.\n___\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "Content": "The euro is about to get a new member, Bulgaria. What's the eurozone and how do countries join?\nBulgaria has the green light to join the euro next year and become the 21st member of the European Union's currency union\nFRANKFURT, Germany -- European Union officials gave the green light Wednesday for Bulgaria to become the 21st member of the euro currency union,, a key EU project aimed at deepening the ties between member countries.\nThe Balkan country of 6.4 million people is to make the switch from its national currency, the lev, to the euro on Jan. 1.\nHere are basic facts about the currency union, also called the eurozone, and how countries join it.\nThe euro is a shared currency and monetary system launched in 1999 when 11 EU member countries irrevocably fixed their currencies to the euro as an accounting currency, then swapped out the national notes and coins in 2002.\nThe EU established the European Central Bank to handle monetary policy and set interest rate benchmarks for member countries, similar to the role of the U.S. Federal Reserve in the U.S.\nCountries must meet four criteria: low inflation, keeping deficits and debt under control, low long-term interest rates and a stable exchange rate between their currency and the euro. Countries must go through a two-year \u201cwaiting room\u201d in which their currency does not fluctuate excessively against the euro. The process is meant to demonstrate that their economies are sustainably converging with that of the eurozone.\nOnce the European Commission determines that requirements have been met, the member governments of the EU decide by what's called a qualified majority vote. Approval needs a minimum of 55% of member states representing at least 65% of the EU population.\nAfter joining, countries face rules limiting debt and deficits. Those rules are intended to keep countries from running large deficits that could undermine the euro.\nThe European Commission ruled Wednesday that Bulgaria has met the requirements, seconded by an opinion from the ECB. The matter now goes to a vote at a meeting of EU finance ministers slated for July 8. EU officials say the vote is a done deal.\nBulgaria is unusual in that it pegged its currency, the lev, to the euro right from the beginning of monetary union in 1999, even before it joined the European Union in 2007. Bulgaria also has very low levels of debt, only 24.1% of annual economic output. That is well below the 60% level set in the economic criteria for eurozone membership. The last step was getting inflation below the benchmark of 2.8%, or no more than 1.5% higher than the average of the three lowest eurozone members.\nThere were concerns about the level of corruption and money laundering in the EU's poorest country. The commission and the ECB found however that Bulgaria has made progress in those areas.\nThe most recent Eurobarometer poll carried out by the EU showed that 50% of Bulgarians were opposed and 43% in favor. Reasons include fears of inflation, distrust of official institutions in a country that has had seven governments in four years, and widespread misinformation on social media.\nThe issue has been taken up by pro-Russian nationalist politicians who argue for keeping the national currency. President Rumen Radev stoked anti-euro forces with a proposal for a referendum, which was rejected by parliament. Misinformation included false claims that the euro would allow EU officials to confiscate dormant bank accounts or use a digital euro to control people.\nOn Jan.1, only euros will be dispensed from cash machines, though both currencies will circulate in cash for a month. After that, lev notes can be exchanged at banks for 12 months and for an unlimited time at the Bulgarian national bank.\nIn theory, the euro brings means lower interest rates for business and consumers and eases cross-border trade within the eurozone. Companies no longer have to engage in currency exchange transactions or worry that exchange rate shifts will erode their profits or holdings. Travelers no longer have to pay commissions at an exchange booth or on their credit card bill when vacationing or on a business trip to another EU country.\nMember countries get a seat on the ECB\u2019s rate-setting council and so have a voice in eurozone-wide monetary policy.\nCountries that join lose some authority over their own economy. They give up their ability set their own interest rates, and face restrictions on government spending and deficits, though those rules have proved flexible in practice. And they can no longer gain competitiveness relative to other countries by allowing their currency's exchange rate to devalue.\nBitter memories remain of the debt and economic crisis that shook the eurozone in 2010-2015. After Greece admitted its deficit and debts were much larger than previously reported, it wound up defaulting on its debts and market turmoil spread to other eurozone countries.\nGreece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus were bailed out with loans by the other eurozone governments, in return for strict austerity measures that impacted many ordinary people including government workers and retirees.\nECB President Mario Draghi is credited with defusing the eurozone crisis in 2012 by saying that the central bank would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. The ECB then said it could intervene in bond markets to support countries hit by turmoil, a safeguard that calmed markets even though it was never used.\nLater other backstops were added, including a eurozone bailout fund and moving banking oversight from sometimes-lax national supervisors to the ECB.\nCountries agree to join the euro as part of joining the EU, but not all have made the effort to meet the economic requirements. There is no time window to join.\nDenmark was granted an opt out, while Sweden rejected the euro in a 2003 referendum despite not having an opt out and has no target date to join. Other non-members are Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Romania.\nOfficials in Poland, the biggest non-member, have shown little interest in joining despite acknowledging the obligation to join someday. The winner of Sunday's presidential election, Karol Nawrocki, campaigned on keeping the zloty currency.\nThe country's economy has grown strongly without euro membership, doubling in size over the past two decades as its standard of living has almost caught up with Western Europe since emerging from communist rule in 1989.",

Scharf also announced that each of the 215,000 employees at Wells Fargo would receive a $2,000 award for turning the bank around.\nWells Fargo used to have a corporate culture where it placed unreasonable sales goals on its branch employees, which resulted in employees opening up millions of fake accounts in order to meet those goals. Wells' top executives called its branches \u201cstores\u201d and employees were expected to cross-sell customers into as many banking products as possible, even if the customer did not want or need them.\nAfter an investigation by The Los Angeles Times in 2016, Wells Fargo shut down its sales culture and fired much of its leadership and board of directors. The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo billions of dollars in fines and lost business, and permanently tarnished its reputation, particularly because the scandal broke only a few years after the Great Recession and financial crisis. It was later revealed that Wells Fargo opened up roughly 3.5 million accounts that were not wanted or needed by customers.\nWells Fargo, once thought to be the best run bank in the country, was now the poster child of the worst practices of banking in decades.\nIn order to push Wells to fix itself, the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of placing Wells Fargo in a program where the bank could grow no larger than it was in 2018. No bank had previously been placed into such a program, known as an asset cap. The Fed required Wells to fix it culture and redo its entire risk and compliance departments in order to address its problems.\nSince taking over in 2019, Scharf's goal has been to convince the Federal Reserve that Wells Fargo had fixed its toxic banking practices. With the asset cap removed, the bank can now pursue more deposits, new accounts and take on additional investment banking businesses by holding additional securities on its balance shet.",

        "Content": "New South Korean leader Lee has lived a turbulent life. Now, big challenges await him\nThe life of South Korea's new President Lee Jae-myung is full of ups and downs\nSEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Lee Jae-myung was a child laborer with an arm deformity. He attempted suicide. He later made his way through university and became a highly divisive politician who survived a stabbing attack and struggles with numerous criminal charges.\nHis turbulent life climaxed, as Lee, 60, the candidate of the main liberal Democratic Party, was elected as South Korea's new president to succeed his conservative archrival Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted over his stunning imposition of martial law.\nThere are both hopes and fears about Lee's win. Supporters think he's an able leader who can get things done and fix the country's deep-rooted economic inequality and corruption. But critics say Lee will likely oppress political opponents and intensify a domestic division.\nHere's a look at Lee, whose single, five-year presidency begins on Wednesday:\nAfter graduating from an elementary school, Lee had to work at various factories in Seongnam, a city near Seoul, because his family couldn\u2019t afford his secondary education.\nAt a factory manufacturing baseball gloves, he had his left forearm crushed by a press machine, getting a permanent arm disability. Lee said he suffered beating at his factories and hated encountering a girl who was a neighbor when he helped his garbage collector father's work at a traditional market.\nDespaired, Lee tried to kill himself twice, both unsuccessfully. He later got back on his feet and entered Seoul's Chung-Ang University with a full scholarship, before he became a human rights lawyer.\n\u201cHopes and ordeals always come together. The roles of ordeals are not getting people to surrender, but testing how serious and desperate their hopes are,\u201d Lee said in a memoir published in 2017.\nLee later entered politics and became Seongnam mayor and governor of Gyeonggi province. Once a political outsider, Lee rose to prominence in 2016 after he made a series of fiery street speeches criticizing then conservative President Park Geun-hye, who was later removed from office over a corruption scandal.\n\u201cLet\u2019s seize her with our hands and consign her to history,\" Lee said during one rally in December 2016.\nMany of his comments have since sharply polarized South Koreans.\nLee vilified South Korea's conservative establishment as greedy \u201cfake conservatives.\" He slammed a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea as a source of tensions and likened strengthening U.S.-Japan ties to a 1905 Washington-Tokyo agreement that he said helped Japan colonize the Korean Peninsula later.\nLee's proposal of giving a universal basic income to all citizens have invited accusations that he's a populist.\nIn 2022, he lost the hotly contested presidential election to Yoon. In 2024, Lee was attacked by a man who told investigators that he wanted to kill Lee to prevent him from becoming president.\nRecently, Lee has made few contentious or radical comments on foreign policy and security issues, and rather has promised to pursue pragmatic diplomacy.\nHe's repeatedly described South Korea's alliance with the U.S. as the foundation of the country's foreign policy and stressed the need to maintain a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership.\n\u201cWhen it comes to what Lee said in the past, we don't know whether he made such comments only to appeal to his supporters or whether they showed his true nature,\u201d said Shin Yul, a politics professor at Seoul\u2019s Myonggi University.\nThe major issues that Lee will immediately face is U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and other \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, and North Korea's advancing nuclear program. They are both vital issues for South Korea, but many experts say there isn't much diplomatic room for South Korea to maneuver in to produce major changes in its favor in both matters.\nPaik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University, said that Trump is \u201ctoo overwhelming and dominant,\u201d so that whoever is in South Korean leadership, the country's dealings with the U.S. won't be much different. He said that foreign policy advisers for Lee would also know that North Korea won't voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons.\nLee comes to office under the shadow of his own legal troubles.\nHe stands accused in five trials over corruption and other charges, and at one point, some of his legal battles threatened his bid for presidency.\nLee celebrated in March when the Seoul High Court overturned a suspended prison sentence against him for violating the election law during the 2022 race. But he fumed in May when the Supreme Court quashed that ruling and sent the case back to the high court, citing a strong likelihood of his guilt. Hearings at the high court were eventually postponed until after the election.\nHad his conviction been finalized, Lee would have been barred from running for president.\nOther trials center around his roles in dubious development projects and illegal money transfers to North Korea, and his alleged misuse of official funds and persuading of a witness to commit perjury.\nLee's five trials will likely stop as South Korea\u2019s constitution prevents a sitting president from being charged with most crimes. But his rivals will take issue with it, because the constitution doesn't clearly state whether a president can be convicted for crimes in which indictments came before taking up office.\nLee\u2019s Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the National Assembly, has been pushing to revise the criminal procedure law to suspend ongoing criminal trials involving a sitting president until the end of their term. Conservatives have harshly lambasted the move.\nDuring the presidential campaign, Lee vowed not to pursue a vendetta against conservatives. However, he has also called for a thorough investigation into Yoon and his inner circle over rebellion allegations.\nLee's opponents worry he could use those investigations to clamp down on Yoon associates and prosecutors who he thinks orchestrated inquiries involving his criminal charges.\nYoon's martial law stunt intensified a domestic divide.\nDeclaring martial law, Yoon portrayed Lee's party as \u201canti-state\u201d forces influenced by North Korea and China. He has also endorsed baseless election fraud theories to discredit the liberals\u2019 legislative majority, prompting his angry supporters to pour onto the streets with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d signs. Anti-Yoon activists and citizens, for their part, also rallied for weeks to demand his immediate dismissal.\nWith liberals remaining in control of the legislature, Lee faces a far more favorable environment to advance his policies. Conservatives have voiced concern that Lee and the Democratic Party will wield virtually unchecked power to pass legislation previously blocked by Yoon\u2019s administration, including bills aimed at strengthening protections for labor unionists against corporate lawsuits and shielding farmers from volatile rice prices.",

        "Content": "Trump pushes a July 4th deadline for big tax bill as senators dig in\nPresident Donald Trump wants his \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d bill of tax breaks and spending cuts on his desk to be singed into law by Independence Day\nWASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump wants his \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d bill of tax breaks and spending cuts on his desk to be signed into law by the Fourth of July, and he's pushing the slow-rolling Senate to make it happen sooner rather than later.\nTrump met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune at the White House early this week and has been dialing senators for one-on-one chats, using both the carrot and stick to nudge, badger and encourage them to act. But it's still a long road ahead for the 1,000-page-plus package.\n\u201cHis question to me was, How do you think the bill's going to go in the Senate?\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said about his call with Trump. \u201cDo you think there's going to be problems?\u201d\nIt's a potentially tumultuous three-week sprint for senators preparing to put their own imprint on the massive Republican package that cleared the House late last month by a single vote. The senators have been meeting for weeks behind closed doors, including as they returned to Washington late Monday, to revise the package ahead of what is expected to be a similarly narrow vote in the Senate.\n\u201cPassing THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL is a Historic Opportunity to turn our Country around,\u201d Trump posted on social media. He urged them Monday \u201cto work as fast as they can to get this Bill to MY DESK before the Fourth of JULY.\u201d\nBut Trump's high-octane ally, billionaire Elon Musk, lambasted the package \u2014 and those voting for it.\n\u201cThis massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk posted on his site X, as some lawmakers have expressed reservations about the details. \u201cShame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\u201d\nThune, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, has few votes to spare from the Senate's slim, 53-seat GOP majority. Democrats are waging an all-out political assault on GOP proposals to cut Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments to help pay for more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts \u2014 with many lawmakers being hammered at boisterous town halls back home.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if we could have everybody on board to do it, but, you know, individual members are going to stake out their positions,\u201d Thune said Tuesday.\n\u201cBut in the end, we have to succeed. Failure\u2019s not an option.\u201d\nAt its core, the package seeks to extend the tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump's first term at the White House, and add new ones the presidents campaigned on, including no taxes on tips and others. It also includes a massive build-up of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security.\nTo defray the lost tax revenue to the government and avoid piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services. Estimates are 8.6 million people would no longer have health care and nearly 4 million would lose Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits, known as SNAP.\nThe package also would raise the nation's debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the bills.\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump's bill \"is ugly to its very core.\u201d\nSchumer said Tuesday it's a \u201clie\u201d that the cuts won't hurt Americans. \u201cBehind the smoke and mirrors lies a cruel and draconian truth: tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy paid for by gutting health care for millions of Americans,\" said the New York senator.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to soon provide an overall analysis of the package's impacts on the government balance sheets, particular rising annual deficits. But Republicans are ready to blast those findings from the congressional scorekeeper as flawed.\nTrump Tuesday switched to tougher tactics, deriding the holdout Republican senators to get on board.\nThe president laid into Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian-leaning deficit hawk who has made a career of arguing against government spending. Paul wants the package's $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling out of the bill.\n\u201cRand votes NO on everything, but never has any practical or constructive ideas. His ideas are actually crazy (losers!).\u201d Trump posted.\nPaul seemed unfazed. \u201cI like the president, supported the president,\u201d the senator said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t in good conscience give up every principle that I stand for and every principle that I was elected upon.\u201d\nThe July 4th deadline is not only aspirational for the president, it's all but mandatory for his Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned Congress that the nation will run out of money to pay its bills if the debt ceiling, now at $36 trillion, is not lifted by mid-July or early August to allow more borrowing. Bessent has also been meeting behind closed doors with senators and GOP leadership.\nThune acknowledged Tuesday that lifting the debt ceiling is not up for debate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be done,\u201d the South Dakota senator said.\nThe road ahead is also a test for Thune who, like Johnson, is a newer leader in Congress and among the many Republicans adjusting their own priorities with Trump's return to the White House.\nWhile Johnson has warned against massive changes to the package, Thune faces demands from his senators for adjustments.\nTo make most of the tax cuts permanent \u2014 particularly the business tax breaks that are the Senate priorities \u2014 senators may shave some of Trump's proposed new tax breaks on automobile loans or overtime pay, which are policies less prized by some senators.\nThere are also discussions about altering the $40,000 cap that the House proposed for state and local deductions, known as SALT, which are important to lawmakers in high-tax New York, California and other states, but less so among GOP senators.\n\u201cWe're having all those discussions,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., another key voice in the debate.\nHawley is a among a group of senators, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who have raised concerns about the Medicaid changes that could boot people from health insurance.\nA potential copay of up to $35 for Medicaid services that was part of the House package, as well as a termination of a provider tax that many states rely on to help fund rural hospitals, have also raised concerns.\n\u201cThe best way to not be accused of cutting Medicaid is to not cut Medicaid,\u201d Hawley said.\nCollins said she is reviewing the details.\nThere's also a House provision that would allow the auction of spectrum bandwidth that some senators oppose.\n__ Associated Press writers Matt Brown, Michelle Price and Josh Boak contributed to this report.",

        "Content": "Spanish government says housing market is not a 'free for all' after recent crackdown on Airbnb\nA Spanish government minister tells The Associated Press that Spain has sent a message with its recent crackdown on Airbnb\nMADRID -- MADRID (AP) \u2014 Spain 's government wanted to send a message last month with its crackdown on Airbnb: that the Spanish economy and its housing market are not a \u201cfree for all\" that value profits over the rule of law, a minister told The Associated Press on Tuesday.\nThe government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules by failing to list license numbers, listing the wrong license number or not specifying the apartment's owner. Airbnb is appealing the move.\nSpain is one of the world\u2019s most visited countries. Last year, the Southern European nation of 49 million received a record 94 million international visitors.\nBut a housing affordability problem that is particularly acute in cities such as Madrid and Barcelona has led to growing antagonism against short-term holiday rentals. Airbnb is perhaps the best-known and most visible actor.\nThe Spanish government says the two are related: the rise of Airbnb and other short-term rental companies, and rising rents and housing costs.\n\u201cObviously there is a correlation between these two facts,\u201d Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s not a linear relation, it\u2019s not the only factor affecting it, there are many others, but it is obviously one of the elements that is contributing.\u201d\nA recent Bank of Spain report said the country has a shortfall of 450,000 homes. In the tourist hot spots of the Canary and Balearic Islands, half the housing stock is tourist accommodations or properties owned by nonresidents, the report said.\n\u201cTourism is for sure a vital part of the Spanish economy. It\u2019s a strategic and very important sector. But as in every other economic activity, it must be conducted in a sustainable way,\" Bustinduy said. \u201cIt cannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people. Their right to housing, but also their right to well-being.\u201d\nThe country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Homemade signs including one that read \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d at a recent march in Madrid point to the growing anger.\n\u201cA balance must be found between the constitutional rights of the Spanish people and economic activities in general,\" Bustinduy said.\nRegional governments in Spain are also tackling the issue. Last year, Barcelona announced a plan to close down all of the 10,000 apartments licensed in the city as short-term rentals by 2028 to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents.\nAirbnb said that while its appeal goes through the courts, no holiday rentals would be immediately taken down from the site.\nIn response to Spain's order, Airbnb has said the platform connects property owners with renters but it doesn't have oversight obligations, even though it requires hosts to show that they are compliant with local laws.\nBustinduy said Spain's recent action reflects a desire in Spain, but also elsewhere, to hold tech companies like Airbnb to account.\n\u201cThere is a battle going on about accountability and about responsibility,\u201d Bustinduy said. \u201cThe digital nature of these extraordinarily powerful multinational corporations must not be an excuse to fail to comply with democratically established regulations.\u201d\nBustinduy, who belongs to the governing coalition's left-wing Sumar party, dismissed the idea that the Spanish government's action toward Airbnb could discourage some tourists from visiting.\n\u201cIt will encourage longer stays, it will encourage responsible tourism and it will preserve everything that we have in this wonderful country which is the reason why so many people want to come here,\" he said.\nThe minister also took a shot at low-cost airlines. Spain has pushed against allowing such airlines to charge passengers for hand baggage. Last year, it fined five budget airlines, including RyanAir and easyJet, a total of $179 million for charging for hand luggage.\n\u201cThe principle behind these actions is always the same: preserving consumer rights,\u201d Bustinduy said. \u201cPowerful corporations, no matter how large, have to adapt their business models to existing regulations.\u201d\n___\nJoseph Wilson contributed to this report from Barcelona, Spain.",

        "Content": "OAN's Pentagon reporter learns the limits of expressing her own opinion\nGabrielle Cuccia calls herself a \u201cMAGA girl\u201d who made no secret of her support for President Donald Trump, even as she got a job covering the Pentagon for the One America News Network\nAssigned to cover the Pentagon for the conservative outlet One America News Network, Gabrielle Cuccia didn't pretend to be an unbiased reporter. She describes herself as \u201ca MAGA girl\u201d who is unapologetically defiant in her support of President Donald Trump.\nYet days after publicly criticizing a Trump appointee, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Cuccia found herself out of a job.\nIn taking to Substack last week to express a personal opinion about a figure she covers, Cuccia did something that would be frowned upon in many legacy newsrooms. The message that she was sent, however, is most likely to resound in places where opinion is fine \u2014 but only a certain variety.\nCuccia's lengthy Substack post, \u201cThe Secretary of Defense-ive,\u201d was posted three days after Hegseth issued new rules that banned reporters from accessing large areas of the Pentagon without being watched by his minders.\nShe criticized him for limiting freedom of movement in the name of national security.\n\u201cThe Pentagon wants to paint a picture that journalists are freely roaming classified spaces, sneaking into (secure areas), and leaking top-secret information,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd that is simply not true. There are security cameras everywhere, protocols in place and quite frankly, it would be painfully obvious if a reporter was in a space they didn't belong.\u201d\nCuccia said the real leaks from the Pentagon have come from Hegseth's own team and other senior officials. Hegseth, a former Fox News personality, was embarrassed in March when The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief was mistakenly included in a Signal chat in which the defense secretary discussed upcoming military strikes.\nShe criticized Hegseth for not yet holding a media briefing at the Pentagon.\n\u201cThe Commander-in-Chief welcomes the hard questions ... and yes, even the dumb ones,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhy won't the Secretary of Defense do the same?\u201d\nThree days after her Memorial Day Substack post, Cuccia said her Pentagon access badge was revoked. \u201cBy Friday,\" she said, \u201cI was out of a job.\u201d\nThe Defense Department did not pull Cuccia's credentials, according to a Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues. Cuccia said OAN told her the Substack piece had been \u201cput on their radar,\u201d but she wouldn't say by who. She wouldn't speak further about what her employer told her, and OAN president Charles Herring told The Associated Press that it does not discuss personnel issues.\n\u201cWhen a reporter asks inconvenient questions about government overreach, the response should be accountability \u2014 not silence, and certainly not separation,\u201d Cuccia said.\nTraditionally, the legacy media does not want its journalists expressing opinions about people they cover, since it calls into doubt their ability to report without bias. But exceptions are often made in cases where media access is at issue, said Tom Rosenstiel, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.\nThe New York Times, for example, institutionally called upon Joe Biden to meet more often with journalists when he was president. The Pentagon Press Association said Hegseth\u2019s restrictions were a direct assault on the freedom of the press.\nOne America News Network makes no secret of its allegiance to Trump. When Matt Gaetz's nomination as Trump's attorney general fell apart following the election, OAN quickly signed him up as a contributor. OAN faced lawsuits \u2014 and negotiated settlements \u2014 for its promotion of Trump's false theories that he did not lose the 2020 election.\nWhen Hegseth earlier this year evicted several news organizations from their Pentagon workspaces and gave more room to friendly outlets, Cuccia was assigned space formerly held by NBC News. Before Hegseth aide Sean Parnell's only media briefing, Cuccia said Hegseth's team reached out to her in advance to find out what questions she wanted to ask, something that would never be done for most media outlets.\nIf OAN is responsible for removing Cuccia, it's a \u201ctake no quarter position,\u201d Rosenstiel said. \u201cThere is no room, if you're on the team, to say anything that is negative.\u201d\nHe said he'd be interested to see if any representatives from pro-Trump media outlets defend her. \u201cAre they silent, or do they rally to her in any way?\u201d he asked. Trump, in the past, has frequently criticized Fox News Channel for saying anything on the air that he deemed negative.\nPart of Cuccia's Substack post sounded almost prescient about what might happen to her, when she reminisced about the energy of the early Make America Great Again movement. Questioning government then, she noted, was a point of pride.\n\u201cSomewhere along the way, we as a collective decided \u2014 if anyone ever questioned a policy or person within the MAGA movement \u2014 that they weren't MAGA enough,\" she wrote. \"That they were deep state, that they couldn't be trusted, that they didn't love America as much as we do and that ... to put it bluntly, they sucked.\u201d\n___\nAP correspondent Lolita C.

        "Content": "Asian markets rise as US stock indexes near records amid easing trade tensions\nShares are higher in Asia after U.S. stock indexes drifted closer to records\nShares rose early Tuesday in Asia after U.S. stock indexes drifted closer to records, while oil prices extended gains.\nBeijing and Washington dialed back trade friction as the U.S. extended exemptions for tariffs on some Chinese goods, including solar manufacturing equipment, that U.S. industries rely on for their own production.\nThe U.S. Trade Representative extended those exemptions, which were due to expire on May 31, by three months through Aug. 31.\nStill, China criticized the U.S. on Monday over moves it alleged harmed Chinese interests, including issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China, and planning to revoke Chinese student visas.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.1% to 23,417.39, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.3% to 3,356.36.\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 advanced 0.6% to 37,683.19.\nSouth Korean markets were closed for a snap presidential election triggered by the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative who now faces an explosive trial on rebellion charges over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December.\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.7% to 8,475.50.\nIn Taiwan, the Taiex gained 1.4%.\nOn Monday, U.S. stock indexes drifted closer to their records following a stellar May, Wall Street\u2019s best month since 2023.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 5,935.94 after erasing an early loss from the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1% to 42,305.48. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.7% to 19,242.61.\nIndexes had fallen close to 1% in the morning following some discouraging updates on U.S. manufacturing. President Donald Trump has been warning that U.S. businesses and households could feel some pain as he tries to use tariffs to bring more manufacturing jobs back to the country, and their on-and-off rollout has created lots of uncertainty.\nBut stocks rallied back as the day progressed. Nvidia climbed 1.7%, and Meta Platforms rose 3.6%, for example.\nOil prices have gained as attacks by Ukraine in Russia raise uncertainty about the flow of oil and gas around the world.\nEarly Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 62 cents at $63.14 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 57 cents to $65.19 per barrel.\nMarkets took in stride fresh salvos between the world\u2019s two largest economies, just a few weeks after the United States and China had agreed to pause many of their tariffs that had threatened to drag the economy into a recession.\nThat followed President Donald Trump\u2019s accusation at the end of last week, where he said China was not living up to its end of the agreement that paused their tariffs against each other.\nTrump on Friday told Pennsylvania steelworkers he\u2019s doubling the tariff on steel imports to 50% to protect their industry, a dramatic increase that could further push up prices for a metal used to make housing, autos and other goods. That helped stocks of U.S. steelmakers climb. Nucor jumped 10.1%, and Steel Dynamics rallied 10.3%.\nOn the losing side of Wall Street were automakers and other heavy users of steel and aluminum. Ford fell 3.9%, and General Motors reversed by 3.9%.\nLyra Therapeutics soared nearly 311% for one of the market\u2019s biggest gains after reporting positive late-stage trial results of an implant to treat chronic sinus inflammation in some patients.\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields rose as worries continue about how much debt the U.S. government will pile on due to plans to cut taxes and increase the deficit.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.44% from 4.41% late Friday and from just 4.01% roughly two months ago. That\u2019s a notable move for the bond market.\nBesides making it more expensive for U.S. households and businesses to borrow money, such increases in Treasury yields can deter investors from paying high prices for stocks and other investments.\nYields had dipped briefly in the morning, before rallying back, following the updates on manufacturing, which suggested that effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs are taking root in the economy.\nA report from S&P Global on manufacturing came in better than expected, though uncertainty caused by tariffs has worries high about supplier delays and rising prices.\nAlso early Tuesday, the dollar rose to 143.10 Japanese yen from 142.71 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1438 from $1.1443.\n___\nAP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.",

        "Content": "Judge blocks Florida from enforcing social media ban for kids while lawsuit continues\nA federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued the order Tuesday, blocking portions of the law from taking effect.\nThe measure was one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. on social media use by children when Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it into law in 2024. The law would ban social media accounts for children under 14 and require parental permission for their use by 14- and 15-year-olds.\nIn his order granting the preliminary injunction sought by the groups Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice, Walker wrote that the law is \u201clikely unconstitutional,\u201d but acknowledged that parents and lawmakers have \u201csincere concerns\u201d about social media's effects on kids.\nWalker wrote that the prohibition on social media platforms from allowing certain age groups to have accounts \u201cdirectly burdens those youths\u2019 rights to engage in and access speech.\u201d\nAlso Tuesday, a federal judge in Atlanta heard arguments from NetChoice seeking to block a 2024 Georgia law scheduled to take effect July 1 that would require age verification for social media accounts and require children younger than 16 to get parental permission for accounts. Like in Florida and other states where laws have been blocked, the internet trade group NetChoice argues that the Georgia law infringes on free speech rights, is vague, and overly burdensome.\nWhile siding with the industry groups' claims that the law limits free speech, Walker allowed a provision of the Florida law to go into effect requiring platforms to shut down accounts for children under 16, if their parent or guardian requests it.\nParents \u2014 and even some teens themselves \u2014 are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety.\nMatt Schruers, the president and CEO of the industry association CCIA, praised the judge's order blocking the Florida law.\n\u201cThis ruling vindicates our argument that Florida\u2019s statute violates the First Amendment by blocking and restricting minors \u2014 and likely adults as well \u2014 from using certain websites to view lawful content,\" he said in a statement. \"We look forward to seeing this statute permanently blocked as a violation of Floridians\u2019 constitutional right to engage in lawful speech online.\"\nA spokesperson for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier defended the law and the state's efforts to insulate kids from social media at a time when platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat seem almost impossible to escape.\n\u201cFlorida parents voted through their elected representatives for a law protecting kids from the harmful and sometimes lifelong tragic impacts of social media. These platforms do not have a constitutional right to addict kids to their products,\u201d Uthmeier's press secretary Jae Williams said in a statement. \u201cWe disagree with the court\u2019s order and will immediately seek relief in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d\nIn Atlanta, NetChoice attorney Jeremy Maltz told U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg that Georgia's law would impermissibly restrict speech by minors, saying that \u201cbefore you share your art, before you share your political information, you need to produce your papers, please.\u201d\nTotenberg did not rule Tuesday. But citing rulings against similar laws in other states, she expressed skepticism about Georgia's case, asking Deputy Attorney General Logan Winkles: \u201cWhat makes today different from all other days?\"\nWinkles argued the law's requirement of \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d attempts to verify age could be quite cheap and likened it to banning minors from bars serving alcohol, not restricting their speech.\n\u201cThere are things about social media that make it dangerous,\u201d Winkles said. \u201cIt's a place where children are being restricted. It's not about speech.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy contributed from Atlanta.\n___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

        "Content": "CEO pay rose nearly 10% in 2024 as stock prices and profits soared\nThe typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply\nNEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply.\nMany companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can\u2019t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits.\nThe Associated Press\u2019 CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.\nHere are the key takeaways from the survey:\nThe median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.\nCEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.\nThe stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.\n\u201c2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,\u201d said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.\nSarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent \u201clong-overdue\u201d increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills.\nRick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023.\nAlmost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted.\nOther top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards.\nThe median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar.\n\u201cFor CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,\" said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. \"Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.\u201d\nJackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is \u201cthat share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.\" But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a \u201cphenomenal rise\u201d in CEO compensation \u201ctracking recent years' market performance,\u201d which has \"widened the pay gap within workplaces.\"\nSome well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla\u2019s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle.\nOther notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30.\nAt half the companies in AP\u2019s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company\u2019s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018.\nThe pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries.\nOverall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included.\n\u201cWith CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,\u201d Anderson said. \"These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value \u2013 they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.\u201d\nFor the 27 women who made the AP survey \u2014 the highest number dating back to 2014 \u2014 median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts.\nThe highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.\nOther top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million).\nChristy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs.\n\u201cThere are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we\u2019re really not moving the needle significantly,\u201d she said.\nEquilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.\nEquilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023.\nAmong the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.\n__\nReporters Matt Ott and Chris Rugaber in Washington contributed.",

        "Content": "Measles vaccination rates drop after COVID-19 pandemic in counties across the US\nChildhood vaccination rates against measles fell in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data\nChildhood vaccination rates against measles fell in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data \u2014 including in states that are battling outbreaks this year.\nA Johns Hopkins University study, published in JAMA this week, illustrates where more vulnerable communities are located. The results mirror trends established at state and national levels: Routine childhood vaccination rates are dropping.\n\u201cWhen you look at the state level or national level ... you really don\u2019t see those drastic drops. Those are there. They\u2019re real and they\u2019re really problematic,\u201d said Lauren Gardner, an expert in infectious disease modeling at Johns Hopkins University who is the paper\u2019s senior author. Gardner also built the university\u2019s COVID-19 database.\nMost of the measles cases in the U.S. this year \u2014 1,088 nationally as of Friday \u2014 are in unvaccinated people. It has been spreading among communities due to international and domestic travel. Three people have died from measles during this year's outbreaks, and 2025 is inching closer to becoming the worst for measles in more than three decades.\nMeasles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, and the vaccine is safe and highly effective. Public schools nationwide require two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine before kindergarten, but the number of children with non-medical exemptions from those requirements hit an all-time high in the 2023-2024 school year. Health experts say community-level vaccination needs to be at 95% or higher to prevent outbreaks.\nThe Johns Hopkins study looked at 2,066 counties across 33 states, comparing kindergarten vaccination rates averaged over school years from 2017-2020 to averages from 2022-2024. Where kindergarten data wasn\u2019t available, the researchers used a comparable rate.\nHere's what it looks like in counties where there have been outbreaks this year, including in Texas counties that are the epicenter of measles.\nTexas has logged 742 measles cases since late January, most in West Texas.\nGaines County has 411 cases, the most in the state. Almost 2% of its population got measles. While the county saw a two percentage-point increase in vaccination rates after the pandemic, its 82.4% rate remains below herd immunity.\nTerry County (60 cases) and Yoakum County (20 cases) dropped below the 95% threshold for herd immunity after the pandemic, to 93.7% and 91.8% respectively.\nLubbock County \u2014 which has seen 53 cases and is the closest metro area to Gaines County \u2014 was just below 95% before the pandemic, but dropped three percentage points after to 91.8%.\nEl Paso County on the border of Mexico has had the third-most measles cases in Texas this year with 57. Its vaccination rate is higher than 95% but saw a 2.1 percentage-point decline to 96.5%.\nCounties with outbreaks in Kansas include Gray with 25 cases, Haskell with 11 and and Stevens with seven.\nVaccination rates in Gray County dropped 23 percentage points after the pandemic, from 94% to 71%.\nHaskell County dropped 18 percentage points to 65%. And Stevens County dropped 0.5 percentage points to 90.5%.\nColorado's outbreak, which is linked to an international flight that landed at the Denver airport in mid-May, involves six cases: five in state residents and one out-of-state traveler.\nTwo people who got measles live in Arapahoe County in the Denver metro, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.5 percentage points to 88.4%. Three others live in El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.8 percentage points to 80% post-pandemic.\nPre-pandemic data in North Dakota wasn't available to Johns Hopkins researchers, but they looked at rates from school years ending in 2022, 2023 and 2024.\nNorth Dakota's first outbreak started in Williams County, which now has 16 measles cases. In the timeframe researchers looked at, vaccination rates in Williams rose from 84.6% in 2022 to 87.7% in 2023, only to drop back to 83.5% in 2024.\nCass County has seven cases, and its rate has stayed steady at about 92.7%, while Grand Forks County, which has 10 measles cases, dropped from 95.4% to 93.4%.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "Content": "COVID-related agreement continues to shield some on Georgia's death row from execution\nThe fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia\u2019s death row from execution\nATLANTA -- The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia's death row from execution.\nExecutions in Georgia were halted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the state attorney general's office entered into an agreement with lawyers for people on death row to set the terms under which they could resume for a specific group of prisoners. At least one of those conditions, having to do with the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, has not been met, and seeking an execution date for a prisoner covered by the agreement would breach the agreement, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram ruled.\nThe agreement includes three conditions that had to be met before executions could be set for the affected prisoners: the expiration of the state\u2019s COVID-19 judicial emergency, the resumption of normal visitation at state prisons and the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cto all members of the public.\u201d Once those conditions were met, the state agreed to give three months' notice before pursuing an execution warrant for one of the prisoners covered by the agreement and six months' notice for the rest.\nThe state has argued that the agreement should no longer apply, contending the conditions have been met. But defense attorneys say it's still valid because the vaccine isn't yet available to infants under 6 months old, and visitation at state prisons has not returned to normal.\nIngram's ruling, issued Friday, addressed only the vaccination question. She plans to handle the visitation issue separately.\nIngram wrote that the state's arguments \u201call boil down to an attempt to rewrite the Agreement.\u201d The state is \u201c(u)nhappy with the language it drafted\u201d and wants to change it so that the condition would be satisfied once vaccines are available to \u201cmost members of the public.\u201d\n\u201cBut courts cannot rewrite contracts to relieve a party of their regrets,\u201d she wrote. She ruled that the agreement is \u201cbinding and enforceable,\u201d that the vaccination condition hasn't been met and that seeking an execution warrant before the requirements have been met would breach the agreement.\nThe state attorney general's office plans to appeal, a spokesperson said Tuesday.\nIngram noted that the Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical trials for infants under 6 months old, and newborns receive other vaccines. That shows it is possible for the COVID-19 vaccine to ultimately be available for that age group, and the state should have foreseen that that could take years, she wrote.\nExperts for both sides had testified that it was probable that the COVID-19 vaccine would eventually become available to babies under the age of 6 months, Ingram wrote.\nThat was before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed U.S. health secretary. Kennedy last week announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. A few days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website, which had said those groups should get the shots, was revised to say the vaccinations \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.\nThe agreement covers fewer than 10 of the 34 people currently on Georgia's death row.\nWhile Georgia stopped carrying out executions during the pandemic, death penalty cases continued to wind their way through the court system, and as people exhausted their appeals, they became eligible for execution.\nA committee of a judicial task force on COVID-19 in early 2021 instructed lawyers for people on death row and the state attorney general\u2019s office to come up with terms under which executions could safely resume. The two sides reached the agreement in April 2021.\nThe agreement only applied to people on death row whose requests to have their appeals reheard were denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals while the judicial emergency was in place. The agreement was to remain in effect through Aug. 1, 2022, or one year from the date on which the conditions were met \u2014 whichever was later.\nThe legal fight arose from a lawsuit filed when officials set a May 2022 execution date for Virgil Delano Presnell Jr. The Federal Defender Program, which represents Presnell, said the state had violated the agreement because the conditions hadn\u2019t all been met.\nBased on that argument, a Fulton County Superior Court judge halted the execution less than 24 hours before it was to take place, and the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in December 2022 that the agreement was a binding contract.\nPeople on death row who are not covered by the agreement have since become eligible for execution. One of them, Willie James Pye, was put to death in March 2024.",

        "Content": "Federal prisons must keep providing hormone therapy to transgender inmates, a judge says\nA judge says the federal Bureau of Prisons must keep providing hormone therapy to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment\nWASHINGTON -- The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.\nU.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that the bureau's own medical staff has deemed appropriate.\nThe judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don\u2019t match.\n\u201cIn light of the plaintiffs\u2019 largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,\u201d the judge wrote.\nThe Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The bureau doesn\u2019t dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.\nThe Republican president\u2019s executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren\u2019t spent \u201cfor the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d\nLamberth\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.\nThe lawsuit\u2019s named plaintiffs include Alishea Kingdom, a transgender woman who was prescribed hormone therapy injections and approved to receive social accommodations, including women\u2019s undergarments and cosmetics. Kingdom was denied her hormone shot three times after Trump signed his order, but she had it restored roughly a week after she sued. Her access to feminine undergarments hasn\u2019t been restored, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\u201cIn Ms. Kingdom\u2019s case, there is no indication at all that the BOP means to leave her hormone therapy in place long-term; indeed, as noted above, she was informed by BOP personnel that the decision to resume her treatment was a consequence of this litigation itself, raising the specter that her treatments might be discontinued as soon as the litigation has concluded,\u201d Lamberth wrote.\nTrump\u2019s order also directed the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that \u201cmales are not detained in women\u2019s prisons.\u201d In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men\u2019s facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.\nThe judge said there's no evidence Trump or prison officials considered the harm the new polices could do to transgender inmates.\n\u201cThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged irreparable harm because they are all currently receiving hormone medications. But it suffices to say that all three plaintiffs\u2019 access to hormone therapy is, as best the Court can tell, tenuous,\u201d Lamberth wrote.\nThe plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.\nLamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, in 1987.",

        "Content": "More than 1,000 former rugby players in concussion lawsuit\nA law firm says the number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000\nThe number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000, a British law firm said on Monday.\nRylands Garth, based in London, said more than 520 ex-players from rugby union and rugby league joined the lawsuit by Friday last week, which was the deadline for new applicants set by a court ahead of a hearing in July and before the case potentially goes to trial next year.\nIt takes the total number of players who are part of the lawsuit to approximately 1,100, Rylands Garth said in a statement.\nThe former players contend, according to Rylands Garth, that \u201crugby governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect them from the impacts of concussive and sub-concussive blows during their playing careers, despite knowing of the risks.\u201d\nClaimants are seeking compensation from World Rugby, the English Rugby Football Union and Welsh Rugby Union \u2014 governing bodies in 15-a-side rugby \u2014 and the English Rugby Football League and British Amateur Rugby League Association \u2014 from 13-a-side rugby league \u2014 for lost earnings, medical bills and care costs associated with their injuries, the firm said.\n\u201cRylands Garth is also calling for urgent and substantive reform of the game to better protect the safety of current and future players \u2014 including the creation of an independent brain health ombudsman for the sport,\u201d it said.\nAmong those to have previously joined the class action was World Cup-winning former England hooker Steve Thompson, former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman and former Wales flanker Alix Popham.\n\u201cThis surge in claimants exposes the deep-rooted issues in rugby,\u201d Rylands Garth said, adding: \"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game.\u201d\nIn a joint statement issued by World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU, the governing bodies said they \u201care aware of the latest update shared by the claimants\u2019 legal representatives with the final number of claimants.\u201d\n\u201cWe now await full details of their diagnosis and the claims being made. Our thoughts are with any former player facing challenges.\n\u201cAcross the game, we continue to build on a strong foundation of world-leading initiatives designed to make rugby union as safe as possible.\"\nThat includes \u201csmart mouthguard technology in the elite game, trials of lower tackle height in the community game, and the continued rollout of brain health services to support former players.\u201d\nRylands Garth said it also represents approximately 130 former soccer players who are taking similar legal action against soccer governing bodies. The next court hearing for the soccer case is due on June 26.\n___\nAP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby",

        "Summary": "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
        "Content": "RFK Jr. says autism 'destroys' families. Here's what those families want you to know\nU.S. Health Secretary Robert F\nWASHINGTON -- Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.\nThe 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.\nStill, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.\nKennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d\nHis comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.\nSome worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.\nOhio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who's 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d\nWhile announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.\nFor Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.\nDaniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.\n\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d\nThe Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.\n\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d\nEileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.\nDays in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.\nAt 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.\nLamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.\n\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d\nCopeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.\nKennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.\n\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.\nKennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d\nThat\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.\nAshley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.\n\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d\nDoctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.\nKennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.\nBoth he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.\nLast week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.\nEileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she'd like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about what\u2019s the cause but how do we help,\u201d she said.\nFor Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s study may hold answers she\u2019s wrestled with since Daniel was diagnosed many years ago. She\u2019s aware that research has found no link between vaccines and autism, but she\u2019s still not convinced. Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.\n\u201cWhy did this happen to him?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years and years and years.\u201d",

The lawsuit had been filed last year in state court in Louisville on behalf of a woman who was seven weeks pregnant at the time and identified only by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, which had represented the woman, said in a statement it would not give additional details about the dismissal.\n\u201cPeople have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,\u201d said Amber Duke, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cWe are strategizing our next steps in this fight.\u201d\nThe lawsuit was challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities.

        "Content": "How huge health funding cuts in Washington 'put lives at risk' in communities\nAmericans are losing an array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee.\nState and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big \u2014 and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities \u2014 are being hollowed out.\n\u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\nBut local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed.\nTogether, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.\nThe moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That's one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.\n\"It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d\nJust outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.\nLike many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.\n\u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said.\nThe vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated.\nThe Mecklenburg County department, with \"Protecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.\n\u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d\nWhat they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.\nCritical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d\nState health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.\nMecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department's budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.\nAt times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening.\n\u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d\nIn March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.\nA week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.\nThe sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.\nA Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d\n\u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d\nHHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.\nIn Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.\nIn Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.\nKansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.\nThe cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d\nCDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.\nSo was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.\n\u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.\nShe said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines.\n\u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said.\nThe new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.\nWith health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\nA temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California\u2019s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.\nBut by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation \u2014 some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County\u2019s health director. \u201cWhat really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. ... We were still pretty trim, but we weren\u2019t just, like, bones.\u201d\nIn Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 \u2014 slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs.\nIn Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu.\nThe cuts are not over.\nThe Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC\u2019s budget, enough to cut the agency\u2019s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities.\nMichael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States.\n\u201cWithout the appropriate funding, we can\u2019t properly address these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.\u201d\n___\nUngar reported from Charlotte and Louisville, Kentucky, and Smith reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

        "Content": "CDC removes language that says healthy kids and pregnant women should get COVID shots\nThe nation\u2019s top public health agency has posted new recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women may \u2014 but no longer should \u2014 get COVID-19 vaccinations\nNEW YORK -- The nation's top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get COVID-19 vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.\nThe change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.\nBut the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.\n\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt's not as bad as it could have been.\"\nKennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nOn Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.\nA subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.\n\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\"\nThat kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.\nChildhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.\nTalk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.\nA CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.\nBut Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.\nThe new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \"incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

For many Americans, it\u2019s not clear how easy it will be to get one \u2013 or if they\u2019ve lost the choice.\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was a longtime anti-vaccine activist, said this week that the shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, usurping a decision normally made by scientific experts, not political appointees.\nThe announcement follows an earlier Trump administration step to limit COVID-19 vaccinations among healthy people under age 65.\nUntil now, the U.S. \u2013 following guidance from independent experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 has recommended yearly COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.\nTogether, the moves have left health experts, vaccine makers and insurers uncertain about what to advise and what comes next.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to add a lot of confusion overall,\u201d said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\nSome of this season\u2019s vaccine is still available. Insurance industry experts say if people had insurance coverage before Kennedy\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s highly unlikely that would have ended instantly based on the secretary\u2019s video announcement. That means if someone could find a shot, they'd likely be able to get one for now.\nWho will be able to get what vaccines this fall is still unclear.\nVaccine manufacturers plan to issue updated COVID-19 shots in the late summer or fall. But the Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to limit approval of seasonal shots to seniors and others at high risk, pending more studies of everyone else.\nEven if the U.S. approves vaccines only for certain groups, it still may be possible for others to get the shot depending on the outcome of upcoming advisory meetings, regulatory moves and decisions from insurers and employers.\nInsurers base coverage decisions on the recommendations of that CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It\u2019s not clear what role that panel now will play. Paying out of pocket could cost about $200.\nBut some insurers and employers may decide to still cover the shots regardless of the new recommendations, said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the non-profit KFF, which studies health care issues. She noted that they may view the expense as worthwhile if it avoids a higher bill from someone hospitalized by the coronavirus.\nThe FDA published a list of health conditions it said would qualify, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. The CDC has a more extensive list.\nBut, again, it isn't yet known how this will play out. For example, it could be hard for people to prove they're qualified. If they're vaccinated at a drugstore, for instance, the pharmacist wouldn't normally know about underlying health problems or even ask. Kates said it's unclear whether Kennedy's move would affect whether doctors recommend the shot.\nAnd Sethi, the UW-Madison expert, said \u201cthis elephant in the room\u201d is that blocking vaccination to the healthy may mean people who have a risk factor and simply don't know it will miss out.\nAdding to the confusion, the FDA included pregnancy and recent pregnancy on the list of conditions that would qualify someone for a shot \u2014 but Kennedy said that pregnancy was no longer a qualification in his announcement this week.\nCOVID-19 complications during pregnancy can include preterm birth as well as serious illness in the mother, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said it \u201cstrongly reaffirms\u201d its recommendation for vaccination during pregnancy.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

He and his wife, a successful businesswoman, had applied to come to the UK with their 18-month-old child for three weeks in the summer so they could spend time with his sister, Hope Ibeawuchi-Beales, and her husband, Nick Beales, who is head of campaigning at Ramfel, which supports vulnerable migrants.\nDespite Ibeawuchi-Beales and Beales undertaking to support the family during their trip, a Home Office official turned down the visit visa application. The refusal letter states: \u201cThis sponsorship does not satisfy me of your own intention to leave the UK on completion of your visit.\u201d\nIt adds that future visits are also likely to be refused. Officials also queried how Ibeawuchi, who provided the Home Office with his business registration certificate, derives an income from his business as a self-employed person.\nBKay Security has provided services to the former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan, senior UK and US politicians, celebrities and international footballers including Alex Iwobi, the former Arsenal and Everton player who currently plays for Fulham and Nigeria.\nIt was reported last month that the government was planning to clamp down on visa applications for people from several countries, including Nigeria. Beales said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the UK government refused these visa applications as part of their overtly racist crackdown on Nigerians.\n\u201cSamuel and his wife both run successful businesses in Nigeria and have no interest in remaining here after visiting my family, and had we applied for their visas a year ago I have no doubt they\u2019d have been granted. It sadly says a lot though when the Labour party is even more hostile to families such as ours than their Conservative predecessors.\u201d\nIbeawuchi said he was very disappointed that the Home Office was barring him and his family from coming to the UK. \u201cI feel very bad that the Home Office refused us. I really wanted to take my family to the UK for a visit and we submitted all the necessary documents and photos of the two families spending time together.\n\u201cWe do not want to stay in the UK, just to come here to visit our family for three weeks.\u201d\nIbeawuchi-Beales said: \u201cOur two kids were so excited for their little cousin, aunty and uncle to visit and had already planned all the things they wanted to show them in London. How do we explain to them that the UK government won\u2019t let their family visit them because they\u2019ve decided to target Nigerians like their mother?\n\u201cI\u2019ve previously sponsored several family members and all have come and gone without any problems. My brother would without question not stay here after his family holiday. I don\u2019t believe the invite letter we provided to the Home Office was even read by the person who refused the applications.\u201d\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cEach application is assessed on its individual merits, based strictly on the evidence provided and in accordance with detailed guidance for decision-makers. If an application is refused, the reasons are clearly explained.\u201d\nAccording to Home Office sources those whose visit visas have been refused can reapply addressing the concerns in the refusal notice. Financial circumstances were one of the factors considered before refusing the Ibeawuchi family\u2019s visa.",

        "Content": "US tech mogul Bill Gates has pledged the majority of his $200bn fortune towards health and education services in Africa.\nSpeaking at an event in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Monday, the 69-year-old said that his pledge would focus on \u201cunleashing the human potential through health, through education\u201d across the continent, adding: \u201cEvery country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity.\u201d\nGates, referring to his philanthropic organization, explained: \u201cI recently made a commitment that my wealth will be given away over the next 20 years. And so you can see, you know, I\u2019m extremely lucky. My wealth has gotten to a very high level here. And now, by accelerating my giving, I will have the Gates Foundation take all of those resources.\u201d\nHe went on to add: \u201cThe goals here are pretty basic. They really speak to our values. Mothers should survive delivery. Babies should survive past their fifth birthday \u2013 kids should be well nourished. Many of these infectious diseases should go away, and the rest within 20 years should be at a very low level.\u201d\nCiting his endorsement for artificial intelligence, Gates also said: \u201cI am a technologist at heart. I love backing scientists with great new ideas. And the latest technology that we\u2019re all hearing about is artificial intelligence. And I can say to you that this will be deeply important. It\u2019s an incredible opportunity. It brings challenges with it, but as we drive it forward, it will make a huge difference in health, education and agriculture.\u201d\nWithout naming Donald Trump\u2019s presidential administration, Gates alluded to the slew of federal cuts that have been made across foreign aid programs, saying: \u201cNow, we\u2019re sitting here at a time, actually, of a significant crisis in part of the system where there\u2019s been partnership between countries \u2026 Some of those cuts are being made so abruptly that there are complete interruptions in trials, or medicines are still sitting in warehouses and are not available. And these cuts are something that I think are a huge mistake.\u201d\nGates\u2019s speech came just weeks after he publicly condemned the budget cuts to USAID by the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge), which was run for about four months beginning in January by tech billionaire Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man.\nSpeaking to the Financial Times, Gates said the cuts have led to the expiration of vital food and medicines across aid warehouses, which could precipitate deadly diseases\u2019 spread.\n\u201cThe picture of the world\u2019s richest man killing the world\u2019s poorest children is not a pretty one,\u201d Gates, who has previously criticized Musk, told the outlet.\nIn a separate press release, the Gates Foundation announced that it and its partners would address three main goals associated with the Microsoft founder\u2019s pledge: end preventable deaths of moms and babies; ensure the next generation grows up without having to suffer from deadly infectious diseases; and lift millions of people out of poverty.\nThe foundation said that it will \u201csunset its operations\u201d after 20 years.",

        "Content": "A Kenyan software developer and digital activist who was arrested last week after creating a tool for people to express their opposition to a proposed law has been arraigned in court and released on bail, amid public anger at her detention and growing signs of repression in the east African country and its neighbours.\nRose Njeri was on Tuesday accused of violating the country\u2019s computer misuse and cybercrime law.\nProsecutors said on the charge sheet that her tool enabled users to automatically send emails to the national assembly\u2019s finance committee, \u201cthereby interfering with the normal functioning of the systems\u201d.\nNjeri published a post on X on 19 May announcing her new tool. \u201cI wrote a simple program that lets you reject the Finance Bill 2025 with just one click. Click below to send your objection,\u201d she said. She was arrested at her home in Nairobi on Friday, and police confiscated her electronic devices.\nHer arrest sparked outrage in the country, with politicians, civil society members and Kenyans at large condemning it and calling for her release.\nActivists and family members protested outside the police station where she was being held on Sunday. \u201cImagine having to tell her children that she\u2019s in jail for developing a website that eases public participation for Kenyans who want to submit their proposals on the 2025 budget,\u201d activist Boniface Mwangi said.\nThe executive director of Amnesty International Kenya, Ir\u0169ng\u0169 Houghton, said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cIt is clear to us that Rose Njeri\u2019s rights have been severally violated, and any contemplated fair trial is in jeopardy.\u201d\nNjeri\u2019s tool related to a finance bill that proposes a wide range of tax changes to increase government revenue. Experts say it may increase tax burdens and reduce Kenyans\u2019 disposable income.\nA similar proposed law last year caused unprecedented protests that led to the killing of dozens of protesters and the disappearance and abduction of many more. Demonstrations reduced over time, but killings and disappearances continued with the target tending to shift towards online critics.\nNjeri\u2019s arrest is in line with what observers say is a wave of repression by east African governments cracking down on dissent.\nThe former Kenyan chief justice Willy Mutunga and activists Hanifa Adan and Hussein Khalid were deported from Tanzania two weeks ago. They had travelled to the country to attend a hearing in a treason case against the opposition politician Tundu Lissu.\nTwo other people who had also gone there for the case \u2013 Mwangi and the Ugandan lawyer Agather Atuhaire \u2013 said on Monday that Tanzanian security officers had sexually assaulted them.\nThe Police Reforms Working Group \u2013 Kenya, a coalition of rights organisations, called on the east African and international community to put pressure on the Tanzanian government to hold the officers \u201cresponsible for the torture \u2026 and sexual assault committed against Boniface Mwangi and Agather Atuhaire\u201d accountable.\nThe group spoke alongside the Law Society of Kenya at a press conference in Nairobi.\n\u201cTorture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment are serious crimes under multiple treaties and international law,\u201d they said.\nIn Uganda, where the opposition politician Kizza Besigye has been in jail for six months over alleged treason charges, lawmakers passed a bill last month to allow civilians to be tried in military court.",

        "Content": "A record amount of sargassum has piled up across the Caribbean and nearby areas in May, and more is expected this month, according to a new study.\nThe brown prickly algae is suffocating shorelines from Puerto Rico to Guyana and beyond, disrupting tourism, killing wildlife and even releasing toxic gases that forced one school in the French Caribbean island of Martinique to temporarily close.\nThe amount \u2013 38m tonnes \u2013 is the biggest quantity of algae observed across the Caribbean Sea, the western and eastern Atlantic, and the Gulf of Mexico since scientists began studying the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt in 2011, said Brian Barnes, an assistant research professor at the University of South Florida who worked on the new report from the University of South Florida\u2019s Optical Oceanography Lab.\nThe previous record was set in June 2022 , with some 22m tonnes.\n\u201cThe peaks just seem to keep getting bigger and bigger year after year,\u201d he said.\nBut scientists don\u2019t know why yet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a supremely satisfying answer.\u201d\nThree different types of sargassum exist in the Caribbean and nearby areas, reproducing asexually as they remain afloat thanks to tiny air sacs. They thrive in different ways depending on sunlight, nutrients and water temperature, factors that scientists are currently studying, Barnes said.\nExperts have also said that agricultural runoff, warming waters and changes in wind, current and rain could have an effect.\nWhile large clumps of algae in the open ocean are what Barnes called a \u201chealthy, happy ecosystem\u201d for creatures ranging from tiny shrimp to endangered sea turtles, sargassum near or on the shore can wreak havoc.\nIt can block sunlight that coral reefs need to survive, and if the algae sinks, it can smother reefs and sea grasses. Once it reaches the shore, the creatures living in the algae die or are picked off by birds, Barnes said.\nHuge piles of stinky seaweed also are a headache for the Caribbean, where tourism often generates big money for small islands.\nIn the popular tourist spot of Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, officials have invested in barriers to prevent sargassum from reaching the shore.\nIn the Dutch Caribbean territory of Sint Maarten, crews with backhoes were dispatched in late May as part of an emergency cleanup after residents complained of strong smells of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which can affect a person\u2019s respiratory system.\n\u201cThe smell is quite terrible,\u201d Barnes said.\nMeanwhile, in the French Caribbean, officials expect to soon use storage barges and an upgraded special vessel that can collect several tonnes of seaweed a day.\nThe sargassum \u201cdisfigures our coasts, prevents swimming and makes life impossible for local residents\u201d, the French prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, recently told reporters.\nBut Frank Comito, special adviser to the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association, said such vessels were \u201cmassively expensive\u201d and not a popular option, noting that another method \u2013 using heavy equipment \u2013 is labor-intensive.\n\u201cYou have to be careful because there could be sea turtle eggs affected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can go in there and massively rake and scrape the whole thing.\u201d\nSome Caribbean islands struggle financially, so most of the cleanup is done by hotels, with some offering guests refunds or a free shuttle to unaffected beaches.\nEvery year, the amount of sargassum expands in late spring, peaks around summer and starts to decline in the late fall or early winter, Barnes said.\nThe new record is likely to be broken \u2013 experts said they expect even more sargassum for June.",

        "Content": "Archaeologists and environmentalists have expressed their outrage at a shock decision by Peru\u2019s culture ministry to cut by nearly half the protected archaeological park around the Nazca Lines, excluding an area nearly the size of urban Lima, the country\u2019s capital city.\nThe Unesco world heritage site attracts thousands of tourists to see the vast hummingbird, monkey and whale figures in the desert in Peru\u2019s second-biggest tourist attraction after Machu Picchu. Last year, archaeologists using AI discovered hundreds of new geoglyphs dating back more than 2,000 years, predating the famous lines in the sand.\n\u201cThey are trying to rub out history,\u201d said Ana Mar\u00eda Cogorno Mendoza, president of the Maria Reiche International Association, a non-profit created to protect the Nazca Lines. \u201cThe area that is being separated is exactly where some of the oldest rituals took place, according to our research.\u201d Maria Reiche was a German-born mathematician who pioneered research on the Nazca Lines in the 20th century.\nCritics of the move say it will weaken decades of environmental protection and open up the Nazca Archaeological Reserve to informal and illegal mining, just as international gold prices peak.\nPeru\u2019s culture ministry, which decided on Friday to reduce the Nazca reserve from about 5,600 sq km to roughly 3,200 sq km, said the decision was the result of a 20-year study and consultation and did not affect the Unesco World Heritage destination or its buffer zone.\n\u201cThere has not been enough study to say it has no cultural or archaeological value,\u201d said C\u00e9sar Ipenza, an environmental lawyer who has closely followed the decision-making in the case.\n\u201cThis area, which belongs to our ancestors, requires real protection and not just political expediency.\u201d\nLuis Jaime Castillo, a former culture minister and an archaeologist who has studied the geoglyphs said the protected area was already \u201cinfested with illegal mining and mineral processing plants\u201d.\nSidney Novoa, the technology director at NGO Amazon Conservation, who has mapped the site, said the area now excluded from the protected archaeological zone amounted to more than 2,000 sq km and was overlapped by about 300 concessions owned by miners on a controversial registry of informal miners purportedly in the process of formalising their operations, known as Reinfo.\nIpenza said the registry allowed illegal mining to continue with impunity and without state oversight, adding that the government favoured mining over environmental protection.\nThe move \u201cexposes [the reserve] to a very serious risks and cumulative damage\u201d, said Mariano Castro, a former environment minister. \u201cThe ministry of culture is not considering the expansion of hundreds of extractive mining activities that will cumulatively impact the existing sensitive archaeological zones in Nazca.\u201d\n\u201cThis update responds to the need to more accurately reflect the relationship between the geoglyphs and the physical features recorded in the area, ensuring their protection and preservation,\u201d Fabricio Valencia, Peru\u2019s culture minister, told national radio on Saturday.",

        "Content": "The world will never forget the Tiananmen Square massacre, the US secretary of state and Taiwan president have said on the 36th anniversary of the crackdown, which China\u2019s government still tries to erase from domestic memory.\nThere is no official death toll but activists believe hundreds, possibly thousands, were killed by China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) in the streets around Tiananmen Square, Beijing\u2019s central plaza, on 4 June 1989.\n\u201cToday we commemorate the bravery of the Chinese people who were killed as they tried to exercise their fundamental freedoms, as well as those who continue to suffer persecution as they seek accountability and justice for the events of June 4, 1989,\u201d said Marco Rubio, the US\u2019s top diplomat, in a statement.\n\u201cThe CCP [Chinese Communist party] actively tries to censor the facts, but the world will never forget.\u201d\nResponding to Rubio\u2019s remarks on Wednesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said: \u201cErroneous statements by the US side maliciously distort historical facts, deliberately attack China\u2019s political system and developmental path, and seriously interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\nSeparately, Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory, also praised the bravery of the Tiananmen Square protesters.\n\u201cAuthoritarian governments often choose to silence and forget history, while democratic societies choose to preserve the truth and refuse to forget those who gave their lives \u2013 and their dreams \u2013 to the idea of human rights,\u201d said Taiwan\u2019s president, Lai Ching-te.\nAhead of the 1989 massacre, protesters had been gathering for weeks in the square to call for democratic reforms to the CCP. The student-led movement attracted worldwide attention, which turned to horror as tanks rolled into the square to clear the encampment. Several protesters were also killed at a smaller demonstration in Chengdu, a city in south-west China.\nThe date of 4 June remains one of China\u2019s strictest taboos, and the Chinese government employs extensive and increasingly sophisticated resources to censor any discussion or acknowledgment of it inside China.\nInternet censors scrub even the most obscure references to the date from online spaces, and activists in China are often put under increased surveillance or sent on enforced \u201cholidays\u201d away from Beijing.\nNew research from human rights workers has found that the sensitive date also sees heightened transnational repression of Chinese government critics overseas by the government and its proxies.\nThe report published on Wednesday by Article 19, a human rights research and advocacy group, said that the Chinese government \u201chas engaged in a systematic international campaign of transnational repression targeting protesters critical of the Chinese Communist party\u201d, with Uyghurs, Tibetans and Hongkongers particularly likely to be affected.\nThe report cited Freedom House research in 2023, which found that China had been responsible for about 30% all recorded acts of physical transnational repression since 2014.\n\u201cProtesters targeted by [transnational repression] frequently live in fear of surveillance; targeting; abduction and forced repatriation, especially around embassies and consulates; and \u2018collective punishment\u2019 retaliation against relatives still in China, which also leads people to cut ties with their family,\u201d the report said.\nThe Article 19 researchers found that, with Tiananmen Square vigils snuffed out in China, pro-CCP agents appear to be targeting commemorations in other parts of the world.\nIn 2022, a replica of a statue known as the Pillar of Shame, by the Danish artist Jens Galschi\u00f8t, was vandalised in Taipei. The statue is designed to memorialise the people who died on 4 June 1989. The original was on display at the University of Hong Kong for 23 years before it was removed by university authorities in 2021.\nFor many years, Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent Macau, were the only places on Chinese territory where the event could be commemorated.\nBut since the 2019 pro-democracy protests and the ensuing crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, the annual 4 June vigil in Victoria Park has been banned.\nIn recent years some high-profile activists have been prosecuted over attempts to mark the day. For the last three years a government-sponsored food carnival has been held on the site during the week of the anniversary.\nOn Tuesday there was a heavy police presence in Causeway Bay, near the park, Hong Kong Free Press reported.\nA performance artist, Chan Mei-tung, was stopped and searched, and later escorted from the area by police. She was standing on the road chewing gum, according to the outlet. In 2022 Chan was arrested after she stood in the same area peeling a potato.\nOn Tuesday Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, John Lee, warned that any activity conducted on Wednesday must be \u201clawful\u201d, but was not specific. A key criticism of Hong Kong\u2019s national security laws are that they are broad and the proscribed crimes are ill-defined.\nOne of the few groups of people in China who are still outspoken about the events of 36 years ago are the rapidly ageing \u201cTiananmen Mothers\u201d, parents of young people killed in the massacre, who have called for an official reckoning.\nOne of the founding members, 88-year-old Zhang Xianling, gave a rare interview this year with Radio Free Asia, saying that she still lives under close surveillance.\nZhang said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why they are so afraid of me. I am 88 years old and I have to use a wheelchair if I can\u2019t walk 200 metres. Am I that scary?\u201d\nEarlier this week Li Xiaoming, an ex-PLA officer who has lived in Australia for 25 years, gave an interview to Taiwan media, about his involvement at the Tiananmen crackdown as a junior soldier.\nLi said he was compelled to talk \u201cas a warning to the world\u201d, and also to Taiwan which is facing the threat of Chinese annexation.\n\u201cAlthough the CCP leadership sees the 4 June incident as something shameful, what they learned from it is the need for strict control \u2013 eliminating any sign of unrest early on, controlling and blocking public opinion, and brainwashing to people. They work to crush all instability at the earliest stage,\u201d he said according to Channel News Asia\u2019s translation.\nAdditional reporting by Oliver Holmes",

        "Content": "Politicians in Norway have rejected calls to stop investing its sovereign wealth fund \u2013 the largest in the world \u2013 in the occupied Palestinian territories despite emotional scenes inside and outside parliament.\nThe \u00a31.4tn oil fund, which is run by Norges Bank according to rules set by MPs, is the largest European investor in Israel\u2019s occupation.\nAmong the 45 proposals voted on in Wednesday\u2019s annual review of the oil fund \u2013 several of which related to Israel \u2013 was to instruct Norges Bank to divest the oil fund from companies that contribute to Israel\u2019s illegal occupation and what the proposals said were Israeli war crimes.\nThe vote came after dramatic scenes in Stortinget (parliament) in Oslo as several MPs gave speeches about Gaza through tears. One politician, Marian Hussein, was asked by the speaker to remove her keffiyeh, which she kept on in protest. During the debate, sounds of shouting protesters outside echoed in the chamber.\nHussein, the deputy leader of the Socialist Left party, which brought forward one of the proposals, said in response: \u201cSpeaker, I will not take off my Palestinian scarf. Those standing outside are shouting right now: \u2018Stop Norwegian involvement, withdraw the oil fund.\u2019\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWhy do we still show double standards in this hall? Why are some people worth less than others?\u201d\nAfter quoting from a famous Norwegian poem, Du M\u00e5 Ikke Sove (Dare Not Sleep) from 1936, she cited Jens Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary general who is now the finance minister in Norway\u2019s minority Labour government.\n\u201cWe are a small nation which constantly talks about the need for a world order,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a finance minister who has been a former Nato chief and prime minister. He knows very well what this means in foreign policy.\u201d\nDuring the debate, Stoltenberg said Norway had \u201can established ethical regime for the fund\u201d. He added: \u201cWe divest from the companies that contribute to Israel\u2019s breach of international law, but we do not divest from all companies that are present on the ground.\u201d\nAfter the vote, Hussein told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly disappointed. This should have been the easiest vote of our lives, especially for the Labour party and the Labour government.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWe are not backing down. Shortly before the government recognised the state of Palestine, they voted against it in parliament. We will continue to put pressure on the other parties together with the massive movement in civil society.\u201d\nBefore the afternoon vote, crowds gathered outside parliament for a protest organised by several organisations including the Palestinian Committee, the Action Group for Palestine and Amnesty International Norway.\nNorway has played a historical role in the region, including by facilitating the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians that led to a breakthrough deal in 1993. Last year it recognised the Palestinian state, one of a minority of European countries to do so.\nLast week, Norway\u2019s international development minister, \u00c5smund Aukrust, told the Guardian that Israel was setting a dangerous precedent for international human rights law violations in Gaza that was making the world more dangerous.\nLine Khateeb, the leader of the Palestine Committee of Norway, said the vote was an opportunity for politicians \u201cto show that international law matters and that they do not want to make Norway complicit in the Israeli genocide and colonisation\u201d.\nStoltenberg, she said, \u201cneeds to take responsibility\u201d and she called on the oil fund to divest from Israel as it had done from all Russian companies immediately after the invasion of Ukraine. She added: \u201cEven though the Norwegian oil fund is Europe\u2019s largest investor in the Israeli occupation, Stoltenberg claims that the current guidelines are good enough. That is appalling and needs to change.\u201d\nThe discovery of one of the world\u2019s largest offshore oilfields off the Norwegian coast in 1969 and the huge revenue that came from selling it dramatically changed Norway\u2019s prospects, bringing rapid economic growth.\nNorway\u2019s oil fund, officially called the Government Pension Fund Global, was established in 1990 to preserve revenues for future generations in the knowledge that the oil supply will one day run out. The first deposit was made to the fund in 1996 and since then it has been invested only outside Norway.",

        "Content": "The European Commission has said more than 4 million Ukrainians living in the EU should have their right to stay extended until March 2027, while calling for efforts to promote voluntary returns to their home country.\nTemporary protection status for Ukrainians who fled after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of February 2022 would be extended by one year until March 2027, under a European Commission proposal published on Wednesday. EU member states must approve the extension, which applies to 4.3 million Ukrainians, one-third of whom are children.\nWhile calling for the extension, the commission urged EU governments to think beyond the temporary fix by making it easier for Ukrainians to obtain other types of residence permits, such as work and student visas. It said governments should set up programmes to promote voluntary returns to Ukraine, including by supporting exploratory visits.\nMagnus Brunner, the EU\u2019s internal affairs commissioner, emphasised that all returns would be voluntary and that ending temporary protection status would be a decision taken with EU member states and Ukraine \u201conce we have a stable situation\u201d.\nThe proposals came as Ukraine\u2019s government outlined plans for \u201cunity hubs\u201d \u2013 community centres which will offer its citizens information about returning home and integrating into their host societies. The first unity hub is due to open this summer in Berlin, with others planned in Prague and Alicante.\nUkraine\u2019s deputy prime minister Oleksiy Chernyshov told reporters: \u201cWe desperately need Ukrainians back home once the war is over. We need to develop the Ukrainian economy, we need to transform Ukraine into a prosperous economy and develop democracy.\u201d\nChernyshov said that if Ukraine were to attain the \u201cquite achievable\u201d goal of doubling the size of its economy in the decade after the war it could need an additional 4 million people in the labour market. \u201cOnly the strong economy can pave the way to the future success of Ukraine and successful integration into the European Union,\u201d he added.\nThe proposals follow inconclusive talks in Istanbul, where Russia and Ukraine agreed only on a prisoner exchange, while Moscow refused to compromise on its maximalist war aims, which include the recognition of four Ukrainian regions it claims, but does not fully occupy.\nChernyshov said that \u201cthe results we are getting with these talks are not the ones that could have been achieved\u201d. He said a voluntary returns programme being developed with the UN agencies the IOM and UNHCR, would answer questions facing every Ukrainian family in Europe: \u201cHow they will return back home? What are going to be the possibilities and proposals for their job? Where are they going to live, where are their kids going to go to school? What is the healthcare system proposal \u2013 and so on.\u201d\nThe commission is releasing \u20ac4bn to support Ukrainians in the EU, on top of \u20ac15bn allocated to member states since 2022.\nThe EU activated its temporary protection directive for Ukrainians in March 2022, in an unprecedented gesture of support. That temporary status has been extended several times, but several EU governments have begun exploring other options.\nIn the Czech Republic, Ukrainians earning at least 440,000 Czech crowns (\u00a314,900), with two years\u2019 residence, can now apply for a long-term residence permit. In Poland, Ukrainians who have had temporary protection for at least one year can apply for a three-year residence permit, although they would lose certain benefits such as free healthcare and a waiver on university tuition fees.\nNorway, which is outside the EU but operates a similar temporary protection scheme, announced last year it was tightening up rules so Ukrainians from areas considered safe would be treated like any other asylum seeker and not automatically granted the right to stay.\nSupport for Ukrainians in the EU remains high, but has ebbed since the early days of the invasion. By February 2024, 71% of people surveyed by Eurobarometer supported Ukrainian refugees, compared with 88% immediately after of the invasion.",

        "Content": "A US-backed group operating food distribution sites in Gaza announced it would not give out any provisions on Wednesday, a day after Israel killed dozens of Palestinians waiting for food and with the Israeli army warning that roads leading to distribution centres were considered \u201ccombat zones\u201d.\nAfter Israeli troops opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians, killing at least 27 and injuring hundreds, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has pressed Israel to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its distribution sites.\nGHF is holding security talks with the Israeli army and told the Guardian it could not confirm whether or not operations would resume on Thursday.\nThe GHF said it had asked the Israeli military to \u201cguide foot traffic in a way that minimises confusion or escalation risks\u201d near military perimeters, develop clearer guidance for civilians and enhance training to support civilian safety. \u201cOur top priority remains ensuring the safety and dignity of civilians receiving aid,\u201d said a GHF spokesperson.\nAn Israeli military spokesperson warned civilians against moving in areas leading to GHF sites on Wednesday, deeming them \u201ccombat zones\u201d.\nThe GHF announced in a post on social media that its distribution points would be closed on Wednesday for \u201cupdate, organisation and efficiency improvement work\u201d. The group did not give more information on the improvements it intended to make. It said it was discussing security measures beyond the immediate perimeter of GHF sites with the Israeli military.\nThe military said on Tuesday it had opened fire on a group of people it viewed as a threat near a GHF food distribution site. The International Committee of the Red Cross said at least 27 people were killed and dozens injured. The GHF said the incident was \u201cwell beyond\u201d its site.\nIt was the third such shooting in three days, with Israel admitting on Tuesday for the first time that its forces shot at Palestinians. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing \u201ca number of suspects moving towards them\u201d.\n\u201cThe forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces. The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,\u201d the military said, without specifying who the suspects were.\nA spokesperson for the GHF, which has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza and is backed by Israel, told the Associated Press that the group \u201cwas saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor\u201d.\nThe shooting occurred as the same site where on Sunday more than 30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire while they were heading to the distribution hub.\nThe UN human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the \u201cdeadly attacks\u201d on civilians around food distribution was a war crime. \u201cDeadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid in Gaza are unconscionable,\u201d T\u00fcrk said. \u201cAttacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.\u201d\nWitnesses told the Guardian that the shooting started in the city\u2019s Flag Roundabout area, about a kilometre from the food distribution hub.\nFadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the food distribution site. \u201cWhen gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,\u201d Fadi said.\n\u201cHe was supposed to get married next month. Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren\u2019t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger.\u201d\nIsrael imposed a blockade on all supplies in March, claiming Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters. The group denies this and aid officials in Gaza have denied there is evidence of any widespread diversion of supplies at any stage of the conflict. In May a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.\nThe GHF took over the handling of food relief despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, who criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people, and that it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.\nOn Tuesday, an evangelical leader and adviser to Donald Trump on interfaith issues was appointed as the new head of the GHF. Johnnie Moore, a member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and founder of the boutique advisory firm Kairos Company, replaced Jake Wood, a former marine, who resigned saying he could not guarantee the GHF\u2019s independence from Israeli interests.\nMoore has been a vocal defender of the GHF and has bristled at public criticism of the rollout, telling the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on X that reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking food supplies in Gaza were \u201ca lie \u2026 spread by terrorists\u201d.\nThe UN security council is expected to vote on Wednesday on a demand for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and humanitarian access across Gaza, where malnutrition is widespread and food relief has only trickled in since Israel lifted an 11-week blockade in late May.\n\u201cIt is unacceptable. Civilians are risking \u2013 and in several instances losing \u2013 their lives just trying to get food,\u201d a UN spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, said on Tuesday, adding that the food distribution model backed by the US and Israel was \u201ca recipe for disaster, which is exactly what is going on\u201d.\nIn a separate development, Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 26 people, according to hospital officials. One of the strikes hit a tent in Gaza City, killing seven people including two women and a seven-year-old girl, according to Shifa hospital.\nIsrael\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.\nReuters contributed to this report",

        "Content": "Aasis Subedi, a Bhutanese Nepali refugee, finds himself back in the same Nepal refugee camp he spent part of his youth, once again stateless.\nLast month, Subedi and two dozen community members from across the US were deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers to Bhutan, the tiny Himalayan country where they had never previously set foot. At least four, including Subedi, were immediately rejected by Bhutanese authorities and then expelled to India, where they fled to a refugee camp in Nepal.\n\u201cI have nothing right now. They brought us in [to Bhutan] without any documents,\u201d he says from one of the three Beldangi refugee camps in the south-east of Nepal, where he is using his father\u2019s cellphone.\nSubedi had been serving jail time for a third-degree felony offense committed in Columbus, Ohio, before he was put on a plane and deported via New Jersey.\nSubedi is one of the more than 100,000 Bhutanese Nepalis who fled ethnic cleansing and were made stateless by the Bhutanese government who stripped them of their citizenship rights in the 1980s. Since 2008, more than 90,000 have been resettled in the US.\nBut the Trump administration has upended life for the community.\n\u201cBhutan is still not safe for our community members to return [to]. It is a matter of putting our lives at risk \u2026 Now, people are going through the cycle of being stateless again,\u201d says Robin Gurung of Asian Refugees United.\nSeveral of the deported people are believed to be missing in India.\nIce told Global Press Journal that Subedi was deported under a \u201ctargeted enforcement operation\u201d. Green card holders \u2013 Subedi is a legal permanent resident \u2013 can be deported having been found guilty of a serious crime but only after having the opportunity to plead their case in court and once the US government has shown \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that the person can be deported. US laws forbid the deportation of individuals to countries where their safety may be at risk.\n\u201cMost of the folks who have been deported have already served their time. For me, that is the matter of concern,\u201d says Gurung. \u201cThey served their time, they were in their communities, providing for their families, their children, and now they are gone.\u201d\nThousands of Bhutanese Nepalis have settled in parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania that faced major economic struggles and population loss due to the 2008 Great Recession. About 8,000 Bhutanese Nepali people now live in Reynoldsburg, a city outside Columbus, making up about one-fifth of the population.\nAlong the suburb\u2019s main thoroughfare, East Main Street, Bhutanese Americans have opened up more than 30 businesses ranging from hair salons to restaurants.\n\u201cA lot of the community works at local Amazon and FedEx facilities. Those kinds of jobs were very attractive for folks, and the schools in Reynoldsburg are good,\u201d says Bhuwan Pyakurel who came to Reynoldsburg in 2016 and has since become America\u2019s first-ever Nepali-Bhutanese elected official.\n\u201cMany of those businesses were closed before we came here [and] we came and revived them. Cricket is a big thing for the Bhutanese community when it wasn\u2019t known here in the past. Now the city is in the process of building a new cricket field.\u201d\nWhile towns and cities across the Sun belt have grown significantly in recent years, northern states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and beyond have struggled to retain and attract residents.\nAs a result, immigrants have played an important role in helping local economies grow, creating a tax base for city authorities and adding vibrancy to a region working to shed its Rust belt past. Nextdoor in Pennsylvania, about 40,000 Bhutanese Nepalis live in the cities of Harrisburg and Lancaster. Harrisburg has lost nearly half of its population since 1950, though in recent years that decline has been halted.\nBut now a crippling fear has gripped immigrant communities across the country.\nPyakurel, who was elected to Reynoldsburg\u2019s city council in 2019 having lived in a refugee camp in Nepal for 18 years, says he now fields five to 10 phone calls a day from worried local Bhutanese Nepali residents, many asking for guidance.\n\u201cPeople are wondering if they should apply for their citizenship or wait for three years, if they should renew certain documentation,\u201d he says. Last month, the Palestinian green card holder and Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi was detained at a naturalization interview and deportation proceedings against him were enacted. On 30 April, Mahdawi was released.\n\u201cNowadays, I carry my passport with me all the time,\u201d says Pyakurel. \u201cEven though I\u2019m a [city council] representative here, I don\u2019t look like a citizen to many Ice officers.\u201d\nSubedi came to the US through a government refugee relocation program in July 2016 and had been living and working as a machine operator in Pennsylvania before his arrest in Columbus last July.\nNow 7,700 miles from home, he has little to do but sit all day in the refugee camp, where he lives in a bamboo-made hut \u2013 the very same camp he spent the first two years of his life and where his father still lives. The arrival of him and three others deported from the US caused a stir at the camp, which drew the attention of the Nepali police, who detained him for several weeks as his legal status was investigated.\nThis month, his daughter turns three years old. He says his family has no money to assist him in the refugee camp in part because his wife stopped working when their child was born.\nHe says he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to come back to the US.\n\u201cI want to come back. I have family, my kids,\u201d Subedi says.\n\u201cThis is the second time we have become a refugee.\u201d",

It is too devastating to be put in the hands of political people that may want to use it despite the horrendous effect it could have on our Country,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\nThe GOP is looking to raise the debt ceiling as part of the party\u2019s broader tax and spending cuts package to enact Trump\u2019s domestic agenda.\nWarren on Friday backed Trump\u2019s call to abolish the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, pressing for bipartisan action to \u201cget rid of it forever\u201d. She posted on X that she and Trump agree that the debt limit, which caps how much money the Treasury can owe to pay the country\u2019s bills, should \u201cbe scrapped to prevent an economic catastrophe\u201d.\nHowever, she also added in a jab to the GOP\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that \u201cjacking up the debt limit by $4tn to fund more tax breaks for billionaires is an outrage\u201d.\nHere\u2019s Trump\u2019s full post, which was posted alongside a screenshot of that X post from Warren:\nI am very pleased to announce that, after all of these years, I agree with Senator Elizabeth Warren on SOMETHING. The Debt Limit should be entirely scrapped to prevent an Economic catastrophe. It is too devastating to be put in the hands of political people that may want to use it despite the horrendous effect it could have on our Country and, indirectly, even the World. As to Senator Warren\u2019s second statement on the $4 Trillion Dollars, I like that also, but it would have to be done over a period of time, as short as possible. Let\u2019s get together, Republican and Democrat, and DO THIS!\nUkraine has released dramatic edited footage of its drone attack on four Russian military airbases in Operation Spiderweb, which was 18 months in the making, and involved the use of remotely operated drones from Ukrainian territory.\nRussian planes and jets were targeted on runways across Russia and destroyed by the Ukrainian drones. Scenes of carnage were visible from the first-person view footage, with Russian planes engulfed in balls of fire.\nThe drone attacks carried out by Ukraine in Operation Spiderweb destroyed billions of dollars worth of Russian aircraft stationed at bases across the country, including at locations as far away as Siberia, in what Kyiv claims is its longest-range assault of the war.\nThe spectacular operation was prepared in secret over 18 months. Ukraine\u2019s agents moved short-range drones and explosives inside Russia before they were launched remotely for a coordinated strike on Sunday that was intended to strike at Moscow\u2019s air superiority.\nDrones were smuggled into Russia and placed inside containers, which were later loaded on to trucks. With the trucks positioned near Russian bases, the roof panels of the containers were lifted off by a remotely activated mechanism, allowing the drones to fly out and begin their attack. The drones had first-person view, or FPV, technology that allowed them to be operated remotely, probably from Ukrainian territory.\nAttempting to launch drones from Ukraine would have been much harder, as they would have had to cover huge distances and avoid Russia\u2019s air defences.\nThe White House confirmed yesterday that Donald Trump had no advance knowledge of the attack. He also hadn\u2019t commented on it publicly until this afternoon\u2019s call with Vladimir Putin.\nHere\u2019s a visual guide to the operation from my colleagues:\nTrump says Putin told him Russia \u2018will have to respond\u2019 to Ukraine drone attacks\nDonald Trump has said that he has just discussed the recent drone attacks by Ukraine on Russia and developments concerning Iran in a phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin that lasted over an hour.\nDuring the conversation, Putin told Trump that Russia will have to respond to the Ukrainian drone attacks, the US president said. \u201cIt was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace,\u201d he said in a Truth Social Post.\nPutin had said \u201cvery strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields\u201d - referring to \u2018Operation Spiderweb\u2019, which saw Ukrainian agents move drones and explosives deep inside Russia to strike four airbases - Trump said.\nHe also said that Putin had suggested he may participate in talks with Iran to try to get a nuclear deal done.

How well or badly the talks go \u2013 during a small group meeting, followed by a lunch and then, perhaps most nail-bitingly, a press conference in the Oval Office \u2013 may shape relations for decades to come, analysts say.\nHaving reportedly spoken by phone four times since Merz\u2019s election win in February, swapped numbers and exchanged an undisclosed number of text messages, the two leaders are now on first-name terms.\nBut Merz knows the road to a normal friendship is thorny. The transatlantic relationship has been altered almost beyond recognition since Trump\u2019s return to office, and the shock \u201csits very deep\u201d, said Mariam Lau, a journalist and the author of a new in-depth portrayal of Merz. She went on:\nIt\u2019s the equivalent of a medical emergency in political terms: the speed and degree to which the Merz government has had to react to the disintegration of the transatlantic alliance, one of its main foreign policy pillars, is like being forced to undergo dialysis or an organ transplantation.\nBerlin has viewed as menacing and dangerous the unprecedented interference in German politics by leading members of the Trump administration \u2013 by his former adviser Elon Musk; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and the vice-president, JD Vance, in particular. There is the lack of unity over how and even whether to punish Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine, there are tensions over defence spending levels, and there are diverging viewpoints over the Middle East, and over Trump\u2019s looming tariffs.\nIndeed nobody in Berlin is resting on their laurels. As to just how quickly leaders\u2019 inaugural visits to the Oval Office can curdle, one only needs to recall Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s lions\u2019 den encounter three months ago, or more recently the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s. It has not gone unnoticed that Merz called the latter last Friday, reportedly to pick up a few Trump-whisperer tips.\nLau said Merz would have to \u201cwalk a tightrope between keeping an open dialogue with Trump and standing up to him, not giving into his whims\u201d. And Merz is said to have been coached on an array of eventualities and is armed, rhetorically at least. Merz knows that keeping things brief, not interrupting, heaping praise and stressing the commonalities is the accepted playbook when dealing with Trump.\nNOAA 'fully staffed' with forecasters and scientists, US commerce secretary says\nCommerce secretary Howard Lutnick has told a Senate hearing that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is \u201cfully staffed\u201d with weather forecasters and scientists after concerns were raised about some offices losing 24-hour staffing ahead of hurricane season.\n\u201cWe are fully staffed with forecasters and scientists. Under no circumstances am I going to let public safety or public forecasting be touched,\u201d Lutnick told a Senate appropriations subcommittee overseeing NOAA, saying he got the National Weather Service (NWS) exempted from a federal hiring freeze.\nNOAA, which includes the NWS, lost around 1,000 people or 10% of its workforce amid federal job layoffs in the first months of the second Trump administration, including 600 at the weather service. At least six NWS offices had stopped the routine twice-a-day weather balloon launches that collect data for weather models.\nThe US hurricane season officially began on Sunday and lasts through November. NOAA forecast last week that this year\u2019s season is expected to bring as many as 10 hurricanes.\nThe agency had been scrambling to reassign staffers internally to fill gaps in understaffed offices over the last few months, sources told Reuters.\nLutnick told the committee that they are going to fill these positions and focus on cutting programs that he said were not part of NOAA\u2019s mission, including \u201cchildren\u2019s books about climate anxiety\u201d.\nAn internal memo seen by Reuters said that NOAA plans to hire 126 mission-critical positions at the National Weather Service including forecasters, radar technicians, hydrologists and physical scientists that will be advertised externally.\nCongress budget office sees economic output falling from Trump tariffs\nUS economic output will fall as a result of Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs on foreign goods that were in place as of 13 May, while also reducing federal budget deficits by $2.8tn over a decade, the non-partisan CongressionalBudget Office has said.\nReuters reports that in a letter to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and two other high-ranking Democrats, the CBO said the tariffs, which have been challenged in court cases, will raise the costs of consumer and capital goods.\n\u201cCBO estimates that, on net, real (inflation-adjusted) economic output in the United States will fall as a result,\u201d the agency said.\n\u201cInflation will increase by an annual average of 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026, in CBO\u2019s estimation, reducing the purchasing power of households and businesses,\u201d the letter to Schumer and senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley stated.\nWyden is the senior Democrat on the Senate finance committee and Merkley is the ranking Democrat on the Senate budget committee. The three senators requested the CBO analysis on the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs implemented between 6 January and 13 May through executive actions.\nThe CBO\u2019s inflation estimates were compared to an economic outlook published by the CBO on 17 January.\nThe analysis was completed before two courts ruled that the tariffs exceeded the president\u2019s authority to impose them. The administration has asked an appeals court to pause one of the rulings.\nMike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, said he tried to call Elon Musk on Tuesday night after the tech billionaire\u2019s online outburst denouncing Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending bill as a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d.\nJohnson told reporters on Wednesday:\nI called Elon last night and he didn\u2019t answer. I hope to talk to him today.\nHe said he and Musk are \u201cvery friendly\u201d, adding:\nWe\u2019ve laughed about our differences on policy before. I\u2019m not upset about this.\nTrump pushes Congress to cut $9.4bn in funding for NPR, PBS and foreign aid\nAdam Gabbatt\nThe Trump administration formally asked Congress to rescind $9.4bn in already approved funding from foreign aid and public broadcasters including NPR and PBS on Tuesday, seeking to enshrine spending cuts identified by Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge).\nThe process, known as rescission, is required by Donald Trump to retrieve money from programs and policies that have already received the funding.\nA spokesperson for the White House office of management and budget told the Associated Press that $8.3bn was being cut from the state department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID).NPR and PBS will also lose about $1.1bn in federal funding if Congress fulfills Trump\u2019s request.\nThe targeting of public broadcasters fits with the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing war on the US media. Trump signed an executive order in May cutting federal funding to NPR and PBS, and has launched multiple lawsuits against other news organizations.\nThe House and the Senate will now weigh whether to rescind the funding. On Tuesday Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, pledged to pass the cuts.\nAndriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he met with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Washington DC.\nIn a series of posts on social media, Yermak said he and Rubio discussed the \u201csituation on the front lines and the urgent need to strengthen support for Ukraine\u2019s air defense.\u201d\nThe pair also \u201cexchanged views on the meetings with the Russians in Istanbul, the further course of negotiations, the upcoming prisoner exchange, and the importance of bringing back all hostages and children abducted by Russia,\u201d he said, adding:\nI emphasized that Ukraine has done everything possible to achieve peace and is ready for a ceasefire \u2014 but Russia refuses. That is why additional sanctions are necessary.\nHe and Rubio \u201cagreed to coordinate our next steps,\u201d Yermak said.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has also projected an increase of 10.9m people without health insurance under Donald Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cut bill.\nThat would include 1.4m people who are in the country without legal status in state-funding programs, Associated Press reports.\nAs we reported earlier, the House-passed version of the bill could add $2.4tn to the federal government\u2019s $36.2tn debt, according to the CBO\u2019s revised estimate on Wednesday.\nThe new CBO estimate takes into account late changes that were made to the bill as Republican leaders steered it to passage.\nMexico will respond if there is no agreement with US on 'unfair' metals tariffs, says president\nMexico will announce measures next week if there is no agreement reached with the United States on the steel and aluminum tariffs announced, president Claudia Sheinbaum has said.\nShe also called the US announcement to raise the metals\u2019 tariffs an \u201cunfair measure\u201d during her morning conference, and added that Mexico\u2019s answer will not be \u201can eye for an eye\u201d.\nTrump's 'big, beautiful bill' will add $2.4tn to national debt, according to nonpartisan analysis\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has released a revised estimate of the cost of Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending cut bill passed by the House of Representatives, concluding it will add $2.4tn to the federal government\u2019s $36.2tn debt.\nThe new assessment comes a day after Elon Muskblasted the bill as a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d, emboldening GOP deficit hawks who have been pushing back against the measure.\nAn earlier CBO estimate predicted the bill, which passed through the House on 22 May by a single vote and with no Democratic support, would add around $3.8tn to Washington\u2019s debt over the next decade.\nThe measure, now under consideration in the Senate, aims to extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts while also achieving steep spending reductions to pay for them, largely \u2013 and highly controversially \u2013 on Medicaid.\nThe new CBO estimate takes into account late changes that were made to the bill as Republican leaders steered it to passage.\nUAE seeks US trade deal to roll back Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs - Reuters\nThe United States and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to start negotiations for a potential bilateral trade agreement that could ease tariffs on the Gulf state\u2019s steel and aluminum industry, four people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.\nEmirati officials discussed the possibility of a trade agreement with US counterparts during Donald Trump\u2019s two-day visit to Abu Dhabi last month, the sources said.\nThe Office of the US Trade Representative did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Neither did Emirati officials.\nLike other nations, the UAE has been hit by Trump\u2019s 10% baseline tariff on its exports to the US. But its steel and aluminum products have also been hit by a 25% tariff that the Trump administration is now doubling to 50%.\nWhile the UAE is a major oil producer, its steel and aluminium products are significant non-oil exports. In 2024, the UAE was the second-largest steel and aluminium exporter to the US, accounting for 8% of total US consumption, data shows.\nIn Abu Dhabi, Emirati officials highlighted to American counterparts comprehensive trade deals that it had signed with other countries over the past three years, the sources said, to illustrate that the UAE was capable of moving quickly on trade talks.\nThe sources said that US officials had responded positively, although it was unclear when talks would start. Two of the sources said Washington was likely to negotiate a limited deal that would fall short of a comprehensive free trade pact.\nThe UAE is Washington\u2019s biggest trade partner in the Middle East, according to the Gulf state\u2019s foreign ministry. Bilateral trade in 2024 was valued at $34.4bn, according to US trade data, with the US enjoying a $19.4bn surplus.\nThe Gulf state, which is reliant on the US security umbrella, has pledged to invest $1.4tn in the US over the next decade. Its sovereign wealth funds, including Abu Dhabi\u2019s $330bn Mubadala, are already big US investors, and Trump and his family have business interests in the UAE.\n\u201cThe West Wing is perplexed, unenthused, and disappointed\u201d with Musk, who left the White House to attend to his ailing business empire, one White House official told the news outlet, which reports that a push is now underway among Republicans close to the White House to reframe Musk\u2019s criticisms of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d as self-serving.\n\u201cWhen businessmen criticize legislation, journalists don\u2019t take them at their word, they look at how the legislation would impact their business interests,\u201d said one Republican close to the White House. \u201cThey should be doing that in this case.\u201d\nIndeed Tesla benefitted from the Biden-era EV support package which included multiple federal tax credits, which the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d strips away, as was noted by House speaker Mike Johnson yesterday. He told reporters:\nIt\u2019s not personal. I know that the EV mandate [is] very important to [Musk] \u2014 that\u2019s going away, because the government should not be subsidizing these things as part of the Green New Deal \u2026 And I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that.\nDeadline arrives for 'best offers' from US trading partners to avoid tariffs\nToday is the White House\u2019s deadline for countries to submit their \u201cbest offers\u201d in trade negotiations with the US in order to avoid being slapped with steep tariffs in July.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed yesterday that the Trump administration had sent letters to trading partners to push for offers by today as the deadline approached, underlining Trump\u2019s use of tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\u201cThis letter was simply to remind these countries that the deadline is approaching and the president expects good deals, and we are on track for that,\u201d she told reporters.\nReuters first reported on the office of the US trade representative\u2019s letter seeking to accelerate unwieldy talks with multiple partners ahead of the Trump administration\u2019s self-imposed deadline in under five weeks.\nThose negotiations kicked off on 9 April when he paused his so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs for 90 days until 8 July amid stock, bond and currency markets turmoil over the sweeping levies.\nWhile over the last few months Trump and his administration officials have boasted about the number of countries reaching out to discuss trading arrangements and have even claimed that several agreements are close to being over the line, they have also admitted that talks have been slow-moving and they don\u2019t have the capacity to negotiate (hugely complex) trade deals with so many countries at once.\nThe US has so far only reached a framework agreement with the UK, and an agreement with China that both countries are now accusing each other of reneging on.\nTrump officials delayed - and redacted part of - farm trade report over deficit forecast - Politico\nTrump administration officials delayed and redacted a government forecast because it predicts an increase in the nation\u2019s trade deficit in farm goods later this year, two people familiar with the matter have told Politico, in a story that could raise questions about potential political interference in government reports that present \u201cpolitically inconvenient\u201d data.\nHere\u2019s an extract from Politico\u2019s story:\nThe numbers run counter to Donald Trump\u2019s messaging that his economic policies, including tariffs, will reduce US trade imbalances. The politically inconvenient data prompted administration officials to block publication of the written analysis normally attached to the report because they disliked what it said about the deficit.\nThe highly unusual rollout could raise questions about potential political meddling with government reports that have traditionally been trusted for decades.\n\u201cObjectivity is really key here and the public depends on it,\u201d said Joe Glauber, a former USDA chief economist. \u201cTo lose that trust would be terrible.\u201d\nA USDA spokesperson blamed the delay on an internal review.\n\u201cThe report was hung up in internal clearance process and was not finalized in time for its typical deadline,\u201d said USDA spokesperson Alec Varsamis in a statement. \u201cGiven this report is not statutory as with many other reports USDA does, the Department is undergoing a review of all of its non-statutory reports, including this one, to determine next steps.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear when or if the written analysis portion will be released.\nTrump calls again on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates\nDonald Trump has \u2013 once again \u2013 called on Jerome Powell, the FederalReserve chair, to lower interest rates, noting that payroll processing firm ADP reported that job creation slowed in May.\nIn the post on his Truth Social platform, he said that Powell \u2013 who in the past he has called a \u201cmajor loser\u201d \u2013 is \u201cunbelievable\u201d.\nADP NUMBER OUT!!! \u201cToo Late\u201d Powell must now LOWER THE RATE. He is unbelievable!!! Europe has lowered NINE TIMES!\nADP\u2019s report showed private payrolls ticked up by only 37,000 in May - far below the Dow Jones forecast for 110,000 - and mark the lowest monthly reading from ADP since March 2023.\nAt a meeting with Trump at the White House last week, Powell had pushed back against the president\u2019s demands, telling him \u201cthat the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook,\u201d according to an unusually blunt statement issued by the central bank.\nTrump, who has attacked Powell repeatedly over the Fed\u2019s decision to not lower interest rates, recently said he has no intention of trying to fire Powell. But the possibility of a firing has unsettled financial markets that bank on an independent Fed\u2019s ability to do its job without political interference.\nThe statement went on to say that Powell maintained that the Fed \u201cwill set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis\u201d.\nThe full statement read:\nAt the President\u2019s invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments including for growth, employment, and inflation.\nChair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.\nFinally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the FOMC will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.",

        "Content": "Trump says Putin told him Russia \u2018will have to respond\u2019 to Ukraine drone attacks\nDonald Trump has said that he has just discussed the recent drone attacks by Ukraine on Russia and developments concerning Iran in a phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin that lasted over an hour.\nDuring the conversation, Putin told Trump that Russia will have to respond to the Ukrainian drone attacks, the US president said. \u201cIt was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace,\u201d he said in a Truth Social Post.\nPutin had said \u201cvery strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields\u201d - referring to \u2018Operation Spiderweb\u2019, which saw Ukrainian agents move drones and explosives deep inside Russia to strike four airbases - Trump said.\nHe also said that Putin had suggested he may participate in talks with Iran to try to get a nuclear deal done. Trump said: \u201cI stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the full post:\nI just finished speaking, by telephone, with President Vladimir Putin, of Russia. The call lasted approximately one hour and 15 minutes. We discussed the attack on Russia\u2019s docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides. It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields. We also discussed Iran, and the fact that time is running out on Iran\u2019s decision pertaining to nuclear weapons, which must be made quickly! I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement. President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion. It is my opinion that Iran has been slowwalking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!\nTrump says he agrees with Elizabeth Warren that debt limit should be eliminated\nDonald Trump has said the nation\u2019s debt ceiling should be eliminated, saying he agreed with Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s view on the subject.\n\u201cThe Debt Limit should be entirely scrapped to prevent an Economic catastrophe. It is too devastating to be put in the hands of political people that may want to use it despite the horrendous effect it could have on our Country,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\nThe GOP is looking to raise the debt ceiling as part of the party\u2019s broader tax and spending cuts package to enact Trump\u2019s domestic agenda.\nWarren on Friday backed Trump\u2019s call to abolish the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, pressing for bipartisan action to \u201cget rid of it forever\u201d. She posted on X that she and Trump agree that the debt limit, which caps how much money the Treasury can owe to pay the country\u2019s bills, should \u201cbe scrapped to prevent an economic catastrophe\u201d.\nHowever, she also added in a jab to the GOP\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that \u201cjacking up the debt limit by $4tn to fund more tax breaks for billionaires is an outrage\u201d.\nHere\u2019s Trump\u2019s full post, which was posted alongside a screenshot of that X post from Warren:\nI am very pleased to announce that, after all of these years, I agree with Senator Elizabeth Warren on SOMETHING. The Debt Limit should be entirely scrapped to prevent an Economic catastrophe. It is too devastating to be put in the hands of political people that may want to use it despite the horrendous effect it could have on our Country and, indirectly, even the World. As to Senator Warren\u2019s second statement on the $4 Trillion Dollars, I like that also, but it would have to be done over a period of time, as short as possible. Let\u2019s get together, Republican and Democrat, and DO THIS!\nUkraine has released dramatic edited footage of its drone attack on four Russian military airbases in Operation Spiderweb, which was 18 months in the making, and involved the use of remotely operated drones from Ukrainian territory.\nRussian planes and jets were targeted on runways across Russia and destroyed by the Ukrainian drones. Scenes of carnage were visible from the first-person view footage, with Russian planes engulfed in balls of fire.\nThe drone attacks carried out by Ukraine in Operation Spiderweb destroyed billions of dollars worth of Russian aircraft stationed at bases across the country, including at locations as far away as Siberia, in what Kyiv claims is its longest-range assault of the war.\nThe spectacular operation was prepared in secret over 18 months. Ukraine\u2019s agents moved short-range drones and explosives inside Russia before they were launched remotely for a coordinated strike on Sunday that was intended to strike at Moscow\u2019s air superiority.\nDrones were smuggled into Russia and placed inside containers, which were later loaded on to trucks. With the trucks positioned near Russian bases, the roof panels of the containers were lifted off by a remotely activated mechanism, allowing the drones to fly out and begin their attack. The drones had first-person view, or FPV, technology that allowed them to be operated remotely, probably from Ukrainian territory.\nAttempting to launch drones from Ukraine would have been much harder, as they would have had to cover huge distances and avoid Russia\u2019s air defences.\nThe White House confirmed yesterday that Donald Trump had no advance knowledge of the attack. He also hadn\u2019t commented on it publicly until this afternoon\u2019s call with Vladimir Putin.\nHere\u2019s a visual guide to the operation from my colleagues:\nTrump says Putin told him Russia \u2018will have to respond\u2019 to Ukraine drone attacks\nDonald Trump has said that he has just discussed the recent drone attacks by Ukraine on Russia and developments concerning Iran in a phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin that lasted over an hour.\nDuring the conversation, Putin told Trump that Russia will have to respond to the Ukrainian drone attacks, the US president said. \u201cIt was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace,\u201d he said in a Truth Social Post.\nPutin had said \u201cvery strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields\u201d - referring to \u2018Operation Spiderweb\u2019, which saw Ukrainian agents move drones and explosives deep inside Russia to strike four airbases - Trump said.\nHe also said that Putin had suggested he may participate in talks with Iran to try to get a nuclear deal done.

How well or badly the talks go \u2013 during a small group meeting, followed by a lunch and then, perhaps most nail-bitingly, a press conference in the Oval Office \u2013 may shape relations for decades to come, analysts say.\nHaving reportedly spoken by phone four times since Merz\u2019s election win in February, swapped numbers and exchanged an undisclosed number of text messages, the two leaders are now on first-name terms.\nBut Merz knows the road to a normal friendship is thorny. The transatlantic relationship has been altered almost beyond recognition since Trump\u2019s return to office, and the shock \u201csits very deep\u201d, said Mariam Lau, a journalist and the author of a new in-depth portrayal of Merz. She went on:\nIt\u2019s the equivalent of a medical emergency in political terms: the speed and degree to which the Merz government has had to react to the disintegration of the transatlantic alliance, one of its main foreign policy pillars, is like being forced to undergo dialysis or an organ transplantation.\nBerlin has viewed as menacing and dangerous the unprecedented interference in German politics by leading members of the Trump administration \u2013 by his former adviser Elon Musk; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and the vice-president, JD Vance, in particular. There is the lack of unity over how and even whether to punish Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine, there are tensions over defence spending levels, and there are diverging viewpoints over the Middle East, and over Trump\u2019s looming tariffs.\nIndeed nobody in Berlin is resting on their laurels. As to just how quickly leaders\u2019 inaugural visits to the Oval Office can curdle, one only needs to recall Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s lions\u2019 den encounter three months ago, or more recently the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s. It has not gone unnoticed that Merz called the latter last Friday, reportedly to pick up a few Trump-whisperer tips.\nLau said Merz would have to \u201cwalk a tightrope between keeping an open dialogue with Trump and standing up to him, not giving into his whims\u201d. And Merz is said to have been coached on an array of eventualities and is armed, rhetorically at least. Merz knows that keeping things brief, not interrupting, heaping praise and stressing the commonalities is the accepted playbook when dealing with Trump.\nNOAA 'fully staffed' with forecasters and scientists, US commerce secretary says\nCommerce secretary Howard Lutnick has told a Senate hearing that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is \u201cfully staffed\u201d with weather forecasters and scientists after concerns were raised about some offices losing 24-hour staffing ahead of hurricane season.\n\u201cWe are fully staffed with forecasters and scientists. Under no circumstances am I going to let public safety or public forecasting be touched,\u201d Lutnick told a Senate appropriations subcommittee overseeing NOAA, saying he got the National Weather Service (NWS) exempted from a federal hiring freeze.\nNOAA, which includes the NWS, lost around 1,000 people or 10% of its workforce amid federal job layoffs in the first months of the second Trump administration, including 600 at the weather service. At least six NWS offices had stopped the routine twice-a-day weather balloon launches that collect data for weather models.\nThe US hurricane season officially began on Sunday and lasts through November. NOAA forecast last week that this year\u2019s season is expected to bring as many as 10 hurricanes.\nThe agency had been scrambling to reassign staffers internally to fill gaps in understaffed offices over the last few months, sources told Reuters.\nLutnick told the committee that they are going to fill these positions and focus on cutting programs that he said were not part of NOAA\u2019s mission, including \u201cchildren\u2019s books about climate anxiety\u201d.\nAn internal memo seen by Reuters said that NOAA plans to hire 126 mission-critical positions at the National Weather Service including forecasters, radar technicians, hydrologists and physical scientists that will be advertised externally.\nCongress budget office sees economic output falling from Trump tariffs\nUS economic output will fall as a result of Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs on foreign goods that were in place as of 13 May, while also reducing federal budget deficits by $2.8tn over a decade, the non-partisan CongressionalBudget Office has said.\nReuters reports that in a letter to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and two other high-ranking Democrats, the CBO said the tariffs, which have been challenged in court cases, will raise the costs of consumer and capital goods.\n\u201cCBO estimates that, on net, real (inflation-adjusted) economic output in the United States will fall as a result,\u201d the agency said.\n\u201cInflation will increase by an annual average of 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026, in CBO\u2019s estimation, reducing the purchasing power of households and businesses,\u201d the letter to Schumer and senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley stated.\nWyden is the senior Democrat on the Senate finance committee and Merkley is the ranking Democrat on the Senate budget committee. The three senators requested the CBO analysis on the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs implemented between 6 January and 13 May through executive actions.\nThe CBO\u2019s inflation estimates were compared to an economic outlook published by the CBO on 17 January.\nThe analysis was completed before two courts ruled that the tariffs exceeded the president\u2019s authority to impose them. The administration has asked an appeals court to pause one of the rulings.\nMike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, said he tried to call Elon Musk on Tuesday night after the tech billionaire\u2019s online outburst denouncing Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending bill as a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d.\nJohnson told reporters on Wednesday:\nI called Elon last night and he didn\u2019t answer. I hope to talk to him today.\nHe said he and Musk are \u201cvery friendly\u201d, adding:\nWe\u2019ve laughed about our differences on policy before. I\u2019m not upset about this.\nTrump pushes Congress to cut $9.4bn in funding for NPR, PBS and foreign aid\nAdam Gabbatt\nThe Trump administration formally asked Congress to rescind $9.4bn in already approved funding from foreign aid and public broadcasters including NPR and PBS on Tuesday, seeking to enshrine spending cuts identified by Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge).\nThe process, known as rescission, is required by Donald Trump to retrieve money from programs and policies that have already received the funding.\nA spokesperson for the White House office of management and budget told the Associated Press that $8.3bn was being cut from the state department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID).NPR and PBS will also lose about $1.1bn in federal funding if Congress fulfills Trump\u2019s request.\nThe targeting of public broadcasters fits with the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing war on the US media. Trump signed an executive order in May cutting federal funding to NPR and PBS, and has launched multiple lawsuits against other news organizations.\nThe House and the Senate will now weigh whether to rescind the funding. On Tuesday Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, pledged to pass the cuts.\nAndriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he met with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Washington DC.\nIn a series of posts on social media, Yermak said he and Rubio discussed the \u201csituation on the front lines and the urgent need to strengthen support for Ukraine\u2019s air defense.\u201d\nThe pair also \u201cexchanged views on the meetings with the Russians in Istanbul, the further course of negotiations, the upcoming prisoner exchange, and the importance of bringing back all hostages and children abducted by Russia,\u201d he said, adding:\nI emphasized that Ukraine has done everything possible to achieve peace and is ready for a ceasefire \u2014 but Russia refuses. That is why additional sanctions are necessary.\nHe and Rubio \u201cagreed to coordinate our next steps,\u201d Yermak said.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has also projected an increase of 10.9m people without health insurance under Donald Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cut bill.\nThat would include 1.4m people who are in the country without legal status in state-funding programs, Associated Press reports.\nAs we reported earlier, the House-passed version of the bill could add $2.4tn to the federal government\u2019s $36.2tn debt, according to the CBO\u2019s revised estimate on Wednesday.\nThe new CBO estimate takes into account late changes that were made to the bill as Republican leaders steered it to passage.\nMexico will respond if there is no agreement with US on 'unfair' metals tariffs, says president\nMexico will announce measures next week if there is no agreement reached with the United States on the steel and aluminum tariffs announced, president Claudia Sheinbaum has said.\nShe also called the US announcement to raise the metals\u2019 tariffs an \u201cunfair measure\u201d during her morning conference, and added that Mexico\u2019s answer will not be \u201can eye for an eye\u201d.\nTrump's 'big, beautiful bill' will add $2.4tn to national debt, according to nonpartisan analysis\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has released a revised estimate of the cost of Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending cut bill passed by the House of Representatives, concluding it will add $2.4tn to the federal government\u2019s $36.2tn debt.\nThe new assessment comes a day after Elon Muskblasted the bill as a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d, emboldening GOP deficit hawks who have been pushing back against the measure.\nAn earlier CBO estimate predicted the bill, which passed through the House on 22 May by a single vote and with no Democratic support, would add around $3.8tn to Washington\u2019s debt over the next decade.\nThe measure, now under consideration in the Senate, aims to extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts while also achieving steep spending reductions to pay for them, largely \u2013 and highly controversially \u2013 on Medicaid.\nThe new CBO estimate takes into account late changes that were made to the bill as Republican leaders steered it to passage.\nUAE seeks US trade deal to roll back Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs - Reuters\nThe United States and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to start negotiations for a potential bilateral trade agreement that could ease tariffs on the Gulf state\u2019s steel and aluminum industry, four people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.\nEmirati officials discussed the possibility of a trade agreement with US counterparts during Donald Trump\u2019s two-day visit to Abu Dhabi last month, the sources said.\nThe Office of the US Trade Representative did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Neither did Emirati officials.\nLike other nations, the UAE has been hit by Trump\u2019s 10% baseline tariff on its exports to the US. But its steel and aluminum products have also been hit by a 25% tariff that the Trump administration is now doubling to 50%.\nWhile the UAE is a major oil producer, its steel and aluminium products are significant non-oil exports. In 2024, the UAE was the second-largest steel and aluminium exporter to the US, accounting for 8% of total US consumption, data shows.\nIn Abu Dhabi, Emirati officials highlighted to American counterparts comprehensive trade deals that it had signed with other countries over the past three years, the sources said, to illustrate that the UAE was capable of moving quickly on trade talks.\nThe sources said that US officials had responded positively, although it was unclear when talks would start. Two of the sources said Washington was likely to negotiate a limited deal that would fall short of a comprehensive free trade pact.\nThe UAE is Washington\u2019s biggest trade partner in the Middle East, according to the Gulf state\u2019s foreign ministry. Bilateral trade in 2024 was valued at $34.4bn, according to US trade data, with the US enjoying a $19.4bn surplus.\nThe Gulf state, which is reliant on the US security umbrella, has pledged to invest $1.4tn in the US over the next decade. Its sovereign wealth funds, including Abu Dhabi\u2019s $330bn Mubadala, are already big US investors, and Trump and his family have business interests in the UAE.\n\u201cThe West Wing is perplexed, unenthused, and disappointed\u201d with Musk, who left the White House to attend to his ailing business empire, one White House official told the news outlet, which reports that a push is now underway among Republicans close to the White House to reframe Musk\u2019s criticisms of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d as self-serving.\n\u201cWhen businessmen criticize legislation, journalists don\u2019t take them at their word, they look at how the legislation would impact their business interests,\u201d said one Republican close to the White House. \u201cThey should be doing that in this case.\u201d\nIndeed Tesla benefitted from the Biden-era EV support package which included multiple federal tax credits, which the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d strips away, as was noted by House speaker Mike Johnson yesterday. He told reporters:\nIt\u2019s not personal. I know that the EV mandate [is] very important to [Musk] \u2014 that\u2019s going away, because the government should not be subsidizing these things as part of the Green New Deal \u2026 And I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that.\nDeadline arrives for 'best offers' from US trading partners to avoid tariffs\nToday is the White House\u2019s deadline for countries to submit their \u201cbest offers\u201d in trade negotiations with the US in order to avoid being slapped with steep tariffs in July.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed yesterday that the Trump administration had sent letters to trading partners to push for offers by today as the deadline approached, underlining Trump\u2019s use of tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\u201cThis letter was simply to remind these countries that the deadline is approaching and the president expects good deals, and we are on track for that,\u201d she told reporters.\nReuters first reported on the office of the US trade representative\u2019s letter seeking to accelerate unwieldy talks with multiple partners ahead of the Trump administration\u2019s self-imposed deadline in under five weeks.\nThose negotiations kicked off on 9 April when he paused his so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs for 90 days until 8 July amid stock, bond and currency markets turmoil over the sweeping levies.\nWhile over the last few months Trump and his administration officials have boasted about the number of countries reaching out to discuss trading arrangements and have even claimed that several agreements are close to being over the line, they have also admitted that talks have been slow-moving and they don\u2019t have the capacity to negotiate (hugely complex) trade deals with so many countries at once.\nThe US has so far only reached a framework agreement with the UK, and an agreement with China that both countries are now accusing each other of reneging on.\nTrump officials delayed - and redacted part of - farm trade report over deficit forecast - Politico\nTrump administration officials delayed and redacted a government forecast because it predicts an increase in the nation\u2019s trade deficit in farm goods later this year, two people familiar with the matter have told Politico, in a story that could raise questions about potential political interference in government reports that present \u201cpolitically inconvenient\u201d data.\nHere\u2019s an extract from Politico\u2019s story:\nThe numbers run counter to Donald Trump\u2019s messaging that his economic policies, including tariffs, will reduce US trade imbalances. The politically inconvenient data prompted administration officials to block publication of the written analysis normally attached to the report because they disliked what it said about the deficit.\nThe highly unusual rollout could raise questions about potential political meddling with government reports that have traditionally been trusted for decades.\n\u201cObjectivity is really key here and the public depends on it,\u201d said Joe Glauber, a former USDA chief economist. \u201cTo lose that trust would be terrible.\u201d\nA USDA spokesperson blamed the delay on an internal review.\n\u201cThe report was hung up in internal clearance process and was not finalized in time for its typical deadline,\u201d said USDA spokesperson Alec Varsamis in a statement. \u201cGiven this report is not statutory as with many other reports USDA does, the Department is undergoing a review of all of its non-statutory reports, including this one, to determine next steps.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear when or if the written analysis portion will be released.\nTrump calls again on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates\nDonald Trump has \u2013 once again \u2013 called on Jerome Powell, the FederalReserve chair, to lower interest rates, noting that payroll processing firm ADP reported that job creation slowed in May.\nIn the post on his Truth Social platform, he said that Powell \u2013 who in the past he has called a \u201cmajor loser\u201d \u2013 is \u201cunbelievable\u201d.\nADP NUMBER OUT!!! \u201cToo Late\u201d Powell must now LOWER THE RATE. He is unbelievable!!! Europe has lowered NINE TIMES!\nADP\u2019s report showed private payrolls ticked up by only 37,000 in May - far below the Dow Jones forecast for 110,000 - and mark the lowest monthly reading from ADP since March 2023.\nAt a meeting with Trump at the White House last week, Powell had pushed back against the president\u2019s demands, telling him \u201cthat the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook,\u201d according to an unusually blunt statement issued by the central bank.\nTrump, who has attacked Powell repeatedly over the Fed\u2019s decision to not lower interest rates, recently said he has no intention of trying to fire Powell. But the possibility of a firing has unsettled financial markets that bank on an independent Fed\u2019s ability to do its job without political interference.\nThe statement went on to say that Powell maintained that the Fed \u201cwill set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis\u201d.\nThe full statement read:\nAt the President\u2019s invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments including for growth, employment, and inflation.\nChair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.\nFinally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the FOMC will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.",

        "Content": "Conservatives on a state college board reversed a decision to hire the experienced academic Santa Ono to lead the University of Florida, despite his efforts to distance himself from previous support for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and past criticism of Donald Trump.\nThe 10-6 vote followed a contentious meeting of the Florida board of governors on Tuesday when members argued over Ono\u2019s record, including accusations he failed to protect Jewish students during pro-Palestinian protests last year while he was president of the University of Michigan.\nThe rejection came a week after UF trustees voted unanimously to appoint him as the 14th president of the state\u2019s third-largest university at a salary of $1.5m. It also followed what some critics saw as an attempt by Ono to \u201cclean up\u201d his record.\nHis name was quietly removed last month from a letter signed by more than 600 university presidents accusing the Trump administration of unprecedented interference in academic institutions. Ono wrote an opinion piece for Inside Higher Ed in May explaining why he no longer believed DEI on campus represented equal opportunities for students.\n\u201cOver time, I saw how DEI became something else \u2013 more about ideology, division and bureaucracy, not student success,\u201d Ono wrote, taking credit for eliminating university DEI offices in Michigan.\n\u201cCombating antisemitism has [also] been a priority throughout my career. I\u2019ve worked closely with Jewish students, faculty and community leaders to ensure that campuses are places of respect, safety and inclusion for all.\u201d\nAt least one governor in Tuesday\u2019s board meeting in Tallahassee was skeptical of Ono\u2019s shifting views.\n\u201cThe public record completely contradicted what the nominee was telling us,\u201d Paul Renner, a Republican former speaker of the Florida house, said, according to the New York Times.\nAnd a number of conservative figures in Florida, where the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has led an assault on what he sees as \u201cwoke ideology\u201d on campuses, were previously critical of Ono\u2019s nomination.\nThey pointed to, among other issues, Ono\u2019s previous support for DEI efforts, and a claim he was slow to respond to pro-Palestinian protests at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ann Arbor campus in April and May last year. The university has since taken a particularly harsh approach to cracking down on the protests.\nSenator Rick Scott, a former Florida governor, said on X that Ono was the wrong choice to lead a university he called the \u201cgold standard\u201d in fighting antisemitism.\n\u201cHe is willing to appease and prioritize far-left activists over ensuring students are protected and receive a quality education,\u201d Scott wrote.\n\u201cUF needs and deserves a president who will stand strong against hate, antisemitism and divisive policies and stand with our Jewish students.\u201d\nThe Republican Florida congressman Jimmy Patronis urged governors to reject Ono in a tweet before Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much smoke with Santa Ono. We need a leader, not a DEI acolyte. Leave the Ann Arbor thinking in Ann Arbor,\u201d he wrote.\nUF trustees, however, defended Ono against accusations he had changed his stance to secure the job in Gainesville.\n\u201cDr Ono is not shifting his views to fit Florida. He has been evolving his perspective over time \u2013 before UF ever approached him about this role,\u201d they said in a press release last month.\n\u201cLike any other good scientist, Dr Ono adopted new perspectives as he gained new information.\u201d\nMori Hosseini, chair of the UF trustees, said Ono would have ensured \u201cthat merit and scholarship, not ideology, are the gold standards for success\u201d.\nFlorida\u2019s rejection of Ono, who would have become the highest-paid university president in the country, is symptomatic of the wider rightwing assault on higher education, with DEI and antisemitism allegations the primary pretexts. Trump is feuding with Harvard, one of the country\u2019s oldest and most respected academic institutions, over its resistance to the president\u2019s efforts to control enrollment and curriculum.\nThe Trump administration revoked the visas of thousands of international students \u2013 though many have since been reinstated \u2013 and last week ordered embassies overseas to stop scheduling interviews for foreigners seeking to study in the US.\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting",

        "Content": "Dozens of people milled about in Philadelphia\u2019s Love Park as a series of short film portraits played on the facade of the park\u2019s visitor center on a recent Friday evening. The ambient sounds of the city served as a soundtrack for the silent films. Several videos played simultaneously on different sections of the 360-degree projection wrapped around the building\u2019s exterior. Titled the Philadelphians, the 10 portraits recognize the contributions of the city\u2019s immigrant communities.\nOne film profiled an Afghan immigrant named Rezwan Natiq and followed him as he shopped at a halal Middle Eastern food market. His words were displayed on the screen: \u201cI had a lot of mixed feelings but I had no other option than to leave Afghanistan. I was thinking about my parents who stayed behind, and on the other hand, I was happy that my kids would get to live the life they deserve. At least they will be safe here.\u201d He then shared that he felt compelled to give back to the local immigrant community after receiving the opportunity for a new life in the US.\nToward the end of the three-minute film, the words \u201cfather\u201d, \u201csweetheart\u201d and \u201chealthcare professional\u201d flashed over a montage of Natiq at the store and then smiling as he stood in front of City Hall.\nPhiladelphia-based artist duo Nadia Hironaka and Matthew Suib began filming the portraits in the spring of 2024. In collaboration with the city\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs (OIA), they sought to highlight the immigrant communities that have always existed in one of the oldest cities in the nation. Commissioned by Forman Arts Initiative and Mural Arts Philadelphia, the project is the result of the art non-profits\u2019 second annual residency program where artists observed a city department. \u201cPublic art projects like The Philadelphians bring communities together and highlight how we are more alike than we are di\ufb00erent,\u201d Alain Joinville, the director of strategic communications and programs for the OIA said in a statement. \u201cThey are a vehicle for joy, introspection, and love.\u201d\nFor Hironaka and Suib, a public artwork that recognizes the contributions of immigrants to the cultural fabric of the city may be more important now than ever. It was not meant as an overtly political project, said Suib, but as a response to negative rhetoric about immigration.\nIn recent months, the Trump administration has taken aim at sanctuary cities including Philadelphia, that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. In April, Donald Trump signed an executive order vowing to crack down on such jurisdictions. In May, Philadelphia was named on a homeland security list of hundreds of cities, states and counties at risk of losing federal funding for what the Trump administration considered obstructing immigration laws. The list was taken down a few days later, but it still encouraged Cherelle L Parker, Philadelphia\u2019s mayor, to shirk the sanctuary label. Parker\u2019s administration announced that Philadelphia would be called a welcoming city, though its immigration policies remain the same.\n\u201cOur focus is very much upon the intent of bringing people together, talking about shared experiences and voices and emotions and values that we have with all the immigrant communities that are here,\u201d Hironaka told the Guardian. \u201cYou really see all of us as Philadelphians.\u201d\nThe film will run until 8 June 2025, and it will be accessible online at the Mural Arts Philadelphia and Forman Arts Initiative websites afterwards.\nWhen the artist duo learned that their residency would be based in the Office of Immigrant Affairs, which assists immigrants in resettling and accessing city services, Suib said \u201cone of our most important cues from the office was thinking about people, not in terms of their status, but who lives in the city, who are our neighbors. They are invested in making sure that people who arrive in Philly from anywhere in the world are welcome.\u201d Hironaka and Suib talked to everyone in the office, many of whom were immigrants themselves.\nThe featured participants were immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Eritrea, Ukraine, China, Jamaica, Italy, Afghanistan, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Sweden and Mexico. The films are not meant to include every immigrant community in the city, Suib said, but to highlight the community leaders and \u201ceveryday people who are just making everyday contributions to better the city through the work that they do\u201d.\nThe artist duo filmed the participants using 16mm film and video at their homes, workplaces, grocery stores and places of worship. To flip \u201cthe narrative about immigrant labor to the idea of creating culture\u201d, Suib said, they also filmed cultural craftmaking projects \u2013 such as batik, a textile dyeing technique from Asia, beadwork made by north Africans during Ramadan, and traditional African embroidery.\nIn the future, Hironaka and Suib hope that their project encourages other cities to engage with their diverse composite of neighbors. \u201cIt would be really nice to be a model for other cities to take on,\u201d said Hironaka, \u201cto conduct a similar project and reach out and connect with different immigrant communities in their cities and spaces.\u201d\nToward the end of the Friday evening viewing, archival footage of a traditional European celebration in Philadelphia was intercut with modern-day footage of people crafting with blue beads.\nThe viewer was then transported to St James Church in Philadelphia, where Barbara Wilson, an immigrant from Jamaica, sat in a pew. She struggled to find a place to worship when she arrived in Philadelphia and decided to attend the church because it reminded her of one in her home country. \u201cWhen someone leaves their country and comes to a new country, a country of opportunities, they want to excel,\u201d her words appeared on the screen. \u201cThey come to help build the country and in doing so, build themselves.\u201d",

During the attack, Soliman shouted \u201cFree Palestine\u201d.\nKristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, announced on Tuesday that immigration agents were taking Soliman\u2019s wife and five children into custody, and that federal officials are investigating whether his family knew about his plans.\nThe New York Times also quoted a DHS spokesperson saying the family\u2019s valid visas had been revoked.\nThe Trump administration has quickly seized on Soliman\u2019s immigration status to push its mass deportation agenda. Soliman, who was born in Egypt, was in the US on an expired tourist visa after entering the country in 2022. He applied for asylum that year and received work authorization that later expired, Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary said. Donald Trump has blamed the attack on his predecessor, arguing it was the result of Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cridiculous Open Border Policy\u201d.\nSoliman has said he acted alone, and told police \u201cno one knew about his plans\u201d, according to a state arrest affidavit.\nThe administration doesn\u2019t appear to want to wait for a verdict. \u201cSix one-way tickets for Mohamed\u2019s wife and five kids,\u201d the official White House account, shared with an image taken of Soliman during the attack, cropped to include a rainbow Progress Pride Flag on the Boulder courthouse behind him. \u201cFinal boarding call coming soon.\u201d\nAn earlier post from the account said the family was in custody of immigration authorities for expedited removal, adding in all caps: \u201cTHEY COULD BE DEPORTED AS EARLY AS TONIGHT.\u201d\nIn the 48 hours since the attack, Republicans have politicized the events, blaming Democrats for the attempted murders.\nColorado Republicans in Congress, Lauren Boebert and Gabe Evans, lashed out at Democrats on social media.\n\u201cWhen progressives allow and encourage hate speech toward Jews for their mere existence, people get hurt,\u201d Boebert posted.\nIn a dozen posts, Evans repeatedly claimed that the attack was \u201ca direct result of failed sanctuary states like Colorado\u201d, even though the state\u2019s unwillingness to cooperate with federal immigration officers had nothing to do with the suspected attacker, who had reportedly applied for asylum and so was legally allowed to remain in the US until that claim was adjudicated.\nBut the most inflammatory response came from Danielle Jurinsky, a conservative Aurora city council member, who called the Democratic party \u201ca demonic cult\u201d, and attacked fellow Jews Jared Polis, Michael Bennet, Jena Griswold and Phil Weiser. \u201cShame on every single one of you, who have made the Democratic party your religion. Shame on you! You\u2019re not Jewish, you\u2019re a Democrat!\u201d\nSoliman allegedly planned the attack for more than a year and initially intended to kill everyone at the rally but did not carry out his full plan \u201cbecause he got scared and had never hurt anyone before\u201d, according to a police affidavit. He told authorities he had originally planned to use a gun but was unable to buy one because he was not a US citizen.\nHe reportedly left an iPhone with messages to his family in a desk drawer at his family home in Colorado Springs, according to an FBI affidavit. His wife brought the device to the local police department after his arrest, and told officials that it was his but that other family members also used it.\nSoliman faces numerous state and federal charges, including 16 state counts of attempted murder, 18 related to the use of an incendiary device and a federal hate crime charge.\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting",

        "Content": "The Trump administration formally asked Congress to rescind $9.4bn in already approved funding from foreign aid and public broadcasters including NPR and PBS on Tuesday, seeking to enshrine spending cuts identified by Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge).\nThe process, known as rescission, is required by Donald Trump to retrieve money from programs and policies that have already received the funding.\nA spokesperson for the White House office of management and budget told the Associated Press that $8.3bn was being cut from the state department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). NPR and PBS will also lose about $1.1bn in federal funding if Congress fulfills Trump\u2019s request.\nThe targeting of public broadcasters fits with the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing war on the US media. Trump signed an executive order in May cutting federal funding to NPR and PBS, and has launched multiple lawsuits against other news organizations.\nThe House and the Senate will now weigh whether to rescind the funding. On Tuesday Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, pledged to pass the cuts.\n\u201cThis rescissions package reflects many of Doge\u2019s findings and is one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity,\u201d Johnson said.\n\u201cCongress will continue working closely with the White House to codify these recommendations, and the House will bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.\u201d\nRuss Vought, the White House budget director, said more rescission packages and other efforts to cut spending could follow if the current effort succeeds.\n\u201cWe are certainly willing and able to send up additional packages if the congressional will is there,\u201d Vought told reporters.\nNPR sued Trump last week, arguing that the executive order which cut federal funding to what Trump described as \u201cbiased media\u201d violated the first amendment right to free speech.\nPBS filed a similar lawsuit on Friday, alleging that Trump had overstepped his authority and engaged in \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d in cutting its funding.",

As for Trump, the grievance-is-me president has gone into full conniption-mode, moaning about anti-Trump rulings and denouncing \u201cUSA-hating judges\u201d. On Truth Social, he said: \u201cHow is it possible for [judges] to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is it purely a hatred of \u2018TRUMP\u2019? What other reason could it be?\u201d\nTrump is acting like the 10-year-old bully who pummeled a dozen classmates in the schoolyard, but when his teacher called him out for his thuggishness, he burst into tears and screamed: \u201cThis is so unfair! Why are you picking on me?\u201d\nA word of advice to Trump: you should realize that dozens of judges keep ruling against you because you have flouted the law more than any previous president and because you and your flunkies keep misinterpreting and stretching the nation\u2019s laws far beyond their meaning.\nTake Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs, when he announced steep, across-the-board tariffs against 57 countries. On that day, Trump became the first president to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to impose tariffs. To Trump\u2019s dismay, three judges on the US court of international trade unanimously ruled that he had overstepped his authority and gone far beyond what that 1977 law allows presidents to do. The trade court wrote that the constitution gives Congress, not the president, power over tariff policy and that the 1977 law didn\u2019t give Trump \u201cunbounded\u201d authority to impose tariffs.\nAfter that 28 May ruling, Trump\u2019s latest tantrum began.\nThen, there\u2019s his chest-thumping, cold-hearted rush to expel as many immigrants as possible. To accomplish that, Trump became the first president to invoke the 227-year-old Alien Enemies Act in peacetime. twisting that law\u2019s language to declare that several dozen gang members from Venezuela constitute a war-like invasion force, similar to an enemy army, who could therefore be deported without due process. But several sane, sober judges told Trump that he is full of it. There\u2019s no war-like invasion here.\nAnd then there\u2019s Trump\u2019s effort to stomp on several prestigious law firms that have done things or hired people he doesn\u2019t like. Trump became the first president to essentially put a gun to various law firms\u2019 heads to try to make them submit to him. He sought to undermine those firms\u2019 business with astonishingly vengeful executive orders that not only said that their lawyers couldn\u2019t enter federal buildings and would lose their security clearances, but that their corporate clients might lose their federal contracts. And then there was the unspoken threat that Trump would block corporate deals that those firms\u2019 lawyers were working on. This is poisonous stuff, punishing law firms for doing what our legal system has long called on firms to do: represent clients, even unpopular ones (even ones Trump doesn\u2019t like).\nHere, Trump was engaging in a shakedown, in effect saying: \u201cThat\u2019s a nice law firm you have. It\u2019s a shame if something happens to it. (So you\u2019d be smart to submit to my demands.)\u201d Again, several judges told Trump he\u2019s full of it, that the law firms hadn\u2019t done anything wrong to warrant such illegal shakedown efforts.\nThere are cases galore in which judges found that Trump acted illegally. Judges have provisionally blocked his push to bar international students from attending Harvard and ordered the release of several immigrant graduate students his administration arrested. Judges have ruled against Trump\u2019s dismantling of the Department of Education, his freezing up to $3tn in funding for the states and his firing thousands of federal civil servants.\nHating to see judges rule against his boss, Stephen Miller absurdly asserted: \u201cWe are living under a judicial tyranny,\u201d while Leavitt carped that judges have \u201cusurp[ed] the authority of President Trump to stop him from carrying out the mandate that the American people gave him\u201d. (What mandate? Trump didn\u2019t even receive 50% of the vote, beating Kamala Harris by a mere 1.5 percentage points. Nor did Americans vote for Trump\u2019s tariff chaos or his all-out war against universities.)\nWhat we\u2019ve heard from Trump (and mouthpieces Leavitt and Miller) is dangerous stuff. Trump is essentially rejecting the idea of judicial review. Like many authoritarian rulers, he hates having judges weigh whether his actions have violated the law. Trump forgets that under the constitution, judges (not the president) are the umpires who rule whether the president or Congress is following or flouting the law. As Ty Cobb, a former lawyer for Trump, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s attack on the judges is an attempt to undo the separation of powers. It\u2019s an attempt to take what is three coequal branches and make it one dominant branch.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s attacks against the judiciary are dangerous in another way \u2013 they have literally endangered judges\u2019 safety. In the five months before 1 March, 80 judges received threats, but after Trump\u2019s tirades against judges began to crescendo in February, the number of threats soared: more than 160 judges received threats in the six weeks after 1 March. On Memorial Day, Trump loosed another rant, calling judges who ruled against him \u201cmonsters who want our country to go to hell\u201d.\nWith these diatribes, Trump is seeking to delegitimize the judiciary and turn the public against judges, just as his unrelenting attacks against the news media have helped cause many people to lose faith in the media, no matter that many news organizations are as accurate and fair-minded as ever (and far more truthful than Trump).\nTrump\u2019s war against the judiciary has taken another form \u2013 his administration has evaded, skirted and ignored numerous judicial orders \u2013 stonewalling a judge\u2019s request for information in an immigration case, failing to comply with the US supreme court\u2019s call to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of a wrongly deported immigrant, dragging its feet in restoring funding that had been illegally frozen.\nAfter the trade court\u2019s ruling, Leavitt griped that judges issued more \u201cinjunctions in one full month of office, in February, than Joe Biden had in three years\u201d. Leavitt is blind to the obvious reason for this \u2013 Trump, in churning out more than 150 executive orders, a record number \u2013 has far too often violated the law and the constitution with abandon, while Biden was far more scrupulous in complying with the law.\nTrump and cronies should recognize that there\u2019s a very simple way to get judges to stop overruling his actions. All Trump has to do is stop taking all these illegal, vindictive actions and stop issuing all these destructive, lawless executive orders. What\u2019s more, considering that Trump once tweeted: \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\u201d he needs to stop acting like a modern-day king or Napoleon who is above the law.\n-\nSteven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issues\nComments (\u2026)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion",

Eight people were injured in this latest assault, at least two of them seriously.\nThese horrific acts will no doubt increase the anxiety many Jewish people have about increasing \u2013 and increasingly violent \u2013 antisemitism in the US. Understandably so. Antisemitism must not be given any oxygen to breathe. One can oppose Israel\u2019s 600-plus day war, relentlessly pounding innocent people in Gaza, while vigorously opposing all forms of antisemitism. In fact, one must oppose both. Such is our duty to each other in a civilized world.\nAnd as we have a duty to call out antisemitism when we see it, we also have an equal duty to remember that Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims have also been subjected to extreme forms of violence and bigotry in the US since the beginning of this terrible war. And while we are certain to hear much about today\u2019s rising antisemitism in the coming days, as we should, we must also make sure to acknowledge the rising threats against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims.\nConsider what happened to Wadea al-Fayoume, a six-year-old Palestinian American boy. Wadea was murdered in October 2023 by his landlord, who stabbed the young boy 26 times in his home in Plainfield Township, Illinois. The landlord also attacked the boy\u2019s mother, Hanan Shaheen, stabbing her over a dozen times while telling her \u201cyou, as a Muslim, must die.\u201d Joseph Czuba, 73, the landlord, was found guilty of murder, attempted murder, and hate crime charges last month and sentenced to 53 years in prison.\nOr there are the three Palestinian friends, all college students, who were out for a stroll in Vermont during the Thanksgiving long weekend in 2023. They were gunned down in what many are assuming is a hate crime. The three were speaking a mixture of Arabic and English and were sporting keffiyehs, and one of the three, Hisham Awartani, is now paralyzed from the neck down due to the shooting. The alleged assailant, Jason Eaton, is currently on trial for the shooting.\nAnd there\u2019s the time, in May 2024, when a woman attempted to drown a three-year old Palestinian girl in a swimming pool in an apartment complex in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburb of Euless. The suspect, Elizabeth Wolf, was arrested after the attack and, in September 2024, a grand jury indicted Wolf on attempted capital murder and bodily injury to a child under and intentionally causing bodily injury to a child. The grand jury also included a hate crime enhancement in the indictment.\nOr what about the evening when Zacharia Doar and three of his friends were attacked while they were in their truck, which had a keffiyeh hanging off its side. They were returning from a rally for Palestine in Austin, Texas, in February 2024. Their alleged attacker, Bert James Baker, was yelling racial slurs at them when he reportedly pulled Doar out of the truck and stabbed the 23-year-old Palestinian American in the back. Austin police labeled the attack a hate crime, though the grand jury did not include a hate crime finding in their indictment of Baker for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\nWe should recall that more than 30 protestors for Palestinian rights have filed a lawsuit against campus officials at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and law enforcement agencies, alleging that their civil rights had been violated during protests on campus. Last year, a mob of at least a 100 masked young men descended on an encampment for Palestine that had been erected on campus. The mob attacked the protest for hours while law enforcement watched from the sidelines. As the New York Times described it, \u201ccounterprotesters swarmed individuals \u2013 sometimes a group descended on a single person. They could be seen punching, kicking and attacking people with makeshift weapons, including sticks, traffic cones and wooden boards.\u201d Dozens of people were injured and taken to the hospital for treatment, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nThese are just a few of the stories of violence and abuse. There are, unfortunately, plenty more, such as the Illinois woman who allegedly attacked a man and his pregnant wife at a Panera Bread because the man was wearing a shirt that said \u201cPalestine.\u201d The woman was charged with two counts of a hate crime and one count of misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Or there\u2019s the bizarre case of the Jewish man in Miami Beach who allegedly shot at two men he believed to be Palestinians but who were in fact Jewish Israeli tourists. While in custody, the shooter told the police \u201che saw two Palestinians and shot and killed both,\u201d according to arrest documents. Stranger still, one of the men who was shot reportedly posted on social media that he and his father \u201csurvived an attempted murder motivated by antisemitism,\u201d and then ended his message writing \u201cdeath to Arabs.\u201d\nThe organizations which track antisemitism and Islamophobia have each recorded record high incidents and complaints in the past year, as the violence of this war blows back our shores. None of this should be happening, and it\u2019s clear that our first line of defense, and our responsibility as Americans, is to stop this war immediately, \u201cbefore this violence grows and spreads further, consuming even more innocent lives in its monstrous path.\u201d I wrote those words just over a week ago after the murder of embassy staffers in Washington DC. In a grim turn of events, they are even more true today.\n-\nMoustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnist",

        "Summary": "<p>Jannik Sinner eased into the last four, Lois Boisson\u2019s unlikely run continued and Coco Gauff overcame Madison Keys in an edgy contest</p><p><strong>*Keys 4-2 Gauff </strong>Gauff\u2019s forehand will always be a weakness but it\u2019s giving her almost nothing today; another error means 15-0, and she\u2019s hitting so many more unforceds than winners that it\u2019s almost impossible for her to win games. Keys, on the other hand, has settled. She believes in her game now, so isn\u2019t discouraged by adversity \u2013 though, as I type, a second serve sits up and begs to be punished; Gauff doesn\u2019t miss out, making 40-30, and we\u2019re soon at deuce. If she can prolong the rallies, testing Keys\u2019 patience, she\u2019s got a good chance, and when she makes advantage, she\u2019s offered a second serve to attack. And, though, she can\u2019t unleash a definitive return, Gauff plays a fine point, her forehand finally giving her something, she finishes the game with an overhead, and might Keys regret the three consecutive errors 40-15 into a first break back? We shall see, but even if it\u2019s too late for this set, we can hope that both players are now relaxing into things.</p><p><strong>Keys 4-1 Gauff* </strong>Keys is warming up here, moving Gauff laterally to open up space for the winner; 0-15. And when a double follows, then a netted forehand, you fear for the world no 2, who just hasn\u2019t got going yet; shonuff a second double of the game means Keys has the double break and the first set is almost hers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/jun/04/french-open-2025-quarter-finals-keys-v-gauff-andreeva-v-boisson-sinner-v-bublik-live\">Continue reading...</a>",
        "Content": "That\u2019s it from us for today, though, many thanks for your company. We\u2019ll be back for those semi-finals tomorrow \u2013 and we\u2019ll have a report on the site on Sinner\u2019s win and Zverev v Djokovic. A demain!\nFrench Open: Sinner routs Bublik, Boisson stuns Andreeva to set up Gauff semi \u2013 as it happened\nJannik Sinner eased into the last four, Lois Boisson\u2019s unlikely run continued and Coco Gauff overcame Madison Keys in an edgy contest\nWed 4 Jun 2025 12.50 EDT\nFirst published on Wed 4 Jun 2025 04.43 EDTWed 4 Jun 2025 12.50 EDT\nFirst published on Wed 4 Jun 2025 04.43 EDTLive feed\nStill no order of play for tomorrow\u2019s women\u2019s semi-finals, with Lois Boisson, the story of the tournament, taking on Gauff, and Swiatek and Sabalenka facing off in part XIII. I guess organisers are debating whether they\u2019d rather have a guaranteed full crowd for Boisson if they put her on first, which would be at 3pm Paris time/2pm UK, or whether they\u2019d rather have her in a potentially more TV-friendly early evening slot.\nIf you want to catch up on today:\nBreaking down Sinner\u2019s run: round one vs Rinderknech conceded 12 games, round two vs Gasquet seven games, round three vs Lehecka three games, round four vs Rublev eight games, quarter-final vs Bublik six games. It\u2019s staggering when you consider he didn\u2019t even play tennis for three months up until a few weeks ago.\nWith Sinner in this form \u2013 he\u2019s on a 19-match winning streak in grand slams, it\u2019s like early Roger Federer, before Rafa rocked the boat \u2013 I think he\u2019ll have too much for Zverev or Djokovic. But Alcaraz, most likely, in the final is too tough to call. Sinner blazed a path to the Italian Open final last month, his first event back from his ban, before running into Alcaraz, who beat him in straight sets.\n\u201cHe can have some ups and downs,\u201d says Sinner, making something of an understatement. \u201cSo I tried to stay very consistent, which I\u2019ve done. It was a good performance from my side, as things were very windy and breezy. I\u2019m very happy. Against these types of players you have to be very consistent. I\u2019ll maybe watch a bit [of the quarter-final later], but I\u2019ll try to switch off too. It\u2019s going to be a great match [the semi-final], hopefully I\u2019ll be ready. The fans want a high-quality match, we\u2019ll try to make it happen.\u201d\nSinner defeats Bublik 6-1, 7-5, 6-0\n15-0, 30-0 and \u2013 you know the drill \u2013 40-0 and game, set and match with another seemingly effortless winner. Bublik is grinning; he\u2019s had fun despite the defeat and third-set rout. For Sinner, it\u2019s a second consecutive French Open semi-final, where he\u2019ll face either Alexander Zverev or Novak Djokovic, who play this evening.\nSinner breaks: Sinner* 6-1, 7-5, 5-0 Bublik (*denotes next server)\nIt\u2019s been entertaining, and he\u2019ll always have those wins over Jack Draper and Alex De Minaur, but Bublik\u2019s run in Paris is about to end, as Sinner, from 40-30 down on Bublik\u2019s serve, skips through the next three points with his usual efficiency. The world No 1 will serve for a place in the semi-finals. And Bublik almost congratulates Sinner at the changeover; he\u2019s already accepted his fate.\nThird set: Sinner 6-1, 7-5, 4-0 Bublik* (*denotes next server)\nIt\u2019s remarkable given how little tennis Sinner had under his belt coming into Roland Garros, after that three-month doping ban, how at ease he\u2019s been this fortnight. Close out this set and it\u2019ll be a fifth consecutive win in straight sets. From 40-15, Sinner does the business with an easy putaway at the net, and Bublik needs a miracle, or at least to summon several of his trademark jaw-dropping winners, to inconvenience the Italian winning machine for much longer.\nSinner breaks: Sinner* 6-1, 7-5, 3-0 Bublik (*denotes next server)\n0-15, 0-30, 0-40, as Bublik misdirects a backhand volley. Bublik is shaking his head; the crowd are almost silent. But Bublik does better at the net on the next point, putting away a winner. And from 0-40, he gets back to deuce! A lovely pick-up from Bublik at the net \u2026 Sinner lobs \u2026 but it\u2019s long! Bublik has a game point, which may do little more at this stage than prevent a third-set whitewash, but he doesn\u2019t capitalise. Deuce. Advantage Sinner. Deuce. Advantage Bublik. Deuce. Advantage Bublik. He allows himself a little smile, while also wincing at the pain Sinner is putting him through. Deuce. Advantage Sinner. Game set and match Sinner after yet more clean, consistent and clinical ball striking.\nThird set: Sinner 6-1, 7-5, 2-0 Bublik* (*denotes next server)\nBublik said he hated the sport \u201cwith all my heart\u201d back in 2020. The enigmatic Kazakh is Kyrgios-like when it comes to his wavering focus, combustible temperament and his natural but unfulfilled talent. He\u2019s gesticulating at 40-15; he really can\u2019t catch a break at the moment. And Sinner swiftly holds.\nSinner breaks: Sinner* 6-1, 7-5, 1-0 Bublik (*denotes next server)\nAlas, as so often happens in tennis, Bublik, having pushed so hard in that second set, quickly surrenders at the start of the next. Sinner surges to 15-40, two break points. And that\u2019s the break, when Bublik can\u2019t dig a volley out from his feet.\nThanks Daniel. It\u2019s hard to see a way back for Bublik from here, as hard as seeing a French wildcard ranked 361 in the world on their grand slam debut making \u2026 er wait \u2026 OK, it\u2019s not impossible, but highly implausible. Bublik could probably do with a restorative mid-match Hangover-style trip to Vegas, which is what he did to reignite his career when he felt like jacking it all in during the spring, but instead he\u2019ll have to make do with a quick drink and rub of his towel.\n*Sinner 6-1 7-5 Bublik As we said earlier, it\u2019s close until it isn\u2019t; offer someone like Sinner a finger, he\u2019ll take your whole hand. He serves out to love and it\u2019s a long way back for Bublik from here. As for me, I\u2019m off to see Tina Knowles; here\u2019s Katy to croon you through the rest of this match,\nSinner 6-1 6-5 Bublik* A terrific backhand return, on the stretch, gives Sinner 0-15, then another sets up a forehand winner down the line for 15-30. I fear I can see where this is going and, shonuff, he gets low to carve a forehand winner that raises two break points. Bublik, though, has put so much into this set and he\u2019s not keen that it be for nothing, a fine point ended with two massive forehands to the corner. And I hate to say it, but you can probably guess what happens next: a double fault that hands over the break and that\u2019s the difference between good players and the best. Sinner will now serve for a two-set lead.\n*Sinner 6-1 5-5 Bublik Serving to stay in the set, Sinner finds himself passed by a backhand winner, lazily annihilated cross-court; a netted return restores parity. And from there, the game disappears, Sinner making 5-5, but this is an even contest and if Bublik could nab the set, we\u2019d really be talking.\nSinner 6-1 4-5 Bublik* Bublik has lovely hands, another cunning drop making 30-0 and an ace behind it raising three game points. And, though Sinner makes 15, a further ace secures the hold, and this is getting interesting.\n*Sinner 6-1 4-4 Bublik OK, Bublik makes 15-30 \u2026 then goes long on the return before being wrong-footed by a forehand. The Kazakh, though, fancies the task, a disguised drop bringing us to deuce \u2026 so Sinner closes out in short order. He\u2019s not playing as well, though, and Bublik is serving better while making more of an impression on the return.\nSinner 6-1 3-4 Bublik* At 30-all, Bublik marches in only to put an inside-out forehand just wide \u2026 then lets go a decent drop, cleaning up at the net for deuce. From there, though, he coaxes a gorgeous forehand winner down the line for advantage before opening the court, hitting towards \u2013 but not to \u2013 the corner, allowing the putaway for a conclusive hold. It\u2019s hard to see him breaking, but in a breaker his serve and one-shot kill power would make him a live dog.\n*Sinner 6-1 3-3 Bublik Er, no. His only hope really is to do what Wawrinka did in winning his three major finals against Djokovic and Nadal, just going for everything. He\u2019s not going to outlast Sinner from the back, but he does have big shots and a fine eye; the world no 1 holds easily once more.\nSinner 6-1 2-3 Bublik* Up 40-0, Bublik tosses in a well-timed double, then redeems it with an ace. This is much more enjoyable now, the Kazakh, in his first grand slam quarter, playing like he belongs. But can he get something going on the Sinner serve?\n*Sinner 6-1 2-2 Bublik On Lenglen,Sander Arends and Luke Johnson have levelled at a set apiece in their men\u2019s doubles quarter against Huge Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin; I note this because Luke is, like Henry Patten \u2013 the Wimbledon and Aussie Open champ \u2013 coached by Calvin Betton, our resident expert. Sinner holds to 15, and he\u2019s so solid he should have his own MC pseudonym.\nSinner 6-1 1-2 Bublik* At 15-all Bublik strays long but having opened the channel for the pass down the line, Sinner nets and we move to 30s. From there, a service-winner down the T underlines the underdog\u2019s improvement \u2026 then a double reminds us of his nature. No matter, he holds again, and this is now a contest (until it isn\u2019t).\n*Sinner 6-1 1-1 Bublik Bublik is, I guess, an example of just how much the very best sportsfolk are defined by their mentality. It\u2019s easy for the likes of us to say if we were blessed with talent, we\u2019d give everything while staying calm under pressure, but actually doing that is almost impossible. Sinner holds easily and the match might just have settled into a pattern.\nSinner 6-1 1-0 Bublik* Bublik might just\u2019ve settled. He holds to 15 and, in comms, Mac \u2013 told his coach is behind his decision to put effort in \u2013 chuckles at the apparently revelatory nature of this advice. At 27, he\u2019s still got time to explore its full extent.\n*Sinner 6-1 Bublik Is Bublik growing into it? more so than his neck-beard, I guess and, as I type, Sinner overhits a forehand at 30-all; the comeback is on. And soon, the world no 1 is break point down, a big serve averting immediate danger, likewise one to the body. Then, when up advantage himself, he\u2019s passed by Bublik\u2019s backhand \u2026 but closes out thereafter. Sinner leads by a set and it\u2019s impossible to even conceive of a way in which he loses this.\nSinner 5-1 Bublik* Sinner makes 0-30 and Bublik, your streaky and occasional wonder-shot feel-merchant just cant cope ; understandably so. he\u2019s good enough to beat almost everyone when playing well, but the best are impervious to purple patches from his ilk. Still, a big serve digs him out of a set point at 30-40, then on advantage, Sinner overhits a putaway, and Bublik salutes the crowd upon winning his first game. The world no 1 will have to serve for the first set.\n*Sinner 5-0 Bublik Better from Bublik, who stops in a long rally, playing four or five superb shots to win one point when he guess correctly and blocks back a pick-up into space; 015. From there, we wind up at deuce and this is better from the underdog \u2013 for all the good it does him. A service winner, an ace, and that\u2019s 5-0. The problem Bublik \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 has is that Sinner and Alcaraz ares streets ahead and going away. Only Jack Draper is improving in any kind of meaningful way and he\u2019s still a way off, especially on the red stuff.\nSinner 4-0 Bublik* At 15-30, Bublik telegraphs a drop, it sits up, and Sinner lanks in to stick it away. He\u2019s so comfy out there, and though i\u2019m not sure his best level is the best around, his modal level is stratospheric and he quickly swats a backhand pass down the line for the double break. This could be over very quickly.\nGreetings all. My internet decided to forsake me, but we\u2019re back now and Sinner is already a break to the good at 3-0.\nThe crowd really did blow the roof off. It\u2019s open as Jannik Sinner and Alexander Bublik take to the court. Daniel is back to take you through this \u2013 though I\u2019ll be back for some more later \u2026\nStat attack. Boisson had won just one match on the WTA Tour before this tournament. Her ranking will jump from 361 to around 65 after this win. She\u2019s gone from a wildcard to a French No 1 in less than a fortnight. And she\u2019s into the semi-finals after beating three seeds, including two in the top 10.\nNext up for Boisson: Coco Gauff. If Gauff is as error-strewn as she was today against Keys, Boisson really has a chance of taking one of the craziest stories in tennis history all the way to Saturday\u2019s final. Yes, Andreeva fell apart in the eye of a Parisian storm, but the way Boisson was able to hold her nerve, and do what so many French players have struggled to do in front of a demanding home crowd, suggests she will be very much up for the challenge of facing the world No 2. I don\u2019t think Gauff will let the crowd get to her in the way Andreeva did though.\nBoisson, with a look a total disbelief, speaks:\nIt was amazing to feel supported like this. There are no words to describe that feeling. Whatever the situation for me last year, it\u2019s unbelievable to come from there. Thanks to all my team. I was so tense, I fought hard, the first set was very intense and at the beginning of the second set I was very tired. But I was able to recover.\nShe then talks about how she\u2019ll recover for tomorrow\u2019s semi-final, and talks of having six physios. Six?! Maybe a money-spinning Dove collab is happening.\nBoisson beats Andreeva 7-6, 6-3\nAndreeva appears as if she wants to be put out of her misery. 0-15. 0-30. 0-40. Points that Andreeva lost more than Boisson won. 15,000 fans in Chatrier are once again losing their minds. And they\u2019re blowing the roof off when Boisson\u2019s strong strike draws the error! Boisson is on her back on the clay; she can\u2019t believe it. The French world No 361 wildcard is improbably into the semi-finals, having never even played a grand slam before!\nSecond set: Andreeva* 6-7, 3-5 Boisson (*denotes next server)\nAndreeva is usually able to problem solve so well on court, thinking on her feet, putting the pieces of the puzzle together, coming up with plan A, B, C, D and even E if needed. But having to fight against 15,000 French fans, she can\u2019t think straight. The magnitude of the moment, however, is starting to affect Boisson. She's shaking at 15-30, even more so at 30-40 \u2026 a long rally plays out, Boisson suddenly ups the ante with an injection of pace and Andreeva nets! A second break point for Andreeva at her advantage. Boisson holds her nerve once more. And Boisson backs up the break with her fifth straight game when Andreeva\u2019s meek drop shot is nowhere near to clearing the net!\nBoisson breaks: Andreeva 6-7, 3-4 Boisson* (*denotes next server)\nAndreeva\u2019s mind is gone when she whacks a ball into row Z after falling 0-30 down. The teenager receives a code violation. She\u2019s then dicing with death with a couple of shots that just graze the line, but no, Boisson stops the point, the umpire checks the mark, and the ball was out! Andreeva\u2019s arguing, but it\u2019s in vain. 0-40. Which in Andreeva\u2019s current state of mind may as well be match points. Boisson breaks on the second! Her latest French revolution is almost complete! If she can hold her nerve \u2026\nSecond set: Andreeva* 6-7, 3-3 Boisson (*denotes next server)\nWith Boisson serving at 30-15, Martinez is absolutely screaming at Andreeva to \u201cTAKE THE BALL EARLY\u201d. Andreeva isn\u2019t too impressed, and appears to ask her to leave. Martinez doesn\u2019t listen and is still barking instructions to her charge when the game goes to deuce. It does the trick, though, because here\u2019s a break point! Boisson saves it with a sliding serve out wide. Boisson puffs out her cheeks; she perhaps looks a little tired. But still calm, unlike Andreeva, who can\u2019t believe it when Boisson takes the next two points to hold!\nBoisson breaks: Andreeva 6-7, 3-2 Boisson* (*denotes next server)\nAndreeva is furious with herself, slapping her thighs, as Boisson holds to 30. She doesn\u2019t look as if she\u2019s shaken off that frustration, when she opens up her service game with an eighth double fault. The umpire pleads with the partisan Parisians to be quiet during Andreeva\u2019s service action. But Andreeva is still shaky, and her feet aren\u2019t quite moving quickly enough, as she drops 15-40 behind. The first break point is saved, but Boisson blasts a backhand winner down the line on the second! This jerking drama has another sudden twist!\nSecond set: Andreeva 6-7, 3-0 Boisson* (*denotes next server)\nBoisson taking that first set means the wildcard has remarkably won three consecutive sets against top-six players on her grand slam debut. Her ranking of 361 is slightly misleading, though, given she had an extended period out with an ACL injury, which she suffered just before Roland Garros last year; she couldn\u2019t even face watching the tournament from home, so upset she was at not being able to take the wildcard she\u2019d been offered. Wonder what she\u2019d have said back then if someone had told her she\u2019d be where she is now. But she looks as if she believes she belongs out there, pushing Andreeva to deuce, but the Russian shakes her off on the next two points to hold. Andreeva is in the ascendancy.\nAndreeva breaks: Andreeva* 6-7, 2-0 Boisson (*denotes next server)\nA wonderful game of cat and mouse at 30-all on Boisson\u2019s serve, and Andreeva pings a winning lob. 30-40, break point. Andreeva sorely needs this. And she gets it with a deep strike to Boisson\u2019s backhand, which isn\u2019t coming back into play. After all the tension and tumult of that first-set finale, the atmosphere has calmed and Andreeva is working her way back into this.\nSecond set: Andreeva 6-7, 1-0 Boisson* (*denotes next server)\nThis is a wonderful, improbable story for Boisson \u2013 who knows it could be turning into a Raducanu at the 2021 US Open one \u2013 but I do feel for the 18-year-old Andreeva right now, fighting against the crowd. Her seventh double fault hands Boisson a break point in the opening game of the second set. And so many of her doubles have come at crucial moments. She does, at least, find the strength to resist the double fault before taking the next two points for a much-needed hold.\nBoisson wins the first-set tie-break 8-6\n\u2026 and Andreeva can probably barely hear the encouragement of her coach Conchita Martinez to \u201ckeep going\u201d over the screams of the crowd. Now it\u2019s Boisson with set point at 7-6 \u2026 and Andreeva hoiks wide! Sacre bleu! Boisson has the first set, having been 5-3 and set point down. The Parisian patrons are chanting \u201cLOIS, LOIS, LOIS, LOIS, LOIS, LOIS\u201d. I\u2019m surprised they can breathe.\n\u2026 make that 4-3, and a ripper of an inside-out forehand gets her to 5-3! She\u2019s hit 15 winners off that wing already. But Andreeva wrests back the mini-break and takes the two points on her serve, and suddenly it\u2019s the Russian with a set point at 6-5 \u2026 about 30 minutes after her first. Boisson is serving .. and Andreeva prods out! It\u2019s 6-6 as they again change ends \u2026",

        "Content": "Keir Starmer has said he hopes a trade deal struck last month with the US could come into effect \u201cin just a couple of weeks\u201d, as the White House has signalled that the UK will be spared the 50% steel and aluminium tariffs that came into force on Wednesday.\nDonald Trump said he had decided to \u201cprovide different treatment\u201d to the UK, after the deal was agreed between Washington and London \u2013 though it is yet to be signed.\nStarmer said in the House of Commons on Wednesday that the deal would be implemented \u201cwithin a very short time\u201d.\nThe executive order signed by the US president on Tuesday evening will raise import taxes for US companies buying from other countries.\nLevies will remain at 25% for imports from Britain, although the higher 50% could come in \u201con or after 9 July\u201d if the US administration \u201cdetermines that the UK has not complied with relevant aspects\u201d of the deal.\nChallenged over the uncertainty during prime minister\u2019s questions by the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, Starmer said: \u201cWe are the only country in the world that isn\u2019t paying the 50% tax on steel and that will be coming down. We are working on it, to bring it down to zero; that is going to happen.\u201d\nThe business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said on Wednesday that \u201cessential steps\u201d were taking place \u201cat pace\u201d to turn Starmer\u2019s agreement with Trump into an implementable deal that would eliminate tariffs on steel and cars.\nReynolds was speaking at a brief press conference in Brussels, announcing 13 partnerships with third countries to develop critical minerals supplies, including one pact to financially support Tungsten West, which hopes to reopen a closed mine in Devon. His visit to Brussels came a day after a meeting with the White House trade representative, Jamieson Greer, on the sidelines of an OECD summit in Paris.\n\u201cThe two essential steps we are continuing to progress at pace is, first of all, the implementation of the agreement we have on sectoral tariffs. Steel and aluminium is part of that, alongside automotive, aerospace and the other critical sectors,\u201d Reynolds said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had the decision not to extend 50% but we need to bring that 25% down to effectively zero \u2026 that is one piece of work which we continue to progress at pace.\u201d\nReynolds added that \u201cdeeper negotiation about reciprocal tariffs\u201d between the UK and the US was \u201congoing\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see additional barriers to trade being put in place, and we continue to work constructively with all partners to secure that,\u201d he said.\nThe reduction in tariff rates for UK steelmakers was \u201cin the short-term \u2026 good news\u201d said Rowan Crozier, the chief executive of Brandauer, a metal-stamping specialist.\nHowever, the boss of the Birmingham-based company told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that continual changes to tariff policy were damaging and creating uncertainty for business. \u201cIt is quite far-reaching because essentially our customers are less confident in forward planning or ordering what they need,\u201d Crozier said.\nHe added that the company was having to contact its US customers directly, and called on the UK government to finalise the trade deal with the US in the coming weeks.\n\u201cI think the government have done well to keep us out of it for now but there is a definite deadline they have got to work to now to take away this uncertainty and get those tariffs to zero,\u201d Crozier said.\nThe industry body UK Steel welcomed Trump\u2019s decision to keep tariffs at 25% but said uncertainty remained over the final rate.\nIts director general, Gareth Stace, said: \u201cContinued 25% tariffs will benefit shipments already on the water that we were concerned would fall under a tax hike.\u201d\nHowever, he added: \u201cWe need the UK government to apply rocket boosters to those negotiations with the US administration to get that deal over the line and remove tariffs altogether on our imports and exports to the US market, which is our second-biggest export market.\u201d\nSteel companies had been considering whether to turn shipments around in the mid-Atlantic to try to sell products in Europe rather than pay 50% tariffs. There were also questions over whether products immediately shipped back from the US would be liable to the levies.\nLiam Bates, the president for long products at Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield, told the Guardian that the UK industry was relieved. He said: \u201cStorm in a teacup springs to mind.\u201d\nHowever, he added that \u201cthis is still a wider issue as anything not exclusively UK is attracting 50%\u201d tariffs. It also does require this 0% deal is now done.\u201d\nPaul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said the exemption \u201ctakes us back from the brink and many workers will breathe easier as a result\u201d amid fears that thousands of British jobs could be lost if the steel and aluminium tariffs came into full force.",

        "Content": "The far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has assembled a \u201crogues\u2019 gallery of extremists, conspiracy theorists and C-team political operatives\u201d to promote Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on non-government organisations (NGOs), a congressional watchdog has claimed.\nThe House of Representatives\u2019 Delivering on Government Efficiency (Doge) subcommittee, chaired by Greene, is due to hold a hearing on Wednesday entitled \u201cPublic Funds, Private Agendas: NGOs Gone Wild\u201d.\nThe subcommittee said in a press release that the hearing will \u201cexpose\u201d the use of federal funds by NGOs to advance \u201cradical\u201d agendas such as \u201copen borders and the Green New Deal scam\u201d. It frames its work as an investigation of the alleged funneling of taxpayer dollars to politically motivated groups while \u201clining the pockets of their friends and allies\u201d.\nBut a memo from the Congressional Integrity Project (CIP), obtained by the Guardian, condemns the hearing as \u201cpolitical theater\u201d, \u201cweaponized government oversight\u201d and an exercise in hypocrisy, given the substantial federal funding received by Republican allies and rightwing groups.\nWhile attacking civil society organisations for receiving federal grants, the memo says, \u201ctheir own networks have systematically benefited from government contracts, subsidies, and loans worth billions of dollars\u201d.\nWednesday\u2019s hearing on Capitol Hill will feature witnesses Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies; Daniel Turner, founder and executive director of Power the Future; and Scott Walter, president of the Capital Research Center.\nThe CIP describes Greene\u2019s lineup as \u201crogues\u2019 gallery of extremists, conspiracy theorists and C-team political operatives masquerading as government watchdogs\u201d.\nIt notes that the Center for Immigration Studies has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and regularly circulates content from \u201cwhite nationalist and antisemitic writers\u201d.\nKrikorian has made statements including that Haiti\u2019s problems stem from not being \u201ccolonised long enough\u201d.\nThe memo adds that CIS received more than $700,000 in PPP loans and is now under investigation by the justice department for potentially lying to obtain at least one of them. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Republicans chose as their star witness on government waste someone who may have committed fraud to secure government money for his organization.\u201d\nThe CIP describes Turner as a career political operative who worked for the Charles Koch Institute before founding Power the Future, a climate-denial organisation that attacks environmental groups for receiving federal grants. Yet Turner\u2019s former employer, Charles Koch, has received more than $750m in government subsidies.\nThe memo states: \u201cTurner, who calls \u2018climate change the slippery slope to socialism\u2019 and promotes conspiracy theories about climate science, represents everything wrong with this sham hearing.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a junior varsity Republican operative masquerading as an objective analyst while advancing the financial interests of the fossil fuel industry \u2013 the same interests that have systematically profited from the very government largesse he now pretends to oppose.\u201d\nWalter leads the Capital Research Center, \u201ca secretive organization that won\u2019t disclose its donors while attacking others for lacking transparency\u201d, the CIP alleges.\n\u201cHis organization\u2019s fiscal arrangements appear designed to shield activities from public scrutiny, yet he positions himself as a watchdog exposing liberal \u2018dark money\u2019.\u201d\nIn 2023, according to the memo, Walter helped funnel nearly $600,000 in anonymous donations to supreme court justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s wife Ginni Thomas\u2019s group while his organisation had business before the supreme court, creating conflicts of interest.\nWalter also has a history of making or defending offensive statements about race, gender and sexual orientation. He publicly defended a university professor accused of making racist statements, said average Americans have \u201cdisgust at homosexual practice\u201d and in the 1990s mused that one good thing from the Monica Lewinsky scandal might be \u201cthat feminism will die, that sexual harassment laws will fizzle\u201d.\nThe memo adds: \u201cThis hearing represents weaponized government oversight at its worst, with Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene assembling hate group leaders, conspiracy theorists, and dark money operatives to attack civil society organizations while the very people crying about government waste have pocketed billions in federal contracts and subsidies.\u201d",

        "Content": "A US judge on Tuesday ruled the US Bureau of Prisons must keep providing transgender inmates gender-affirming care, despite an executive order Donald Trump signed on his first day back in office to halt funding for such care.\nUS district judge Royce Lamberth in Washington DC allowed a group of more than 2,000 transgender inmates in federal prisons to pursue a lawsuit challenging the order as a class action. He ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide them with hormone therapy and accommodations such as clothing and hair-removal devices while the lawsuit plays out.\nThe ruling does not require the bureau to provide surgical care related to gender transitions.\nHarrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said the Trump administration expects to ultimately prevail in the legal dispute.\n\u201cThe district court\u2019s decision allowing transgender women, aka MEN, in women\u2019s prisons fundamentally makes women less safe and ignores the biological truth that there are only two genders,\u201d Fields said in an email.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the prisoners, said the ruling was \u201ca critical reminder to the Trump administration that trans people, like all people, have constitutional rights that don\u2019t simply disappear because the president has decided to wage an ideological battle\u201d.\nAbout 2,230 transgender inmates are housed in federal custodial facilities and halfway houses, according to the Department of Justice. About two-thirds of them, 1,506, are transgender women, most of whom are housed in men\u2019s prisons.\nThe named plaintiffs, two transgender men and one transgender woman, sued the Trump administration in March to challenge Trump\u2019s 20 January executive order aimed at combating what the administration called \u201cgender ideology extremism\u201d.\nThe executive order directed the federal government to only recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; and house transgender women in men\u2019s prisons. It also ordered the bureau to stop spending any money on \u201cany medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex\u201d.\nLamberth, appointed by the Republican president Ronald Reagan, said in Tuesday\u2019s ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their lawsuit because the bureau did not perform any analysis before cutting off treatment that its own medical staff had previously deemed to be medically appropriate for the inmates.\nEven if it had extensively studied the issue before deciding to stop gender-affirming care, the decision might still violate the US constitution\u2019s eighth amendment\u2019s protections against \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment, Lamberth wrote.\nThe Department of Justice had argued that the judge should defer to the policy decision of a democratically elected president, but Lamberth said a functioning democracy requires respect for \u201call duly enacted laws\u201d, including those that blocked the executive branch from acting in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner.\nDemocratic self-governance \u201cdoes not mean blind submission to the whims of the most recent election-victor\u201d, Lamberth wrote.\nThe executive order said it was meant to promote the \u201cdignity, safety, and wellbeing of women, and to stop the spread of \u2018gender ideology\u2019\u201d which denies \u201cthe immutable biological reality of sex\u201d.\nBut the inmates receiving hormone treatments had little interest in promoting any ideology, and were instead taking \u201cmeasures to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria\u201d, Lamberth wrote.",

        "Content": "The drugmaker Indivior has become the latest company to abandon its listing in London, heaping further pressure on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) to reinvigorate itself.\nThe Virginia-based company, which makes the opioid addiction treatments Sublocade and Suboxone, switched its main stock listing to the US last year but now plans to cancel the secondary listing it had retained in London.\nIndivior said on Monday that in making the decision it had considered the liquidity and trading volumes of its shares on the US\u2019s Nasdaq exchange compared with the LSE; the location of its shareholders; and the cost and administrative requirements related to the London listing.\nMore than 80% of Indivior\u2019s net revenues come from the US, which has been in the grip of an opioid crisis for decades, after a rise in the use of opioid painkillers led to increasing addiction rates and a sharp rise in fatal overdoses.\nDavid Wheadon, the Indivior chair, said: \u201cA single primary listing on Nasdaq best reflects the profile of Indivior\u2019s business. We appreciate the support received from shareholders for this initiative and look forward to capitalising on the expected benefits of this move, including reductions in cost and complexity.\u201d\nThe London-listed share price fell by 2% to 925.7p on Monday, giving Indivior a market value of almost \u00a31.2bn.\nThe LSE has been hit by an exodus of companies, such as the Anglo-German travel company Tui, which opted for a sole listing in Frankfurt last year. Last year, the London market lost 88 companies that delisted or transferred their primary listing elsewhere, the most since the 2009 financial crisis, according to analysis by EY. The London float of Canal+, the TV channel spun off from France\u2019s Vivendi, gave the LSE a much-needed boost in December.\n\u201cThe London Stock Exchange will be upset it is losing another big name,\u201d said Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cIt means the pressure is on to attract new names to the market and keep existing ones.\u201d\nThe blow was softened as the LSE welcomed Anglo American\u2019s $11bn (\u00a38bn) platinum spin-off Valterra, which became independent from the mining company. Valterra is listed in South Africa and will now have a London listing as well.\nMould said he had expected Indivior to exit London entirely, as its business is focused on the US, where most of its shareholders are based. The company had been listed in London because it was spun off in 2014 from the UK consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser, itself listed in London.\nIndivior appointed the pharma veteran Joseph Ciaffoni as chief executive in February, replacing Mark Crossley after warning of a sharp drop in revenues this year. Last year, it posted 9% sales growth to almost $1.2bn.\nThis was driven by Sublocade, a prescription medicine that is injected once a month by health professionals to treat addiction to opioid drugs in adults, alongside mental health support. Suboxone is a similar drug but is given as tablets or as a film that dissolves when placed under the tongue.\nSublocade\u2019s 2025 sales are expected to be flat compared with last year, while Suboxone film faces a 50% slump in sales because of competition from generic drugs, and Indivior will discontinue Perseris, its once-monthly schizophrenia drug.\nIndivior said in February it faced \u201cnumerous lawsuits\u201d, including an allegation that Suboxone film was \u201cdefectively designed and caused dental injury\u201d.\nThere have also been cases brought by shareholders in the UK and US. Indivior faces a lawsuit in London\u2019s high court from Wirral council, which administers the Merseyside Pension Fund, over alleged false marketing of Suboxone. The case was thrown out in 2023; Wirral council appealed, and Indivior said in February it intended to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d itself.\nIn 2019, the US justice department charged Indivior with fraudulently claiming Suboxone film was better and safer than similar drugs.\nIts former parent, Reckitt, agreed to pay a $1.4bn fine to settle the case in July 2019, without any admission of wrongdoing, while Indivior said in 2020 that it had \u201cpleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement relating to healthcare matters in 2012\u201d and that it would make payments to federal and state authorities totalling $600m over seven years.\nShaun Thaxter, the former Indivior chief executive, was sentenced to six months in federal prison in 2020 after pleading guilty to his role in a scheme to secure Medicaid coverage for Suboxone film by misleading officials about its dangers to children.",

        "Content": "Old people are making news. Just this past week in Denmark, the retirement age for collecting a government pension was increased to 70 years old, an issue that has caused much debate in that country. Here in the US, questions have been raised about Joe Biden\u2019s mental acuity while he was still in office. Warren Buffett announced his retirement at the age of 94 from Berkshire Hathaway. Donald Trump\u2019s behavior, at the age of 78, continues to raise concern, if not alarm.\nWhen are people too old to do their jobs?\nRecent regulations are encouraging workers to stay on the job by increasing the age for when people are required to start cashing out their 401(k) plans from 70 1/2 years to 75 years by 2033. However, a recent study found that more than half of workers over the age of 50 have been pushed out of jobs before they would have retired willingly. US law prohibits forced retirement, but some well-known companies \u2013 like General Electric, Exxon, Intel and Apple \u2013 have age-based restrictions for their senior executives and board members.\nYet, according to a recent report from the Federal Reserve, more than half of small businesses are owned by people over the age of 55, including 70% of firms with more than 50 employees. Should they still be in charge?\nIt\u2019s a growing concern because the population of old people is growing. In the US, the number of people over the age of 65 was about 9% of the total population in 1960. Today it\u2019s closer to 18% and by 2054, 84 million adults ages 65 and older will make up an estimated 23% of the population. Life expectancy was less than 70 back in 1960. Now it\u2019s closing in on 80. People are living longer and working longer. We all know people in their 80s who are sharper than those who are half their age.\nHow old is too old?\nClearly you can\u2019t assign an arbitrary number that defines old age. Mick Jagger is 81. Bruce Springsteen is 75. Paul McCartney is 82. They\u2019re all still performing in front of countless fans. Tom Cruise \u2013 age 62 \u2013 is still jumping out of planes. Cher, 78, recently released a holiday album. Richard Branson, 74, continues to command the Virgin empire. Say what you want about Trump, but even at 78, he\u2019s running around like someone half his age.\nBut do we really want a 78-year-old running the country? Or piloting a commercial jet? Or performing open-heart surgery? Should someone that old be putting out fires, fixing roofs, driving trucks, working in a steel foundry, herding cattle? Probably not. In fact, when someone hits a certain age, everything needs to be re-evaluated.\nWhat age? 60.\nA 2023 study found that almost half of the Fortune 500 were run by people over the age of 60. However, only 28 companies were still being run by a CEO over the age of 70. Something happens during that time, and a recent study from Stanford University may provide the clue.\nAccording to that research, which tracked thousands of molecules in people aged 25 to 75, two major waves of age-related changes were detected at around ages 44 and again at 60, which helps explain why spikes in certain health issues including musculoskeletal problems and cardiovascular disease occur. This may account for the \u201csudden accumulation of wrinkles, aches and pains or a general sensation of having grown older almost overnight\u201d. It\u2019s not gradual. It\u2019s a burst. And while the study focused on physical effects, I believe there\u2019s something else going on once someone hits the age of 60: a loss of energy.\nI have a friend in his early 60s who used to run a bar in downtown Philadelphia and now works as a manager at a manufacturing firm. I asked him if he had any interest in running a bar in the future. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he said to me. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the energy. I just want to play a little golf and spend time with my grandkids.\u201d\nThat sums it up. Most people lose energy when they hit their 60s. Of course, we\u2019re still interested in the world. But work has become less of a priority. We prefer to do other, more fun things in the remaining years of our lives. We tire a little more quickly. We go to bed earlier. We move a little more slowly. I was recently offered the opportunity to buy a competitor\u2019s business and I declined. Sounded interesting but, like my friend, I just couldn\u2019t imagine mustering the energy needed to make such a transaction successful. The thought exhausted me. It still does!",

        "Content": "The US on Thursday voluntarily dismissed its civil lawsuit against Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The move extends the new, friendly approach to cryptocurrencies of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a major financial regulator, since Donald Trump re-entered the White House.\nA joint stipulation of dismissal signed by lawyers for the SEC, Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, was filed in the Washington DC federal court. Its dismissal is with prejudice, meaning the SEC cannot pursue the case again. The SEC said that dismissing the enforcement case was appropriate \u201cin the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter\u201d.\nIn a statement, a Binance spokesperson called the dismissal \u201ca landmark moment. We\u2019re deeply grateful to [SEC] Chairman Paul Atkins and the Trump administration for recognizing that innovation can\u2019t thrive under regulation by enforcement.\u201d An SEC spokesperson declined additional comment.\nTrump promised during his 2024 White House run to be a \u201ccrypto president\u201d, becoming the first major presidential candidate to accept crypto donations, and pledged to reverse an industry crackdown overseen by Atkins\u2019 predecessor, Gary Gensler. The SEC has since withdrawn or put on hold many cryptocurrency enforcement cases. Trump himself has launched a cryptocurrency and hosted a dinner for the coin\u2019s top holders.\nThe SEC sued Binance and Zhao in June 2023, accusing the exchange of artificially inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds and misleading investors about its surveillance controls.\nBinance was also accused of unlawfully facilitating the trading of several cryptocurrency tokens that SEC leadership during Joe Biden\u2019s administration believed should have been registered as securities.\nThe case was separate from Binance\u2019s November 2023 guilty plea and $4.32bn criminal penalty for violating federal anti-money laundering and sanctions laws through lapses in internal controls. Zhao himself pleaded guilty to money laundering violations, stepped down as CEO and was released from prison last September after serving a four-month sentence.\nIn February, the SEC dismissed a separate enforcement case accusing Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, of arranging trading in at least 13 unregistered tokens.\nThe crypto industry has long chafed over regulatory efforts to apply federal securities laws to digital assets, with many companies likening tokens to commodities. Classifying tokens as securities would require cryptocurrency companies to register with the SEC and disclose more to investors.\nAtkins said on 12 May that developing a regulatory framework which establishes \u201cclear rules of the road\u201d for issuing, trading and safekeeping crypto assets, while discouraging lawbreakers, would be a key priority.",

        "Content": "The Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi called his student Richard Garwin \u201cthe only true genius I\u2019ve ever met\u201d. Garwin, who has died aged 97, is perhaps the most influential 20th-century scientist that you have never heard of, because he produced much of his work under the constraints of national or commercial secrecy. During 40 years working at IBM on an endless stream of research projects, he was granted 47 patents, in diverse areas including magnetic resonance imaging, high-speed laser printers and touch-screen monitors. Garwin, a polymath who was adviser to six US presidents, wrote papers on space weapons, pandemics, radioactive waste disposal, catastrophic risks and nuclear disarmament.\nThroughout much of that time, a greater secret remained: in 1951, aged 23, he had designed the world\u2019s first hydrogen bomb.\nTen years earlier, Fermi had had the insight that an atomic bomb explosion would create extraordinarily high pressures and temperatures like those in the heart of the sun. This would be hot enough to ignite fusion of hydrogen atoms, the dynamical motor that releases solar energy, with the potential to make an explosion of unlimited power. This is known as a thermonuclear explosion, reflecting the high temperature, in contrast to an atomic bomb, which starts at room temperature.\nDetonation of the atomic bomb in 1945 gave the proof of the first part of this concept, but in secret lectures at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico that summer, Fermi admitted that although an exploding atomic bomb could act as the spark that ignites hydrogen fuel, he could find no way of keeping the material alight.\nIn 1949, the USSR exploded its first atomic bomb and within months President Harry S Truman announced that the US would develop \u201cthe so-called hydrogen or superbomb\u201d. In the same year, Garwin graduated from the University of Chicago with a doctorate in physics and became an instructor in the physics department. Fermi invited him to join Los Alamos as a summer consultant, to help to realise Truman\u2019s goal.\nEarly in 1951 Edward Teller and Stanislaw Ulam made the theoretical breakthrough: a bomb consisting of two physically separated parts in a cylindrical casing. One component was an atom bomb whose explosion would emit both atomic debris and electromagnetic radiation.\nThe radiation would move at the speed of light and flood the interior with rays that would compress the second component containing the hydrogen fuel. The impact of the debris an instant later would complete the ignition. This one-two attack on the hydrogen fuel was the theoretical idea that Teller asked Garwin to develop.\nGarwin turned their rough idea into a detailed design that remains top secret even today. The device, codenamed Ivy Mike, was assembled on the tiny island of Elugelab in the Enewatak Atoll of the Marshall Islands in the south Pacific. Weighing 80 tonnes and three storeys high, it looked more like an industrial site than a bomb. It was undeliverable by an aeroplane but designed solely to prove the concept.\nOn 1 November 1952, the explosion, which was 700 times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped over Hiroshima or Nagasakai, instantly wiped Elugelab from the face of the earth and vaporised 80m tonnes of coral. In their place was a crater a mile across into which the waters of the Pacific Ocean poured. The mushroom cloud reached 80,000ft in 2 minutes and continued to rise until it was four times higher than Mount Everest, stretching 60 miles across. The core was 30 times hotter than the heart of the sun, the fireball 3 miles wide.\nThe sky shone like a red-hot furnace. For several minutes, many observers feared that the test was out of hand and that the whole atmosphere would ignite.\nNone of the news reports mentioned Garwin\u2019s name; he was a scientific unknown, a junior faculty member at the University of Chicago. A month later he joined the International Business Machines Corporation, IBM, in Yorktown Heights, New York. The post included a faculty appointment at Columbia, which gave him considerable freedom to pursue his research interests and to continue as a government consultant at Los Alamos and, increasingly, in Washington.\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, the elder son of Leona (nee Schwartz), a legal secretary, and Robert Garwin, a teacher of electronics at a technical high school by day and a projectionist at a cinema at night, Dick was a prodigy; by the age of five he was repairing family appliances.\nAfter attending public schools in Cleveland, in 1944 he entered Case Western Reserve University. In 1947, he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics and married Lois Levy; the couple moved to Chicago, where Garwin was tutored by Fermi. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 1948 and a doctorate, aged 21, in 1949. In his doctoral exams he scored the highest marks ever recorded in the university.\nIn addition to his applied science research for IBM, he worked for decades on ways of observing gravitational waves, ripples in space-time predicted by Albert Einstein. His detectors successfully observed the ripples in 2015. This has opened a new window on the universe, in revealing the dynamics of black holes.\nThroughout his career he continued to advise the US government on national defence issues. This included prioritising targets in the Soviet Union, warfare involving nuclear-armed submarines, and satellite reconnaissance and communication systems. A strong supporter of reducing nuclear arsenals, he advised the US president Jimmy Carter during negotiations with the Soviet president Leonid Brezhnev on the 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. He believed that the US should nonetheless maintain a strategic balance of nuclear power with the Soviet Union and opposed policies that could upset that: \u201cMoscow is more interested in live Russians than dead Americans.\u201d\nAfter retiring from the University of Chicago in 1993, he chaired the State Department\u2019s arms control and non-proliferation advisory board until 2001. In 2002 he was awarded the National Medal of Science, the US\u2019s highest scientific award, and in 2016 the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian award. In presenting the award, Barack Obama remarked that Garwin \u201cnever met a problem he didn\u2019t want to solve\u201d.\nLois died in 2018. Garwin is survived by two sons and a daughter, five grandchildren and a great-grandchild.",

        "Content": "Science is under siege.\nOn Friday evening, the White House released an executive order called Restoring Gold Standard Science. At face value, this order promises a commitment to federally funded research that is \u201ctransparent, rigorous, and impactful\u201d and policy that is informed by \u201cthe most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available\u201d. But hidden beneath the scientific rhetoric is a plan that would destroy scientific independence in the US by giving political appointees the latitude to dismiss entire bodies of research and punish researchers who fail to fall in line with the current administration\u2019s objectives. In other words: this is Fool\u2019s-Gold Standard Science.\nAccording to the order, \u201cGold Standard Science means science conducted in a manner that is:\n(i) reproducible;\n(ii) transparent;\n(iii) communicative of error and uncertainty;\n(iv) collaborative and interdisciplinary;\n(v) skeptical of its findings and assumptions;\n(vi) structured for falsifiability of hypotheses;\n(vii) subject to unbiased peer review;\n(viii) accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and\n(ix) without conflicts of interest.\u201d\nThe order mimics the language of an active reform movement in science to increase rigor and transparency of research \u2013 a movement commonly called the open science movement, to which some of us are contributors. Science is, by nature, a continuous work in progress, constantly self-scrutinized and always looking for opportunities to improve. We should all be able to celebrate any administration\u2019s investment in improving the openness, integrity and reproducibility of research.\nBut, with this executive order, we cannot.\nInstead of being about open science, it grants administration-aligned political appointees the power to designate any research as scientific misconduct based on their own \u201cjudgment\u201d and includes the power to punish the scientists involved accordingly; this would weaponize government counter to the public interest.\nThe consequences of state-dictated science can be catastrophic. When Trofim Lysenko, a researcher who denied the reality of genetic inheritance and natural selection, won favor with Joseph Stalin and took control of agriculture in the Soviet Union, thousands of scientists who disagreed with him were fired, imprisoned or killed. His disastrous agricultural prescriptions ultimately led to famines that killed millions in the USSR and in China.\nScience does not proceed by sequentially establishing unassailable conclusions, but rather by steadily accumulating numerous lines of evidence, scrutinizing weaknesses, and pursuing additional evidence. Almost any study, any source of evidence, any conclusion, falls short of meeting every aspect of the White House\u2019s list of best practices. This has nothing to do with laziness, let alone misconduct by individual scientists; it\u2019s simply a consequence of the fact that science is difficult. Scientists constantly grapple with uncertainty, and nevertheless can ultimately arrive at robust, valid conclusions, such as the fact that vaccines do not cause autism, and that the burning of fossil fuels is warming the planet and wreaking havoc on our climate.\nUnder the terms of the executive order, political appointees loyal to the president can willfully find justification to label any research finding as scientific misconduct, and then penalize the researchers involved accordingly. This administration has already appropriated the language of open science to assert control over and deal heavy blows to the scientific ecosystem of the United States \u2013 including cancelling thousands of active research grants in climate science, misinformation and disinformation, vaccines, mental health, women\u2019s health, LGBTQ+ health and stem education. Calls to \u201crevisit\u201d decades of work that establish vaccine safety beyond a shadow of a doubt \u201cbecause the only way you can get good science is through replication\u201d, and demands for unethical vaccine clinical trial practices and additional data, further echo the bad-faith adoption of open science language.\nTrump has also advanced a congressional budget calling for massive cuts to federal spending on research and development and levied significant retaliation against universities that have not fallen in line with his demands. He has gone so far as to propose a rule change by the office of personnel management that would install policy police at all levels of federal agencies, converting thousands of employees into presidential appointees who can be summarily fired without due process for any arbitrary political reason. This new executive order raises the concern that many of our best scientists would be targeted in Lysenkoist purges. Meanwhile, the threat of such actions is already having a chilling effect on all scientists.\nScience is the most important long-term investment for humanity. Interference in the scientific process by political arbiters stifles scientists\u2019 freedom of speech and thought. Science depends on unfettered speech \u2013 free and continuous discussion of data and ideas. We, like the rest of the scientific community, aspire to achieve greater openness, integrity and reproducibility of research to accelerate discovery, advance treatments and foster solutions to meet society\u2019s greatest challenges. Meeting that objective will not occur by centralizing power over science and scientists according to the whims of any political administration. We see this executive order for what it is: an attempt to sell the US\u2019s future for pyrite.\n-\nColette Delawalla is a PhD candidate at Emory University and executive director of Stand Up for Science.

        "Content": "There is a stereotype that the natural political activists in academia are the humanities professors: literary scholars, social theorists and critics of culture are the ones who speak truth to power and fight back against oppression.\nYet scientists also ought to stand up and organize against the Trump administration\u2019s attacks \u2013 not only the attacks on scientific research and integrity, but also the attacks on immigrants, on political speech and on democracy. Scientists cannot see themselves as above the fray but rather in coalition with other workers resisting authoritarianism.\nHistory is replete with examples of scientists that have taken on great risks to resist authoritarianism. The Dutch neurologist GGJ Rademaker reorganized his laboratory into a base of resistance (complete with printing press, radio equipment and hidden weapons) against fascist forces in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands. Some German scientists, including the psychoanalyst John Rittmeister and biochemist Heinrich Wieland, opposed the Nazi regime by hiding Jews and distributing banned anti-fascist literature. Brave German scientists even aided the Allied forces during the second world war.\nAt this year\u2019s meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, the CEO of this research society, Margaret Foti, encouraged cancer scientists to take part in demonstrations and meetings with elected representatives. Professors from all corners of campus are already fighting back against funding cuts, the attempted deportations of our international students and usurpations of democratic governance. At Columbia, where I work, faculty have been organizing to urge our university leadership to provide real protections to students at risk of deportation and sue the Trump administration, among other demands. Contrary to the stereotype, much of the organizing work is being spearheaded by science faculty \u2013 psychiatrists, epidemiologists, astronomers, mathematicians, economists, statisticians, oceanographers \u2013 hand in hand with our colleagues in the humanities.\nDespite the notion that scientists are and should be cautious or apolitical, professors in the sciences are well-suited to political activism. The work of political organizing is not so different from the work of managing a research lab: skills in divvying up tasks, managing people with sensitivity and foresight, and creating clear, compelling narratives to communicate accomplishments (eg to peer reviewers reading our manuscripts) are all clearly transferrable to activism. All science professors were once science students, doing the typically monotonous labor of scientific work, spending hours carefully tinkering in the laboratory, debugging computer code, or meticulously collecting information on the human or natural world. Often political activity involves straightforward but time-consuming tasks such as printing leaflets or making phone calls to representatives. Sometimes there are simple logistics that need taking care of in organizing a protest march. Some activism involves strategizing in coalitions to distribute needed resources or build supportive institutions. None of this is as difficult as \u201crocket science\u201d and it is in fact remarkably similar to the more banal parts of everyday science.\nMany recent actions taken by the Trump administration impinge quite obviously on the expertise of scientists: the attacks on federal research funding, the rollback of decades-long protections of our environment and human health, the excising of research specifically related to climate change or vaccine development. Robert F Kennedy Jr has recently promised to dedicate scientific resources to studying the alleged relationship between autism and vaccination \u2013 a question that has been addressed by dozens of studies and on which the scientific consensus to the contrary is clear \u2013 and thrown the weight of the government behind stigmatizing and dangerous initiatives related to autism, contested by experts and advocates. Donald Trump has also taken steps to sabotage congressionally mandated research on the climate crisis by dismissing expert authors of the National Climate Assessment. Opposing these moves and organizing against them as scientists is a no-brainer. Yet also scientists must fight tooth and nail against the secretive and seemingly baseless incarceration of immigrants, the usurpation of democratic checks and balances, and the reorganization of society along ever more hateful lines. These things affect all of us regardless of our job descriptions. It should go without saying that scientific inquiry cannot flourish in a society dominated by fear, censorship and hate.\nScientists are drawn to the work we do for many different reasons, but I would venture that for most of us there is an underlying goal of advancing humanity \u2013 whether that is by finding cures to disease, new technology or more abstractly by pushing the boundaries of human knowledge so that future generations are better off. All of that is at risk if we remain \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201capolitical\u201d at the wrong moment in history. Though there is a plausible argument for erring on the side of \u201capolitical\u201d in normal times, to ensure trust and guard against undue politicization of scientific work, the argument stretches thin and breaks down given our current political environment and apparent slide toward fascism. Our scientific research itself must remain free from prejudice and aimed wherever the truth may lead, but the work before us is not only scientific research. We must also work to preserve the conditions of life that make both science and society flourish. In these times that means that scientists have a duty to dissent.\n-\nDaniel Malinsky is an assistant professor of biostatistics in the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University",

        "Content": "The Trump administration is going after California following a 16-year-old trans athlete\u2019s victories in a state track and field championship over the weekend.\nThe 16-year-old, AB Hernandez, a junior at Jurupa Valley High School in Riverside County, has made headlines and been at the center of protests in recent months simply for competing.\nDespite protests on Saturday, Hernandez won first place in the girls\u2019 high jump and triple jump at the State Track and Field Championships at Buchanan High School in Clovis, California. Hernandez also finished second in the long jump.\nBut because of a new rule instituted by the California Interscholastic Federation, multiple other student athletes also received medals in the categories that Hernandez competed in. As such, Jillene Wetteland and Lelani Laruelle also won first place in the high jump, and Kira Gant Hatcher also won first in the triple jump. Brooke White also placed second in the long jump.\n\u201cA Biological Male competed in California Girls State Finals, WINNING BIG, despite the fact that they were warned by me not to do so. As Governor Gavin Newscum fully understands, large scale fines will be imposed!!!\u201d the president wrote on Truth Social on Monday.\nOn the same day, Harmeet K. Dhillon, the head of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, sent a transphobic letter to public school districts in California claiming that the state\u2019s law allowing students to compete in sports based on their gender identity rather than the identity assigned to them at birth is \u201cfacially unconstitutional.\u201d\n\u201cThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex,\u201d Dhillon, a legal adviser to Trump, an anti-voting rights and anti-LGBTQ rights extremist, argued in the letter. \u201cKnowingly depriving female students of athletic opportunities and benefits on the basis of their sex would constitute unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d\n\u201cScientific evidence shows that upsetting the historical status quo and forcing girls to compete against males would deprive them of athletic opportunities and benefits because of their sex,\u201d she also wrote, without clarifying where to find the evidence.\nThe letter gives California a week to fall in line with the Justice Department\u2019s interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, which seems to complement Trump\u2019s February executive order.\nTrump\u2019s order aims to block \u201cmale competitive participation in women\u2019s sports\u201d and \u201crescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.\u201d\nIn a letter to superintendents and administrators in the state on Tuesday, Tony Thurmond, the California superintendent of public instruction, reportedly said that the department would review the request and respond by June 9, but that the letter isn\u2019t the law.\nAccording to The Athletic, Thurmond argued that the Equal Protection Clause \u201cdoes not require that athletic teams be segregated by \u2018biological sex.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe DOJ assertions are not in themselves law, and the letter by itself cannot be an enforcement mechanism,\u201d Thurmond also reportedly said.\nThe news comes after the California Interscholastic Federation, California\u2019s high school sports governing body, expanded eligibility for the 2025 CIF State Track and Field Championships rather than excluding anyone from the competition.\n\u201cThe CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law and Education Code,\u201d the organization continued.\nOn Sunday, Nereyda Hernandez, AB Hernandez\u2019s mom, told local outlet KCRA that she was a Trump supporter, but her daughter\u2019s perspective and treatment changed her views.\n\u201cJust talking to AB, and I started analyzing things differently,\u201d Nereyda Hernandez said. \u201cIt\u2019s too much for me because we\u2019re people and I don\u2019t feel we\u2019re being treated as such.\u201d\nShe also told KCRA that the protests during her daughter\u2019s big day were a little distracting, but that she was \u201cproud of her.\u201d\n\u201cA kid is more mature than a lot of these adults putting her in this situation. So I\u2019m just happy, yeah, I could brag.

        "Content": "TULSA, Okla. (AP) \u2014 Tulsa\u2019s new mayor on Sunday proposed a $100 million private trust as part of a reparations plan to give descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre scholarships and housing help in a city-backed bid to make amends for one of the worst racial attacks in U.S. history.\nThe plan by Mayor Monroe Nichols, the first Black mayor of Oklahoma\u2019s second-largest city, would not provide direct cash payments to descendants or the last two centenarian survivors of the attack that killed as many as 300 Black people. He made the announcement at the Greenwood Cultural Center, located in the once-thriving district of North Tulsa that was destroyed by a white mob.\nNichols said he does not use the term reparations, which he calls politically charged, characterizing his sweeping plan instead as a \u201croad to repair.\u201d\n\u201cFor 104 years, the Tulsa Race Massacre has been a stain on our city\u2019s history,\u201d Nichols said Sunday after receiving a standing ovation from several hundred people. \u201cThe massacre was hidden from history books, only to be followed by the intentional acts of redlining, a highway built to choke off economic vitality and the perpetual underinvestment of local, state and federal governments.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time to take the next big steps to restore.\u201d\nNichols said the proposal wouldn\u2019t require city council approval, although the council would need to authorize the transfer of any city property to the trust, something he said was highly likely.\nThe private charitable trust would be created with a goal to secure $105 million in assets, with most of the funding either secured or committed by June 1, 2026. Although details would be developed over the next year by an executive director and a board of managers, the plan calls for the bulk of the funding, $60 million, to go toward improving buildings and revitalizing the city\u2019s north side.\n\u201cThe Greenwood District at its height was a center of commerce,\u201d Nichols said in a telephone interview. \u201cSo what was lost was not just something from North Tulsa or the Black community. It actually robbed Tulsa of an economic future that would have rivaled anywhere else in the world.\u201d\nNichols\u2019 proposal follows an executive order he signed earlier this year recognizing June 1 as Tulsa Race Massacre Observance Day, an official city holiday. Events Sunday in the Greenwood District included a picnic for families, worship services and an evening candlelight vigil.\nNichols also realizes the current national political climate, particularly President Trump\u2019s sweeping assault on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, poses challenging political crosswinds.\n\u201cThe fact that this lines up with a broader national conversation is a tough environment,\u201d Nichols admitted, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t change the work we have to do.\u201d\nJacqueline Weary, is a granddaughter of massacre survivor John R. Emerson, Sr., who owned a hotel and cab company in Greenwood that were destroyed. She acknowledged the political difficulty of giving cash payments to descendants. But at the same time, she wondered how much of her family\u2019s wealth was lost in the violence.\n\u201cIf Greenwood was still there, my grandfather would still have his hotel,\u201d said Weary, 65. \u201cIt rightfully was our inheritance, and it was literally taken away.\u201d\nTulsa is not the first U.S. city to explore reparations. The Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, was the first U.S. city to make reparations available to its Black residents for past discrimination, offering qualifying households $25,000 for home repairs, down payments on property, and interest or late penalties on property in the city. The funding for the program came from taxes on the sale of recreational marijuana.\nOther communities and organizations that have considered providing reparations range from the state of California to cities including Amherst, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Asheville, North Carolina; and Iowa City, Iowa; religious denominations like the Episcopal Church; and prominent colleges like Georgetown University in Washington.\nIn Tulsa, there are only two living survivors of the Race Massacre: 110-year-old Lessie Benningfield Randle and Viola Fletcher, who is 111. The women, both of whom were in attendance on Sunday, received direct financial compensation from both a Tulsa-based nonprofit and a New York-based philanthropic organization, but have not received any recompense from the city or state.\nDamario Solomon-Simmons, an attorney for the survivors and the founder of the Justice for Greenwood Foundation, said earlier this year that any reparations plan should include direct payments to Randle and Fletcher and a victims\u2019 compensation fund for outstanding claims.\nA lawsuit filed by Solomon-Simmons on behalf of the survivors was rejected by the Oklahoma Supreme Court last year, dampening racial justice advocates\u2019 hopes that the city would ever make financial amends.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show one of the two living survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre is Lessie Benningfield Randle, not Leslie, and that the other living survivor, Viola Fletcher, is 111, not 110.",

        "Content": "In what activists say is a landmark decision for Puerto Rico, a federal judge issued a ruling on Monday allowing nonbinary, intersex and gender-fluid individuals in the territory to adjust their birth certificate so that it accurately reflects their gender identity.\nJudge Mar\u00eda Antongiorgi Jord\u00e1n, of the Federal District of Puerto Rico, ordered the Demographic Registry to amend a form so that people can select \u201cX\u201d as a gender marker on their birth certificate. Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n said she was awaiting recommendations from the territory\u2019s Justice Department regarding the ruling, and applicants will have to wait to change their gender marker until the new form is available.\n\u201cAt a time when nonbinary, gender nonconforming and trans communities are under attack, this historic decision opens the door to the full recognition of their dignity,\u201d said Pedro Julio Serrano, activist and president of the LGBTQ+ Federation of Puerto Rico. \u201cWe celebrate a milestone that allows the equality promised in the Constitution to be put in practice.\u201d\nTrans people in Puerto Rico have been allowed to change their gender marker from \u201cmale\u201d to \u201cfemale\u201d and vice versa since 2018, but until Monday could not choose an option that aligned with an identity outside the gender binary. This difference violates the right to equal protection of all people, according to the court order.\n\u201cThe Court finds there is no rational basis to deny the plaintiff\u2019s request,\u201d the order said. \u201cThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\u2019s current birth certificate policy arbitrarily distinguishes between binary and nonbinary individuals and subjects nonbinary individuals to disadvantaged treatment without any justification for doing so.\u201d\nThe ruling is in response to an October 2023 lawsuit against Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n requesting the \u201cX\u201d marker on birth certificates. The suit was filed by six nonbinary Puerto Ricans: \u00cdnaru Nadia de la Fuente D\u00edaz, Maru Rosa Hern\u00e1ndez, Andr\u00e9 Rodil, Yelvy V\u00e9lez Bartolomei, G\u00e9 Castro Cruz and Deni Juste.\nThe ruling \u201crepresents a respite from so much repression \u2026 It\u2019s an unexpected victory,\u201d de la Fuente D\u00edaz told Puerto Rican outlet Todas. \u201cThe fact that you wake up every day knowing that they\u2019re trying to take away your rights, and the next day you wake up and find that they won the lawsuit, that there\u2019s a possibility of continuing to fight in this political climate, shows once again that [U.S. President Donald Trump] doesn\u2019t have absolute power, nor does the government of Puerto Rico.\u201d\nPuerto Rico has long had a history of grassroots activism that protects and uplifts the territory\u2019s LGBTQ+ communities \u2014 beating 30 states and other U.S. territories in overall LGBTQ+ rights and equity, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Trans and nonbinary Puerto Ricans had been able to choose a third gender marker on their passports since 2021, until Trump signed an executive order threatening it.\nThe January order prohibits the use of \u201cX\u201d on federal documents like U.S. passports, military IDs and Social Security cards \u2014 not state- and territory-issued papers like birth certificates and driver\u2019s licenses. Trump\u2019s order, which is policy and not law, was temporarily halted by a federal judge in April.\nAt least 16 states and the District of Columbia currently allow citizens to use the \u201cX\u201d gender marker on their birth certificates, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Many in the LGBTQ+ community have expressed concern about that changing under an administration actively working to roll back civil rights, but activists say they\u2019re determined to keep fighting for equality.\n\u201cThis is proof that when you fight, you win,\u201d said Ivana Fred Mill\u00e1n, director of the LGBTQ+ Federation that\u2019s made up of hundreds of individuals and more than 100 community and allied organizations.\n\u201cEven with so many attacks, the LGBTQ+ communities are still fighting to achieve the promised equality,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe will not take a step back and will continue fighting until equality is achieved.\u201d",

        "Summary": "A judge has ruled federal prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to transgender inmates.",
        "Content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.\nU.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that the bureau\u2019s own medical staff has deemed appropriate.\nThe judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don\u2019t match.\n\u201cIn light of the plaintiffs\u2019 largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,\u201d the judge wrote.\nThe Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The bureau doesn\u2019t dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.\nThe Republican president\u2019s executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren\u2019t spent \u201cfor the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d\nLamberth\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.\nThe lawsuit\u2019s named plaintiffs include Alishea Kingdom, a transgender woman who was prescribed hormone therapy injections and approved to receive social accommodations, including women\u2019s undergarments and cosmetics. Kingdom was denied her hormone shot three times after Trump signed his order, but she had it restored roughly a week after she sued. Her access to feminine undergarments hasn\u2019t been restored, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\u201cIn Ms. Kingdom\u2019s case, there is no indication at all that the BOP means to leave her hormone therapy in place long-term; indeed, as noted above, she was informed by BOP personnel that the decision to resume her treatment was a consequence of this litigation itself, raising the specter that her treatments might be discontinued as soon as the litigation has concluded,\u201d Lamberth wrote.\nTrump\u2019s order also directed the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that \u201cmales are not detained in women\u2019s prisons.\u201d In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men\u2019s facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.\nThe judge said there\u2019s no evidence Trump or prison officials considered the harm the new polices could do to transgender inmates.\n\u201cThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged irreparable harm because they are all currently receiving hormone medications. But it suffices to say that all three plaintiffs\u2019 access to hormone therapy is, as best the Court can tell, tenuous,\u201d Lamberth wrote.\nThe plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.\nLamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, in 1987.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) are \u201cantisemitic\u201d for joining college protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\nThe Republican lobbed the accusation after fellow political commentator Maria Cardona argued President Donald Trump is to blame for the recent antisemitic attacks across the U.S., as a result of his support for white supremacist groups like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.\n\u201cThat is absolutely nuts. You guys are barely scratching the surface here,\u201d Sununu replied on Monday.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about; we need more Democrats to condemn what\u2019s happening,\u201d he continued. \u201cHow about let\u2019s get Democrats not joining in on it? How about AOC and Representative Omar don\u2019t join those college campuses?\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez and Omar have criticized Israel\u2019s ongoing military campaign in Gaza to varying degrees: both have called it a \u201cgenocide,\u201d while Omar physically joined Columbia University\u2019s demonstration last year and saw her own daughter arrested for participating.\nSununu argued that the rise of antisemitism in the U.S. \u201cstarts on the college campuses\u201d and \u201cempowers people to go beyond\u201d words. The panel had been discussing Sunday\u2019s attack in Boulder, Colorado, where a man yelling \u201cFree Palestine\u201d injured eight people.\n\u201cI want to be a little bit more specific about what we\u2019re talking about here,\u201d said host Abby Phillip.\n\u201cI definitely think, to the congressman\u2019s point, there are specific things that are being said on these campuses that are antisemitic,\u201d she added. \u201cBut the idea that AOC and \u2026 Omar are engaging in those activities, I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s a lot of evidence of that.\u201d\nSununu said, \u201cThey showed up on those campuses. They spoke at the campuses!\u201d\nPhillip replied, \u201cBut here\u2019s what I\u2019m saying \u2014 do you understand what I\u2019m saying? If they show up on college campuses to protest the situation in Gaza, is that, are you saying, automatically the same thing as uttering antisemitic words and using antisemitic language?\u201d\nTo which Sununu had a very plain response. \u201cYes, they\u2019re antisemitic,\u201d he said. \u201cMake no mistake about it, this is all based on antisemitism.\u201d\nWhen asked what specific evidence he might have that the congresswomen are antisemitic, beyond merely attending demonstrations or criticizing the Israeli government\u2019s relentless bombardment of Gaza, Sununu baselessly replied: \u201cSupporting terrorists?\u201d\nThe former lawmaker\u2019s argument has since been shredded on social media, as neither Omar nor Ocasio-Cortez has ever endorsed terrorists. Both have criticized Israel\u2019s military campaign, but also publicly denounced Hamas, as well as Sunday\u2019s attack in Boulder.\nPhillip said regarding Omar and Ocasio-Cortez, \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between protesting and saying and doing antisemitic things.\u201d",

        "Content": "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is facing a primary challenge from a somewhat unexpected source: one-time ally and current deputy Antonio Delgado.\nDelgado, New York\u2019s lieutenant governor, announced on Monday that he intends to challenge Hochul in the upcoming 2026 Democratic primary and stressed the need for \u201cbold, decisive, transformational leadership\u201d in a campaign video.\nDelgado\u2019s move underscores a sharp break with Hochul, who appointed him to his current role in May 2022. The two moderates ran on the same ticket in the 2022 election, but they have had a series of public rifts in the years since. In February, Delgado announced that he wouldn\u2019t be running alongside Hochul in 2026, fueling speculation about a potential primary challenge.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a vision,\u201d Delgado told The New York Times on Monday. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a decisive leadership that is cleareyed.\u201d\nHochul has been New York\u2019s governor since 2021, taking on the role after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned following sexual harassment allegations. During her tenure, she\u2019s been known for launching a universal school meal program, implementing a congestion pricing policy in Manhattan and rolling back progressive bail reforms. Delgado was previously a member of Congress before resigning to become Hochul\u2019s deputy; he was also a Rhodes Scholar and hip-hop artist.\nHochul and Delgado\u2019s relationship has publicly fractured in the last year. After former President Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance in June 2024, Delgado urged him to drop out of the race, while Hochul, a surrogate for the Biden campaign, declined to do the same. \u201cWhile Lieutenant Governor Delgado has the right to voice his opinion, Governor Hochul believes Democrats must come together, move forward as a united party, and focus on defeating Donald Trump in November,\u201d Jen Goodman, a spokesperson for Hochul\u2019s campaign, said at the time.\nSuch divides were even more apparent when Delgado urged New York City Mayor Eric Adams to resign after he was indicted on federal charges of bribery. \u201cI speak for New Yorkers. That\u2019s how I orient myself: as an independently elected individual,\u201d Delgado said during a state capitol speech, the Gothamist reported. \u201d I serve with the governor. But I don\u2019t serve at the pleasure of the governor, right? I am my own person. I have my own voice.\u201d\nHochul had not asked Adams to resign at the time of Delgado\u2019s remarks and eventually decided not to remove him, proposing increased oversight of his leadership instead. \u201cLt. Gov. Delgado does not now and has not ever spoken on behalf of this administration,\u201d Hochul spokesperson Anthony Hogrebe said in February.\nWhen Delgado announced that he wouldn\u2019t be running with Hochul in February, her office was similarly blunt. \u201cToday, Antonio Delgado finally said out loud what has been obvious for quite some time: he is simply not interested in doing the job of the Lieutenant Governor of the State of New York,\u201d Hogrebe said.\nOn Monday, Delgado said in his campaign video that he\u2019d aim to focus on policies including affordable housing, universal health care and universal pre-K.\nPolling suggests that Hochul could be vulnerable, with an April Marist Poll finding that 57% of New Yorkers opposed her decision to run for reelection.\nIn addition to Delgado, Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) as well as Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) have also hinted at their interest in the race, too.\n\u201cThe powerful and well-connected have their champions,\u201d Delgado said in his campaign announcement. \u201cI\u2019m running for governor to be yours.\u201d",

Maura Healey (D), who said the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown has created \u201cfear in our communities, and it\u2019s making us all less safe.\u201d\n\u201cYet again, local officials and law enforcement have been left in the dark with no heads up and no answers to their questions,\u201d she said in a statement Sunday.\nTodd Lyons, acting director of ICE, defended the teen\u2019s arrest to reporters at Monday\u2019s press conference, calling it legal and arguing that the teen didn\u2019t need to be a known violent or dangerous criminal to be taken into custody.\n\u201cLike any local law enforcement officer, if you encounter someone who has a warrant, or like I said is here illegally, we will take action on that,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t say he was dangerous, I said he was in this country illegally, and we\u2019re not going to walk away from anybody.\u201d\nHyde said the teen\u2019s arrest was part of a mass immigration sweep in May that targeted \u201cthe most dangerous alien offenders in some of the most crime-infested areas of Massachusetts.\u201d\nICE made nearly 1,500 arrests within the last 30 days. Everyone arrested was breaking the nation\u2019s immigration laws, she said \u201cbut most of these individuals, 790 to be exact, had significant criminality,\u201d including records for murder and drug crimes.\nHundreds of people marched in protest of Gomes\u2019 arrest on Sunday from Milford High School\u2019s graduation ceremony to the city\u2019s Town Hall, according to NBC Boston.\nGomes\u2019 girlfriend, Julianys Rentas Figueroa, told the local station that he was supposed to play drums in the school\u2019s ceremony.\n\u201cHe said they had put chains around his ankles and on his wrists and that he was first in, I think, Burlington and then transferred to Plymouth, and right now, I haven\u2019t spoken to him since then, I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing,\u201d she said.\nAmong those demonstrating on Sunday was state Sen. Becca Rausch (D), who condemned the teen\u2019s arrest in a statement Monday.\n\u201cThe cruelty and unlawful actions of the Trump Administration make all of us less safe, and the trampling of one person\u2019s constitutional rights is the destruction of constitutional rights for us all,\u201d she said.",

        "Content": "BOULDER, Colo. (AP) \u2014 Four additional victims have been identified in the Boulder attack in which a man is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails into a Colorado group that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Monday, bringing the number of injured to 12.\nThe man planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted what he described as a \u201cZionist group,\u201d authorities said in court papers unsealed Monday charging him with a federal hate crime.\nWitnesses in Boulder said the suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d and used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices. Eight people were injured in the attack, some with burns.\nAn FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he was driven by a desire \u201cto kill all Zionist people,\u201d a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.\n\u201cHe said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,\u201d police wrote. \u201cMohamed described his hopes for everyone in the Zionist group to die.\u201d\nFederal court records don\u2019t list the name of an attorney who could speak on Soliman\u2019s behalf and no one answered the door at a Colorado Springs townhouse where public records show he lived.\nThe burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.\nSix Victims Hospitalized\nThe eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.\nSix of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, said Miri Kornfeld, a Denver-based organizer connected to the group. She said the clothing of one of those who remains hospitalized caught on fire.\nThe attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, \u201cHe\u2019s right there. He\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails,\u201d as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.\nAlex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a \u201cboom\u201d followed by people yelling and screaming.\nIn video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack.\nMolotov Cocktails Found\nSoliman said he dressed up like gardener with an orange vest in order to get as close to the group as possible, even purchasing flowers from Home Depot, police wrote. He had gas in a backpack sprayer but told investigators he didn\u2019t spray it on anyone but himself \u201cbecause he had planned on dying.\u201d\nHe told investigators he only threw two Molotov cocktails at the group \u201cbecause he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,\u201d police wrote.\nAfter the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video Osante filmed.\nDistrict Attorney Michael Dougherty said 16 unused Molotov cocktails were recovered by law enforcement. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said.\nInside his car, law enforcement found papers with the words \u201cIsrael,\u201d \u201cPalestine,\u201d and \u201cUSAID,\u201d the affidavit says.\nSoliman told investigators he constructed homemade Molotov cocktails after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients.\n\u201cHe stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,\u201d the affidavit says.\nSuspect Hospitalized After Attack\nAuthorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. He was also injured and taken to a hospital. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.\nSoliman was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on the social platform X. McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.\nSoliman, who was born in Egypt, moved to Colorado Springs three years ago, where he lived with his wife and five kids, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.\nColorado Springs Neighbors Recognized Suspect\nShameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his wife as kindly neighbors with three young kids and two teenagers, who\u2019d play with Pruiett\u2019s kids.\nAnother neighbor, Kierra Johnson, said she could often hear shouting at night from his apartment and once called police because of the screaming and yelling.\nOn Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman\u2019s home to come out. Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett.\nAn online resume under Soliman\u2019s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo.\nThe War In Gaza\nIsrael\u2019s war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.\nIsrael\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants.\nTucker reported from Washington.

The man was heard yelling \u201cFree Palestine\u201d while carrying out the afternoon violence, which injured four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, local authorities said.\nSoliman was charged with a federal hate crime Monday, according to court documents.\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,\u201d President Donald Trump said in a statement Monday afternoon that pointedly blamed his predecessor for the violence and repeated his campaign for mass deportations.\n\u201cThis is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!\u201d he said.\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, who in the wake of the attack has directed local law enforcement agencies to bolster security efforts at Jewish places of worship, also called for the suspect to be prosecuted \u201cto the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\n\u201cSeveral individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement Sunday. \u201cHate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror.\u201d\nColorado\u2019s Democratic Sens.

The suspect in that attack said, \u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza,\u201d upon his arrest, according to an FBI special agent\u2019s affidavit in the case.\n\u201cIt is particularly painful that this attack occurred as the Jewish community prepares to celebrate Shavuot. We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to combating antisemitism in all of its forms,\u201d Bennet added.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) expressed similar sentiments, with all three calling it a shared responsibility to stand up against antisemitic acts.\n\u201cWhen antisemitism is allowed to fester, when it spreads unchecked, and when too many look the other way, history has shown us where it leads: to hatred, to violence, to terror,\u201d Schumer said.\n\u201cAntisemitism has no place in our nation or anywhere throughout the world. It must be crushed,\u201d Jeffries said.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were targeted \u201csimply because they were Jews\u201d and that he expected the \u201ccold blood perpetrator\u201d would be prosecuted to \u201cthe fullest extent of the law.\u201d\n\u201cThe antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,\u201d he said.\nSeveral Trump administration officials have spoken out, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sharing that her department is monitoring the incident and \u201cpraying for the victims and their families.\u201d\n\u201cThis violence must stop,\u201d she posted on social media.\nFBI Director Kash Patel also said his agency is \u201cfully investigating\u201d what his deputy director called a suspected \u201cact of ideologically motivated violence.\u201d\n\u201cWe are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence. All of the necessary assets will be dedicated to this investigation,\u201d Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a statement.\nTrump\u2019s senior adviser Stephen Miller meanwhile also blamed Joe Biden\u2019s administration for the suspect\u2019s ability to carry out the attack.\n\u201cSuicidal migration must be fully reversed,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration security is national security.\u201d\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) similarly blamed the Biden administration for what happened.\n\u201cThis act of terror could have been prevented, but Biden made a mockery of our national security and America is paying the price for his failures,\u201d he posted on social media.",

        "Summary": "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act has a provision buried halfway through its 1,000-plus pages that would take away power from the courts.",
        "Content": "In the House of Representatives\u2019 recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, something ugly lurks beneath the surface.\nIt is a provision \u2014 a single paragraph found about halfway through the bill\u2019s 1,000-plus pages \u2014 that could hamstring judges, reduce access to the courts for the average person and reverse a number of the Trump administration\u2019s legal setbacks and defeats.\nWhat is the provision, and how likely is it to become a reality? HuffPost breaks down what it all means.\nThis story is part of HuffPost\u2019s commitment to fearlessly covering the Trump administration. You can support our work and protect the free press by contributing to our newsroom.\nWhat Is Section 70302?\nSection 70302 of the bill states that \u201cno court of the United States may use appropriated funds to enforce a contempt citation for failure to comply with an injunction or temporary restraining order if no security was given when the injunction or order was issued pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), whether issued prior to, on, or subsequent to the date of enactment of this section.\u201d\nIn simple terms, this means that judges wouldn\u2019t be able to issue contempt orders against defendants who defy the courts unless the person who first sued for an injunction or restraining order had forked over a bond at the very start of their lawsuit. Contempt citations, which occur when a person fails to obey court orders, can carry financial penalties as well as jail time.\nBonds are taken to limit financial damages to the person or entity being sued. The Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) has offered guidance on this point since 1938, telling judges they can only hand down preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders if they first issued a bond that was \u201cproper.\u201d A preliminary injunction stops a party in a legal dispute from taking any further action; a temporary restraining order is similar but it only lasts for a short window of time, usually 10 days.\nA judge ultimately decides what that \u201cproper\u201d bond amount should be. Federal courts often do not set bonds at all due to the large disparity in power and resources between the United States and an individual plaintiff, judges often put practicality first when it comes to lawsuits against the federal government and Rule 65 is applied at their discretion: A single person would likely never be able to put up a financial bond big enough to cover the full cost of potential injury the federal government may experience if hit with an injunction.\nAs a result, a judge might set such a bond for a nominal amount, like $1 or even $0. This lowers the hurdle that the public must climb over when contesting the actions of its own government.\nImportantly, the provision in the bill passed by the House applies retroactively, without any stated time limit. This could mean that injunctions handed down by the courts years ago \u2014 like those instructing the government to stop segregating schools, for example, and any other where a bond was not taken \u2014 could potentially be undone if a bond was not taken first, Erwin Chemerinsky, dean and distinguished professor of law at Berkeley Law School, recently told HuffPost.\nThe language in the provision is somewhat vague, and it\u2019s not clear whether bonds set by a judge at $0 would be swept up, too.\nWill It Pass The Senate?\nThe biggest hurdle the provision faces is that it likely doesn\u2019t meet the requirements of the Byrd Rule, which prohibits passing a budget bill that includes anything \u201cextraneous\u201d or not related to fiscal spending.\nThere are six tests senators must use to determine if a provision is \u201cextraneous,\u201d according to the Congressional Research Service: 1, if the provision does not produce any change in revenue or the amount of funds spent on something; 2, if it produces an increase in the amount of funds spent on something or a decrease in revenue; 3, if it is outside the jurisdiction of the congressional committee that submitted the provision to begin with; 4, if it only changes revenue or spending in a way that is \u201cmerely incidental\u201d; 5, it increases the deficit in a fiscal year beyond what was already covered in a budget bill; and 6, it would amend specific parts of the Social Security Act relevant to old age, survivors and disability insurance.\nThe provision in the tax bill attempts to meet that criteria by saying courts can\u2019t use \u201cappropriated funds to enforce a contempt citation.\u201d Although judges have the power to hold someone in contempt, the related penalties \u2014 for example, whether someone gets arrested and is taken to jail \u2014 are left up to the U.S. Marshals service, Chemerinsky explained. That agency is housed under the Justice Department, which has its funds appropriated by Congress.\nKhadijah Silver, the supervising attorney for civil rights at Lawyers for Good Government, told HuffPost the U.S. Marshals Service \u201cconnection is incredibly thin.\u201d\n\u201cThe Byrd Rule requires budget reconciliation measures to have a direct fiscal impact, and this is fundamentally about restricting judicial power, not spending,\u201d Silver said. \u201cMore importantly, as the Supreme Court established nearly a century ago in Michelson v. United States, Congress cannot undermine the essential functions of federal courts. The contempt power is integral to judicial authority under Article III \u2014 without it, court orders become meaningless suggestions that the executive branch can ignore at will.\u201d\nAt least one Republican senator demurred when asked whether the provision was likely to make it to the final bill.\nDuring a town hall in Iowa on Friday, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) told attendees that every provision in the 1,100-page bill would go through a review process before it came up for a vote \u2014 and said Republicans in the chamber wouldn\u2019t be making the final call.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the ones who make those decisions, folks. If you follow Senate procedures, it\u2019s nonpartisan parliamentarians who make that decision. \u2026 And they are very strict about this as well. I don\u2019t think any argument that could ever be made that this [provision] impacts mandatory spending or revenues \u2014 I just don\u2019t see it getting into the Senate bill,\u201d Ernst said.\nThe current Senate parliamentarian is Elizabeth MacDonough, who was appointed to the role by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, in 2012.\nBut what Ernst failed to mention was that senators could vote to overrule MacDonough if she were to suggest tossing the provision \u2014 and that a simple majority is all that is needed to do so when it comes to budget bills. Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.\nReal-World Impact\nIf the provision were passed, it would have the potential to unwind injunctions or restraining orders that judges have already set against the Trump administration as the president has pushed through executive orders attempting to dismantle the federal government or target groups he perceives as a threat to his administration\u2019s agenda, from people born to immigrant parents to law firms he claims are weaponized against him, to trans people serving in the U.S. military.\nJudges in the nation\u2019s lower courts have ruled against the administration 96% of the time so far, according to an analysis by political science professor Adam Bonica of Stanford University. Many cases where an injunction was issued could be in jeopardy if the provision is left intact, and the threat of a judge issuing future contempt citations against the administration evaporates as well.\nThere is little question the provision would \u201cembolden government excesses and hobble judges\u2019 ability to enforce their rulings,\u201d Silver said.\n\u201cThis is most problematic in cases where the injunction is based on the government\u2019s breach of the Constitution,\u201d they said. \u201cIt forces private actors who have been harmed and are being harmed to pay for the privilege of having those harms brought before the court.\u201d\nIn short, it\u2019s now up to the Senate whether the judicial system will change drastically and quickly.\n\u201cThis provision would render hundreds of existing court orders unenforceable overnight. We\u2019re talking about everything from school desegregation orders to police reform mandates to protection of immigrants\u2019 due process rights,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt would create a \u2018catch me if you can\u2019 system where the government could violate the Constitution faster than courts could stop them. This isn\u2019t about fiscal responsibility \u2014 it\u2019s about neutering the last meaningful check on executive power when it tramples our constitutional rights.\u201d",

        "Content": "A new study has found that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination rate among American children has fallen about 3% since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, aligning with the rise of anti-vaccine misinformation.\nThe change comes after over a decade of more stable MMR vaccination rates, the study\u2019s senior author, Lauren Gardner, director of Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Systems Science and Engineering, told HuffPost.\nThe study, published on Monday in JAMA, found that 78% of the 2,066 counties studied experienced a decline in their MMR vaccination rates over the past five years. On average, the rate fell from 93.92% pre-pandemic to 91.26% post-pandemic, marking a 2.67% decline.\nOf the 33 states included in the study, only California, Connecticut, Maine and New York reported an increase in the median county-level MMR vaccination rate. The lowest MMR rates observed in the study were in Wisconsin, confirming previous findings.\nThe shift means the U.S. is \u201cmoving further away from the 95% herd immunity threshold to predict or limit the spread of measles,\u201d Johns Hopkins University said with the release of the study.\nThough measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. 25 years ago, it\u2019s now surging with more than 1,000 confirmed cases and three confirmed deaths this year in an outbreak largely centered in Texas. Only 3% of those infected are known to have received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.\nEven as the outbreak grows, lawmakers in Texas approved a bill earlier this week that would make it much easier for children to enroll in school without the MMR vaccine and other standard inoculations. Since 2018, the Texas Tribune reported, such exemption requests have more than doubled from 45,900 to more than 93,000 in 2024.\nThe observed downturn in MMR vaccine rates comes as anti-vaccine misinformation thrives online at a rate outpacing the interventions to address it, a study out of Columbia University found last year.\n\u201cMisinformation is not new and its noxious consequences are not insurmountable, but its effect on vaccine hesitancy through social media is an urgent global threat to public health,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Kai Ruggeri, said upon its release.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., long one of the loudest voices in the anti-vaccine movement, is also a known spreader of misinformation about the MMR shots.\nIn an April interview with CBS, he claimed the vaccine \u201cwanes very quickly,\u201d even though evidence shows it lasts most people their entire lifetimes. And in a March appearance on Fox Nation, he pushed baseless claims that Vitamin A could be a treatment for measles. He also falsely claimed that \u201ca lot of studies\u201d show that natural immunity derived from catching measles can help the immune system fight cancer, cardiac disease and allergies.",

        "Summary": "This specific type of cancer is on the rise in people 50 and younger in the U.S. \u2014 but there\u2019s hope.",
        "Content": "Dense bean salads, which use beans as a salad base instead of lettuce, are all the rage on social media for good reason. The beans, along with the fresh veggies in the dish, help you reach your daily fiber goal, a number that experts say most Americans don\u2019t hit, which isn\u2019t good. Eating enough fiber is a crucial way to reduce your risk of colon cancer, a type of cancer that\u2019s on the rise in people 50 and younger in the US.\n(It\u2019s recommended that women eat roughly 25 grams of fiber each day while men consume about 38 grams, but most adults eat roughly 10 grams of fiber each day.)\nDecades ago, researchers found that people in Uganda had very low rates of colon cancer when compared to Americans because of their diet, which was high in fiber \u2014 veggies, fruits and grains \u2014 and low in meat, said Dr. Ron Quinton, the medical director of the Goldring Center for Culinary Medicine at Tulane University in New Orleans. Specifically, colon cancer occurred at a rate of 3.5 out of 100,000 in men in Uganda compared to 51.8 out of 100,000 in men in Connecticut.\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the first time that it was really noticed that this was a prevention for colon cancer,\u201d noted Quinton. Meaning, it\u2019s really important to prioritize your fiber consumption.\nThere are multiple ways that fiber benefits colon health and even more ways to reach the daily recommended amount. Here\u2019s what experts say:\nEating enough fiber helps move your stool through your digestive tract.\n\u201cFiber plays an important role in the health of the colon, and when the colon gets unhealthy, then we\u2019re set up for development of cancer and other inflammatory diseases,\u201d said Quinton.\nOverall, fiber adds bulk to the stool, which helps with proper colon function.\n\u201c[Fiber] makes the stools more easy to move along, so the time that the stool spends in the colon is lessened, so less chance for constipation, more normal stools,\u201d explained Quinton.\nThis is also good for the removal of toxins: \u201cIf there are any toxins in the stool that lead to cancer, they spend less time in the colon, and therefore lessen the chances of cancer exposure or other diseases,\u201d he said.\nFiber also benefits the microbiome, which is protective against colon cancer, too.\nFiber is also important for the microbiome, which has been the main focus of research in the past decade, said Mary Ellen Camire, a professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine.\nFiber is often prebiotic, meaning it\u2019s food for probiotic bacteria, Camire added. And probiotics help rebuild and balance your microbiome.\n\u201cWhen the bacteria get a nice fiber meal, they are very active, and they make compounds that help protect the colon\u201d against colon cancer, along with other kinds of cancers, she explained.\nMore, the cells that line the colon, which are called colonocytes, get their energy from the microbiome, added Quinton. \u201cAnd when the colonocytes are healthy, then they form an intact barrier along the colon, so that substances that may cause disease or cancer can\u2019t cross that barrier,\u201d Quinton said.\n\u201cIt also helps the colon produce mucus [and] thick mucus lining also protects the colon, so without enough fiber, our microbiome gets diseased and they don\u2019t produce the energy or nutrients that our colon needs to stay healthy,\u201d he noted.\nHere\u2019s how you can eat more fiber:\n\u201cFiber is a really critical part of our overall diet, and the typical American only gets 5 or 10% of the recommended amount of fiber in their diet on any given day,\u201d said Quinton.\nAs mentioned above, women need about 25 grams of fiber each day and men need about 38 grams, he said.\nBeans and legumes are very high in fiber and certain fruits and veggies are, too. Lentils have 18 grams of fiber per cup, black beans have about 15 grams in 1 can, chia seeds have 10 grams in 2 tablespoons, barley has 6 grams in 1 cup, raspberries have 8 grams in 1 cup and a pear has 6 grams, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\nThis summer, you could make a bean and whole wheat pasta salad to up your fiber intake, or make some cold barley salads, said Camire. You can also lean into seasonal produce, she said.\nCamire added that it\u2019s important to spread your fiber intake out across the day and to consume different kinds of foods for fiber.\n\u201cThe mistake a lot of people make when they decide \u2018I\u2019m going to make fiber a priority\u2019 is they don\u2019t give their system time to adjust. If you\u2019re used to eating 15 grams of fiber a day, and you start eating 30 grams a day, the bacteria think they\u2019re having a party and so you may have some gas and cramping,\u201d Camire said.\nYou should start out gradually and slowly build up, she noted.\n\u201cOnce you find the foods that you tolerate well and that you like, getting enough fiber won\u2019t be difficult or expensive,\u201d Camire added.\nAnd fiber supplements don\u2019t cut it.\nIt\u2019s tempting to turn to fiber supplements as a quick and easy way to reach your fiber goal, but experts say you shouldn\u2019t.\n\u201cNone of the supplements ... are an adequate replacement for natural fiber,\u201d Quinton said. Also, since you need so much fiber, fiber supplements end up being just a drop in the bucket, Camire added.\nWhile some of the supplements can increase your stool bulk and help constipation, \u201cthey don\u2019t necessarily have the soluble fiber elements that feed the microbiome and keep it healthy, which keeps your gut healthy,\u201d said Quinton.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can just replace the fiber with supplements. You need to be eating whole food,\u201d Quinton added.\nBeyond fiber intake, there\u2019s more you can do to lower your colon cancer risk.\nIt\u2019s important to also take other preventative steps to lower your risk of developing colon cancer. These include monitoring yourself for concerning symptoms such as ongoing stomach pain, blood in your stool or a change in your bowel movements. If you notice these symptoms, talk to your doctor.\nIt\u2019s also important to let your doctor know if colon cancer runs in your family as you may be eligible for an early colonoscopy screening.\nColonoscopy screenings start at 45 for those with no family history and without the symptoms mentioned above, but no matter when you\u2019re eligible, colonoscopies are the best way to screen for colon cancer and remove potentially precancerous polyps.\n\u201cDuring a colonoscopy, if we see a polyp, and we believe it to be the precancerous kind, which the vast majority are, we will remove those polyps at the colonoscopy,\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Dueker, a gastroenterologist at UPMC and an associate professor of gastroenterology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, previously told HuffPost. \u201cAnd in doing so, we are reducing the colorectal cancer risk going forward,\u201d Dueker added.\nWith rising colon cancer rates in the U.S., it\u2019s important to do what you can to lessen your risk, which includes eating a high-fiber diet, going to necessary doctor\u2019s appointments and monitoring yourself for symptoms.",

        "Content": "- The CEO of BarkBox, Matt Meeker, has apologized after an internal message leaked.\n- The message compared Pride products to hypothetical MAGA items, calling both \"politically charged.\"\n- Meeker called it \"disrespectful and hurtful\" and said the company has no plans to remove its Pride offerings.\nThe CEO of BarkBox, the company that offers a monthly subscription service for boxes of dog toys and treats, has issued a public apology for a \"disrespectful and hurtful\" internal message that leaked on social media.\nA screenshot of the message that circulated on Reddit described the decision to immediately pause paid ads and lifecycle marketing pushes for the company's Pride kit.\n\"While celebrating Pride is something we may value, we need to acknowledge that the current climate makes this promotion feel more like a political statement than a universally joyful moment for all dog people,\" the message reads in part. \"If we wouldn't feel comfortable running a promotion centered around another politically charged symbol (like a MAGA-themed product), it's worth asking whether this is the right moment to run this particular campaign.\"\n\"Right now, pushing this promo risks unintentionally sending the message that 'we're not for you' to a large portion of our audience,\" the message concludes.\nBarkBox confirmed to Business Insider the authenticity of the screenshot. The author of the message is unclear.\nFounder and CEO Matt Meeker apologized for the \"disrespectful and hurtful\" message in an Instagram post on Wednesday.\n\"I do not agree with the content of the message. It wasn't good, it doesn't reflect our values, and I'm deeply sorry that it happened,\" he said.\n\"We stand by the products,\" he wrote about the Pride kits, noting that the company had no plans to remove them. While the company has donated a portion of profits from its Pride collection to an organization supporting LGBTQ people in past years, it'll donate 100% of the revenue from the collection this year, he added.\nThe company's Pride collection is available as an optional add-on for BarkBox and Super Chewer subscribers, and has been offered for the past four years.\nThe initial pullback on Pride isn't unique to BarkBox. Some of the biggest retailers in the US have walked back their support for diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, with some taking cues from the Trump administration's stance on the matter. Target last year scaled back its Pride Month collection after receiving backlash from conservatives over the merchandise in prior years. In late November, Walmart announced it was ending some of its DEI initiatives and taking down some LGBTQ-related merchandise from its website.",

        "Summary": "Elon Musk's actions in the White House violated norms \"at an astonishing pace\" for government workers, Elizabeth Warren's office said in a report.",
        "Content": "- A report from Sen. Warren says Elon Musk abused his role as a \"special government employee.\"\n- The report flagged over 100 instances that suggest Musk used his role to benefit himself or his businesses.\n- \"In many cases, Musk has violated norms at an astonishing pace,\" the report reads.\nUS Sen. Elizabeth Warren is criticizing Elon Musk's work in the White House this year as a vast enrichment campaign for the world's richest person.\nWarren's office released a report on Tuesday which said the billionaire CEO used his role as a \"special government employee\" to benefit himself and his businesses.\nThe report outlined 130 instances, which Warren said suggest that Musk and his businesses gained from his role in the Department of Government Efficiency.\nThe report says that some of the actions explicitly violated rules that prevent federal employees from participating in matters where they have a financial interest, the report said, though some of Musk's actions have simply broken norms for government employees.\n\"In many cases, Musk has violated norms at an astonishing pace, contributing to the Trump Administration actions that have benefitted his private interests while hurting the American public \u2014- scandalous behavior regardless of whether it subjects him to criminal prosecution,\" the report, which was published by Warren's office, said.\nDOGE has said that its mission is to make the government more efficient and transparent, with the goal of saving taxpayers' money by eliminating wasteful spending. It estimates to have saved the government $180 billion so far.\nHere are some of the ways Musk benefited from his work with DOGE, according to the report from Warren's office:\nGovernment contracts. Some of Musk's businesses obtained \"new lucrative contracts\" with federal agencies after President Donald Trump re-entered the White House. In some cases, Musk's companies are reportedly being considered for deals, or informal arrangements that would benefit Musk's firms over competitors.\nSome of Musk's family members, like his brother, Kimbal Musk, have also struck deals for their respective businesses after Musk assumed his role in DOGE.\nEnding regulatory actions. Before Trump entered the White House, Musk's companies faced over $2.3 billion in potential liabilities from pending regulatory actions. But many of those actions have since \"stalled or been dismissed,\" the report said, pointing to several closed investigations and dropped suits against Musk's companies this year.\nDOGE has also issued steep budget cuts at some agencies that oversee Musk's businesses, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nPolicy changes. Some agencies also issued policy changes in recent months that appeared to benefit Musk's firms.\nThe report outlined recent decisions from agencies like the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Securities and Exchange Commission that helped several projects across Musk's companies.\n- Special access to information. Musk had access to government meetings, classified info, and other data that could have potentially benefitted his companies, the report said.\n- Influence over government workers. Musk has selected key personnel and placed them in agencies that could benefit his companies. During his time in DOGE, several SpaceX workers, investors, and other representatives for the company were nominated for roles in the government.\nMusk has not filed his financial disclosure form detailing potential conflicts of interest for government employees.\n\"Elon Musk has done more to improve the lives of Americans and strengthen this country in just over 100 days than Sen. Warren has achieved in her over 10-year career. The Senator excels at producing toothless reports that waste paper and will be read by no one, even if paid to. The President's success through DOGE is undisputed, and his work will continue to yield historic results,\" Harrison Fields, a spokesperson for the White House, told Business Insider in a statement.\nSpaceX, Tesla, and xAI, which were among Musk's companies mentioned in the report, did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\nWarren has criticized Musk's conduct in the past, raising concerns in recent years about potential conflicts of interest as the CEO expanded his business empire. Last year she asked Trump to create conflict-of-interest rules for Musk, and said in a letter that Musk working in the White House without any rules was an \"invitation for corruption on a scale not seen in our lifetimes.\"\nMeanwhile, Musk has been critical of the GOP budget bill in recent days. He's described Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" as an abomination. He said the bill would add to the deficit and undermine the work DOGE has done.",

"Kamala Harris, the United States' first female vice president, made more history at the Democratic National Convention when she formally accepted the party's presidential nomination. But she came up short in her quest to become the nation’s first female president, losing the 2024 election to former President Donald Trump. Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. She announced her candidacy in July after President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid and endorsed her to succeed him. The party moved quickly to coalesce behind Harris following Biden's unprecedented exit. Harris became the first female vice president of the United States when she was sworn into office in 2021.",0

But she came up short in her quest to become the nation’s first female president, losing the 2024 election to former President Donald Trump.

"Kamala Harris, the United States' first female vice president, made more history at the Democratic National Convention when she formally accepted the party's presidential nomination. But she came up short in her quest to become the nation’s first female president, losing the 2024 election to former President Donald Trump. Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. She announced her candidacy in July after President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid and endorsed her to succeed him. The party moved quickly to coalesce behind Harris following Biden's unprecedented exit. Harris became the first female vice president of the United States when she was sworn into office in 2021.",0

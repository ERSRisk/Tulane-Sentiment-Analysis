Since then, House Bill 685 has remained stuck on the Senate calendar, dying on the vine, in the final days of the legislative session.\nAs she does when all House-passed bills first reach her chamber, Senate Secretary Yolanda Dixon announced the bill and its title on May 20. But Dixon, following instructions from Senate President Cameron Henry, then announced that HB685 was being returned to the calendar.\nAnd it has sat there since then, unheard.\nIn an interview, Henry, R-Metairie, said he\u2019s been trying to decide which committee to refer the bill to.\n\u201cI\u2019m still working through that,\u201d Henry said Thursday, declining to say more.\nThe legislative session ends at 6 p.m. Thursday.\nHenry\u2019s handling of HB685 stands out because he has had Dixon refer virtually all other House-passed bills to one Senate committee or another, the next step in the legislative process.\nSen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, said the House debate left bruised feelings that senators have been reluctant to revisit.\n\u201cEveryone in the building observed the painful debate that took place on the House floor,\u201d Boudreaux said. \u201cIt did not go unnoticed. I am confident that the Senate will continue to preserve the integrity of the institution that I have been blessed to be part of for the last 10 years.\u201d\nThe bill by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, prohibits state agencies from maintaining or initiating DEI programs, employing people to perform functions related to DEI or requiring any applicants or employees to provide a statement regarding DEI.\nHer bill also prohibits \u201cany preferential treatment based on race, color, ethnicity, sex, national origin, gender identity, or sexual orientation in making decisions at public postsecondary education institutions on admissions, state-supported financial aid, scholarships, or other services or benefits.\u201d\nChenevert said when she presented HB685 that it followed up on an anti-DEI executive order last year by Gov. Jeff Landry and had the governor\u2019s support. She said it was needed to ensure that Louisiana universities do not run afoul of the Trump Administration\u2019s crackdown on DEI programs.\n\u201cThis bill makes sure we are in line with First Amendment rights and academic freedom of speech,\u201d Chenevert told her colleagues.\nBlack legislators did not buy that argument.\nIn an extraordinary move, some two dozen Black and two White Democrats walked to the front of the chamber and lined up in solidarity besides each member speaking against the bill.\nRep. Denise Marcelle, D-Baton Rouge, called the bill \u201cdivisive.\u201d\nRep. Wilford Carter, D-Lake Charles, said DEI programs exist to give opportunities to those who might be left behind without a helping hand.\nRep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, said bills like this one created an unhealthy racial climate that could have made LSU President William Tate, who is Black, want to take over the top spot at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\nOn Thursday, Chenevert reiterated what she told House colleagues: that her bill would have ensured that DEI courses could not be mandated for graduation and colleges and universities \u201cwhile also protecting the rights of every person \u2013 no matter their race, nationality or background as it pertains to state agencies.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, there was a lot of misinformation surrounding the bill,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if the governor wants to bring it back next session.\u201d", "Source": "The Advocate", "Keyword": ["executive order", "dei", "executive order", "rutgers university", "rutgers university"], "Entities": ["Louisiana", "House of Representatives", "House", "Senate", "House", "Senate", "Yolanda Dixon", "Dixon", "Senate", "Cameron Henry", "HB685", "Henry", "Henry", "Henry\u2019s", "HB685", "Dixon", "House", "Senate", "Gerald Boudreaux", "House", "House", "Boudreaux", "Senate", "Emily Chenevert", "DEI", "DEI", "DEI", "Chenevert", "HB685", "Jeff Landry", "Louisiana", "the Trump Administration\u2019s", "DEI", "First Amendment", "Chenevert", "solidarity", "Denise Marcelle", "D-Baton Rouge", "Wilford Carter", "DEI", "Edmond Jordan", "D-Baton Rouge", "LSU", "William Tate", "Rutgers University", "New Jersey", "Chenevert", "House", "DEI"]}, {"Title": "Louisiana LIGO scientists fear Trump administration's proposed cuts: 'So much science would be lost'", "Link": "https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/louisiana-ligo-scientists-proposed-trump-budget/article_0d8e0238-745b-4b62-b51e-cd644d764958.html", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 13:30:00 -0500", "Summary": "Scientists believe if the Trump administration's proposed budget is approved, a Louisiana space observatory could be on the chopping block and see its scientific mission crippled.", "Content": "Scientists believe if the Trump administration's proposed budget is approved, a Louisiana space observatory could be on the chopping block and see its scientific mission crippled.\nThe Trump administration announced on May 30 a proposed federal budget request for 2026 that would cut $5.2 billion, or 57%, of the National Science Foundation's $9 billion annual budget.\nThe proposal could lead to the shutdown of the NSF-funded observatory tucked away in the Livingston Parish piney woods, which made international headlines in 2015 when it detected gravitation waves from black holes more than a billion light years away.\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is one of two in the United States. Its counterpart is LIGO Hanford in Washington state.\nUnder the proposed federal budget, only one LIGO observatory would operate with a reduced level of spending for LIGO technology development in the 2026 fiscal year, according to the budget proposal.\nLIGO Livingston Observatory Head Joseph Giaime said that if either observatory were to close, \"the amount of space we can see into is much diminished.\u201d\n\u201cWe run together. We use data together. We\u2019re able to dig more deeply into space together,\u201d he said.\nWhile it is unclear which LIGO observatory would have to shut down if the proposed budget were approved, scientists believe it would be harmful to both observatories either way.\nLIGO Executive Director David Reitze, who oversees both observatories and is based at the California Institute of Technology, said in an email that LIGO is preparing for a 39.6% budget reduction for LIGO and are working to understand what can keep operating.\nReitze said this type of budget cut would force LIGO to make \"very hard choices\" about picking programs to terminate. He also said LIGO is talking to NSF to understand the decision process behind potentially closing an observatory\n\"Honestly, shutting down either LIGO Livingston or LIGO Hanford would cripple our scientific mission,\" Reitze said. \"How can we even make a decision like that?\"\nPlans on hold\nLIGO had planned to temporarily shut down some parts of its Livingston facility over the next two years to install a number of technology improvements. The new technology would lead to more gravitational wave detections and increase the possibility of discovering new types of gravitational-wave sources. But the proposed budget cut could stall these plans.\n\"We'll have to put those upgrade plans on hold. So much science would be lost,\" he said.\nEach LIGO observatory employs approximately 50 people. The Livingston site also hosts graduate students and researchers, including LSU researchers, according to Reitze.\nThe NSF froze funding grants in January after a White House memo called for a pause in federal grant spending and then rescinded the memo. LIGO has since been under a hiring freeze, but did not reduce any staff at either observatory, said Whitney Clavin, a Caltech spokesperson, in March.\nLIGO has had significant ties to LSU for decades. The university even proposed Livingston as a location for the observatory. It is the only LIGO site close to a university, said LSU professor of physics and astronomy Gabriela Gonz\u00e1lez.\nGonz\u00e1lez, who was also the spokesperson for the international LIGO Scientific Collaboration during the 2015 breakthrough, said many scientists come to work at LSU because of LIGO.\nShe said if support for LIGO is eliminated or drastically reduced, observatory employees from Baton Rouge, Hammond and across the state would lose their jobs.\n\u201cIf NSF support for LIGO research is reduced \u2026 it would not let us attract graduate students and postdocs to LSU who later work for the technological workforce in Louisiana and the U.S.,\" she said. \"Our physics and astronomy department and others in the country saw a large increase in applications to graduate school citing LIGO as one the main factors\u201d\nThe gravitational waves discovery in 2015 confirmed a key prediction of Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity and kick-started a new era of astronomy. Since then, LIGO has observed hundreds more gravitational waves.\nAside from operating and improving the gravitational wave detector, the Livingston observatory's main goals are also to use LIGO data for science, and to carry out education and public outreach at the LIGO Science Education center. The observatory hosts school field trips and public tours on the first Saturday of every month.\n\u201cI personally worry about our ability to continue our education mission and do a good job as needed on our science mission \u2026 we\u2019re going to do the best we can,\u201d Giaime said.", "Source": "The Advocate", "Keyword": ["federal grant"], "Entities": ["Trump", "Louisiana", "Trump", "$5.2 billion", "the National Science Foundation's", "$9 billion", "NSF", "more than a billion light", "The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory", "LIGO", "the United States", "LIGO Hanford", "Washington", "LIGO", "LIGO", "LIGO", "Livingston Observatory", "Joseph Giaime", "LIGO", "LIGO", "David Reitze", "the California Institute of Technology", "LIGO", "LIGO", "Reitze", "LIGO", "LIGO", "NSF", "LIGO Livingston", "LIGO Hanford", "Reitze", "LIGO", "Livingston", "LIGO", "Livingston", "LSU", "Reitze", "NSF", "White House", "LIGO", "Whitney Clavin", "Caltech", "LIGO", "LSU", "Livingston", "LIGO", "LSU", "Gabriela Gonz\u00e1lez", "Gonz\u00e1lez", "LIGO Scientific Collaboration", "LSU", "LIGO", "LIGO", "Baton Rouge", "Hammond", "NSF", "LIGO", "LSU", "Louisiana", "U.S.", "LIGO", "Albert Einstein\u2019s", "LIGO", "Livingston", "LIGO", "the LIGO Science Education", "Giaime"]}, {"Title": "Inside the battle over prescription drug prices and pharmacies in the Louisiana Legislature", "Link": "https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/louisiana-senators-propose-new-model-for-prescription-drugs/article_a08fda23-9cb1-5c6e-9fd8-11f81d8b424b.html", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 09:00:00 -0500", "Summary": "Independent pharmacies gained the upper hand Wednesday against pharmacy benefit managers following a behind-the-scenes lobbying battle over what has been one of the biggest unsettled policy issues in the final days of the regular legislative session.", "Content": "Independent pharmacies gained the upper hand Wednesday against pharmacy benefit managers following a behind-the-scenes lobbying battle over what has been one of the biggest unsettled policy issues in the final days of the regular legislative session.\nThe outcome could affect everyone in Louisiana who buys prescription drugs, especially those who purchase specialty drugs that treat such maladies as diabetes, neuropathy and inattention or hyperactivity.\nPharmacy benefit managers are third-party companies that are supposed to negotiate lower drug prices by acting as middlemen between drug manufacturers, insurance companies and pharmacies. Critics say that pharmacy benefit managers pocket too much of the savings.\nA measure passed Wednesday by the Senate Insurance Committee, House Bill 264, favored independent pharmacies by prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from steering customers to pharmacies they own and by mandating that discounts negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers go to employers and consumers. HB264 also requires pharmacy benefit managers to report more details of their activities to government regulators to ensure that they are following the law.\n\u201cToday, the balance has shifted away from large corporations and their profits back to independent pharmacies and the consumers,\u201d Sen. Adam Bass, R-Bossier City, said in an interview following the insurance committee hearing.\nGov. Jeff Landry has sided with the independent pharmacies, saying when he opened the legislative session nearly two months ago that he favors \"reining in the PBMs who are driving the cost of prescriptions.\" Landry pitched his views to Republican senators Monday night in the Senate basement, according to senators.\nLobbyists for pharmacy benefit managers had lobbied against HB264 but accepted the changes as inevitable, legislative sources said, to try to head off Louisiana from following Arkansas and adopting more far-reaching legislation that would prohibit pharmacy benefit managers from also owning and operating pharmacies.\nLandry also supports that change, according to his staff.\nCVS, the biggest drugstore company that owns a pharmacy benefit manager, sued Arkansas a week ago to block the new law there from taking effect. CVS has 23 pharmacies in Arkansas but more than 100 in Louisiana.\nThe CEO of Caremark, CVS\u2019 pharmacy benefit manager, tried to sway legislators in Louisiana with phone calls, legislators said. The CEO of Optum Rx, another pharmacy benefit manager, came to Baton Rouge to personally lobby lawmakers.\nA state website shows that CVS has seven lobbyists working the halls of the State Capitol. They are working in alliance with lobbyists for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association.\n\u201cPBMs secure savings on prescription drugs for Louisiana employers and patients and provide employers with a wide range of choices to offer quality prescription drug coverage,\u201d said Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for the association. \u201cDrug companies set drug prices, and the prices are the problem.\u201d\nCVS declined to comment, saying the company is still digesting the last-minute changes to HB264.\nThe Louisiana Association of Independent Pharmacies and its allies have their own phalanx of lobbyists.\n\"PBMs shouldn\u2019t be allowed to say one thing and do another behind the scenes,\u201d said Randal Johnson, president of the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association. \u201cHB264 attempts to shine a light on rebate flows, bans hidden fees and ensures that what\u2019s paid and what\u2019s reimbursed can actually be traced and reviewed. That\u2019s good policy, and more importantly, it\u2019s pro-patient.\"\nThe heavy lobbying by both sides caught the attention of legislators.\n\u201cEvery lobbyist here is hired,\u201d said Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas. \u201cYou have CEOs from these companies flying in. There are meetings happening in every room of this building.\u201d\nPharmacy benefit managers became in vogue only in the past dozen years but have quickly faced questions for their activities.\nThe New York Times reported in a three-part series last year that pharmacy benefit managers operate in an opaque fashion and \u201care driving up drug costs for millions of people, employers and the government.\u201d\nThe Trump administration and Congress are moving to adopt less favorable rules for pharmacy benefit managers.\nWednesday\u2019s action is not the final word in the long-running battle in Louisiana between the independent pharmacies and their allies on one side and the pharmacy benefit managers on the other.\nThe full Senate still needs to approve HB264, and the House would need to agree to the changes made by the Senate before adjournment on June 12.\nIn the meantime, a separate House measure, House Bill 358 by Miller, could be amended to institute the change that CVS strongly opposes \u2014 a prohibition on pharmacy benefit managers from owning or operating pharmacies. House and Senate negotiators are scheduled to meet in the next several days to decide on the final shape of HB358.\n\u201cI support any legislation that will stop the anti-competitive practices that I think PBMs do,\u201d Miller said in an interview.\nRep. Mike Echols, R-Monroe, and the sponsor of HB264, also takes a skeptical view of the pharmacy benefit managers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting money into the hands of consumers, which should lower costs,\u201d he told the Senate Insurance Committee.\nDriving HB264 forward has been Bass, a 44-year-old Allstate agent who is the vice chair of the insurance committee.

Kirk Talbot, R-Harahan, the committee chair, deputized Bass to try to fashion a bill that could win legislative approval.\nBass said he concluded that pharmacy benefit managers were using their power to block some drugs from coming to market and that employers and consumers are not receiving enough of the discounts negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers with drug manufacturers.\nBass said he met with lobbyists from all sides and worked until midnight with legislative staff late on Monday and Tuesday night to confect the final language for changes in HB264.\nThe amendments were not shared with lobbyists and some lawmakers until just before Wednesday\u2019s meeting. Echols was quickly familiarizing himself with the changes to his bill just before he presented it Wednesday.\nOnce the hearing began, Bass explained the changes.

As local law enforcement struggles to manage the cyber crime they facilitate, recent legislation has been introduced that would force ATM\u2026", "Content": "When Danny Foret\u2019s computer froze one morning, a window flashed on the screen urging him to call Microsoft customer support. But after he dialed the number, Foret says, his minor headache turned disastrous.\nThe support agent informed him his computer had been hacked, giving someone access to his bank account: $9,000 had been spent at a child pornography site, with another $4,000 siphoned toward online gambling.\nPanic set in, Foret recalls, but the voice on the other line was reassuring, his instructions clear: Don\u2019t touch your computer, don\u2019t speak to anyone, and above all, act fast.\nShaken, Foret followed orders, withdrawing cash from his local bank. To prevent further theft, the caller said, the rest of the money needed a secure location: a Bitcoin ATM across the street at a Chevron. The 78-year-old Thibodaux native had spent a lifetime working oil fields for Texaco and says he'd never even heard of Bitcoin. Now he found himself scanning a QR code that allowed him to send money to an address recorded on something called a blockchain.\nIt wasn't until the next morning that he began to feel uneasy. By then, a third of his life savings was gone, fed in $100 bills through a machine.\n\u201cI was so upset that day I didn\u2019t think straight,\u201d Foret said. \u201cThey were polished, I guarantee it.\u201d\nThe use of crypto currencies \u2014 digital assets that operate on decentralized networks rather than regulated authorities \u2014 has exploded in recent years. So too have their physical counterparts.\nThousands of crypto ATMs are popping up at gas stations, pharmacies and vape shops across the country. The companies that own them claim the machines make it easier for the tech-unsavvy to invest in crypto. But many law enforcement officials argue that same convenience allows criminals to easily scam people and launder money.\n\u201cRight now, this is not a system that gives any confidence to law enforcement that it's being legitimately used,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said. \u201cThere are a lot of smarter things these companies could do to make it a legitimate enterprise.\u201d\nThe Federal Trade Commission reports that fraud losses at crypto ATMs increased tenfold between 2020 to 2023, with $66 million reported in the first six months of 2024. In Louisiana, as local law enforcement struggles to manage the new threat, legislation has been introduced recently that would force companies to help curtail criminals.\nCrime's new frontier\nAs the realization that he had been scammed dawned on Foret, he contacted Sgt. Gerard Lotz, who handles cyber fraud for the Lafourche Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office and is also a member of the Louisiana Cyber Crimes Division, a state-run program that collaborates with the U.S. Secret Service.\n\u201cThey needed someone to investigate crypto, I just happened to be standing in the hallway,\u201d said Lotz, who admits most of what he initially learned about Bitcoin came from 12-year-olds on YouTube. \u201cThey say I\u2019m the foremost expert in cryptocurrency in Lafourche Parish.\"\nLotz first noticed crypto ATMs appearing in his mostly rural parish over the summer of 2023. Since then, he has come across 30 or so of the machines in Lafourche. During the first 10 months of 2024, Lafourche residents reported losing $1.6 million to cryptocurrency scams, with $657,000 fed solely through ATMs.\n\u201cIf 2% of the population of Louisiana accounts for $1.6 million in cryptocurrency fraud, how much is it for the whole state of Louisiana?\u201d Lotz said.\nMany cases go unreported by both victims and law enforcement. When they are brought to light, resource-strapped police departments rarely pursue them since the investigations are unlikely to end in arrests, Lotz said.\n\u201cThe scam industry has evolved in the past years,\u201d said Paul Sibenik, founder and CEO of Crypto Forensic Investigators, a private firm many people turn to when their losses exceed six figures.\nWhile 90% of his cases involve scammers operating from overseas \u2014 often calling from countries like Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos \u2014 Sibenik says the schemes are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The groups behind them are larger, more organized and frequently linked to transnational enterprises such as Chinese crime syndicates, or, in the case of North Korea, state-sponsored schemes.\nMany scammers are often victims themselves, Lotz said. According to a United Nations Report, an estimated 220,000 people have been trafficked into Southeast Asia for the sole purpose of conning people, forced to call around the clock from industrial-scale compounds. Globally, The Economist reports that up to 1.5 million people \u2014 both coerced and voluntary \u2014 are involved in the industry.\nDespite his devastating loss, Foret expressed some sympathy for many caught up in the business.\n\u201cI guess they almost have to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s rough.\u201d\nTricky tactics\nLotz and Sibenik said getting people to the ATMs is made easier by personal information posted on the dark web by criminal hacker groups. Fraudsters pose as customer service representatives from banks or tech companies, develop business or romantic relationships, or impersonate local and federal government agents to convince victims they owe bogus fines and fees \u2014 such as alleged Social Security overpayments or outstanding warrants.\nIn three incidents in Lafourche, scammers targeted newer gas station employees, posing as their bosses and convincing them to transfer cash from their office\u2019s safe into the ATMs, said Lotz. Others in the parish were victims of a nationwide scheme run by a prison gang in Georgia, where cellmates introduced themselves as local law enforcement.\n\u201cOne represented themselves as our chief deputy, one as the detective captain,\u201d Lotz said.\nThe main giveaway, he said, was that they called it \u201cLafourche County.\u201d\nAfter cash is converted to Bitcoin \u2014 or any of the thousands of other cryptocurrencies \u2014 the funds are typically sent to an online wallet controlled by the scammer. By the time victims realize they have been defrauded, thieves have usually already used \u201cmixing services\u201d \u2014 tools that combine stolen cryptocurrency with funds from other sources and distribute it across multiple accounts to obscure the origins of the scammed money.\n\u201cIt's like starting a race 50 laps into the race,\u201d Lotz said.\nIn rare cases where investigators identify a wallet address, blockchain technology \u2014 a public ledger recording all cryptocurrency transactions \u2014 enables them to trace funds between accounts.\n\u201cThe problem is, you don\u2019t know who is tied to that Bitcoin,\u201d Lotz said. \u201cI can\u2019t give a search warrant to Bitcoin because it doesn\u2019t exist; it\u2019s a concept.\u201d\nSo investigators monitor transactions but usually can\u2019t do much until funds end up in an online exchange. Analogous to traditional banks, exchanges are law enforcement\u2019s best chance to recover funds because they provide an opportunity to freeze assets. But that requires cooperation, and most criminals use exchanges based outside the U.S. in countries like the Bahamas or the Seychelles with weak regulations and minimal identification requirements.\n\u201cThat way if a warrant is served from another country or a law enforcement agency, they can say \u2018Hey I don't have any info on this person,\u2019\u201d he added.\nEven if the exchange provides personal information, Lotz says, law enforcement sometimes has to wait days for search warrants to be processed by a judge, by which point the scammer has usually offloaded the funds back into cash. Private companies like Sibenik's face similar restraints once they locate stolen money.\n\u201cIn order to recover funds that are frozen, pretty much every exchange wants a law enforcement request,\u201d Sibenik added. \u201cThis crypto can be very fast, and the legal system does not move fast.\u201d\nLawmakers respond\nCrypto ATM companies say they facilitate access to digital currency. Most machines charge between 15% and 30% in transaction fees. By comparison, major online exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken charge 0.1% to 0.4% and allow users to convert cash to crypto from home.\n\u201cIt begs the question why anybody would put cash into a machine like this when they could do it a different way.\u201d Attorney General Murrill said.\nIn February, Athena Bitcoin, a major Bitcoin ATM provider, was sued in Maryland for allegedly enabling elder financial abuse. The lawsuit claims the company allowed exploitation by failing to implement adequate safeguards.\nBitcoin Depot, the largest Bitcoin ATM network in the world, received $5,418 from Foret\u2019s transactions in February. Lotz says it has refused to return the money, despite law enforcement requests. In an email response to The Advocate, a representative for the company said Bitcoin Depot was unable to comment on the story.\n\u201cThe most vulnerable people are being affected by the machines, and these companies are taking 30%.\u201d Lotz said.\nReacting to the local cases, Lafourche Sheriff Craig Webre called the Attorney General's Office to raise the alarm. The conversation prompted the introduction of House Bill 483 during this spring\u2019s state legislative session.\nSponsored by Rep. Mark Wright, the bill would place new restrictions on crypto ATM use, including a $3,000 daily transaction limit, a mandatory 72-hour waiting period before transactions are processed, and a warning on each machine stating that \u201cno state or government official will ever request that cash be deposited into a Crypto ATM.\u201d\nMurrill said the three-day transaction hold is intended to give law enforcement a window to recover funds in cases of suspected fraud, citing incidents where Lafourche sheriff\u2019s deputies were able to seize cash from an ATM moments before it was collected by an armored truck.\nThe $3,000 daily cap also aims to deter money laundering, as current machines allow unlimited cash deposits \u2014 activity that if large enough would automatically raise red flags from the IRS in traditional banking systems.\nMurrill says the bill wouldn't interfere much with the broader crypto industry.

The legislation now goes to the governor\u2019s desk for signature.\nLandry hopes to have a contract for the new voting system finalized by the end of 2025 and begin a \u201cphased-in implementation\u201d of the new system in 2026, said Secretary of State spokesperson Joel Watson.\nThe new bidding process\nUnder legislation passed in 2021, the Secretary of State must first certify that any voting machines to be considered in the procurement process comply with standards set out in state law. Bidding can then begin after certification.\nUnder the invitation to negotiate procedure in HB 577, the state invites vendors to submit competitive sealed responses as a starting point for negotiations. It is then empowered to select which vendors it wants to continue negotiations with.\nIn contrast, with a standard request for proposal, the state first defines detailed parameters of the product or service it needs and then solicits bids to meet those specs.\nBill sponsor Rep. Daryl Deshotel, R-Marksville, said invitation to negotiate gives the secretary of state the chance \u201cto discuss with vendors their ability to provide needed and expected services,\u201d and it gives the state more bargaining power in negotiations before making an award.\nDeshotel told lawmakers on the Senate committee the concept is designed for large IT procurement. He sponsored legislation last year that added the new bidding process to the list of procurement methods authorized under state law.\n\u201cInvitation to negotiation is a public bid process,\u201d Landry said. \u201cIt\u2019s just more flexible \u2026 It allows you to exchange more information than an RFP does.\u201d\nThe legislation also sets out an expedited timeline for any legal contest or appeal that arises related to the eventual voting system contract award.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford for that litigation to take years,\u201d Nancy Landry told lawmakers last month.\nVoting system controversies\nPrevious efforts to replace the voting system have stumbled at multiple junctures in the face of bid-rigging allegations.\nAnd, in 2021 amid false claims of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election, state lawmakers added additional requirements to Louisiana\u2019s voting system procurement effort.\nThose included the creation of a Voting System Commission and a Voting System Proposal Evaluation Committee, the latter of which is required to \u201cinvestigate and publicly test the voting systems\u201d that are part of the bidding process and recommend a selection to the secretary of state.\n\u201cThis bill does nothing to remove public input or transparency in the procurement process,\u201d Landry said of this year\u2019s House Bill 577.\nDeslatte said PAR recognizes the challenges Landry faces in light of previous litigation over voting system contracts, and the organization plans to monitor the current effort.\n\u201cThis contract is gonna be worth a lot of money,\u201d she said, adding that any replacement voting system is \u201ccrucial to making sure election functions in this state.\u201d\nSen.

They also say the changes will more strongly protect the free speech rights of people who spend money to express political views.\n\u201cCampaign finance law should be clear to prevent the wasting of constitutionally protected free speech dollars,\u201d said Stephen Gel\u00e9, an attorney who has been involved in writing the bill. \u201cComplaints of violation of campaign finance law should be handled judiciously and fairly, protecting the right of due process guaranteed by the United States and Louisiana Constitutions as well as protecting taxpayer dollars.\u201d\nGel\u00e9 also represents Gov. Jeff Landry in an ongoing ethics dispute.\nHouse Bill 693, sponsored by Rep. Mark Wright, R-Covington, advanced out of the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday without objection. To pass the Legislature, the measure still needs a vote by the full Senate, as well as a final stamp of approval from the House.\nDuring a public hearing last month, the Public Affairs Research Council, a good-government watchdog group, raised concerns about the impact of the legislation on campaign finance laws.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single thing here that I can find that makes it more transparent to the public,\u201d said Steven Procopio, president of PAR. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s all about trying to make things easier for the elected officials.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, after the Senate committee made some change to the bill, Procopio said his concerns about transparency remain, but amendments related to investigations of campaign finance violations avoid legislation that is \u201cexistentially bad.\u201d\nProcopio also said he was grateful that lawmakers heeded some of the concerns raised by the Public Affairs Research Council.\nPolitical spending and free speech\nSince 1980, the stated purpose of Louisiana\u2019s Campaign Finance Disclosure Act has been to allow for the public disclosure of political fundraising and spending, in recognition of the fact that representative government depends on a knowledgeable electorate that has confidence in its public elected officials.\nBut under HB 693, the law would also acknowledge that \u201cthe financing of campaigns facilitates constitutionally protected political speech.\u201d\nAdding the recognition that campaign spending is protected speech is needed so that any legal interpretations of campaign finance laws don\u2019t violate the Louisiana and U.S. Constitutions, Gel\u00e9 said.\nThe bill would also require that the state\u2019s campaign finance rules be interpreted \u201cnarrowly and strictly\u201d in the interest of respecting free speech and due process rights.\nAnd any ambiguity in campaign finance issues should be \u201cinterpreted in favor of a person accused of violating\u201d the laws, the bill says.\nNew rules for political committees\nThe proposed law would define four separate types of political committees, each with their own rules and disclosure requirements:\n- Political committees would be set up to spend money to support or oppose candidates, propositions, political parties or recalls.\n- Principal campaign committees would be set up as the sole campaign committee of a candidate.\n- Independent expenditure-only committees would be set up for political advocacy work that is not coordinated with a candidate.\n- Leadership committees would be set up by elected officials \u2014 separate from their campaign committees \u2014 to support their holding of public office and to contribute to other officials\u2019 committees.\nA concept called a \u201cjoint fundraising agreement\u201d would be added to Louisiana law and authorize committees and other organizations to collaborate on political fundraising.\nContribution limits for political committees were increased under a 2024 law and would not increase further under this year\u2019s legislation.\nThe limits are $12,000 for major offices, $6,000 for district offices and $2,000 for smaller local offices.\nPolitical committees that have more than 250 members, however, can make contributions in the amounts of $24,000, $12,000 and $4,000.\nThere is no limit on contributions to independent expenditure-only committees.right\nNew rules for spending\nFor all candidates and committees, current law contains a broad prohibition against contributions being \u201cused, loaned, or pledged by any person for any personal use unrelated to a political campaign, the holding of a public office or party position.\u201d\nThe proposal defines new, more detailed parameters for the things candidates and committees can and cannot spend campaign money on.\nAll candidates and committees would be allowed to spend money on lobbying, issue advocacy, donations to tax-exempt organizations, committee operating expenses, contributions to gubernatorial transitions and independent-expenditure committees. They could also back efforts to support or oppose propositions, recalls or gubernatorial transitions.\nIn all cases, the measure would prohibit the use of contributions for the \u201cpersonal use\u201d of a candidate, elected official or immediate family member.\n\u201cPersonal use\u201d would be defined as spending money on something that would exist \u201cirrespective of the candidate's campaign or the holding of office\u201d and isn\u2019t connected to a campaign or holding of political office.\nThe bill sets out a list of items that would be presumed to be for personal use:\n- Household food items or supplies\n- Funeral expenses, unless they are for a campaign worker\n- Clothing that isn\u2019t used for campaign, fundraising or office-holding events\n- Tuition payments\n- Social, recreational and private club fees that aren\u2019t for a fundraising event or campaign or office-holding activities\nOn Wednesday, the Senate committee agreed to strengthen the language prohibiting campaign funds for personal use.\nSen. Greg Miller, R-Norco, a member of the committee, said it was important to guard against the use of campaign funds \u201cfor subsidizing your lifestyle.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we want to encourage that,\u201d he said.\nThe bill also sets out a list of items that would not be considered personal use:\n- Candidate and immediate family member attendance at political events including Washington Mardi Gras and conferences for political parties, professional groups or social advocacy groups.\n- Security measures for a candidate, elected official, family members or campaign workers, including security systems and personnel\n- Taxes on interest earned by campaign funds\n- Campaign loan interest\n- Costs to replace damaged, lost or stolen campaign items\nFor each of the four committee types, the legislation spells out additional spending rules.\nNew reporting requirements\nUnder the legislation, monetary thresholds that trigger a variety of campaign finance reporting requirements would increase.\nFor example, political committees would have to report contributions and expenditures when they reach $1,000, up from $500.\nSimilarly, committees that anticipate receiving or spending $1,000 a year would need to file a statement of organization, up from $500.\nReporting requirements for some out-of-state entities contributing to Louisiana elections would be triggered at $50,000 of spending, up from $20,000.\nAnyone who isn\u2019t a candidate or a committee would need to file disclosure reports for political spending for anything over $1,000, up from $500 currently. But unlike current law, disclosures would only be needed in specific cases of \u201cexpress advocacy.\u201d\nChanges to Board of Ethics investigations\nThe Louisiana Board of Ethics administers and enforces the state\u2019s Campaign Finance Disclosure Act, and it\u2019s responsible for investigating any possible violations of campaign finance disclosure rules.\nIn instances where the ethics board undertakes a campaign finance investigation, it would also need to meet a higher bar to issue any subpoenas, and more detailed procedures would govern the subpoenas process.\nAfter an investigation, the ethics board would need to have \u201cprobable cause\u201d to justify bringing formal charges against someone for campaign finance violations.\nIf the board found that a campaign finance violation did occur, before filing any formal charges against the person being investigated, the board would have to create a report of the investigation, provide that report to the person being investigated, and give that person a chance to respond.\nThese changes related to board investigations are similar to those in another bill that sets stricter rules for how the Board of Ethics investigates potential conflicts of interest, nepotism, and other ethics law violations.\nThe legislation, House Bill 674 sponsored by Rep.

Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge.\nFreiberg sought to have St. George absorb a greater share of an estimated $60 million in legacy costs, most of it connected with medical care of retirees. Now, the two sides have to start meeting within 60 days of the law taking effect to hash out a settlement of all assets and liabilities, including retiree health care costs.\nAlso the revised bill sunsets proposed cross-district enrollment, including in magnet schools; that enrollment ends when children finish at their current schools.

But Sen. Mike Fesi, R-Houma, said his Senate Bill 46 aims to protect \u201cthe people of Louisiana and the integrity of our environment.\u201d\n\u201cWith so many unknowns around geoengineering and atmospheric interventions, we\u2019re taking a stand for transparency, public health, and natural balance,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cSenate Bill 46 ensures that decisions about our air and climate are made responsibly.\u201d\nThe bill says that no person shall \u201cintentionally inject, release, apply, or disperse, by any means, a chemical, chemical compound, substance, or apparatus into the atmosphere within the borders of this state for the express purpose of affecting the temperature, weather, climate, or intensity of sunlight.\u201d\nIt also requires the Department of Environmental Quality to collect reports from anyone who believes they observe a weather modification activity.\nWhen SB46 first passed the Senate, support for the bill fell along party lines, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. In the House, some Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the bill, though it still passed by a margin of 58 to 33. The bill still needs Gov. Jeff Landry\u2019s signature to become law.\nWhat does solar geoengineering look like?\nThere are several types of weather modification, both theoretical and real. Few if any such activities are currently taking place in Louisiana.\nThe activity that is primarily associated with solar geoengineering \u2013 using aircraft to disperse aerosols like sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere in an effort to reflect sunlight and cool the planet \u2013 is not taking place anywhere in the world, according to Josh Horton, a senior program fellow in solar geoengineering at the Harvard Kennedy School.\nThat concept is known as stratospheric aerosol injection, he said, and it is the leading solar geoengineering proposal. So far, there have not been any real-world experiments of the theory, and it is not clear how safe it would be, he said.\n\u201cThere have been a couple of attempts to do very small-scale experiments that have been canceled for a number of reasons. It\u2019s very controversial,\u201d Horton said. \u201cRight now all the research based on stratospheric aerosols is desk-based \u2013 it\u2019s either using computer models or small-scale laboratory tests to see which kinds of particles would be most effective and most benign.\u201d\nThere is another type of solar geoengineering known as marine cloud brightening that has been experimented with in Australia over the Great Barrier Reef. It involves spraying seawater into low-lying clouds in hopes that they will whiten and reflect sunlight back into space, Horton said.\nThat\u2019s \u201cnot really what most folks who are pushing these (weather modification) bans in different states have in mind when they\u2019re concerned about geoengineering and claiming it\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking about these aircraft releasing megatons of sulfur or something else in the stratosphere that envelopes the planet, which of course is not happening but perhaps one day would, although we\u2019re nowhere close to that.\u201d\nCloud seeding\nOne type of weather modification that does occur in the United States is cloud seeding. It typically involves using aircraft to release silver iodide into clouds in an attempt to increase rainfall or snowfall.\nThe science behind cloud seeding, an activity that is seventy years old and mostly takes place out West, is uncertain, said Horton.\n\u201cThere continues to be debates among scientists about whether or not it\u2019s the least bit effective, but I think what there is agreement on is that it\u2019s not really harmful,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, nine states currently use cloud seeding.\n\u201cFederal cloud seeding involvement and support is minimal,\u201d the agency\u2019s website says.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration does not conduct weather modification activities but requires companies that do to report such activity. Of over 1,000 project reports dating back to 2000 in the NOAA\u2019s database, none specified Louisiana as a location. One did mention the Gulf, but the vast majority were in states like California, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Idaho and North Dakota.\nDebate veers into \u2018chemtrails\u2019\nThough SB46 does not mention the conspiracy theory known as \u2018chemtrails,\u2019 debate on the House floor veered into the topic when Rep.

(Photo by Otto Kitsinger/ Idaho Capital Sun)\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has rescinded guidance issued in July 2022 that emphasized hospitals are responsible for providing emergency abortion care despite state bans, saying it does not reflect the Trump administration\u2019s policy.\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is a federal law requiring hospitals that accept Medicare funding to provide stabilizing treatment to anyone who comes to an emergency room seeking care. After the Dobbs decision in June 2022 that allowed states to regulate abortion access and more than a dozen states implemented total abortion bans, the Health and Human Services Department under former Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration issued guidance reinforcing hospitals\u2019 obligations to patients under EMTALA, regardless of state policy. Abortion is a form of stabilizing care in certain situations, such as when a pregnant patient\u2019s water breaks prematurely and the fetus is not yet viable.\n\u201c(Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) will continue to enforce EMTALA, which protects all individuals who present to a hospital emergency department seeking examination or treatment, including for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy,\u201d the Tuesday announcement said. \u201cCMS will work to rectify any perceived legal confusion and instability created by the former administration\u2019s actions.\u201d\nThe statement did not elaborate further on what that will mean in cases where the EMTALA mandate conflicts with state abortion bans. In court, Idaho\u2019s attorneys arguing on behalf of the state have said EMTALA never requires an abortion to be performed as part of stabilizing care \u2014 an argument also made by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito when the court heard Idaho\u2019s case last year. The justices sent the case back to the circuit court for further consideration, but the Trump administration dropped the Biden-era lawsuit against Idaho in early March.\nConfusion over maternal care medication plagues politics in Louisiana and beyond\nAbortion-rights advocacy organizations said the move sends a clear message that the administration is siding with anti-abortion foes.\n\u201cStripping away federal guidance affirming what the law requires will put lives at risk,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, in a statement. \u201cTo be clear: this action doesn\u2019t change hospitals\u2019 legal obligations, but it does add to the fear, confusion, and dangerous delays patients and providers have faced since the fall of Roe v. Wade.\u201d\nDoctors in places like Idaho, where the Biden administration sued over the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban as it relates to EMTALA, have said the ban is what created confusion. Court injunctions have been in place off and on through litigation over the past three years, and when it wasn\u2019t in place for a four-month period in 2024, staff at the state\u2019s largest hospital airlifted six patients to other states because there was uncertainty about whether they could be prosecuted under the state law. Patients can also file complaints under the EMTALA law, and if the hospital is found to be in violation, it could lose its status and funding as a Medicare provider.\nSt. Luke\u2019s, the state\u2019s largest hospital system, filed a new lawsuit as the plaintiff in January, anticipating that the Trump Department of Justice would drop it. The federal judge in that case issued a new injunction protecting St. Luke\u2019s doctors from prosecution under the state ban, but other Idaho doctors outside of that health system are not protected by it.\nThe federal health agency also rescinded a letter written by Biden\u2019s former HHS secretary, Xavier Becerra, that told U.S. health care providers the federal statute protected their clinical judgment and the actions they take to provide stabilizing treatment, regardless of the state where they practice.\nThere have been several lawsuits over EMTALA since 2022 besides in Idaho, including one in Tennessee filed in January by the Catholic Medical Association that specifically challenged the July 2022 guidance. The Association said the Biden-era memo and accompanying letter were issued without conducting proper administrative procedure, and alleged that it violated the religious freedom of doctors.\nOn Tuesday, when DHHS rescinded the guidance, the Association dropped the lawsuit.\nRegina Davis Moss, president and CEO of a reproductive health and sexuality advocacy organization called In Our Own Voice, is a former HHS employee and longtime advocate for better reproductive health outcomes for Black women and girls and nonbinary people. Moss said Black women are already two to three times more likely to die during pregnancy than white women, and this policy change on EMTALA will only serve to make those statistics worse.\n\u201cWe\u2019re changing the whole scope and spirit of why we had to have EMTALA in the first place,\u201d Moss said. \u201cIt\u2019s leading to delays in care, and it\u2019s putting pregnant people\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

One of these complexities patients now have to navigate is a growing industry of insurance middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), whose practices meddling in our local health system increase health care costs and block access to critical medications.\nPBMs work between health insurance companies and drug manufacturers to negotiate lower drug prices for the health plans they represent. Their function and influence in the health care industry have evolved significantly, and today, PBMs operate with very little oversight or transparency and their decisions are often based on what is most profitable for a health plan rather than what is best for a patient.\nPBMs wield significant influence over what treatments patients can access and how much they will be required to pay. These middlemen receive significant rebates and discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers for the cost of medications and treatments after negotiations, but they don\u2019t pass those savings on to patients receiving the care, increasing what patients are required to pay out of pocket when they pick up their medication at the pharmacy counter.\nPBMs can also require only certain drugs be covered by a health plan, impose arbitrary rules around access to provider-prescribed medications, and PBM revenue is often directly linked to the list price of a medicine, so PBMs are incentivized to recommend treatments that would yield the most profit.\nThe three largest PBMs \u2013 CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx \u2013 manage nearly 80% of prescription drug claims for 270 million people across the country. To make matters worse, PBMs are increasingly integrating and consolidating with other health care services, including distributors and pharmacies, making the influence PBMs hold over the health care system even larger. As these for-profit entities merge and collaborate, it\u2019s unclear if the system is actually functioning in the best interest of patients regarding quality and cost of care.\nPBMs have flown under the radar for far too long, but scrutiny of these middlemen and their impact on our health care system has rightfully grown in recent years, with many federal and state policymakers and regulators calling attention to the outsized role PBMs play in driving up health care costs. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that PBM integration with chain pharmacies and insurers has allowed them to dominate the broader health system and that PBMs have significant control over what drugs are available to patients and how much they are required to pay.\nThe FTC even filed suit against the three of the nation\u2019s largest PBMs, citing their anticompetitive tactics as a barrier to health care access. In addition, numerous investigations found that PBMs often act in their own financial interest, including pushing patients toward drugs with higher out-of-pocket costs because it\u2019s more profitable for the PBM.\nAccess to consistent treatments is necessary for Louisiana patients, particularly those living with chronic health conditions or hard-to-treat illnesses such as cancer. Each year, more than 25,000 Louisianans receive a new cancer diagnosis. Alleviating access and financial barriers to care is a necessary step to improving health outcomes for patients.\nIt is overwhelmingly clear that we must take action to reform PBM practices to improve access to care for patients and stop letting middlemen meddle in our health system. There has never been a time when we can do more for patients as doctors, but at the same time, there has never been a time when we have more complexities in the health care systems impede healthcare access and affordability. This \u201cprofit over patients\u201d business model is putting critical care out of reach for many Louisiana patients. Time is overdue to curb harmful PBM practices.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Julie O\u2019Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)\nThe Louisiana Legislature is advancing legislation that would allow politicians to spend their campaign funds on a broader group of expenses, including country club memberships and gym fees, while providing less transparency about who provided the money.\nHouse Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Wright, R-Covington, is the sponsor of House Bill 693 and said several elected officials and campaign finance experts had input on the proposal.\nThe 101-page legislation makes \u201clittle to no change in substantive law\u201d and mostly brings \u201cpractices that have been followed for decades\u201d into the state code, Wright said at a Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee meeting Wednesday.\nLouisiana\u2019s Ethics Administration David Bordelon, who is in charge of enforcing the state\u2019s campaign finance laws, had a different take. While the legislation reinforces some of the state ethics board\u2019s guidance on campaign finance, it also \u201cundoes\u201d previous instruction the board has issued about political spending, he said at the same meeting.\nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry is the driving force behind this massive campaign finance rewrite. Two private attorneys for Landry, Stephen Gel\u00e9 and Charles Spies, helped draft the proposal.\nGel\u00e9 and Spies are representing the governor in charges he faces from the ethics board over failing to disclose trips he took on a political donor\u2019s private plane to Hawaii in 2021. That case isn\u2019t affected by Wright\u2019s legislation.\nGele said the bill is meant to correct over-enforcement of campaign finance laws. The ethics board\u2019s aggressive posture has impeded on the public\u2019s right to free speech and political expression, he said.\n\u201cThat right is burdened when you have to pay lawyers and accountants significant amounts of money to make sure you are complying with the law or to fight ethics complaints over the law,\u201d Gele told lawmakers in the committee hearing.\nLandry, as governor, stands to benefit more from the loosening of campaign finance restrictions than any other elected official in the state. He has more money in his campaign accounts, and his reelection campaign in 2027 will likely be the most expensive. YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nWright\u2019s legislation makes it easier for politicians to raise money and curbs existing public disclosure of that fundraising. It also explicitly permits politicians to spend their campaign cash on expenses the ethics board has been scrutinizing.\nSpending more freely\nAs one example, the bill would enshrine the right to spend campaign money on \u201cevents related to the Mardi Gras celebration in Washington D.C.,\u201d a five-day celebration that takes place every year in January. Lawmakers have complained in recent months that the ethics board was questioning their Washington Mardi Gras expenses. But who the board might be scrutinizing hasn\u2019t been disclosed publicly because its investigations are confidential.\nSenate committee members pushed back on other carve outs for campaign spending in the bill. On Wednesday, the committee removed a provision that would have allowed political funds to go toward paying parts of candidates\u2019 home mortgages and utility bills.\nThey also tweaked language in the bill permitting politicians to cover their country club dues, gym memberships and Louisiana Mardi Gras krewe fees with campaign funds. YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThe Senate committee replaced the words \u201ccountry club\u201d and \u201chealth club\u201d with \u201cprivate club\u201d in the legislation. They also added a clause requiring politicians who want to use their money for club memberships to produce \u201ca preponderance of evidence that the expense was not for personal use.\u201d\nThis means dues for country clubs, gyms and Mardi Gras krewes could still be covered with campaign cash, but the politician might be asked to justify the expense.\n\u201cBe very careful about using campaign funds for subsidizing your lifestyle,\u201d said Sen. Greg Miller, R-Norco, who offered the amendment at the committee meeting. \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to encourage that.\u201d\nLess disclosure on campaign spending\nWhile allowing candidates to spend more freely, the bill includes provisions that would lessen the amount of information available to the public about political donations and spending.\nWright\u2019s legislation raises the dollar-amount threshold at which a political donation or expense has to be included on a public campaign finance report more than 20 times.\nFor example, the current law requires campaign contributions and expenditures that are over $200 and given within 20 days ahead of an election to be reported on a public campaign finance report within 48 hours. The proposed law would increase that threshold to $5,000.\nIndividuals who are not political candidates or explicitly with a political committee could also spend money on an election without disclosing contributions they accepted for the politicking under the legislation.\nThese nontraditional political campaigns would also only have to disclose campaign spending if it was over $1,000 and included \u201cexpress advocacy.\u201d In the bill, \u201cexpress advocacy\u201d is defined as political communication that features phrases like \u201cvote for\u201d and \u201cdefeat\u201d or that includes the candidate\u2019s name and the office they are seeking.\nMore subtle campaign expenditures \u2013 those that don\u2019t mention an election or involve public advertising \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have to be disclosed by sources that aren\u2019t overtly political.\nInitially, this legislation also eliminated all campaign finance reporting requirements for ballot proposition campaigns, such as state constitutional amendments and tax millages. Wright backed off those changes when they proved unpopular.\nThe bill needs at least three more votes to pass, including from the full House and Senate. Those must be taken before the legislative session ends Thursday.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Jay Morris. R-West Monroe, is nearing final passage in the Louisiana Legislature, though voters will get the final say on a constitutional amendment on a ballot that could have significant consequences for how state government operates.\nMorris\u2019 proposal would give state lawmakers power that currently rests with the Civil Service Commission, a seven-member independent review panel that oversees the hiring and firing of 28,000 \u201cclassified\u201d state workers. The commission hears complaints from classified employees and appeals from any who want to contest their dismissal or demotion, affording them due process when it comes to discipline and terminations.\nIn an interview Tuesday, Morris said his bill would let lawmakers \u201cunclassify\u201d state employees, removing them from the oversight of the commission. An unclassified employee does not have Civil Service protections and can be fired \u201cat will\u201d for no reason. The bill\u2019s current version would also apply to local civil service workers such as municipal police and firefighters, but Morris said he intends to change his measure to exclude them and restrict it to only state employees.\n\u201cIf you believe in democracy or republicanism \u2014 [because] we\u2019re a republic \u2014 then the Legislature should have some ability to alter how our civil service system works,\u201d Morris said. \u201cRight now we can\u2019t do anything because the constitution prevents it.\u201d\nSome Democrats have taken issue with the latest iteration of the ballot language in Morris\u2019 bill because it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention classified employees and could mislead voters into thinking the amendment doesn\u2019t affect those state workers who are currently protected under Civil Service. When asked about the proposal following Tuesday\u2019s meeting of the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, Rep. Wilford Carter, D-Lake Charles, said the ballot language doesn\u2019t align with what\u2019s in the bill.\nThe ballot language states: \u201cDo you support an amendment to allow the legislature to remove or add officers, positions, and employees to the unclassified civil service?\u201d\nCritics have pointed to other issues that have not been addressed or debated in any of the committee hearings on Morris\u2019 proposal.\nOne of those is the vague use of the word \u201cremove,\u201d which could be interpreted to mean \u201cfire\u201d or \u201cterminate,\u201d said Peter Robins-Brown, who opposes the bill on behalf of Louisiana Progress, which advocates for low and middle-income people. He said lawmakers have not drafted any kind of companion measure that would establish statutes or regulations to implement the specific necessary changes.\n\u201cNo one has really been paying attention to the details,\u201d Robins-Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how the average voter will be able to figure it out, especially when the bill doesn\u2019t have a statutory companion to prove the goal of this exercise.\u201d\nGov. Landry fails to remove civil service protections from 900 state jobs\nRep. Nicholas Muscarello, R-Hammond, who chairs the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, said the intent of the amendment is to give lawmakers the power to unclassify state employees, not fire employees. Hiring and terminating decisions would be left up to the executive branch, he said.\nThe Civil Service Commission, a nonpartisan entity, has taken a neutral position on Morris\u2019 proposal. When asked about it Wednesday, commission administrators said they assume \u201cremove\u201d means the act of changing an employee\u2019s classification status, but they pointed out the word is not actually defined in the bill.\nState Civil Service Director Byron Decoteau said Morris\u2019 civil service amendment amendment, if adopted, could technically allow lawmakers to simply \u201cremove\u201d an unclassified job position with no intention of classifying it, leaving a current employee in a limbo with neither a classified nor unclassified status.\nSherri Gregoire, Civil Service general counsel, said the lack of a clear definition invites different interpretations, including that the amendment gives lawmakers the power to remove governor\u2019s staff members, and creates a situation that would certainly end up in court.\nThe more likely course of events, if voters decide to approve the amendment, would be that the legislature designates all future hires as unclassified employees \u2014 a move that would eventually end the classified civil service system altogether, Gregoire said. The Civil Service Commission, itself, would still exist under the constitution but would effectively become pointless because it would no longer have anything to oversee.\n\u201cEventually you won\u2019t have any classified employees, so why do you need a commission?\u201d Gregoire said.\nMorris said he doesn\u2019t yet have a vision for how lawmakers would exercise their new power if voters approve the amendment.\nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry has tried repeatedly to exert authority over the commission. In February, he tried unsuccessfully to revoke civil service classifications from 900 state jobs, mostly positions for engineers, shortly after President Donald Trump made a similar move at the federal level. The state Civil Service Commission rejected Landry\u2019s request in a 4-2 decision in February.\nBecause unclassified workers can be subject to political punishment and coercion, removing such a large number of engineers from the classified service could create ethical conflicts and unnecessary risks to the public, the commissioners said.\nA similar version of Morris\u2019 bill stalled on the House floor last year, but some Republicans who likely would have supported the bill were absent when the final vote took place.\nMorris\u2019 bill is expected to earn final passage before the regular session ends June 12 and will be placed before voters on the Nov. 3, 2026, statewide election ballot.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Accounting for births and deaths, the net population gain from immigration in those years was about 4.4 million, CBO said.\nAcross the country, state and local governments spent about $19.3 billion in goods and services for those immigrants, with costs concentrated on providing education and shelter, CBO estimated.\nThe $9.2 billion direct net cost amounts to 0.3% of state and local spending, CBO said.\n\u201cState and local governments saw both their tax revenues and their spending increase in 2023 as a result of the surge in immigration,\u201d the CBO report said. \u201cIn CBO\u2019s estimation, the increase in spending was greater than the increase in taxes.\u201d\nIn an alternative calculation, CBO estimated that when accounting for indirect effects \u2014 for example, increases in property taxes and economic activity, greater demand for government services \u2014 the surge led to a spending increase of $28.6 billion and increased revenue of $18.8 billion for state and local governments, netting a loss of roughly $9.8 billion.\nMore than half of newly arrived immigrants resided in six states: California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas.\nCBO estimated that in 2023, about 550,000 children in public schools, or 1.1% of students, were immigrants who\u2019d arrived since 2021.\n\u201cIn CBO\u2019s estimation, the surge in immigration directly increased spending for public primary and secondary education by $5.7 billion, or 0.7 percent, in 2023,\u201d according to the report.\nThose higher costs were \u201cdue to lower English proficiency among the surge population.\u201d\n\u201cBecause recent immigrants are often English-language learners, they tend to need additional instructional and support services,\u201d according to the report. \u201cCBO estimates that those services cost state and local governments $1.2 billion in 2023.\u201d\nAnother high cost was shelter services, CBO found. Four states \u2014 New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Colorado \u2014 \u201cspent a total of $3.3 billion to provide shelter and related services, including food and legal support, to the surge population in 2023,\u201d according to the report.\nIn 2021, the Biden administration dealt with the highest levels of migration at the southern border in 20 years. In an effort to ease the increase at the U.S.-Mexico border, several programs were created to allow migrants to obtain work permits or enter the country while their asylum cases were pending before immigration court.\nA nonpartisan New York think tank that studies domestic and international migration, the Center for Migration Studies, released a report that found the population of people in the United States without permanent legal status increased to by 2 million to 12.2 million by 2023, using the most recent Census Bureau American Community Survey data.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus pledged Thursday to make more visits to immigration detention centers across the country to carry out oversight of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown.\nThe members detailed their visits to various detention centers over last week\u2019s recess. Many people they visited in those centers were arrested while attending their court hearings or had no criminal record, they said.\n\u201cWhat we and our colleagues witnessed was the system being used to punish people simply for being an immigrant, and we all know that cruelty is the point with this president,\u201d said New York Democratic Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez.\nContinued oversight of immigration detention centers will only become more important, members of the all-Democrat caucus said, if congressional Republicans succeed in passing a massive tax and spending bill that would increase immigration enforcement funding by billions, including for detention centers.\nRepublicans are moving ahead with a legislative procedure known as reconciliation to fulfill President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities without needing 60 votes in the U.S. Senate.\nThe vow to continue with oversight at detention centers comes after three congressional Democrats said they were accosted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials at a New Jersey detention center last month. That incident ended with the Newark Mayor Ras Baraka arrested, and Rep. LaMonica McIver facing federal charges. The charges against Baraka were dismissed about two weeks later.\n\u201cWe will not succumb to any intimidation tactics,\u201d CHC Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York said. \u201cWe will continue to comply with our duty to have oversight of these detention centers, and we will visit them within the parameters of the law.\u201d\nMembers of Congress are allowed to conduct oversight visits at any Department of Homeland Security facility that detains immigrants, without prior notice, under provisions of an appropriations law.\nCollateral arrests\nWashington state Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, slammed the Trump administration\u2019s expansion of government contracts with private prison companies to detain migrants.\n\u201cIt is critically important that we members of Congress continue to investigate what are supposed to be civil detention centers, but instead operate as private for-profit prisons with substandard medical care and they make billions of dollars \u2026 in contracts from this administration detaining people of all legal statuses,\u201d Jayapal said.\nThe detention center in New Jersey reopened this year and ICE awarded GEO Group Inc. with a $1 billion contract to run the facility.\nJayapal said when she conducted an oversight visit at the Tacoma, Washington, Northwest ICE Processing Center, which was formerly known as the Northwest Detention Center, over the recess, some of the people being detained were caught up in immigration enforcement raids targeting other people. Such immigration arrests are known as collateral arrests.\nShe said one woman she spoke to who was detained had been in the country for more than 20 years, but did not have a permanent legal status.\n\u201cShe was swept up in a raid at the workplace, and she was detained less than a week before she was going to get married to a U.S. citizen,\u201d Jayapal said.\nShe said another person she talked to was a man who had been in the U.S. for 31 years and is a permanent legal resident.\n\u201cThese are not the so-called worst of the worst that Trump kept saying he was going to go after,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cThese are simply people who love this country, who have been in this country for decades, who are married to U.S. citizens and have U.S. citizen children, and do not understand why the country they love would be doing this to them.\u201d\nDemocratic Rep. Lou Correa of California, said that he\u2019s come across immigrants in detention centers who were arrested while attending their court hearings.\n\u201cThese individuals are following the law, showing up \u2026 to court hearings, and they\u2019re having their removal cases dismissed,\u201d he said. \u201cImmediately as they walk out of that courtroom, they are rearrested and put into what is called an expedited removal process \u2026 to quickly get them out of the country.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)\nOver the past few months, Celina Damian\u2019s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: \u201cWhat kind of loan is this?\u201d \u201cAm I in default?\u201d \u201cWill the government really take my wages?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes they just don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d said Damian, California\u2019s student loan servicing ombudsperson.\n\u201cI\u2019m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to \u2014 I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,\u201d she said.\nThe federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.\nThe U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.\nFederal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.\nMore than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million \u2014 about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio \u2014 are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.\nStates can\u2019t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants \u2014 actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.\nWhen borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.\nA borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.\nDamian\u2019s office, established under California\u2019s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, \u201cStudent Loan 101\u201d workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.\nRoughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,\u201d Damian told Stateline. \u201cThese borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.\u201d\nStudent loans became a key issue during last year\u2019s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.\nBut President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.\nThese borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.\n\u2013 Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson\nSome conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.\nWinston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans \u2014 calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower\u2019s income.\nOther borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.\n\u201cThere was an expectation to repay,\u201d Berkman-Breen said. \u201cBut there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.\u201d\nStates now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.\nNineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.\n\u2018Can\u2019t wait for Washington\u2019\nConnecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt \u201ca drag on the economy,\u201d and said states can\u2019t afford to wait for Congress \u2014 mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness \u2014 to find common ground.\n\u201c[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,\u201d she told Stateline. \u201cThat hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can\u2019t wait for Washington to figure it out.\u201d\nLast year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.\nKavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.\n\u201cThese were people who were already paying,\u201d Kavros DeGraw said. \u201cIt just made sense. I think it\u2019s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.\u201d\nLawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.\nSeveral states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.\nRepayment\nStudent loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican\u2010controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.\nMississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% \u2014 meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That\u2019s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nBy contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.\nExperts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.\nStates also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.\n\u201cStates can regulate and enforce, but they can\u2019t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,\u201d said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. \u201cThey\u2019re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.\u201d\nA November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.\n\u201cThe repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,\u201d Zampini said.\nThe Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn\u2019t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.\nIn California, a major part of Damian\u2019s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.\nMeanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years \u2014 raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.\nThe bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.\n\u2018Incentive to hike prices\u2019\nAndrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition \u2014 namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.\n\u201cThe link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,\u201d Gillen said in an interview. \u201cIf we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges\u2019 incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.\u201d\nEven without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people defaulting. We don\u2019t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,\u201d Zampini said.\nStateline reporter Robbie Sequeira can be reached at [email protected].\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis report was first published by Stateline, part of the States Newsroom nonprofit news network.

(Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump late Wednesday ordered the White House legal counsel and U.S. attorney general to investigate when Biden administration staff used an autopen to sign the former president\u2019s name on official documents, alleging that Biden might not have known or approved of their actions.\nThe inquiry represents an escalation in Trump\u2019s animosity toward and legal action against former President Joe Biden, who vehemently denies the allegations that he didn\u2019t know what executive orders or pardons were signed during his term.\nTrump has repeatedly suggested that Biden wasn\u2019t fully cognizant during the end of his administration. Similar concerns were reported on by dozens of news organizations following Biden\u2019s answers and behavior during a debate in June 2024.\nBiden\u2019s apparent confusion during some of the debate raised alarm bells among fellow Democrats and eventually led him to withdraw from his reelection campaign, later endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\nTrump\u2019s memorandum alleges \u201cBiden\u2019s aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden\u2019s cognitive decline and assert Article II authority.\n\u201cThis conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden\u2019s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\u201d\nThe memo stated that if Biden staff used an autopen, a mechanical device that mimics a person\u2019s signature, \u201cto conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden\u2019s name.\u201d\nTrump said Thursday during an appearance in the Oval Office that he hadn\u2019t discovered any evidence that Biden aides violated the law.\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve uncovered the human mind,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was in a debate with the human mind and I didn\u2019t think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it\u2019s one of those things, one of those problems. We can\u2019t ever allow that to happen to our country.\u201d\nBiden released a written statement rejecting the claims Trump laid out in the memo, arguing the investigation \u201cis nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.\u201d\n\u201cLet me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cAny suggestion that I didn\u2019t is ridiculous and false.\u201d\nLast updated 11:35 a.m., Jun. 5, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Alex Brandon-Pool/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge in the District of Columbia on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to allow Venezuelan men removed under an 18th-century wartime law and sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador to have their cases heard in court, though he conceded the logistics of the order would be challenging to sort out.\nIn a 69-page order, Judge James Boasberg partially granted an injunction to require 137 Venezuelans be given due process. He ruled that they had no chance to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, or the accusation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang.\nThe Trump administration will have until June 11 to put forth a plan for the men removed under the wartime law and sent to the mega-prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, to be afforded their due process rights.\n\u201cThe Government has violated the CECOT Class\u2019s vested right to due process, an infringement that risks inflicting irreparable harm for which the public interest requires a remedy,\u201d Boasberg said. \u201cThe question \u2014 simply asked but not so simply answered \u2014 thus becomes what relief they must obtain for that violation.\u201d\nBoasberg said that the Trump administration \u201cplainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States \u2014 a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition.\u201d\nHe said that even if President Donald Trump lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act and if those subject to the proclamation are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, they must be given a chance to contest the charges.\n\u201cThis is the critical point \u2014there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government\u2019s say-so.\u201d\n\u201cDefendants instead spirited away planeloads of people before any such challenge could be made,\u201d Boasberg continued. \u201cAnd now, significant evidence has come to light indicating that many of those currently entombed in CECOT have no connection to the gang and thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.\u201d\nOrder doesn\u2019t require return\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, sought to require the Venezuelans be brought back to the U.S. from El Salvador to challenge their removals. But Boasberg rejected that argument.\nBoasberg determined that even though there is a financial agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador to detain the men, they are in the custody of the Salvadoran government.\n\u201cWhile it is a close question, the current record does not support Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that they are in the constructive custody of the United States,\u201d Boasberg said.\n\u201cEven crediting the public statements characterizing the arrangement as outsourcing the U.S. prison system and acknowledging the President\u2019s unofficial assertion of his power to request a release, such comments cannot overcome a sworn declaration from a knowledgeable government official attesting that the CECOT Class\u2019s ongoing detention is a question of Salvadoran law.\u201d\nDepartment of Justice attorneys have used the same reasoning in a separate case to resist the return of the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, despite a U.S. Supreme Court order to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the Maryland man\u2019s return to the U.S.\nACLU will be allowed to have input to determine how due process can be afforded to the men at CECOT, Boasberg wrote.\nWednesday\u2019s order is the latest in a months-long dispute between the Trump administration and Boasberg after three planes landed in El Salvador and roughly 300 men were sent to CECOT in mid-March, despite the judge\u2019s temporary restraining order against using the Alien Enemies Act.\nBoasberg found probable cause to hold Trump officials in contempt for violating his temporary restraining order that ordered the deportation planes carrying men removed under the Alien Enemies Act to be returned to the U.S. over concerns they did not receive due process.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Screenshot from committee livestream)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Linda McMahon took heat from Democrats on the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce on Wednesday over the Trump administration\u2019s initiatives to dramatically overhaul the federal role in education and eliminate the Education Department.\nLawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal 2026 budget request \u2014 which includes $12 billion in spending cuts \u2014 as well as efforts to dismantle the agency and threats to yank funds for schools that use race-conscious practices across aspects of student life.\nA department summary said the cut \u201creflects an agency that is responsibly winding down.\u201d\nChair Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican, praised McMahon\u2019s efforts.\n\u201cWe believe in reducing bureaucracy, trusting our educators, trusting our state and local leaders and trusting the innovators who are pushing against the barriers thrown up by the bureaucracy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd above all, we trust our parents \u2014 this is our vision, and thankfully, we finally have an administration in place that shares this vision.\u201d\nBut Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the panel, blasted the department\u2019s priorities, including the budget proposal, which he said \u201cwould make it more difficult for students to enroll in and afford a college education by proposing reductions in funding to need-based grants such as Pell and work study.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it is the students of this nation who will suffer under this budget proposal,\u201d the Virginia Democrat said. \u201cStudents from low-income families and students with disabilities, English learners, international students and students of color will face more hurdles accessing equal educational opportunity.\u201d\nThe budget calls for eliminating key programs administered by the Education Department for disadvantaged and low-income students, including Federal TRIO Programs and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, or GEAR UP.\nThe budget request also proposes a $60 million increase to expand the number of charter schools in the country and lowering nearly $1,700 from the maximum amount a student can receive annually through the Pell Grant \u2014 a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college.\nA federal judge in Massachusetts in May dealt the administration a major setback to its education agenda, ordering the agency to reinstate the more than 1,300 employees gutted during a reduction in force effort, blocking the department from carrying out Trump\u2019s order to close the department and barring the department from transferring the student loan portfolio and special education services to other federal agencies while the case challenging those policies is ongoing.\nA federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld the trial judge\u2019s order.\nDEI lesson plans\nDemocrats on Wednesday took aim at the administration\u2019s efforts against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs. The administration had sought to bar schools from using DEI practices across aspects of student life to continue to receive federal funding, an effort that multiple federal judges have blocked.\nRep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania said the Trump administration \u201chas undoubtedly revived the culture of racism we haven\u2019t seen since the Jim Crow era,\u201d adding that \u201cthey\u2019ve made it clear that open attacks on Black and brown and other marginalized communities is not just tolerated, but it\u2019s encouraged.\u201d\nAsked by Lee whether a lesson plan on the Tulsa race massacre would be considered \u201cillegal DEI,\u201d McMahon replied: \u201cI\u2019d have to get back to you on that.\u201d\nLee then asked McMahon whether she knew what the Tulsa race massacre was, to which the secretary said: \u201cI\u2019d like to look into it more and get back to you on it.\u201d\nMcMahon was similarly noncommittal on a question about assigning school desegregation icon Ruby Bridges\u2019 autobiography.\nState flexibility\nThe budget proposal also calls for consolidating 18 grant programs for K-12 education and replacing them with a single formula grant program, which the administration says will give states spending flexibility.\nDemocrats at Wednesday\u2019s hearing blasted the administration\u2019s push to return education \u201cback to the states,\u201d noting that some states have poor records on education.\nRep. Yassamin Ansari said the education system is \u201cabsolutely failing\u201d many students in the United States. The main cause of that, the Arizona Democrat said, was that many states have \u201cwoefully underfunded\u201d their public education systems and not, as the administration has claimed, due to \u201ctoo much\u201d federal oversight or DEI policies.\nWhen asked by Ansari what risk McMahon weighed for public schools and universities if federal education funding is gutted or devolved to the states, the secretary said \u201cfederal education wouldn\u2019t necessarily be gutted\u201d and that \u201cthere would be more money to go to the states without the bureaucracy of the Department of Education.\u201d\nAnsari rejected that claim, noting that some states, including hers, have an \u201cabysmal track record of managing education.\u201d She pointed to Arizona\u2019s low rankings on public education, teacher salaries, test scores and the highest student-to-teacher ratio in the country.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Jeff Landry has established a new government efficiency task force to look at ways to cut state government spending. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)\nLouisiana lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a set of dramatic changes to state ethics laws Wednesday that will make it much more difficult to charge elected officials and public employees with misconduct.\nHouse Bill 674 alters the process the state ethics board used to bring charges against Gov. Jeff Landry two years ago that are still pending.\nLandry\u2019s charges won\u2019t be affected by the legislation, but he pushed for the bill and is expected to let it pass into law. The governor\u2019s personal attorney, Stephen Gel\u00e9, helped craft the language contained in it.\nBeyond making it harder to bring ethics charges, the legislation also loosens limits on elected officials\u2019 and state employees\u2019 state travel, weakens restrictions on government contracts with public servants and their families, and reduces requirements for elected officials and political candidates\u2019 disclosure of financial interests.\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, said it is a reaction to the ethics board\u2019s overzealous enforcement that has frustrated officials in both parties. The anger toward the board was reflected in lawmakers\u2019 overwhelming support of the bill.\nThe Louisiana Senate and House voted 34-2 and 92-1, respectively, for the ethics overhaul this week.\nThe votes came after ethics board members expressed concerns about the bill during their May meeting. Its top staff member, Ethics Administrator David Bordelon, described it as \u201cskewing\u201d the ethics investigation process in favor of the person accused of wrongdoing.\nThe state\u2019s preeminent government watchdog group, the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR), also vociferously opposed the legislation.\n\u201cThis is designed to make sure we don\u2019t have ethics investigations,\u201d PAR President Steven Procopio told lawmakers at a hearing last week.\nThe changes to the ethics board\u2019s enforcement mechanisms affects a wide range of public servants, lobbyists and government contractors. The incoming laws will apply to every elected officer and public employee in state and local government \u2013 from a local librarian to the governor.\nThe bill becomes law in about three weeks or whenever the governor signs it, whichever comes first.\nNew barriers to enforcement\nOnce enacted, the legislation will create a loophole in the law that might allow any public official, government contractor or lobbyist to block ethics investigations by requesting an advisory opinion on their potential misconduct from the ethics board.\nThe bill prohibits the ethics board from bringing charges based on information that a person includes in their advisory opinion request, which could allow someone to protect themselves against charges by submitting such a document. If the board suspects there was ethical misconduct based on the advisory opinion request, it won\u2019t be able to act on it anymore.\nThe board will also have to reach a higher standard to refer a matter for investigation. It will have to find \u201cprobable cause,\u201d a legal standard that requires the board to have established it is likely a violation has occurred without the investigation being conducted, said Kathleen Allen, the state\u2019s former ethics administrator who retired in December after 16 years.\n\u201cAlso, it could open the Board up to litigation challenging its decision to refer a matter to investigation,\u201d wrote Allen in a text Wednesday.\nThe ethics board will have far less time to investigate and decide whether to bring charges in cases. Under current law, the board has a year to act once an investigation is launched. The legislation would add several more steps to that process by allowing the subject of the complaint to object and respond to accusations more often during the board\u2019s deliberations.\n\u201cThey are lopping off a couple of months, minimum,\u201d ethics board member Alfred \u201cButch\u201d Speer, an appointee of former Gov. John Bel Edwards, said at a May meeting.\n\u201cIf [the persons being investigated] drag their feet long enough, then we run out of time,\u201d he added.\nGovernor\u2019s influence\nOnce the bill becomes law, the governor will also have significantly more influence over whether charges are ever brought against someone.\nThe ethics board will now need to vote with a two-thirds majority multiple times in order for an investigation and charges against a person to go forward.\nFollowing changes Landry pushed last year, the governor now controls nine of the 15 votes on the board. This means investigations and charges can\u2019t proceed unless four of the governor\u2019s appointees vote multiple times in favor of them.\nPlane travel from political donors\nAnother portion of Beaullieu\u2019s legislation targets the issue that got Landry in trouble with the ethics board \u2013 private plane travel. It eases restrictions on legislators\u2019 travel for state business on private planes that political donors or outside organizations provide.\nLegislators were previously only allowed to accept flights on private planes for public speeches if they were traveling within the United States or Canada. Once the new law takes effect, they will be able to accept private plane travel for government business anywhere in North America or the U.S. territories, including locations in the Caribbean, as long as they are making a public speech, participating in a panel discussion or making a media appearance.\nMore restrictions possible\nLawmakers are also close to passing a second piece of legislation that would place even more limitations on ethics complaints.\nHouse Bill 160 by Rep, Kellee Hennessy Dickerson, R-Denham Springs, would require the identities of people who provide tips to the ethics board to be revealed to the person accused of misconduct, Currently, the board keeps this information confidential.\nPeople who don\u2019t pay to produce a \u201csworn\u201d complaint \u2013 one made under legal oath attesting to the truthfulness of the allegations \u2013 would have to deliver their \u201cnon-sworn\u201d complaint to the ethics board staff in person at their office in downtown Baton Rouge, even if they live hundreds of miles away.\nDickerson also wants to limit materials the ethics board can use to launch an investigation and bring charges solely to complaints and reports state agencies or officials produce. Currently, the board also regularly pursues investigations based on media reports.\nDickerson said she is bringing the legislation based on her personal experience with the ethics board, which fined her $1,500 in 2023.\nPublic employees are prohibited from being paid for outside work by their agency. The ethics board concluded Dickerson, when she was a member of the Livingston Parish School Board, helped a teacher get paid tens of thousands of extra dollars from the high school where he was works for removing trees and doing some light construction work at the school.\nDickerson said she was only reported to the ethics board because she was in a contentious election for her state representative seat that year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very chilling process,\u201d she said at a legislative hearing Wednesday of the ethics board\u2019s deliberations. \u201cIt\u2019s a very derogatory process once the complaint has been made.\u201d\nDickerson\u2019s bill has already passed the House and only needs approval by the Senate and Landry to become law. The legislative session ends June 12.\nEthics matter\nIf this type of coverage is important to you, please consider a tax-deductible donation to the Illuminator.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Maryland federal judge overseeing the lawsuit concerning the wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia unsealed documents Wednesday that the Trump administration had asked to keep unavailable to the public under the so-called state secrets privilege.\nThe order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis unsealed three documents that she said did not contain any privileged information. Xinis questioned the Trump administration\u2019s broad use of the privilege during a hearing last month.\nThe request to unseal the documents came from a coalition of news organizations, arguing First Amendment rights and the public\u2019s right to information in a case that has become a flashpoint between the judiciary branch and the Trump administration.\n\u201cThe Press Movants rightly contend that, at common law, the public enjoys a presumptive right to access court records, overcome only when outweighed by competing interests,\u201d Xinis wrote Wednesday.\nPresident Donald Trump has said Abrego Garcia, who was removed in March due to an \u201cadministrative error,\u201d will not return to the U.S. and Department of Justice attorneys on behalf of the Trump administration have argued in court that the Maryland man is in the custody of El Salvador and the federal government has no authority to bring him back.\nIn a separate case of another wrongly deported immigrant to El Salvador, the Department of Justice submitted a document detailing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was personally working with the Salvadoran government to return a 20-year-old referred to in court documents as only \u201cCristian,\u201d after another federal judge ordered his return.\nDiscovery documents\nSome of the filings that were unsealed Wednesday had been public until the Trump administration moved to seal them.\nOne unsealed record related to an April discovery request Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys made to the government seeking information about how the administration was facilitating Abrego Garcia\u2019s return from El Salvador. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration must facilitate the Maryland man\u2019s return, but stopped short of requiring it.\nAnother document related to the Trump administration\u2019s request for more time in discovery proceedings.\n\u201cIt does not disclose any potentially privileged or otherwise sensitive information for which a compelling government interest outweighs the right to access,\u201d Xinis wrote.\nOne document was partially redacted, because it \u201cincludes some information potentially implicated by the state secrets privilege,\u201d Xinis wrote.\nThe document, signed by Abrego Garcia attorney Jonathan G. Cooper, objected to the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to pause discovery. The government had argued that complying with discovery in the lawsuit would hinder efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return.\n\u201cAs we explained to the government, in our meet-and-confer, we do not understand why the production of documents or interrogatory responses \u2014 none of which has occurred in the public eye \u2014 has any bearing on efforts to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s release and return,\u201d Cooper wrote in the partially redacted document unsealed Wednesday.\nA fourth document, a transcript from a late April hearing, will be released but redacted until the high-profile case is settled, Xinis wrote.\n\u201cAlthough the Court does not wholly agree with the Defendants\u2019 overbroad characterizations of the government interests at stake, the Court does recognize that certain information touches upon Defendants\u2019 asserted state secrets privilege as applied to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the State Department,\u201d she wrote about the partially redacted transcript.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

What happens now?\nLSU\u2019s Memorial Tower displays the time on Monday, March 20, 2023, on Tower Drive in Baton Rouge, La. (Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)\nAfter former LSU President William Tate abruptly departed campus for the same job at Rutgers University in New Jersey, political forces began jockeying to posture their preferred replacements to take the prized office.\nLSU\u2019s faculty will expect Tate\u2019s replacement to have an academic background, including the highest degree, a body of research and time as a faculty member. But politically-appointed university board members are mulling names without this pedigree, including those at the highest echelons of elected office in Louisiana.\nBefore the LSU Board of Supervisors can take action on a replacement, two questions must be settled: Will Tate, who served as both president of the LSU System and chancellor of the Baton Rouge campus, be replaced by one person or two? And what kind of search will the board undertake?\nEarlier this year, two board members confirmed to the Illuminator the possibility of splitting the president and chancellor roles is being discussed. The two positions were combined in 2012. The uncertainty could impact the pool of candidates, as some applicants might not want to take a job that could be split in two.\nThe effort to split the job is spearheaded by LSU Board Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, a Republican mega-donor from Lake Charles. He said the combined roles have not served the university well.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried it for over a decade, and I believe the results speak for themselves,\u201d Mallett said in an emailed statement. \u201cWhen a university is large, complex, and multifaceted, leadership must be distributed.\u201d\nLSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard, who was a member of the board in 2012 when the merger occurred, is generally opposed to splitting the roles again. He said in an interview he might consider dividing the jobs as \u201cthere may be a reason to,\u201d though he did not elaborate on what that reason would be.\nBallard said the board will soon announce a search committee, which he predicted would work over the next six months or so to conduct a nationwide search for Tate\u2019s replacement. Such a move could ease fears among some faculty who thought the board might choose and coronate a successor without their input.\nThough Tate\u2019s successor could very well be a top administrator at an out-of-state university, there are some in-state names circulating.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nMatt Lee\nMatt Lee, LSU\u2019s vice president for agriculture and dean of its College of Agriculture, currently serves as interim president while the search plays out. An academic with an aptitude for politics, he could be seen as the compromise candidate.\nLee got his Ph.D. from LSU before joining the faculty at Mississippi State for five years, after which he returned to LSU. In Baton Rouge, he earned the rank of full professor before making the jump to administration.\nLee\u2019s work as a sociologist has mostly focused on crime, and his publications have touched on Louisiana themes, including the aftermath of the BP-Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Hurricane Katrina.\nLee previously served as interim provost before Tate ultimately hired Roy Haggerty, who is also on his way out to take the same job at Oregon State University. Though being made vice president for agriculture might have been a consolation prize, the position better serves him if his goal is to replace Tate.\nLee has not responded to questions about whether he intends to apply for the job.\nLeading the LSU AgCenter, which has a presence in all 64 parishes \u2014 and by extension, every legislative district \u2014 means Lee has had the opportunity to form connections with lawmakers and other public officials.\nHis political clout, his academic pedigree and his general affability could make him the choice who would make the most people happy.\nWade Rousse\nWade Rousse has served as president of McNeese State in Lake Charles for just over a year. Before taking the job, he had worked several other administrative jobs at the school since 2019.\nRousse is the candidate favored by Mallett, who is a Lake Charles resident.\n\u201cDr. Rousse will stand on his own two feet,\u201d Mallett said. \u201cIf he chooses to enter this process, I am confident in his ability to rise to the top based on merit, leadership, and qualifications.\u201d\nIn an emailed comment, Rousse did not confirm or deny his interest in the position.\n\u201cWhile I am flattered that my name was mentioned as a candidate for its presidency, I remain laser-focused on building on our successes at McNeese State, where we have right-sized the university, stabilized our finances and reversed a 14-year enrollment decline,\u201d Rousse said.\nWhile Rousse has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Illinois Chicago and some experience as an adjunct professor, he does not have the typical academic background expected of the president of a major research institution. And with just one year of experience running a regional university \u2014 with very different goals than an institution that spends over $500 million annually on research \u2014- higher education observers question whether his administrative knowledge is enough to make up for his lack of academic experience.\nJulia Letlow\nU.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R-Start, is rumored to be the most-favored political candidate for the job.\nLetlow has represented Louisiana\u2019s 5th Congressional district since 2021. Her district was redrawn in 2024 to include LSU, where she held her re-election victory party last year.\nLetlow has a Ph.D. in communications from South Florida University and worked in administrative jobs at the University of Louisiana at Monroe before joining Congress. A finalist for the ULM presidency in 2020, she was passed over for Ronald Berry.\nIn remarks to students visiting her during Washington Mardi Gras earlier this year, Letlow described applying for the job as one of the most terrifying experiences of her life.\n\u201cIt was horrible and the faculty were terrible to me,\u201d Letlow said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get it, and that was so good \u2026 because it was preparing me for the next step.\u201d\nLetlow spokesman Matt Smith declined to comment for this story.\nLike McNeese, UL-Monroe is a regional non-research university. While Letlow might have the favor of the political class, the fact she was passed over for that job raises questions for faculty as to what makes her qualified to lead a much larger, much more research-focused institution.\nThat could change if the LSU board ends up splitting the two jobs. While faculty would be unlikely to back Letlow for chancellor, she wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to win their support to be successful as the system president, which is a much more political and administrative position.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nBill Cassidy\nU.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, is another rumored political pick for the job. He is currently in a fight for his political life in next year\u2019s election after voting to convict President Donald Trump for his actions in the attempted insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThough Cassidy might find an easy out \u2014 and a much higher paycheck \u2014 leading his alma mater, he said in an interview that he\u2019s focused on re-election.\nA two-time LSU graduate, Cassidy is a physician and was on its medical school faculty for many years before starting his political career.\nThe theory of Cassidy as a potential successor is predicated on the idea that getting Cassidy out of the U.S. Senate race would be a political boon for Trump-aligned conservatives who want to replace him with a more favorable Republican.\nThe desired political domino effect is not unprecedented in Louisiana higher education. Just last year, Gov. Jeff Landry threw his support behind state Supreme Court Justice Jimmy Genovese to become president of Northwestern State University. That allowed a Landry-backed candidate to run and win Genovese\u2019s seat on the high court.\nOther rumored names\nThough they were both finalists for the job in 2021, former Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and current Louisiana Tech President Jim Henderson are very unlikely to enter the fray again.\nWhile Dardenne is a Republican, his endorsement of former democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Landry foe, and a subsequent eight years of service as Edwards\u2019 budget chief, makes him a non-starter with the Landry-controlled LSU Board of Supervisors. If his political disadvantage wasn\u2019t enough, Dardenne\u2019s lack of an academic background also puts him at odds with faculty expectations.\nDardenne is a two time LSU graduate, earning his undergraduate in mass communications and a J.D. from the Law Center.\nThough he was passed over for the job previously, Dardenne, who was previously LSU student body president and a student member on the board of supervisors, has remained ubiquitous at LSU events, always dressed in purple and gold. That is unlikely to change.\nHenderson served as president of the University of Louisiana System from 2017-23 and has been president of Louisiana Tech since then. He laughed when contacted about the possibility of him succeeding Tate and said he was happy where he is.\nThough Henderson has experience running a research institution and plenty of political allies, his candidacy would come at the same time LSU is taking back control of the fiscally embattled University of New Orleans from the University of Louisiana System. That could prompt uncomfortable questions for Henderson about his knowledge of the crisis when he led the UL System.\nAnd though he has a doctor of management from the University of Maryland, Henderson is not an academic and has never held a faculty job. He was also handed the Tech job under unusual circumstances, without a search committee or faculty feedback. Both factors could impact his standing in the eyes of LSU faculty.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

GHF had opened three sites earlier in the week, and one of Thursday\u2019s sites was in a new location, it said.\nThe GHF, which has been fiercely criticized by humanitarian organizations including the United Nations for alleged lack of neutrality, began distributing aid last week. The U.N. has warned that most of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population is at risk of famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade of the enclave.\nMeanwhile, Israel announced it had recovered the bodies of two dual nationality Israeli-American hostages from Gaza. Gadi Hagi and his wife Judy Weinstein-Hagi were killed and taken to Gaza after Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Fifty-six hostages remain in captivity, with fewer than half believed to be alive.\nThe Israeli military has intensified operations in Gaza since breaking a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in March, taking more territory with the government pushing to wipe out the Islamist militant group.\nAt least 20 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Thursday, including four journalists in a hospital in the enclave\u2019s north, local health authorities said. The military said that it had targeted an Islamic Jihad militant who was operating a command-and-control center.\nThe Hamas-run government media office says that 225 journalists in Gaza have been killed since the war began.\nThe renewed military campaign has further isolated Israel amid mounting international pressure. On Wednesday, a U.S. veto blocked a U.N. Security Council draft resolution, backed by the 14 other members, demanding an \u201cimmediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire\u201d and full, unrestricted aid access to Gaza.\nUnder global pressure, Israel allowed limited U.N.-led aid deliveries to resume on May 19. A week later, the relatively unknown GHF launched a new aid distribution system that bypasses traditional relief agencies.\nThe GHF halted distributions on Wednesday and said it was pressing Israeli forces to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its operations after dozens of Palestinians were shot dead near the Rafah site over three consecutive days this week.\nWhat exactly occurred remains unclear, but the Israeli military said its soldiers fired warning shots in each incident. GHF has said that aid was safely handed out from its sites without any incident.\nThe American organization, which uses private U.S. security and logistics companies to transport aid to its distribution points inside Gaza from where it is collected, has said that it has so far distributed at least 7 million meals.\nThe U.N. and international humanitarian groups refuse to work with the GHF because they say aid distribution is essentially controlled by Israel\u2019s military and forces the displacement of Palestinians by limiting distribution points to a few venues in central and southern Gaza.\nNavigating the Gaza Strip is dangerous, with unexploded rockets and shells making it hard for many to reach aid handout sites. For Palestinians in north Gaza, cut off from distribution points in the south, even that remains out of reach.\nFootage released by the GHF this week showed hundreds of Palestinians crowding its site in Rafah, collecting aid from piles of stacked boxes without any clear system of distribution.\nMuslims around the world will begin celebrating Eid al Adha from Thursday, a holiday typically marked by slaughtering livestock, but in Gaza food is scarce after nearly two years of war and Israeli siege.\nIsraeli opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman accused the government on Thursday of arming Palestinian militias in Gaza.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said later in a statement that Israel was acting \u201cin various ways\u201d on the recommendation of the security establishment.\nNetanyahu\u2019s office did not deny Lieberman\u2019s accusation.\nIsraeli media reported that Israel had transferred weapons to Yasser Abu Shabab, a leader of a large clan in the Rafah area, now under full Israeli army control.\nAbu Shabab previously said that he was building up a force to secure aid deliveries into some parts of Gaza.\nHamas security officials told Reuters Abu Shabab was wanted for \u201ccollaborating with the occupation against his people\u201d. They said Hamas forces had killed at least two dozen of his men before January in what they said were clashes with looters of aid trucks.\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies. On Wednesday, a Palestinian transport company contracted by U.N. agencies suspended operations indefinitely after an armed gang intercepted its aid trucks in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza, killing one driver and injuring another.\nIsrael and the U.S. are urging the U.N. and governments to work through the GHF. But it is unclear who is funding the group, which this week named an evangelical Christian with ties to U.S. President Donald Trump as its executive chairman.\nThe war in Gaza has raged since Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel in the October2023 attack and took 251 hostages back to the enclave, according to Israeli tallies.\nIsrael responded with a military campaign that has killed over 54,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.", "Source": "NBC News", "Keyword": ["dei"], "Entities": ["U.S.", "Gaza", "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation", "Gaza", "GHF", "GHF", "the United Nations", "U.N.", "Gaza", "Israel", "Gaza", "Gadi Hagi", "Judy Weinstein-Hagi", "Gaza", "Hamas", "Gaza", "Hamas", "Gaza", "Islamic Jihad", "Hamas", "Gaza", "Israel", "U.S.", "U.N.

For many, the move seemed like a return to 2017 and one of the most controversial policies of Trump\u2019s first term.\nTrump cited national security and terrorism concerns Wednesday as motivating factors behind the ban on nationals largely from Africa and Asia, triggering reactions from representatives of those countries from weary diplomacy to downright anger.\nChad, a country in Central Africa that is among the countries hit with a travel ban, quickly issued a reciprocal restriction on issuing visas to U.S. citizens. \u201cChad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has its dignity and pride,\u201d President Idriss Deby wrote Thursday on Facebook.\nTrump's new order affects a patchwork of 19 countries \u2014 some of them banned for the first time, for reasons that the administration said include high rates of visa overstays, lack of \"appropriate screening and vetting measures\" and allegedly being sponsors of terrorism.\nNationals of 12 countries will be barred from entering the U.S.: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Partial bans have also been placed on nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\nAfter the Trump administration canceled a special visa program with Venezuela on Wednesday, the country's interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, described the U.S. government as \u201cfascist,\u201d adding that \u201cthey persecute our countrymen, our people, for no reason.\u201d\n\u201cThe truth is being in the United States is a big risk for anybody, not just for Venezuelans,\u201d he said during a weekly show on state television.\nMany on the list are majority-Muslim countries, and several began observing the Hajj pilgrimage holiday late Wednesday, making immediate responses less likely. Officials at U.S. embassies in Libya, Chad, Eritrea, Sudan and Turkmenistan were not available for comment.\nStill, Shawn VanDiver, president of the Afghan refugee advocacy group #AfghanEvac, referred to the ban as \u201cpolitical theater\u201d and \u201ca second Muslim Ban, dressed up in bureaucracy.\u201d\nTrump began a video address Wednesday by citing the recent violence in Boulder, Colorado, where an Egyptian man seeking asylum with an expired tourist visa injured at least 12 demonstrators in what city officials called an antisemitic attack, as justification for the renewed travel ban.\nEgypt is not on the list of banned countries, but its absence speaks to the importance of Egyptian influence both on American Middle East policy and in the region at large, said Ahmed Soliman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.\nTrump's order largely affects \u201cconflict-prone [countries], or ones which have security issues at this time, or don\u2019t have the diplomatic or security heft to respond very aggressively to this U.S. ban,\u201d Soliman said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing the U.S. going after its strategic partners in either the Middle East or Africa.\u201d\nThe White House's decision prompted a rebuke from the African Union Commission, which in a statement Thursday urged the U.S. to exercise its right to protect its borders \u201cin a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa.\u201d\n\u201cThe Commission remains concerned about the potential negative impact of such measures on ... relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades,\u201d it said.\nIt was a relatively tame statement from a body that represents countries already disproportionately affected by the Trump administration's decision to cut USAID programs.\nInternational aid groups have condemned the new ban, with Amnesty International on Thursday calling it \u201cdiscriminatory, racist, and downright cruel\u201d on X.\nSomalia, which had its American assistance slashed and U.S. military aid in training local forces to fight terrorist groups pulled, struck a similarly conciliatory tone.\n\u201cSomalia values its longstanding relationship with the United States and stands ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised,\u201d Dahir Hassan Abdi, the Somali ambassador to the U.S., said in a statement Wednesday.\nThe administration pointed to terrorism as a reason for banning travel from Somalia.\n\u201cThe United States Government has identified Somalia as a terrorist safe haven. Terrorists use regions of Somalia as safe havens from which they plan, facilitate, and conduct their operations,\u201d according to a statement released by the White House. \u201cThe Government of Somalia struggles to provide governance needed to limit terrorists\u2019 freedom of movement.\u201d\nAlex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan and independent public policy research organization, said terrorist attacks by nationals from the 12 countries facing outright bans are rare.\n\u201cA single terrorist from those countries murdered one person in an attack on U.S. soil: Emanuel Kidega Samson from Sudan, who committed an attack motivated by anti-white animus in 2017. The annual chance of being murdered by a terrorist from one of the banned countries from 1975 to the end of 2024 was about 1 in 13.9 billion per year,\u201d Nowrasteh wrote.\nTrump's order also pulls the rug from under nearly 200,000 Afghans who have relocated to the U.S. since America's chaotic and botched exit from the country in 2021. They include about 14,000 resettled refugees who arrived in the 12 months through September.\nTrump, who suspended refugee resettlement for Afghans on his first day in office, criticized Afghanistan's passport authority and its screening and vetting measures Wednesday.\nRepresentatives of the Afghan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cTo include Afghanistan \u2014 a nation whose people stood alongside American service members for 20 years \u2014 is a moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold,\u201d #AfghanEvac\u2019s VanDiver added.\nFor experts watching Trump\u2019s approach to the developing world since before he first took office in 2017, the move was less of a surprise.\nTrump has for years expressed a desire to limit immigration from Haiti and African nations, deriding them as \u201cshithole\u201d countries in discussing the visa lottery system at a White House meeting in 2018.\nThomas Gift, an associate professor of political science at the University College of London, called the president's latest move \u201cpart and parcel of an \u2018America First\u2019 foreign policy.\u201d\nThe travel plan and visa cancellations send \u201ca loud and clear message,\u201d said Gift, \u201cthat America isn\u2019t an open, pluralist nation that welcomes the world to its shores.\u201d\nCORRECTION (June 5, 2025, 1:17 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified a fellow at Chatham House who explained why Egypt was not on Trump\u2019s travel ban list.

Russia has said little about the attacks, although its Defense Ministry acknowledged in a statement that some planes caught fire.\nThe strikes have highlighted the increasing importance of drones for both Russia and Ukraine in the war, which entered its fourth year in February. And experts told NBC News that both sides are increasingly turning to cheap, commercially available first-person view or quadcopter drones that can often be purchased from online retailers and easily converted into deadly weapons \u2014 simple technology that is having a huge impact on the battlefield in Ukraine and farther afield.\nTheir use is \u201cgoing to become very, very common,\u201d Robert Lee, a senior fellow at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank, said in an interview.\nDrones were used when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime was overthrown in December, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re here ... because they\u2019re ubiquitous, because they are quite useful, and they\u2019re demonstrating that every day in Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re going to be used by all sorts of groups, whether it\u2019s criminal groups or terrorist groups, and they pose a quite significant threat,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI think we\u2019re a little bit behind the power curve on this and actually getting ready to counter them.\u201d\nTargeting civilians\nAnastasia Pavlenko, 23, said she noticed a drone \u201chunting\u201d her as she was riding her bicycle to a cosmetology appointment in Antonivka, a rural community in Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region.\n\u201cIt took off, followed me, and I zigzagged on the bike,\u201d Pavlenko, the mother of two, said of the attack in September, adding that a second drone suddenly appeared with \u201ca shell attached to it.\u201d\nDespite her best attempts to escape, she said, the second drone dropped the shell \u201cright on my head,\u201d and it bounced down onto her thigh and exploded on the asphalt next to her.\n\u201cBlood was coming from my neck, and there were fragments under my ribs,\u201d Pavlenko said, adding she somehow managed to keep cycling and take cover under a bridge, where she screamed for help until she started to lose consciousness.\n\u201cI just had a small purse, shorts, a T-shirt and long loose hair, so it was clear that I was a girl,\u201d she said, adding that she was not wearing military colors or carrying any weapons when she was hit.\nDoctors were unable to remove shrapnel fragments from her neck, ribs or leg, she said, adding she had been unable to return to work at her coffee shop because she \u201ccan\u2019t handle physical stress.\u201d\nRussia has repeatedly denied that it targets civilians in Ukraine. The Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about whether its forces or groups allied with them had used commercial drones to carry out strikes on nonmilitary targets in the Kherson region.\nBut drone video posted on a Russian military blogger\u2019s Telegram channel appears to show the attack on Pavlenko.\nNBC News was able to determine that the video was taken in late September and geolocate it to a specific section of a road in Antonivka where Pavlenko said everything went dark.\n\u2018Hunted from above\u2019\nThe strike on Pavlenko was one of at least 45 Russian attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine from June to December that Human Rights Watch has documented.\nBelkis Wille, an associate director in the nongovernmental organization\u2019s Crisis, Conflict and Arms Division, said it was the first time it had \u201cever documented the use of these commercial quadcopter drones used at wide scale in a precise campaign to target civilians.\u201d\nThe majority of the attacks were carried out with modified commercial drones manufactured by the Chinese companies DJI and Autel Robotics, according to a report co-authored by Wille and released Monday, called \u201cHunted from Above: Russia\u2019s Use of Drones to Attack Civilians in Kherson, Ukraine.\u201d\nLee, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, analyzed pictures of some of the drones posted to Telegram channels associated with bloggers affiliated with Russia\u2019s military.\nSome were \u201call homemade\u201d munitions, he said, adding that some of the parts, including a plastic tail, could be created with 3D printers. Another photo showed parts of a rocket-propelled grenade attached to a drone with duct tape, Lee said.\nBut despite their DIY appearance, he said, \u201cyou have a guided weapon that operates at significantly greater distances, and this can be operated at a very tactical level, in a very cheap way.\u201d\nBoth Autel Robotics and DJI have policies on their websites that explicitly prohibit using their drones in combat. Autel Robotics say all customers are required to sign a \u201ccompliance commitment letter\u201d and \u201cend-user statement\u201d to that effect. DJI says that, as part of its terms of use, users \u201cagree not to: attempt to \u2018hack,\u2019 \u2018crack,\u2019 reverse engineer or modify the product.\u201d\nBoth companies stopped direct sales in Russia when the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, and DJI says it stopped direct sales in Ukraine. Autel Robotics says it added geofencing restrictions \u201cto prevent the operation\u201d of Autel drones \u201cin Russia, Ukraine, and other embargoed regions.\u201d\nDJI did not respond to a question about geofencing capabilities of its drones.

It was part of a wider overnight assault that became the latest in a series of large-scale attacks targeting regions across Ukraine.\nKlitschko said search and rescue operations were underway at several locations.\nMultiple explosions were heard for hours in the capital, Kyiv, where falling debris set off fires across several districts as air defense systems attempted to intercept incoming targets, said Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Administration.\n\u201cOur air defense crews are doing everything possible.

Emergency services evacuated three people from the apartment, and rescue operations were ongoing. Another fire broke out in a metal warehouse.\nTkachenko said the metro tracks between two stations in Kyiv were damaged in the attack, but no fire or injuries occurred.\nMore than 2,000 households in Kyiv\u2019s eastern bank remained without electricity Friday following the overnight Russian attack, the Kyiv City Administration said.\nThe attack targeted at least six regions across Ukraine, leaving a trail of civilian injuries, damaged infrastructure and disrupted utilities.\nThe number of people injured in a Russian attack on the western city of Ternopil early Friday rose to 10, including five emergency workers, regional governor Viacheslav Nehoda said. The strike damaged industrial and infrastructure facilities, left parts of the city without electricity, and disrupted water supplies.\nThree people were injured in Ukraine\u2019s central Poltava region following a Russian attack there that damaged administrative buildings, warehouses and a cafe, regional head Volodymyr Kohut said. Fires caused by the strike have been extinguished, and debris also fell on a private home.\nRussian forces also struck the Khmelnytskyi region overnight, damaging a private residential building, outbuildings, a fence and several vehicles, regional governor Serhii Tiuryn said.\nMeanwhile, air defense forces shot down three Russian missiles over the western Lviv region overnight, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi said.\nIn northern Chernihiv region, a Shahed drone exploded near an apartment building, shattering windows and doors, according to regional military administration chief Dmytro Bryzhynskyi.

And you know why I think we\u2019re seeing progress? Because we are putting these measures in place, and we\u2019re saying we\u2019re putting teeth behind what we\u2019re looking at,\" McMahon said in an interview with NBC News at her office in Washington.\nStill, McMahon said Harvard still needs to do more to combat antisemitism on campus and vet international students.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we are making sure that the students who are coming in and being on these campuses aren\u2019t activists, that they\u2019re not causing these activities,\u201d the education secretary said.\n\u201cStudents should not come on campus and be afraid to be there and not feel safe to be on campus,\" McMahon added.\nThe secretary acknowledged that the universities have taken positive steps to combat what she said was growing antisemitism on campus, but credited Trump for pushing them to do so.\n\"I'm really happy to see what Harvard did, but I wonder if maybe they didn't get a little spur from our action, because they talk a lot about it, but I think we really started to see a lot of their actions once we were taking action,\" McMahon said.\nHer comments came after Trump on Wednesday signed a proclamation that aims to deny visas for foreign students seeking to study at Harvard. A federal judge in May blocked Trump from revoking Harvard\u2019s ability to enroll foreign students.\nAsked directly whether international students already enrolled at Harvard would have to leave the U.S. due to Trump's proclamation, McMahon demurred, saying, \"Well, that's actually more up to the State Department than it is to Department of Education,\" and reiterating that \"we have to do more careful vetting.\"\nShe echoed comments Trump made Thursday in the Oval Office, when he told reporters that he had no problem with Harvard enrolling foreign students, as long as their names were disclosed to the federal government.\n\"We want to have foreign students come. We\u2019re very honored by it, but we want to see their list,\" Trump said during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.\n\"Harvard didn\u2019t want to give us the list. They\u2019re going to be giving us the list now. I think they\u2019re starting to behave, actually, if you want to know the truth,\" the president added.\nThe Trump administration has also accused Harvard and Columbia of fomenting antisemitism on campus, with the federal government in April canceling $2 billion in grants to Harvard and in March canceling $400 million in grants to Columbia. Each grant cancellation came alongside a statement from the Trump administration\u2019s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism accusing the universities of not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.\nThe cancellation of Harvard\u2019s federal grants came after several members of the Trump administration wrote to Harvard\u2019s leadership with 10 demands that included a requirement to screen admissions of foreign students \u201cto prevent admitting students hostile to the American values and institutions inscribed in the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence, including students supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism.\u201d\nThe letter also included demands that Harvard audit their student body, faculty and staff for \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d to discontinue all diversity, equity and inclusion programs on campus and to root out what the Trump administration labeled as antisemitism in certain programs and schools on campus.\nOn Friday, McMahon defended the contents of the letter, saying that \"only 3 percent of [Harvard's] faculty were conservatives.\"\n\"Do you think that's a diversity of viewpoint on campus? Because those \u2014 you can't possibly believe that,\" she added. \"And I do think that that's one of the things that Harvard and Columbia and other universities are taking a serious look at, is, what is that balance?\"\nAsked directly what a diversity of viewpoints would practically look like on campus, McMahon called for \"balancing what the curriculum is going to be.\"\n\"I think Harvard and other universities need to do a better job in that,\" she added.\nThe Trump administration in recent months has also targeted individual students who it says are advocating for terrorism and antisemitism by participating in pro-Palestinian speech or protests.\nIn March, the administration drew national outrage after federal authorities arrested Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident and graduate student. A federal judge last month ruled that the effort to deport Khalil was likely unconstitutional.\nAnd in early May, Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk was freed from ICE custody after she had been detained by federal law enforcement agents in Massachusetts in March.\nMcMahon on Friday painted the international students facing arrest and detention as \u201cstudents at Columbia and Harvard en masse attacking other students, yelling hate crimes at those students, making them afraid to walk across their campus, and driving them even underground.\u201d\n\u201cI think the American public is looking at that, is saying, \u2018I want my kids to go to college and be safe. They shouldn\u2019t have to worry going from class. That\u2019s not why \u2014 that is not why I sent them to campus,\u2019\u201d the education secretary added.\nMcMahon also said that any foreign students arrested for violence or for antisemitism will have the chance to prove whether the detention is \u201cunjust.\u201d\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a false arrest made, and that person shows that, that that was an unjust [arrest] and that person is released, OK,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how many others are not being arrested because we don\u2019t have the proper vetting in place?\u201d\nMcMahon also spoke favorably about the Trump administration\u2019s decision earlier Friday to ask the Supreme Court to allow it to continue with mass layoff plans at the Department of Education after a federal judge blocked the move. The layoffs were part of a broader Trump plan to dismantle the department.\n\u201cThe president made it very clear to me, when he asked me to serve in this job, that he believed that I would be successful in my job once the Department of Education was dismantled, and that the agencies, other agencies, would continue the work of the Department of Education. So I have known what that mandate was from the very beginning,\u201d McMahon said.\nThe Department of Education, in its budget proposal this week, is also seeking to cut its funding to the department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights, which is tasked with investigating claims of discrimination, from $140 million to $91 million. There is currently a backlog of cases.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t missed any statutory deadlines and are performing our tasks because we\u2019re operating more efficiently,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cWe have streamlined that department.\u201d\nThis comes as the administration has also targeted efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the federal government and at elite universities and has targeted transgender students across the country.\nOn Friday, McMahon defended Trump's efforts to eliminate DEI programs on college campuses, saying that she favored merit-based admissions instead.\n\"What we found when we admit students through merit and meritocracy and, and their studies, that diversity comes on campuses by itself,\" McMahon said. \"You don't need to have a particular program that says we have to have diversity, equity, inclusion.\"\nMcMahon also said she agreed with the Trump administration's assertion that allowing transgender girls to participate in girls sports was a violation of the federal Title IX anti-discrimination law.\n\"What the president has said in his executive order [is] men are men and women are women, and so women should participate in women\u2019s sports and men should participate in men\u2019s sports. Otherwise it\u2019s not a level playing field,\" McMahon said, referring to athletes by their sex at birth.\nAsked directly whether she though the Trump administration's decision to sue Maine over federal funds was a proportional response to the issue of transgender girls participating in girls' sports, the education secretary simply said, \"To uphold the laws of the United States, we have to take action.\"", "Source": "NBC News", "Keyword": ["civil rights", "antisemitism", "federal grants", "federal grant", "discrimination", "education secretary", "executive order", "title ix", "dei", "federal authorities", "international students", "revoking", "executive order", "protests", "columbia university", "tufts university", "visa"], "Entities": ["Education", "Linda McMahon", "Donald Trump", "Harvard", "Columbia", "McMahon", "NBC News", "Washington", "McMahon", "Harvard", "McMahon", "Trump", "Harvard", "McMahon", "Trump", "Harvard", "Trump", "Harvard", "Harvard", "U.S.", "Trump", "McMahon", "the State Department", "Department of Education", "Trump", "the Oval Office", "Harvard", "Trump", "Friedrich Merz", "Harvard", "Trump", "Harvard", "Columbia", "$2 billion", "Harvard", "$400 million", "Columbia", "Trump", "Joint Task Force", "Harvard", "Trump", "Harvard", "the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence", "Harvard", "Trump", "McMahon", "Harvard", "Harvard", "Columbia", "McMahon", "Harvard", "Trump", "Columbia University", "Mahmoud Khalil", "U.S.", "Tufts University", "Rumeysa Ozturk", "Massachusetts", "McMahon", "Columbia", "Harvard", "McMahon", "McMahon", "Trump", "the Supreme Court", "the Department of Education", "Trump", "the Department of Education", "the Department of Education", "McMahon", "The Department of Education", "Office of Civil Rights", "$140 million to $91 million", "McMahon", "McMahon", "Trump", "DEI", "McMahon", "McMahon", "Trump", "Title IX", "McMahon", "Trump", "Maine", "the United States"]}, {"Title": "Trump and Elon Musk's Feud on Full Display as They Trade Insults", "Link": "https://www.today.com/video/donald-trump-and-elon-musk-lob-insults-in-escalating-public-feud-241038917822", "Published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 12:33:39 GMT", "Summary": "After months of appearing inseparable, President Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s relationship is imploding into a messy public spectacle with the two men trading attacks online over a variety of topics, including Trump\u2019s budget bill, Musk\u2019s White House departure and electric cars.

Variations of it have been around for centuries \u2014 Thomas Jefferson got one in 1803 that he used to make copies of his correspondence.\nThey\u2019re often used for mass reproductions of signatures on items like diplomas, and there are now digital versions.\nCan presidents use autopens for official actions?\nThey can, according to 2005 guidance from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel.\n\u201cThe President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law,\u201d the guidance said. \u201cRather, the President may sign a bill ... by directing a subordinate to affix the President\u2019s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.\u201d\nHave presidents used autopens for official acts?\nThey have. President George W. Bush \u2014 who had requested the guidance from the Justice Department \u2014 did not wind up using an autopen for official actions, but both Biden and President Barack Obama did while they were traveling.\nUSA Today reported in 2017 that Obama used an autopen to issue dozens of pardons the previous year while he was on vacation in Hawaii. Biden, meanwhile, signed a funding extension for federal aviation programs via autopen while he traveling to San Francisco in 2024, CNN reported at the time.\nHow often did Biden use an autopen?\nThat\u2019s unclear. There is no official record of Biden's using an autopen for official government business.\nTrump\u2019s memorandum says, \u201cThe vast majority of Biden\u2019s executive actions were signed using a mechanical signature pen, often called an autopen, as opposed to Biden\u2019s own hand.\u201d\nTrump has offered no evidence to support the claims.\nHas Trump used an autopen?\nHe has, but he maintains it wasn't for anything important.\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One in March, Trump at first said that \u201cI never use\u201d an autopen before he acknowledged that he had.\nOn Thursday, he said that \"I think it\u2019s very disrespectful to people when they get an autopen signature\" but that he does use one to respond to letters. \"I'd like to do it myself,\" he said, but he added that he gets thousands of letters a week and it's \"not possible to do.\"\nWhat did Trump order with his new memo?\nTrump's memo directs \"The Counsel to the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and the head of any other relevant executive department or agency (agency), shall investigate, to the extent permitted by law, whether certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden\u2019s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.\"\nIt also orders a probe into \"the circumstances surrounding Biden\u2019s supposed execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in office,\" including \"policy documents for which the autopen was used.\"\nAsked by NBC News whether he has any evidence that anything specific was signed without Biden\u2019s knowledge or that someone in the Biden administration acting illegally, Trump said, \u201cNo, but I\u2019ve uncovered, you know, the human mind.\u201d\n\u201cI was in a debate with the human mind, and I don't think he knew what the hell he was doing,\u201d he said Thursday, referring to his debate with Biden last year.\nDid Trump request a criminal probe?\nThe Justice Department declined to comment when it was asked whether the investigation into the autopen issue is a criminal one. The White House counsel's office does not conduct criminal probes.\nThe House Oversight Committee is also investigating Republican allegations about Biden\u2019s using the autopen.\n\u201cWho was making the decisions? Who was authorizing his signature? Was it him?\u201d committee chair James Comer, R-Ky., asked last month.\nHave the courts weighed in on autopens?\nThe Justice Department guidance from 2005 hasn\u2019t been directly challenged in court, but a ruling last year involving presidential pardon powers lent some weight to the finding.\nA unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said presidents don\u2019t have to issue written or signed pardons for them to be implemented.\n\u201cThe plain language of the Constitution imposes no such limit, broadly providing that the President \u2018shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\u2019 The constitutional text is thus silent as to any particular form the President\u2019s clemency act must take to be effective,\u201d the ruling said.\nWhat is the source of the allegations?\nWhile it's unclear how Trump came to seize on the allegations, right-wing media has focused on them for months, fueled in large part by a study from the conservative Heritage Foundation that accused the Biden administration of extensive autopen use, largely based on the timing of when Biden signed documents compared with when he was traveling.\nSome of the findings also came from an analysis of the signatures in the Federal Register. A National Archives spokesperson told the fact-checking website Snopes in March: \u201cAt the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President\u2019s signature to the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register.\u201d\nWhat is the objective of Trump's order?\nTrump's memorandum doesn\u2019t give any indication of what might result from the investigation.\nTrump has already revoked scores of Biden's executive actions \u2014 including about 80 on his first day in office \u2014 and he has suggested before that the use of an autopen could be used to challenge some of the pardons Biden issued.\n\u201cThe \u2018Pardons\u2019 that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to the pardons Biden gave to members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\nThere's no evidence that Biden wasn't aware of those pardons \u2014 he'd discussed the possibility he would sign off on them in a Jan. 8 interview with USA Today and later issued a lengthy statement explaining why he'd signed them.\nCan a president rescind a prior president's pardon?\nWhile the Constitution give the president unique powers to issue pardons, it makes no provision for subsequent presidents to rescind them.\nJeffrey Crouch, a politics professor at American University and author of the book \u201cThe Presidential Pardon Power,\u201d told NBC News in March that \u201cBiden\u2019s pardons are highly unlikely to be revoked somehow because of the apparent use of an autopen.\u201d\nWhat does Biden say about Trump's allegations?\nIn his statement Wednesday, Biden said, \u201cLet me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency.

But others say they will stay and fight.", "Content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As transgender service members face a deadline to leave the U.S. military, hundreds are taking the financial bonus to depart voluntarily. But others say they will stay and fight.\nFor many, it is a wrenching decision to end a career they love, and leave units they have led or worked with for years. And they are angry they are being forced out by the Trump administration's renewed ban on transgender troops.\nActive duty service members had until Friday to identify themselves and begin to leave the military voluntarily, while the National Guard and Reserve have until July 7. Then the military will begin involuntary separations.\nFriday's deadline comes during Pride Month and as the Trump administration targets diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying it's aiming to scrub the military of \"wokeness\" and reestablishing a \"warrior ethos.\"\n\"They're tired of the rollercoaster. They just want to go,\" said one transgender service member, who plans to retire. \"It's exhausting.\"\nFor others, it's a call to arms.\n\"I'm choosing to stay in and fight,\" a noncommissioned officer in the Air Force said. \"My service is based on merit, and I've earned that merit.\"\nThe troops, who mainly spoke on condition of anonymity because they fear reprisals, said being forced to decide is frustrating. They say it's a personal choice based on individual and family situations, including whether they would get an infusion of cash or possibly wind up owing the government money.\n\"I'm very disappointed,\" a transgender Marine said. \"I've outperformed, I have a spotless record. I'm at the top of every fitness report. I'm being pushed out while I know others are barely scraping by.\"\nSome transgender troops decide to leave based on finances\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said this is President Donald Trump's directive and what America voted for. The Pentagon, he said, is \"leaving wokeness & weakness behind\" and that includes \"no more dudes in dresses.\"\nSen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a veteran, and 22 other Democratic senators have written to Hegseth urging him to allow transgender troops to keep serving honorably.\nAlready, more than 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and are slated to begin leaving, according to rough Defense Department estimates. Defense officials say there are about 4,240 active duty transgender troops but acknowledge the numbers are fuzzy.\nFor many, the decision is financial.\nThose who voluntarily leave will get double the amount of separation pay they would normally receive and won't have to return bonuses or tuition costs. Those who refuse to go could be forced to repay reenlistment or other bonuses as high as $50,000.\nThat was the tipping point for Roni Ferrell, an Army specialist at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington.\nFerrell, 28, lives on base with her wife and two children and had planned to stay in the Army for at least another decade. But she said she felt \"backed into a corner\" to sign the voluntary separation agreement, fearing she would have to repay an $18,500 reenlistment bonus.\n\"My commander basically said it was my only option in order to make sure my kids are taken care of,\" Ferrell said.\nThe Marine, who has served for more than 25 years, said she had planned to stay and fight, but changed her mind. Lawyers, she said, told her an involuntary separation would put a code in her record saying she was forced to leave \"in the interests of national security.\"\nThat designation, she said, could mean those involuntarily separated could lose their security clearances, hurting future job prospects.\nIn a statement Friday, a defense official said the code \"is not intended\" to trigger clearance revocations and that gender dysphoria is not a security reporting requirement, according to the director of national intelligence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\nCynthia Cheng-Wun Weaver, senior director of litigation for Human Rights Campaign, said it's important for troops to talk with judge advocates general in their services to ensure they understand the different procedures being implemented.\nOther transgender troops plan to stay despite the ban\nThe Air Force service member and a transgender officer in the Army National Guard both said they plan to stay and fight. Lawsuits over the ban continue and could change or block the policy.\nFor troops involved in the court battles as plaintiffs, leaving voluntarily now would likely hurt their standing in the case. For others, it's simply dedication to their career.\n\"I've really embraced military culture, and it's embraced me,\" the Air Force member said. \"It's not about money. It's the career that I love.\"\nThe Guard soldier echoed that sentiment, saying he will stay on \"because it is important to me to serve. Frankly, I'm good at it, I'm well trained so I want to continue.\"\nOthers without bonuses to repay or who have been in the military only a short while and won't get much in separation bonus pay may opt to stay and see what happens.\nNational Guard troops face a particular problem\nNational Guard members who are heading to their monthly drill weekend or annual two-week drill in June could be required to go but serve as the gender they were assigned at birth.\nThat means they would have to wear uniforms and haircuts of that gender, use that bathroom and be referred to as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\" based on that gender.\nFor many, that could be close to impossible and create uncomfortable situations.\n\"If I were to show up to drill this weekend, I'd be expected to use all female facilities, I would be expected to wear a woman's uniform,\" said the Army Guard officer, who transitioned to male about five years ago and says others in his unit know him as a man. \"I don't look like a woman. I don't feel like a woman. It would be disruptive to good order and discipline for me to show up and to tell my soldiers, you have to call me 'ma'am' now.\"\nIt's not clear if Guard units are handling it all the same way, and it could be up to individual states or commanders. Some may allow troops to postpone the drill or go on administrative leave.\nWhat happens next for transgender troops?\nThe service members interviewed by The Associated Press said they don't know what will happen once the deadline passes to leave voluntarily.\nSome believe that unit commanders will quickly single people out and start involuntary separations. Others say the process is vague, may involve medical review boards and could take months.\nThe defense official said Friday that as the Pentagon takes these steps, it \"will treat our service members with dignity and respect.\"\nUnder Hegseth's directive, military commanders will be told to identify troops with gender dysphoria \u2014 when a person's biological sex does not match their gender identity \u2014 and send them to get medical checks to force them out of the service, defense officials have said. The order relies on routine annual health checks \u2014 so it could be months before that evaluation is scheduled.\n\"My real big sticking point is that this administration's whole push is to reform this country based around merit, and that gender, race, etc., should have no factor in hiring,\" the Air Force service member said. \"If that's true, I'm solely being removed for my gender, and merit is no longer a factor.\"", "Source": "NBC News", "Keyword": ["lawsuit"], "Entities": ["WASHINGTON", "U.S.", "Trump", "the National Guard and Reserve", "Pride Month", "Trump", "the Air Force", "Marine", "Defense", "Pete Hegseth", "Donald Trump", "America", "Pentagon", "Tammy Duckworth", "Illinois", "Hegseth", "Defense Department", "as high as $50,000", "Roni Ferrell", "Army", "Tacoma", "Washington", "Ferrell", "Army", "18,500", "Ferrell", "Marine", "Cynthia Cheng-Wun Weaver", "Human Rights Campaign", "The Air Force", "the Army National Guard", "Air Force", "National Guard", "National Guard", "Army Guard", "Guard", "The Associated Press", "Pentagon", "Hegseth", "Air Force"]}, {"Title": "Fear and anger ripple through countries targeted by Trump's travel ban", "Link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-travel-ban-sparks-confusion-affected-families-rcna211169", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:10:28 GMT", "Summary": "The travel ban goes into effect on Monday, leaving many to fear a future in which they can't visit family or loved ones are unable to escape dire circumstances in their home countries.", "Content": "Anger and condemnation broke out as families, attorneys and immigrant advocates absorbed the blast from the latest bombshell delivered by the Trump administration \u2014 a travel ban that stops or restricts people from 19 mostly African, Asian and Caribbean countries from entering the U.S.\nWhile the Trump administration said the travel ban is meant to keep Americans safe, critics lobbed accusations of discrimination, cruelty, racism, inhumanity and more in response. Meanwhile, the news also elicited confusion over what will happen once the ban goes into effect on Monday.\n\"This travel ban is a racist, bigoted and xenophobic and deeply un-American attack on human rights \u2014 it\u2019s like persecution. We have fled dictatorship, violence, hunger,\u201d Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, told NBC News from Miami, a city with a large population of immigrants from several of the countries on Trump\u2019s list.\n\u201cThis administration clearly has something against immigrants, and it has something against us in particular,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Antonio Colina, a former Venezuelan army lieutenant who fled to Miami in 2003 and heads the exile organization Veppex. \u201cWe are double-persecuted. We are persecuted by the tyranny of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and we are persecuted by the administration of Donald Trump.\u201d\nA 38-year-old Haitian green-card holder in Miami who was too fearful to allow her name to be used said she and many others in the community feel \u201cconfused and scared\u201d over the travel ban on Haiti. She said most of her family lives there, including her sister and father, who is sick. \u201cThey come all the time to visit and now I don\u2019t know if they will be able to,\u201d she said, adding she heard there were exceptions to the ban but wasn't sure.\nThere are some exceptions, including for people with lawful permanent residency, spouses and children of U.S. citizens, those who are adopted and others.\n\u201cBut if you are a spouse of a permanent resident, forget about it,\u201d said Doug Rand, former senior adviser of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration. It will also affect other relatives, such as adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens, people who won the diversity lottery or people who were sponsored by U.S. employers and are from the listed countries, \u201cpeople who have been waiting for years and done it the right way,\u201d he said.\nIn Havana, a queue of people outside the U.S. Embassy learned the news of the travel ban and suspensions as they waited for their visa interviews.\n\u201cI had been waiting nine years for this moment,\u201d said one young woman in line, who declined to be identified by name for fear it might affect her visa chances. She and others said the suspension means not being able to visit family or escape dire circumstances in Cuba.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t grant visas, Cubans will starve, given the situation, they will starve,\u201d said Ismael Gainza, a retired Cuban. \u201cI see that measure as bad, I see it as bad because the situation is tough and we have to survive.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s proclamation issued Wednesday night bans nationals from 12 countries from traveling to the U.S. The countries are: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\nIn seven more countries, travel to the U.S. was suspended but not banned. They are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\nShahzeen Karim, managing attorney at Hafey & Karim law firm, said that although she's in the immigration law space, she holds \u201cRepublican views\u201d on the topic, agreeing there's a need for a stricter immigration policy and more thorough screening.\n\u201cI know the White House presented some explanations as to why each of those countries, but I can\u2019t help but feel very targeted, being a Muslim immigration attorney,\u201d Karim said. \u201cThe countries are majority Muslim, unfortunately.\u201d\nChallenging the ban could be 'an uphill battle'\nImmigration advocates said that, unlike Trump's previous travel ban, which caught them off guard, they expected the president would enact a similar policy in his second term. Trump\u2019s 2017 ban immediately barred Muslims from entering the country, leaving some stranded at airports or unable to board flights.\nBut like his previous ban, the impact of the current ban taking effect next week will be felt by people trying to bring together families, those who landed a job in the U.S., who had tours or visits planned, who planned to study here or were looking forward to a cultural exchange.\nIt took three tries for Trump, in his previous administration, to come up with a travel ban that the U.S. Supreme Court would accept. Lower courts nixed the first version, and the administration kept revising it until the high court accepted its third version in June 2018. Immigration and civil rights groups opposed all three versions.\nRaha Wala, vice president of strategy and partnerships at the National Immigration Law Center, said that challenging the latest ban \u201cwill be an uphill battle\u201d because the Supreme Court decision is the law of the land.\nEdward Cuccia, an immigration attorney in New York City, said that blocking the latest ban could be tougher now than in 2017.\n\u201cTrump got smarter this time,\u201d he said, explaining that the mix of countries makes it harder to argue that the ban is discriminatory.\nAlso, the implementation won't be as abrupt, and the argument that the singled-out countries do not vet the documents of their nationals well may hold up in court, according to Cuccia.\nEven so, the implications are vast for the people who are affected and are not a security threat, he said.\n\u201cWhat is this going to mean for family unification? There\u2019s a lot of countries here!\u201d Cuccia said. \u201cAnd then, there are people that maybe had business dealings, people who wanted to do investments here in the United States or come over on temporary work visas, student visas or even just to visit. \u2026 That seems to be gone out the window.\u201d\nWala called the justification for the ban \u2014 that visa overstays present a national security threat and the inability to fully vet visa travelers in those countries \u2014 a \u201cfig leaf.\u201d\nIf there is a gap in vetting, \u201cthat\u2019s worth taking a look at,\u201d he said, but he added that \u201call kinds of people overstay their visas \u2014 and just because someone overstayed their visa and committed a crime, we just have to get away from this guilt by association concept.\u201d\nFor Wala, the newly announced ban cannot be separated from the president's previous policies and statements.\n\"This ban started as the president saying he was going to have a complete and total shutdown of Muslims in the country. And he also said he wants to ban folks \u2014 and pardon my French here \u2014 from s---hole countries,\" Wala said.\nIn Miami, Colina said he was glad the ban would prevent officials of Maduro\u2019s regime in Venezuela and their families \"who always find a way\" to get a visa to enter the country, \"but they are a minority, and the partial ban will negatively impact the larger community and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d", "Source": "NBC News", "Keyword": ["civil rights", "discrimination", "student visa", "visa"], "Entities": ["Trump", "U.S.", "Trump", "Adelys Ferro", "the Venezuelan American Caucus", "NBC News", "Miami", "Trump", "Jos\u00e9 Antonio Colina", "Miami", "Veppex", "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro", "Donald Trump", "Miami", "Haiti", "U.S.", "Doug Rand", "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services", "Biden", "U.S.", "U.S.", "Havana", "Cuba", "Ismael Gainza", "Trump", "U.S.", "Afghanistan", "Myanmar", "Chad", "Equatorial Guinea", "Eritrea", "Haiti", "Iran", "Libya", "Somalia", "Sudan", "Yemen", "U.S.", "Burundi", "Cuba", "Laos", "Sierra Leone", "Togo", "Turkmenistan", "Venezuela", "Shahzeen Karim", "Hafey & Karim", "the White House", "Karim", "Trump", "Trump\u2019s 2017", "U.S.", "Trump", "the U.S. Supreme Court", "Raha Wala", "the National Immigration Law Center", "Supreme Court", "Edward Cuccia", "New York City", "Cuccia", "Cuccia", "the United States", "Wala", "fig", "Wala", "Wala", "Miami", "Maduro", "Venezuela"]}, {"Title": "Trump's surgeon general pick criticizes others' conflicts but profits from wellness product sales", "Link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trumps-surgeon-general-pick-criticizes-others-conflicts-profits-wellne-rcna211420", "Published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:02:33 GMT", "Summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.", "Content": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.\nYet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.\nA review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.\nIn her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.\nMeans, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.\nStill, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.\n\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.\nThe nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.\nThough scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.\nThe aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.\nMeans\u2019 use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.\nA compelling origin story\nMeans earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.\n\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.\nMeans turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.\nMeans has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.\n\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly\u2019s podcast last year.\nBut even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.\nDuring the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.\nGrowing an audience, and selling products\nInfluencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d\nWith more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.\nAffiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.\n\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.\nMany companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.\nMeans has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\u201d; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.\nShe also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d\nOn a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.\nDisclosing conflicts\nMeans has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\u201d Means said. \u201cWe know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d\nIn November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d\nOn the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d\nInfluencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.\nMeans has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.\nMeans also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.\nThough the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.\nRepresentatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil\u2019s founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means\u2019 business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means\u2019 advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi\u2019s prediabetes and other ailments.\n\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.\nWhile the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.\n\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d\nPotential conflicts pose new ethical questions\nMeans isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.\nJerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group.

Michigan\u2019s 14 Planned Parenthood clinics serve tens of thousands of women. In order to save clinics around the state that were either busier or in places where women had few other options, the team would have to close multiple clinics, including the only one in the state\u2019s Upper Peninsula, a large, isolated and mostly rural area surrounded by a stretch of Lake Michigan. In Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, the city\u2019s two clinics would be combined.\nIt\u2019s a reality playing out across the country.\nAt least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed or will close within the year. For decades, the health care organization has been squeezed by the same pressures choking nearly all U.S. providers \u2013\u2013 low insurance reimbursement rates, blocked Medicaid expansion, understaffing and rising costs of providing medical care that have forced hospitals and health clinic closures throughout the country.\nUniquely, Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that serves more than 2 million patients nationwide every year, many of them uninsured, underinsured or who qualify for Medicaid, has also become the target of pointed funding cuts that started under the first Trump administration.\n\u201cWhat is different this time around is that it\u2019s much more sweeping. It\u2019s a deeper and broader cut that will affect both more clinics and more people,\u201d said Farzana Kapadia, a professor of epidemiology and population health at the New York University School of Global Public Health.\nIn March, the Trump administration withheld funding by excluding many Planned Parenthood clinics from the Title X family planning program, a federal grant program that funds family planning and reproductive health care. Then, in late May, House Republicans delivered another enormous blow, voting to end funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the reconciliation bill.\nFederal law already restricts federal funds from being used for abortion, except in cases of incest, rape or if a mother\u2019s life is in danger, through a law called the Hyde Amendment.\nBut if passed, the reconciliation bill would cut off Medicaid reimbursement to any nonprofit that primarily offers family planning or reproductive health services, provides abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment exceptions and received more than $1 million in Medicaid reimbursements in 2024. As a nationwide organization, Planned Parenthood does all three.\nIf the bill passes in the Senate, it would block Planned Parenthood clinics from billing Medicaid for any health services at all, including cancer screenings, wellness exams and birth control. It's unclear if the new legislation would apply to Planned Parenthood nationally or on a state-by-state basis.\nOver half of Planned Parenthood patients are covered by publicly funded health programs like Medicaid and in 2023, about 36% of all Title X services were provided by Planned Parenthood clinics. Eliminating these sources of funding would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from Planned Parenthood\u2019s care costs every year. Targeting federal funding for any type of care for Planned Parenthood clinics is a way opponents of abortion rights can attempt to shut down clinics that do provide abortion, even if they also offer other care.\nPhenicie said Republican lawmakers appear to understand that cutting off Planned Parenthood from Title X and Medicaid reimbursement will put the clinics that perform abortion in peril, even if these funds can\u2019t cover the procedures. The slashed funds could affect all Planned Parenthood clinics whether they offer abortion services or not.\n\u201cThey know so much of our patient base is on Medicaid or needs Title X to pay for their care, they know that cutting this off will allow them to cut off access to abortion and they are willing to make that trade,\u201d she said.\nBefore the cuts, Planned Parenthood was already operating on thin margins. Now, clinics are struggling to operate at a loss.\n\u201cThe numbers are so devastating that there are really no options other than closing some centers and consolidating others, and then investing in our virtual health centers that can serve people across the state,\u201d Phenicie said.\nClinics provide basic health care\nAt least 1 in 3 women say they have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care, as well as 1 in 10 men, according to a recent KFF Health poll. Nearly half of Black women have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic, the poll found.\nAbortions, the main reason the Trump administration has ended support for the clinics, account for just 4% of the services Planned Parenthood provides, according to a 2024 annual report.\nThe vast majority of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services involve basic health care for women, including diagnosing and treating urinary tract and yeast infections and screening for cervical cancer and breast cancer. Some locations offer vaccination against HPV, hepatitis B, Covid and influenza.\nMore than half of care is related to testing for sexually transmitted infections and treatment. Another 25% is providing access to contraception, often at low or no cost. Cancer screenings and other non-abortion services make up 18%, the report showed.\nThose important medical services haven\u2019t swayed opponents of the clinics.\nIn January, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., introduced a bill that sought to ban Planned Parenthood from federal funding in the same ways the federal reconciliation bill would. The bill is called the Defund Planned Parenthood Act.\n\u201cMy commitment to protecting life isn\u2019t just personal, it\u2019s rooted in both science and principle. Life begins at conception, and I\u2019ve spent my time in the Senate fighting to protect the right to life,\u201d Paul said in a press release.\nClosing in states that support abortion rights\nAbout 40% of Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding comes from government health care reimbursements and grants. Many locations offer a sliding scale payment option for people who can\u2019t afford health care. That money comes, in part, from government programs that are now being cut.\n\u201cCutting this funding is really about cutting access to care for people who are not insured or who are underinsured to allow for tax breaks for people who can afford their medical care,\u201d NYU\u2019s Kapadia said.\nWendy Stark, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, said that even when a patient has private insurance, \u201cthe reimbursement rates are just not meeting the costs of primary care.\n\u201cThe U.S. health care system pays a tiny amount of health care dollars into primary and preventative care,\u201d Stark said. \u201cWe are sitting in a micro version of that.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Planned Parenthood announced it was selling the building that housed its only Manhattan location. Planned Parenthood locations are also shuttering throughout the Midwest and in other states that have historically voted in favor of abortion rights, including Vermont.\nIn late May, Planned Parenthood announced it will close four clinics in Minnesota within a year. The state was the first to codify the right to abortion into law after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, but only one of the closing clinics performed abortions.\nFour of the six Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa, including one in Ames, where Iowa State University is located, will also be shuttered. Four Illinois clinics, none which performed abortions, stopped operating in March. In April, three locations closed and two were consolidated in Michigan, where the right to abortion is enshrined into state law. Two Utah locations closed in May after losing a significant amount of funding as a result of the Title X freeze.\n\u201cWe are subsidizing almost every visit we do, even with insurance,\u201d Stark said. \u201cWe also have a great deal of our patients who come who do not have insurance.\u201d\nThe decision to sell the Manhattan clinic was a strategic but difficult decision, she said. The revenue from the sale could help keep other clinics in the state operating. Both the patients and staff of the Manhattan clinic can be absorbed by Planned Parenthood\u2019s other New York City locations, which can minimize the impact the closure will have.\n\u201cWhen we consolidate in certain locations, we look at the whole area. Can we funnel patients to our next closest health center, are there other clinics that patients can be sent to?\u201d Stark said, adding that this is more difficult to do in rural areas that already have extremely minimal health care options.\n\u201cIf we face further erosion of our finances, we will have to make more hard decisions,\u201d she said.\nStraining a fragile health care system\nSeveral state-level laws banned Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funds in the decade preceding the sweeping federal exclusions.\nRobin Marty, the executive director of WAWC Healthcare, formerly West Alabama Women\u2019s Center, in Tuscaloosa, said these states can provide a picture of what health care may look like in states that have more recently faced Planned Parenthood closures.\n\u201cWe exist as kind of a lesson to people of what resources are like if there is not a Planned Parenthood,\u201d she said.\nPlanned Parenthood operates just one brick-and-mortar clinic in Alabama, in Birmingham, but offers telehealth throughout the state. There are just two in Louisiana and one in the Florida Panhandle.\nThere are no physical clinics in Mississippi, which has the highest teen birth rate in the nation. Alabama and Louisiana rank in the top seven, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Mississippi also has the highest maternal mortality rate. Louisiana comes in second. Alabama is fourth.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t places for people to go for free birth control or STI screenings or maternal care,\u201d she said, referring to sexually transmitted infections.\nWAWC Healthcare is one of the only providers in Alabama, outside of federally qualified health centers, which are run by states or counties, that does. Already, Marty said, the clinic relies heavily on nongovernmental grants in the absence of access to Title X, though the clinic does accept Medicaid.\n\u201cEvery time I apply for a grant, I know I have only about a 10% chance of getting it, but I do it anyway because that\u2019s the only way my patients can get care,\u201d she said. Other than grants, \u201cwe rely on donors who each donate about $50 each time we contact them.\u201d\nMarty said other clinics that provide some of the same services as Planned Parenthood, which are already operating on razor-thin margins, if not at a loss, will be further strained by closures. This strain will be passed onto patients.\n\u201cYou are talking about individuals who are living at or below the poverty level who already can\u2019t afford health care on their own and then you are eliminating a major source of their health care,\u201d Kapadia said.\nThe GOP megabill, which blocks Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed with Medicaid dollars, among other Medicaid cuts, is awaiting its fate in the Senate this week. For now, Title X funding is frozen for Planned Parenthoods in 20 states.\nIf the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d passes, another 200 of the roughly 600 Planned Parenthoods will be in danger, according to Planned Parenthood.\nWhen Title X funding was cut off to Michigan Planned Parenthood between 2019 and 2021, the number of people seeking preventative care at its locations dropped 75%, Phenicie said.\nAlthough there are other health centers that can pay for visits using Title X funds, they could not absorb the patients Planned Parenthood could no longer see, she added.\nIn the month leading up to this year\u2019s closures, Planned Parenthood Michigan kept the four closing clinics open to honor all the appointments that had already been made, and spent hours trying to help patients line up care at other clinics or through telehealth with Planned Parenthood.\n\u201cEven if they would like to continue care, if they can\u2019t be covered under Title X and they can\u2019t use Medicaid, their options will be limited,\u201d Phenicie said.\nCORRECTION: (June 6, 2025, 11:25 a.m. ET) A previous version of this article misstated which university is located in Ann Arbor.

Glenn Youngkin\u2019s partner.\nEarle-Sears, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, has largely attempted to frame her candidacy as an extension of the current administration, an attempt to replicate the term-limited governor\u2019s path to victory in the blue-leaning state four years ago.\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve fought for parents, backed the blue, and delivered real results for Virginians. Now, it\u2019s time to keep that momentum going,\u201d Earle-Sears, referring to Youngkin, wrote in a Facebook post earlier this year.\nBut there has been notable daylight between Earle-Sears and Youngkin on several fronts, particularly on social issues, complicating her strategy to follow in the footsteps of her more popular governing partner.\n\u201cShe is definitely trying to have it all ways,\u201d said a Republican operative in Virginia, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about Earle-Sears.\nMost prominently, Earle-Sears has made clear she is not fully aligned with Youngkin on a pair of hot-button social issues: same-sex marriage and abortion rights.\nLast year, Youngkin signed legislation protecting marriage equality in Virginia. But Earle-Sears left a handwritten note on the bill stating she was \u201cmorally opposed\u201d to the legislation.\nFollowing the bill\u2019s passage through both chambers of the Legislature, Earle-Sears wrote on the physical copy, \u201cAs the Lt. Governor, I recognize and respect my constitutional obligation to adhere to the procedures laid out in the Constitution of Virginia. However, I remain morally opposed to the contents of HB174 as passed by the General Assembly.\u201d\nEarle-Sears doubled down on separating herself from Youngkin\u2019s position on the issue in a recent interview, telling a local news outlet in Richmond last month that she was \u201cfine\u201d with civil unions but refused to say she supported same-sex marriage.\nShe\u2019s also out of step with Youngkin\u2019s positioning on abortion rights.\nIn 2023, Youngkin proposed a 15-week ban on abortion in the state, which included exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother, in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to help the GOP carve out a less severe \u201cconsensus\u201d bill restricting reproductive rights.\nFor her part, Earle-Sears has supported a ban at six weeks, or when fetal cardiac activity is detected \u2014 a point at which most women don\u2019t even know they are pregnant \u2014 and with fewer exceptions.\nWhile she got behind Youngkin\u2019s 15-week ban in 2023, she left another handwritten note on a measure passed by the Legislature earlier this year to send to voters a proposed constitutional amendment that would enshrine the state\u2019s abortion protections.\n\u201cI am morally opposed to this bill; no protection for the child,\u201d she wrote. She has also in the past called abortion \u201cgenocide\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo everything in my power\u201d to end abortion in Virginia.\nYoungkin managed to shift the focus elsewhere during his 2021 campaign \u2014 and has largely had to continue doing so as governor, as he\u2019s dealt with a Democratic-controlled Legislature. But the fact that he staked out middle ground on social issues has only further highlighted Earle-Sears\u2019 more conservative positioning.\nIn addition, Earle-Sears has faced criticism for her approach to the plight of federal workers in Virginia who have been affected by President Donald Trump\u2019s moves to shrink the size of government via the Department of Government Efficiency.\nShe praised those efforts earlier this year, saying she was \u201cglad\u201d Trump was \u201cgetting to the bottom\u201d of alleged waste and fraud in the federal government. While she has often pointed to the Youngkin administration\u2019s investments in the private sector of the Virginia economy as a reason workers need not worry, she has also said she would help Trump \u201cget the job done\u201d on the issue. And she downplayed the federal layoffs at an event in March, saying, \u201cThe media is making it out to be a huge, huge thing \u2014 and I don\u2019t understand why.\u201d\nYoungkin, on the other hand, has said he wants to \u201ccushion\u201d his state\u2019s economy from the effects of DOGE and earlier this year was frequently touting a website his administration created that effectively serves as a job board \u2014 while also praising DOGE.\nEarle-Sears\u2019 positions stand in contrast to the relative political middle ground Youngkin has famously staked out in Virginia \u2014 efforts that have contributed to a record of strong approval ratings for the Republican governor in a state that Kamala Harris carried last year by about 6 percentage points.\nLast month, though, a Roanoke College poll found a 44% favorability rating for Youngkin among registered voters, versus 50% who view him unfavorably \u2014 his worst showing in that particular poll, and a possible indication that the broader GOP brand could be facing trouble in Virginia.\nBut Earle-Sears had lower marks, with only 32% viewing her favorably and 48% saying they had an unfavorable view. Another 20% of respondents said they had no opinion of her. And the poll showed Democrat Abigail Spanberger leading Earle-Sears in the governor\u2019s race by 17 points.\nPolitical operatives in the state from both parties told NBC News these notable departures by Earle-Sears \u2014 particularly on social issues \u2014 risk turning off large chunks of voters in the political center that she\u2019d need to hold together Youngkin\u2019s winning coalition from four years ago.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her core promise to the voter? It should be pretty simple: \u2018Things are going good. Let\u2019s keep it going\u2019 \u2014 but she gets distracted,\u201d the Republican operative said.\nDemocratic Party of Virginia spokesperson Maggie Amjad said these issues, and others, show that Earle-Sears \u201cis a far-right candidate with a long record that\u2019s out of step with Virginians.\u201d\nRepresentatives for both Earle-Sears and Youngkin downplayed any differences in their political views and emphasized that Youngkin\u2019s strengths as governor still extended to Earle-Sears and other Republicans on the ballot in Virginia this fall.\n\u201cThe media\u2019s obsession with creating division where there isn\u2019t any won\u2019t change the fact that the Youngkin-Sears Administration is one of the most popular in Virginia\u2019s history \u2014 that\u2019s no accident,\u201d Earle-Sears campaign press secretary Peyton Vogel said in an email to NBC News. \u201cThey share a commitment to common-sense leadership, individual liberty, and getting government out of the way. Winsome has been a vital part of this administration, and will continue to bring ideas to the table that better the lives of Virginians across the Commonwealth as Governor just as she has during her time as Lieutenant Governor.\u201d\nJustin Discigil, a spokesperson for Youngkin\u2019s Spirit of Virginia PAC, said in an email that \u201cYoungkin has delivered for Virginians with record tax relief, record job growth, and record investments in education, law enforcement, behavioral health, and other shared priorities,\u201d and that Earle-Sears \u201cand all Virginia Republicans have a record to run on with proven results.\u201d\nA challenging political landscape\nEarle-Sears\u2019 positioning on social issues and DOGE could further complicate what had already emerged as an uphill climb for Republicans to keep control of the governorship.\nEarle-Sears has already faced a torrent of criticism for running an undisciplined campaign. And Spanberger, her opponent, is widely seen as a strong candidate who has won several competitive House races.\nThe GOP also faces historical headwinds: In 11 of the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial races, voters elected the candidate of the party out of power in the White House.\nRepublicans view Youngkin\u2019s 2021 victory as the product of a unique candidate who was able to benefit from the anger and fatigue over the Covid-19 pandemic and remote learning in public schools. Strategists said that will be difficult to replicate this year.\n\u201cHe just simply makes the main thing the main thing, and he\u2019s extremely disciplined about it. Everything fits into \u2018make Virginia the best place to live, work and raise a family.\u2019 He puts everything into the common sense bucket, the kitchen-table issue bucket. That\u2019s where he lives. That\u2019s why his approval ratings are always pretty high,\u201d said Virginia-based Republican strategist Zack Roday, who previously worked with Youngkin through his Spirit of Virginia PAC but is not working with the Earle-Sears campaign.\nRoday, along with other Virginia GOP strategists, suggested that Earle-Sears hadn\u2019t yet displayed the same political strengths.\nMeanwhile, Democrats signaled they were preparing to seize on another difference they said would be meaningful to Virginia voters: how each candidate handled Trump during their campaign.\nThroughout the 2021 campaign, Youngkin notably kept his distance from Trump, who was at a political low point following his loss to Joe Biden and the fallout from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. While Youngkin has since cultivated a much more public and close relationship with Trump in the years since, operatives from both major parties credited that distance during that campaign as another reason he won.\nEarle-Sears has so far voiced full-throated support for Trump.\nEarle-Sears \u201cis only focused on appeasing Trump and pushing an extreme agenda that\u2019s wrong for Virginia,\u201d said Amjad.", "Source": "NBC News", "Keyword": ["legislature"], "Entities": ["Winsome Earle-Sears", "Virginia", "Glenn Youngkin", "Earle-Sears", "Earle-Sears", "Youngkin", "Earle-Sears", "Youngkin", "Virginia", "Earle-Sears", "Earle-Sears", "Youngkin", "Youngkin", "Virginia", "Earle-Sears", "Legislature", "Earle-Sears", "the Constitution of Virginia", "HB174", "the General Assembly", "Earle-Sears", "Youngkin", "Richmond", "Youngkin", "Youngkin", "GOP", "Earle-Sears", "Youngkin\u2019s", "Legislature", "Virginia", "Youngkin", "Legislature", "Earle-Sears", "Earle-Sears", "Virginia", "Donald Trump", "the Department of Government Efficiency", "Trump", "Youngkin", "Virginia", "Trump", "Youngkin", "DOGE", "DOGE", "Earle-Sears", "Youngkin", "Virginia", "Kamala Harris", "Roanoke College", "Youngkin", "GOP", "Virginia", "Earle-Sears", "Abigail Spanberger", "Earle-Sears", "NBC News", "Earle-Sears", "Youngkin", "Democratic Party of Virginia", "Maggie Amjad", "Earle-Sears", "Earle-Sears", "Youngkin", "Youngkin", "Earle-Sears", "Virginia", "the Youngkin-Sears Administration", "Virginia", "Earle-Sears", "Peyton Vogel", "NBC News", "Commonwealth", "Justin Discigil", "Youngkin\u2019s Spirit", "Virginia", "Youngkin", "Earle-Sears", "Virginia", "Earle-Sears", "DOGE", "Earle-Sears", "Spanberger", "House", "GOP", "Virginia", "Youngkin\u2019s", "Virginia", "Virginia", "Zack Roday", "Youngkin", "Spirit", "Virginia", "Earle-Sears", "Roday", "Virginia", "GOP", "Earle-Sears", "Virginia", "Trump", "Youngkin", "Trump", "Joe Biden", "U.S.", "Youngkin", "Trump", "Earle-Sears", "Trump", "Earle-Sears", "Trump", "Virginia", "Amjad"]}, {"Title": "Trump's travel ban, in five charts", "Link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/five-charts-show-many-people-president-trumps-travel-ban-will-affect-rcna211284", "Published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 01:33:52 GMT", "Summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s proclamation Wednesday restricting entry into the United States for nationals from a patchwork of 19 countries revives one of his most controversial policies from his first term and targets many of the same countries", "Content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s proclamation Wednesday restricting entry into the United States for nationals from a patchwork of 19 countries revives one of his most controversial policies from his first term and targets many of the same countries.\nBeginning Monday, the directive bans entry for nationals from 12 countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

The new readings were a record high and represented an increase of more than 3 ppm over last year.\nThe measurements indicate that countries are not doing enough to limit greenhouse gas emissions and reverse the steady buildup of C02, which climate scientists point to as the main culprit for global warming.\n\u201cAnother year, another record,\u201d Ralph Keeling, a professor of climate sciences, marine chemistry and geochemistry at UC San Diego\u2019s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s sad.\u201d\nCarbon dioxide, like other greenhouse gases, traps heat from the sun and can remain in the atmosphere for centuries. As such, high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere contribute to higher global temperatures and other negative consequences of climate change, including rising sea levels, melting polar ice, and more frequent and severe extreme weather events.\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide has risen sharply since preindustrial times, owing mostly to human activities that pump greenhouse gases into the air.\nDecades ago, crossing the 400 ppm threshold was unthinkable. That meant that for every 1 million molecules of gas in the atmosphere, more than 400 were carbon dioxide. The planet hit that grim milestone in 2013. And now, scientists have warned that levels of CO2 could reach 500 ppm within 30 years.\nBut human society is already in uncharted territory.\nThe last time the planet had such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was likely more than 30 million years ago, Keeling said, long before humans roamed Earth and during a time when the climate was vastly different.\nHe said it\u2019s alarming not only how high CO2 levels have climbed, but also how quickly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s changing so fast,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cIf humans had evolved in such a high-CO2 world, there would probably be places where we wouldn\u2019t be living now. We probably could have adapted to such a world, but we built our society and a civilization around yesterday\u2019s climate.\u201d\nCarbon dioxide levels are typically represented on a graph known as the Keeling Curve, named for Keeling\u2019s father, Charles David Keeling, who began taking daily measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide in 1958 with instruments atop the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.\nThe Keeling Curve famously shows a steep climb since the Industrial Revolution, owing to human-caused climate change.\nRalph Keeling and his colleagues at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found that average concentrations of atmospheric CO2 in May were 430.2 ppm. NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Laboratory, which has conducted separate daily readings since 1974, reported an average of 430.5 ppm in May.\nCarbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are closely monitored to gauge how much humans are influencing Earth\u2019s climate.

In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.\nMeans, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.\nStill, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.\n\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.\nThe nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.\nThough scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.\nThe aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.\nMeans\u2019 use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.\nA compelling origin story\nMeans earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.\n\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.\nMeans turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.\nMeans has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.\n\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly\u2019s podcast last year.\nBut even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.\nDuring the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.\nGrowing an audience, and selling products\nInfluencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d\nWith more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.\nAffiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.\n\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.\nMany companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.\nMeans has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\u201d; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.\nShe also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d\nOn a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.\nDisclosing conflicts\nMeans has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\u201d Means said. \u201cWe know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d\nIn November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d\nOn the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d\nInfluencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.\nMeans has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.\nMeans also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.\nThough the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.\nRepresentatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil\u2019s founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means\u2019 business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means\u2019 advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi\u2019s prediabetes and other ailments.\n\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.\nWhile the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.\n\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d\nPotential conflicts pose new ethical questions\nMeans isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.\nJerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.\nHe divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.\nVivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.\nMeans has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.\nHund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.\nOther administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.\n\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d", "Source": "NBC News", "Keyword": ["stanford university"], "Entities": ["PROVIDENCE", "R.I.", "Donald Trump", "U.S.", "Casey Means", "The Associated Press found Means", "AP", "Jeff Hauser", "the Revolving Door Project", "Trump", "Levels", "U.S.", "Robert F.

A 2023 international study confirmed that taurine decreased with age and then showed that taurine supplements could slow the aging process in several species of animals.\nNow, a new study published in Science on Thursday found that taurine levels did not decline with age but, rather, were unchanged throughout adult life or even increased in some older people.\nThe seeming contradiction suggests that taurine measurements wouldn\u2019t be an indicator for longevity and raises questions about its use as an anti-aging supplement. After expecting to find that higher taurine levels in the blood protected against inflammation or some chronic diseases, the finding surprised even the authors of the new study.\n\u201cWe did this study to confirm what the first had done,\u201d co-author Dr. Luigi Ferrucci, scientific director at National Institute on Aging, said in a press briefing. \u201cOur purpose was really not to find the exact same association, but to find a strengthening.\u201d\nWhen their study was finished, \u201cthere was a large discrepancy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis discrepancy needs to be analyzed more in depth because that may reveal some important mechanism with aging.\u201d\nThe new findings do not rule out the possibility that boosting taurine with supplements might improve health in some people.\nVijay Yadav, co-author of the earlier study and head of the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School Healthy Longevity Program, said the new data will be important to the understanding of how taurine affects the aging process because it shows that it matters where the underlying data was collected.\nOne of the biological databases that was analyzed for his study came from a very homogeneous group of people from Finland, whereas one of the major sources of data for the new study was residents of Baltimore where the population is very varied genetically, he said.\n\u201cThis would suggest to me that different genetic backgrounds or populations have different taurine values and data from different races or ethnicities cannot be pooled to interpret results,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just means we need to better define the variables, genetic background is certainly an important one.\u201d Others could include whether an individual has fasted or recently eaten.\nIt may turn out to be similar to the situation when scientists were trying to understand the relationship between blood sugar and diabetes, Yadav said. Initially, for example, it wasn\u2019t known that it made a difference if samples were collected from someone who was fasting or had already consumed a meal.\nThe human body can make small amounts of taurine, although people mostly get it from food. Shellfish, dark chicken and turkey meat contain the highest levels of taurine. Other meats have moderate amounts of taurine. Dairy products have small amounts of the amino acid.\nTo shed light on whether a taurine supplement improves health and delays biological aging, Yadav and his colleagues are currently running a double blind, randomized placebo controlled trial.\nThe two papers are a good example of how science can work, said Dr. Peter Abadir, a specialist in geriatrics and an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.

Michigan\u2019s 14 Planned Parenthood clinics serve tens of thousands of women. In order to save clinics around the state that were either busier or in places where women had few other options, the team would have to close multiple clinics, including the only one in the state\u2019s Upper Peninsula, a large, isolated and mostly rural area surrounded by a stretch of Lake Michigan. In Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, the city\u2019s two clinics would be combined.\nIt\u2019s a reality playing out across the country.\nAt least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed or will close within the year. For decades, the health care organization has been squeezed by the same pressures choking nearly all U.S. providers \u2013\u2013 low insurance reimbursement rates, blocked Medicaid expansion, understaffing and rising costs of providing medical care that have forced hospitals and health clinic closures throughout the country.\nUniquely, Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that serves more than 2 million patients nationwide every year, many of them uninsured, underinsured or who qualify for Medicaid, has also become the target of pointed funding cuts that started under the first Trump administration.\n\u201cWhat is different this time around is that it\u2019s much more sweeping. It\u2019s a deeper and broader cut that will affect both more clinics and more people,\u201d said Farzana Kapadia, a professor of epidemiology and population health at the New York University School of Global Public Health.\nIn March, the Trump administration withheld funding by excluding many Planned Parenthood clinics from the Title X family planning program, a federal grant program that funds family planning and reproductive health care. Then, in late May, House Republicans delivered another enormous blow, voting to end funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the reconciliation bill.\nFederal law already restricts federal funds from being used for abortion, except in cases of incest, rape or if a mother\u2019s life is in danger, through a law called the Hyde Amendment.\nBut if passed, the reconciliation bill would cut off Medicaid reimbursement to any nonprofit that primarily offers family planning or reproductive health services, provides abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment exceptions and received more than $1 million in Medicaid reimbursements in 2024. As a nationwide organization, Planned Parenthood does all three.\nIf the bill passes in the Senate, it would block Planned Parenthood clinics from billing Medicaid for any health services at all, including cancer screenings, wellness exams and birth control. It's unclear if the new legislation would apply to Planned Parenthood nationally or on a state-by-state basis.\nOver half of Planned Parenthood patients are covered by publicly funded health programs like Medicaid and in 2023, about 36% of all Title X services were provided by Planned Parenthood clinics. Eliminating these sources of funding would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from Planned Parenthood\u2019s care costs every year. Targeting federal funding for any type of care for Planned Parenthood clinics is a way opponents of abortion rights can attempt to shut down clinics that do provide abortion, even if they also offer other care.\nPhenicie said Republican lawmakers appear to understand that cutting off Planned Parenthood from Title X and Medicaid reimbursement will put the clinics that perform abortion in peril, even if these funds can\u2019t cover the procedures. The slashed funds could affect all Planned Parenthood clinics whether they offer abortion services or not.\n\u201cThey know so much of our patient base is on Medicaid or needs Title X to pay for their care, they know that cutting this off will allow them to cut off access to abortion and they are willing to make that trade,\u201d she said.\nBefore the cuts, Planned Parenthood was already operating on thin margins. Now, clinics are struggling to operate at a loss.\n\u201cThe numbers are so devastating that there are really no options other than closing some centers and consolidating others, and then investing in our virtual health centers that can serve people across the state,\u201d Phenicie said.\nClinics provide basic health care\nAt least 1 in 3 women say they have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care, as well as 1 in 10 men, according to a recent KFF Health poll. Nearly half of Black women have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic, the poll found.\nAbortions, the main reason the Trump administration has ended support for the clinics, account for just 4% of the services Planned Parenthood provides, according to a 2024 annual report.\nThe vast majority of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services involve basic health care for women, including diagnosing and treating urinary tract and yeast infections and screening for cervical cancer and breast cancer. Some locations offer vaccination against HPV, hepatitis B, Covid and influenza.\nMore than half of care is related to testing for sexually transmitted infections and treatment. Another 25% is providing access to contraception, often at low or no cost. Cancer screenings and other non-abortion services make up 18%, the report showed.\nThose important medical services haven\u2019t swayed opponents of the clinics.\nIn January, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., introduced a bill that sought to ban Planned Parenthood from federal funding in the same ways the federal reconciliation bill would. The bill is called the Defund Planned Parenthood Act.\n\u201cMy commitment to protecting life isn\u2019t just personal, it\u2019s rooted in both science and principle. Life begins at conception, and I\u2019ve spent my time in the Senate fighting to protect the right to life,\u201d Paul said in a press release.\nClosing in states that support abortion rights\nAbout 40% of Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding comes from government health care reimbursements and grants. Many locations offer a sliding scale payment option for people who can\u2019t afford health care. That money comes, in part, from government programs that are now being cut.\n\u201cCutting this funding is really about cutting access to care for people who are not insured or who are underinsured to allow for tax breaks for people who can afford their medical care,\u201d NYU\u2019s Kapadia said.\nWendy Stark, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, said that even when a patient has private insurance, \u201cthe reimbursement rates are just not meeting the costs of primary care.\n\u201cThe U.S. health care system pays a tiny amount of health care dollars into primary and preventative care,\u201d Stark said. \u201cWe are sitting in a micro version of that.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Planned Parenthood announced it was selling the building that housed its only Manhattan location. Planned Parenthood locations are also shuttering throughout the Midwest and in other states that have historically voted in favor of abortion rights, including Vermont.\nIn late May, Planned Parenthood announced it will close four clinics in Minnesota within a year. The state was the first to codify the right to abortion into law after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, but only one of the closing clinics performed abortions.\nFour of the six Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa, including one in Ames, where Iowa State University is located, will also be shuttered. Four Illinois clinics, none which performed abortions, stopped operating in March. In April, three locations closed and two were consolidated in Michigan, where the right to abortion is enshrined into state law. Two Utah locations closed in May after losing a significant amount of funding as a result of the Title X freeze.\n\u201cWe are subsidizing almost every visit we do, even with insurance,\u201d Stark said. \u201cWe also have a great deal of our patients who come who do not have insurance.\u201d\nThe decision to sell the Manhattan clinic was a strategic but difficult decision, she said. The revenue from the sale could help keep other clinics in the state operating. Both the patients and staff of the Manhattan clinic can be absorbed by Planned Parenthood\u2019s other New York City locations, which can minimize the impact the closure will have.\n\u201cWhen we consolidate in certain locations, we look at the whole area. Can we funnel patients to our next closest health center, are there other clinics that patients can be sent to?\u201d Stark said, adding that this is more difficult to do in rural areas that already have extremely minimal health care options.\n\u201cIf we face further erosion of our finances, we will have to make more hard decisions,\u201d she said.\nStraining a fragile health care system\nSeveral state-level laws banned Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funds in the decade preceding the sweeping federal exclusions.\nRobin Marty, the executive director of WAWC Healthcare, formerly West Alabama Women\u2019s Center, in Tuscaloosa, said these states can provide a picture of what health care may look like in states that have more recently faced Planned Parenthood closures.\n\u201cWe exist as kind of a lesson to people of what resources are like if there is not a Planned Parenthood,\u201d she said.\nPlanned Parenthood operates just one brick-and-mortar clinic in Alabama, in Birmingham, but offers telehealth throughout the state. There are just two in Louisiana and one in the Florida Panhandle.\nThere are no physical clinics in Mississippi, which has the highest teen birth rate in the nation. Alabama and Louisiana rank in the top seven, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Mississippi also has the highest maternal mortality rate. Louisiana comes in second. Alabama is fourth.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t places for people to go for free birth control or STI screenings or maternal care,\u201d she said, referring to sexually transmitted infections.\nWAWC Healthcare is one of the only providers in Alabama, outside of federally qualified health centers, which are run by states or counties, that does. Already, Marty said, the clinic relies heavily on nongovernmental grants in the absence of access to Title X, though the clinic does accept Medicaid.\n\u201cEvery time I apply for a grant, I know I have only about a 10% chance of getting it, but I do it anyway because that\u2019s the only way my patients can get care,\u201d she said. Other than grants, \u201cwe rely on donors who each donate about $50 each time we contact them.\u201d\nMarty said other clinics that provide some of the same services as Planned Parenthood, which are already operating on razor-thin margins, if not at a loss, will be further strained by closures. This strain will be passed onto patients.\n\u201cYou are talking about individuals who are living at or below the poverty level who already can\u2019t afford health care on their own and then you are eliminating a major source of their health care,\u201d Kapadia said.\nThe GOP megabill, which blocks Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed with Medicaid dollars, among other Medicaid cuts, is awaiting its fate in the Senate this week. For now, Title X funding is frozen for Planned Parenthoods in 20 states.\nIf the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d passes, another 200 of the roughly 600 Planned Parenthoods will be in danger, according to Planned Parenthood.\nWhen Title X funding was cut off to Michigan Planned Parenthood between 2019 and 2021, the number of people seeking preventative care at its locations dropped 75%, Phenicie said.\nAlthough there are other health centers that can pay for visits using Title X funds, they could not absorb the patients Planned Parenthood could no longer see, she added.\nIn the month leading up to this year\u2019s closures, Planned Parenthood Michigan kept the four closing clinics open to honor all the appointments that had already been made, and spent hours trying to help patients line up care at other clinics or through telehealth with Planned Parenthood.\n\u201cEven if they would like to continue care, if they can\u2019t be covered under Title X and they can\u2019t use Medicaid, their options will be limited,\u201d Phenicie said.\nCORRECTION: (June 6, 2025, 11:25 a.m. ET) A previous version of this article misstated which university is located in Ann Arbor.

Doctors told her the sooner Guy received therapy for his nonverbal communication and behavioral challenges, the better chance he had of reaching his full potential \u2014 and perhaps entering a kindergarten with neurotypical students.\nLike many parents, Mazzola hoped to find therapists who were covered by their insurance. So she consulted a directory of providers listed as \u201cin-network\u201d on her insurance company\u2019s website.\nMazzola spent two weeks calling providers on the list, but found no viable options.\n\u201cProbably 50% of the time no one answered the phone or the phone number was wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you would get people on the phone and they\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, we have about a nine-month wait list.\u2019\u201d\nShe had stumbled upon what\u2019s informally known as a \u201cghost network\u201d \u2014 a directory of providers that are largely unreachable, out of network or don\u2019t accept new patients. Studies suggest it\u2019s common to encounter these networks while looking for covered care.\nBy prolonging the search for a provider, ghost networks can delay patients\u2019 ability to get diagnosed and treated, or cause them to forgo care altogether. But regulatory efforts to force insurance companies to update their directories or penalize them for inaccurate provider information have fallen short, prompting some patients to turn to the courts.\nA class action lawsuit filed last year on behalf of federal employees in New York against Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield claims the company\u2019s ghost networks amount to deceptive advertising by making people think they\u2019re purchasing insurance with an extensive list of in-network providers.\nThe suit further claims that inaccurate directories help insurance companies \u201cevade the costs\u201d of covering people\u2019s care. It alleges that plaintiffs who could not rely on Anthem\u2019s directory were forced to use out-of-network doctors, saddling them with thousands of dollars in extra costs. In moving to dismiss the case, Anthem has argued that federal law pre-empts the plaintiffs from suing as members of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\nMazzola, who lives in Connecticut and runs a construction company with her husband, is not a plaintiff in the suit. She estimated that she pays about $7,000 out of pocket each month for Guy\u2019s care, even after appealing denied claims and getting reimbursed for some out-of-network costs. She believes she wouldn\u2019t have to pay that sum if the providers in Anthem\u2019s directory were available.\n\u201cYou take it at face value when you\u2019re buying a plan that this is what I\u2019m getting,\u201d Mazzola said. \u201cI would have gladly gone to any of those [in-network] providers if they actually were taking patients.\u201d\nIf you are dealing with bills that seem to be out of line or a denial of coverage, care or repairs, whether for health, home or auto, please email us at Costofdenial@nbcuni.com.\nA spokesperson for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield said the company meets access requirements outlined under state law.\n\u201cWe also work hard to ensure that our provider directories are up-to-date and as accurate as possible, which requires a shared commitment from providers to update their information when there are any changes,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nAnthem said its provider network offers most of the services Guy needs, but due to the specialized nature of those services, it can be challenging to get appointments immediately. The company said it reviewed the list of providers that Mazzola tried to contact and found five errors related to incorrect phone numbers or addresses, which it said it will work with providers to fix.\nNBC News reached out to 21 providers listed in Anthem\u2019s network, and found 20 either didn\u2019t take patients Guy\u2019s age or had no availability for months.\nAnother class action lawsuit filed in April on behalf of state and local employees in New York against Carelon Behavioral Health, which provides health care services through insurance plans, claims that ghost networks delayed plaintiffs\u2019 access to mental health treatment. Carelon said it does not comment on pending litigation.\nThe two class action suits are among the first to challenge insurance companies over ghost networks, said Steve Cohen, a lawyer at Pollock Cohen in New York who is representing the plaintiffs in both cases as well as Mazzola.\n\u201cPatients are in need of help,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThey call provider after provider who are listed in this directory to get no answer, to be told it\u2019s not a doctor\u2019s office, to be told they don\u2019t accept the insurance. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating and often complicates getting medical care. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\nA widespread problem\nMazzola\u2019s experience is familiar to many, regardless of their insurance plan or health issue.\n\u201cThe vast majority of the time, a doctor\u2019s information is not going to be correct,\u201d said Dr. Neel Butala, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who co-founded a company that uses artificial intelligence to help large health plans improve provider data.\nButala reviewed physician directories from five large health insurers and found that 81% of entries had inconsistencies, such as address errors or the wrong specialty\u2019s being listed for a physician. His findings were published in JAMA Network Open. A government review of Medicare Advantage plans found that the share of inaccurately listed provider locations ranged from nearly 5% to 93%, depending on the directory.\nGhost networks can pose a particular challenge to finding mental health providers, many of whom have long patient waitlists or have stopped taking insurance. After having called nearly 400 listed numbers for mental health providers in New York, the state attorney general\u2019s office found that 86% were ghost entries. Staffers on the Senate Finance Committee similarly contacted 120 mental health providers listed as in-network by Medicare Advantage plans and found that ghost entries made up more than 80%.\n\u201cIn my view, it\u2019s a breach of contract for insurance companies to sell their plan for thousands of dollars each month while their product is unusable, unusable due to a ghost network,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said at a Senate hearing on mental health access in 2023.\nAnneliese Hanson, who was a network market manager at Cigna Behavioral Health until several years ago, said she felt pressure to make provider networks seem more robust to appeal to current or prospective members.\n\u201cIf our target was to have 100 autism specialists within a certain [geographic area], we would be working towards meeting that target on paper, rather than actually checking and ensuring that there were 100 autism providers,\u201d Hanson said.\nA Cigna spokesperson said that it takes rigorous measures to ensure its directory is updated and accurate and that it has a dedicated team of specialists to help patients access behavioral care quickly and conveniently.\nIn response to Hanson\u2019s comments, the spokesperson said: \u201cThese untrue and inflammatory assertions have no basis in reality, neither back then nor today.\u201d\nCohen said federal and state standards require insurance companies to offer an ample number of in-network health care providers within a defined distance of a patient\u2019s home. Those requirements may encourage insurers to pad their directories, he said.\nBut Butala pushed back on that idea: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any actually bad actors,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everyone wants to get this right.\u201d\nButala said there\u2019s an incentive for insurance companies to put out the right information, since a bad member experience could cause them to lose customers.\nOne explanation for ghost networks, he said, is that providers report doctors\u2019 information in a way that\u2019s conducive for billing, but isn\u2019t necessarily accessible to patients. Insurers often receive data that\u2019s difficult and time-intensive to comb through, he said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just a really hard problem to solve,\u201d he said.\nA better solution?\nMazzola said she and her husband, also named Guy, have been fortunate enough to afford their son\u2019s autism therapy so far. The younger Guy, now 2, is not speaking yet but has gotten better at making eye contact and using sign language to communicate words.\nBut the Mazzolas still feel the insurance system didn\u2019t work for them as promised.\n\u201cYou pay for insurance your whole life, hoping [a diagnosis] never happens, but when it does, that you can put your head on the pillow at night knowing they\u2019re going to be there for you. And that just wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d Guy Mazzola said.\nLegal and medical experts say some protections against ghost networks exist but aren\u2019t consistently enforced. Under the No Surprises Act, a federal law that took effect in January 2022, private health plans are required to verify and update their provider directories at least every 90 days. If members receive out-of-network care because the directory information was inaccurate, insurance companies must reimburse them for any costs that exceed the in-network price.\nPatients can also file complaints to state regulators, who have the authority to fine companies for directory errors. But a ProPublica investigation last year determined that such fines are rare. In an average year, insurance regulators issue fewer than a dozen fines for directory errors, the investigation found \u2014 and even then, the penalties are small.\nOne solution that might reduce the prevalence of ghost networks is a centralized directory of providers that all health plans could refer to. But health policy experts see that as a long-term goal that would be difficult to implement.\nButala said AI can help insurers scrub their directories for errors.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think health plans are skimping on throwing people at the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve been throwing too many people at the problem, and now they realize maybe AI can actually make it better.\u201d\nBut the Mazzolas also think insurance companies should be willing to pay more providers, so it\u2019s not a challenge to offer services in-network.\n\u201cI\u2019m not anti-business. I\u2019m not anti-profit, but there\u2019s an ethical side of it, too,\u201d Michelle Mazzola said. \u201cSomething needs to be done.\u201d", "Source": "NBC News", "Keyword": ["lawsuit"], "Entities": ["Michelle Mazzola\u2019s", "Guy", "Guy", "Mazzola", "Mazzola", "New York", "Anthem Blue Cross", "Blue Shield", "Anthem", "thousands of dollars", "Anthem", "the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program", "Mazzola", "Connecticut", "about $7,000", "Guy\u2019s", "Anthem", "Mazzola", "Anthem Blue Cross", "Blue Shield", "Anthem", "Guy", "Mazzola", "NBC News", "Anthem", "Guy\u2019s", "New York", "Carelon Behavioral Health", "Carelon", "Steve Cohen", "Pollock Cohen", "New York", "Mazzola", "Cohen", "Mazzola\u2019s", "Neel Butala", "the University of Colorado School of Medicine", "Butala", "JAMA Network Open", "Medicare Advantage", "New York", "the Senate Finance Committee", "Medicare Advantage", "thousands of dollars", "Ron Wyden", "Senate", "Anneliese Hanson", "Cigna Behavioral Health", "Hanson", "Cigna", "Hanson\u2019s", "Cohen", "Butala", "Butala", "Mazzola", "Guy", "Guy", "Guy Mazzola", "the No Surprises Act", "ProPublica", "Butala", "AI", "AI", "Mazzolas", "Michelle Mazzola"]}, {"Title": "Ghost networks leave patients struggling to find care", "Link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/ghost-networks-leave-patients-struggling-to-find-care-241007685880", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 23:40:50 GMT", "Summary": "Guy and Michelle Mazzola struggled to find care for their two-year-old son with autism when many of the providers listed within their insurer\u2019s network ended up being unavailable.

Many anti-abortion groups see restricting who can get mifepristone or rescinding its approval as one of the most effective ways to limit abortion access nationwide.\nThe petition comes just days after FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said he was committed to conducting a safety review of mifepristone.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., each requested the review following the release of a paper, which was neither peer-reviewed nor published in a medical journal, that claimed to find a high rate of serious adverse events in women who recently took the medication. Researchers who study reproductive health said the report amounts to junk science and exaggerates the risks of mifepristone. They note that it does not meet basic research standards, relying on overly broad definitions and failing to disclose which database it used.\nThe report was released by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank that served on the advisory board of Project 2025, a right-wing policy initiative that called for the FDA to walk back its approval of mifepristone.\nThe attorneys general said Thursday that the FDA should use the safety review as an opportunity to remove barriers to accessing mifepristone nationwide \u2014 or, at minimum, in the four states involved in the petition.\nThe FDA regulates certain medications with serious safety concerns via a drug safety program called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). Mifepristone is currently part of that program, though a wealth of research has shown that less than 0.5% of women who take it have serious adverse reactions. Studies have also demonstrated that prescribing mifepristone through telehealth is as safe and effective as administering it in person.\nAs part of the REMS program, mifepristone is subject to a few restrictions: People who prescribe the pills must be certified health care providers, and pharmacies must obtain certifications to dispense the medication. Patients who receive mifepristone must also sign a form attesting that they intend to end their pregnancy.\nThe attorneys general said in their petition that those restrictions are burdensome and unnecessary. They claim that many primary care and family medicine physicians aren\u2019t able or willing to take on the administrative burden of getting certified to prescribe the pills, or are worried about being added to a list of national or local abortion providers.\nThe FDA has already lifted several restrictions on mifepristone over the last decade. In 2016, it extended the window in which mifepristone could be used to terminate pregnancies from seven weeks\u2019 gestation to 10 weeks. In 2019, it approved a generic form of the medication, which increased supply. And in 2021, it eliminated a requirement to dispense mifepristone in person, allowing the drug to be prescribed via telehealth and sent by mail.\nAnti-abortion groups have called on the FDA to reinstate those restrictions, often pointing to misleading studies that suggest the medication has harmful effects. The April report that launched the FDA safety review, for instance, claims to find a 22-times higher rate of serious complications from mifepristone than reported by the agency.\nIn their petition Thursday, the four attorneys general denounced recent attempts to challenge mifepristone\u2019s safety, which they said rely on methodologically flawed research.\nA coalition of anti-abortion groups sued the FDA in 2022 over its approval of mifepristone, citing two studies from the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a group that opposes abortion, that claimed to show severe complications from the drug. The lawsuit was ultimately thrown out by the Supreme Court and the studies were later retracted by a medical publisher.\nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute released another paper last month claiming that a growing number of emergency room visits after abortions are incorrectly attributed to miscarriages, thereby masking abortion complications.\nRachel Jones, a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access, said the data only captures a small portion of abortions and is skewed in favor of those that are potentially higher risk. Some of the same data was used in the retracted studies, she said.\nJones added that the timing of the new reports from anti-abortion groups is not coincidental.\n\u201cThe anti-choice people are really going after medication abortion and doing whatever they can to get the FDA under the Trump administration to revisit the availability of the drug,\u201d she said.", "Source": "NBC News", "Keyword": ["lawsuit"], "Entities": ["the Food and Drug Administration", "California", "Massachusetts", "New Jersey", "New York", "FDA", "New York", "Letitia James", "FDA", "FDA", "Marty Makary", "Health and Human Services", "Robert F.

Watch in the video player above. He is expected to be prosecuted in the U.S. and, if convicted, will be returned to his home country in El Salvador at the conclusion of the case, officials said Friday. WATCH: \u2018Let\u2019s have a real court case\u2019: Attorney for deported man on the refusals to return him \u201cThis is what American justice looks like,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday in announcing the return of Abrego Garcia and the criminal charges. The charges stem from a 2022 vehicle stop in which the Tennessee Highway Patrol suspected him of human trafficking. A report released by the Department of Homeland Security in April states that none of the people in the vehicle had luggage, while they listed the same address as Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcia was never charged with a crime, while the officers allowed him to drive on with only a warning about an expired driver\u2019s license, according to the DHS report. The report said he was traveling from Texas to Maryland, via Missouri, to bring in people to perform construction work. In response to the report\u2019s release in April, Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife said in a statement that he sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites, \u201cso it\u2019s entirely plausible he would have been pulled over while driving with others in the vehicle. He was not charged with any crime or cited for any wrongdoing.\u201d WATCH: Sen. Van Hollen says El Salvador soldiers blocked him from seeing wrongly deported man The Trump administration has been publicizing Abrego Garcia\u2019s interactions with police over the years, despite a lack of corresponding criminal charges, while it faces a federal court order and calls from some in Congress to return him to the U.S. Authorities in Tennessee released video of a 2022 traffic stop last month.

Give Now By \u2014 Associated Press Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation to El Salvador became a political flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s stepped-up immigration enforcement, was being returned to the United States to face criminal charges related to what the Trump administration said was a massive human smuggling operation that brought immigrants into the country illegally. Watch in the video player above. He is expected to be prosecuted in the U.S. and, if convicted, will be returned to his home country in El Salvador at the conclusion of the case, officials said Friday. WATCH: \u2018Let\u2019s have a real court case\u2019: Attorney for deported man on the refusals to return him \u201cThis is what American justice looks like,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday in announcing the return of Abrego Garcia and the criminal charges. The charges stem from a 2022 vehicle stop in which the Tennessee Highway Patrol suspected him of human trafficking. A report released by the Department of Homeland Security in April states that none of the people in the vehicle had luggage, while they listed the same address as Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcia was never charged with a crime, while the officers allowed him to drive on with only a warning about an expired driver\u2019s license, according to the DHS report. The report said he was traveling from Texas to Maryland, via Missouri, to bring in people to perform construction work. In response to the report\u2019s release in April, Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife said in a statement that he sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites, \u201cso it\u2019s entirely plausible he would have been pulled over while driving with others in the vehicle. He was not charged with any crime or cited for any wrongdoing.\u201d WATCH: Sen. Van Hollen says El Salvador soldiers blocked him from seeing wrongly deported man The Trump administration has been publicizing Abrego Garcia\u2019s interactions with police over the years, despite a lack of corresponding criminal charges, while it faces a federal court order and calls from some in Congress to return him to the U.S. Authorities in Tennessee released video of a 2022 traffic stop last month.

(AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health. Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket. WATCH: The background and career of Casey Means, Trump\u2019s pick for surgeon general A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses. In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found. Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote. Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health. \u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees. The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy. Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients. The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry. Means\u2019 use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry. A compelling origin story Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine. \u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website. Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors. Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures. \u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly\u2019s podcast last year. But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests. During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest. Growing an audience, and selling products Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness. Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry. \u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added. Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer. Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\u201d; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements. She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process. Disclosing conflicts Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\u201d Means said. \u201cWe know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales. Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company. Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship. Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it. Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives\u2019 LinkedIn profiles.

Trump\u2019s proclamation was the latest attempt by his Republican administration to prevent the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest college from enrolling a quarter of its students, who account for much of its research and scholarship. Harvard filed a legal challenge on Thursday, asking for a judge to block Trump\u2019s order and calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard\u2019s rejection of White House demands.

Give Now By \u2014 Associated Press Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal judge has temporarily blocked a proclamation by President Donald Trump that banned foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University. Trump\u2019s proclamation was the latest attempt by his Republican administration to prevent the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest college from enrolling a quarter of its students, who account for much of its research and scholarship. Harvard filed a legal challenge on Thursday, asking for a judge to block Trump\u2019s order and calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard\u2019s rejection of White House demands. Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order. A few hours later, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against Trump\u2019s proclamation.

The top law enforcement officials from 19 states filed a federal lawsuit after the Republican president signed the executive order in March, arguing that its provisions would step on states\u2019 power to set their own election rules and that the executive branch had no such authority. In a filing supporting that argument, a bipartisan group of former secretaries of state said Trump\u2019s directive would upend the system established by the Constitution\u2019s Elections Clause, which gives states and Congress control over how elections are run. They said the order seeks to \u201cunilaterally coronate the President as the country\u2019s chief election policymaker and administrator.\u201d If the court does not halt the order, they argued, \u201cthe snowball of executive overreach will grow swiftly and exponentially.\u201d Trump\u2019s election directive was part of a flurry of executive orders he has issued in the opening months of his second term, many of which have drawn swift legal challenges. It follows years of him falsely claiming that his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election was due to widespread fraud and an election year in which he and other Republicans promoted the notion that large numbers of noncitizens threatened the integrity of U.S. elections. In fact, voting by noncitizens is rare and, when caught, can lead to felony charges and deportation. Trump\u2019s executive order would require voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections, prohibit mail or absentee ballots from being counted if they are received after Election Day, set new rules for voting equipment and prohibit non-U.S. citizens from being able to donate in certain elections. It also would condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the strict ballot deadline. The hearing Friday in U.S. District Court in Boston comes in one of three lawsuits filed against the executive order. One is from Oregon and Washington, where elections are conducted almost entirely by mail and ballots received after Election Day are counted as long as they are postmarked by then. The provision that would create a proof-of-citizenship requirement for federal elections already has been halted in a lawsuit filed by voting and civil rights groups and national Democratic organizations. In that case, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the judge said the president\u2019s attempt to use a federal agency to enact a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voting usurped the power of states and Congress, which at the time was considering legislation that would do just that. That bill, called the SAVE Act, passed the U.S. House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Trump\u2019s executive order said its intent was to ensure \u201cfree, fair and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion.\u201d The Justice Department, in arguing against the motion by the attorneys general for a preliminary injunction, said the president is within his rights to direct agencies to carry out federal voting laws. The order tasks the U.S. Election Assistance Commission with updating the federal voter registration form to require people to submit documentation proving they are U.S. citizens. Similar provisions enacted previously in a handful of states have raised concerns about disenfranchising otherwise eligible voters who can\u2019t readily access those documents. That includes married women, who would need both a birth certificate and a marriage license if they had changed their last name. A state proof-of-citizenship law enacted in Kansas more than a decade ago blocked the registrations of 31,000 people later found to be eligible to vote. The two sides will argue over whether the president has the authority to direct the election commission, which was created by Congress as an independent agency after the Florida ballot debacle during the 2000 presidential election. In its filing, the Justice Department said Trump\u2019s executive order falls within his authority to direct officials \u201cto carry out their statutory duties,\u201d adding that \u201cthe only potential voters it disenfranchises are noncitizens who are ineligible to vote anyway.\u201d Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: An extraordinary feud erupted into public view today between President Donald Trump and his one-time ally Elon Musk, with Mr. Trump saying he was very disappointed in Musk for criticizing the GOP's massive domestic policy bill. That's as President Trump today also defended his sweeping new travel ban on citizens from 12 different countries and restricting entry from seven more. Amna Nawaz: The president claims it will protect U.S. national security. The ban mostly affects people from Africa and the Middle East and will take effect on Monday.White House correspondent Laura Barron-Lopez has our report. Laura Barron-Lopez: Pointing to Sunday's violent attack in Boulder, Colorado, President Trump unveiled his new travel ban last night.Donald Trump, President of the United States: The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted. Laura Barron-Lopez: Banning citizens from 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting access for seven other countries. Trump claimed it's necessary to prevent terror attacks. Donald Trump: Very simply, we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States. Laura Barron-Lopez: On the list, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, while citizens from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela face heightened restrictions for entry.Notably not on the list, Egypt. That despite Trump using the Boulder suspect, who is an Egyptian national, as justification for his actions. During a visit with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office today, Trump defended his decision to leave Egypt off the list. Donald Trump: Egypt has been a country that we deal with very closely. They have things under control. The countries that we have don't have things under control. Laura Barron-Lopez: There are some key exemptions in place, including for those who are dual citizens, legal residents, refugees or asylum grantees already in the U.S. and athletes traveling for events like the World Cup and Olympics.At JFK Airport in New York City, some said the policy seemed shortsighted. Suleiman Kenyi, New Jersey Resident: We seem to be isolating ourselves from the rest of the world. So, wherever we draw back, I think the Chinese and other countries kind of fill in the gap, which is not good for \u2014 from my point of view, not good in the long term. Laura Barron-Lopez: The new travel ban is significantly larger in scope than the executive order issued during the early days of the first Trump administration. That policy banned citizens from predominantly Muslim countries, like Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.After a chaotic implementation and legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld a version of the ban in 2018. Despite waiting more than four months to issue it, Trump said that his travel ban can't come soon enough. Donald Trump: We're not stopping until we get them out. Laura Barron-Lopez: But the president didn't linger on the new policy, instead focusing more on the precarious future of his budget bill and the economy. Donald Trump: We have almost perfect inflation. Grocery prices are down, everything. Remember eggs? Eggs have come down 400 percent. Everybody has eggs now. Laura Barron-Lopez: Egg prices have decreased since peaks earlier this winter, but it's closer to a 61 percent drop, not 400 percent.Wholesale prices for businesses have dropped, but economists say the impact of Trump's tariff policies will likely drive them up again later this summer. And Trump lashed out at former adviser Elon Musk. Donald Trump: I'm very disappointed in Elon. I have helped Elon a lot. Laura Barron-Lopez: This week, Musk publicly criticized the president's tax bill, calling it a disgusting abomination. Donald Trump: Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the E.V. mandate. Laura Barron-Lopez: Musk quickly responded on his social media platform X, saying: \"Whatever. Republicans can get rid of the Biden era tax credit for electric vehicles as long as they ditch the mountain of disgusting pork in the bill.\"Musk's attacks didn't end there, posting: \"Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.\"Within hours, the president took to his own platform, TRUTH Social, saying \"Musk went crazy\" and that \"The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts.\"The mutually beneficial relationship between two of the most powerful men in the world appears to be over. Musk dropping what he called a really big bomb about alleged ties between the president and convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein. Musk said: \"Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.\"Some conspiracy theorists believe the government is hiding information about the death of Epstein. The Trump administration released a first phase of documents earlier this year.As the president and Elon Musk continue their public fight on social media, Tesla's stock price plunged this afternoon, dropping 14 percent. And shares in Trump Media and Technology Group, the TRUTH Social parent company, also took an 8 percent hit \u2014 Amna. Amna Nawaz: Well, let's pick up where you left off there and the feud between the president and Elon Musk that is escalating by the minute. What's the latest on that? Laura Barron-Lopez: So this fight carried on for hours, Amna. And Musk posted again on his social media platform, X, saying that he will immediately decommission his Dragon spacecraft.That's the only U.S. option for delivering the crew to and from the International Space Station. Elon Musk continued, amplifying a post calling for the president's impeachment. And he also said that the president's tariffs will \u2014 quote \u2014 \"cause a recession in the second half of the year.\"Now, President Trump fired back on TRUTH Social, saying that he didn't mind that Elon Musk turned on him, but said that Musk should have done it months ago.So, this ongoing fight exploding today, less than a week after Elon Musk and Donald Trump were in the Oval Office saying their goodbyes. Amna Nawaz: Laura, is any of this going to have an impact on the president's budget bill that he's trying to push through right now? Laura Barron-Lopez: So the president and the Republican Senate leadership can only lose three votes in the Senate. But some sources close to the White House said that the bill was in a tough spot as of this morning, but that they think that this fight between Elon Musk and the president could actually have a rallying effect for the president, essentially Republicans rallying around the president.As for the relationship between the two men, a source close to the president said that they think that the president's threats about canceling those government contracts that Musk's businesses have with the government, that that's a very real threat, and that ultimately Musk could end up being attacked and targeted in the way that the president has attacked his other perceived enemies. Amna Nawaz: Let's turn back to that travel ban you were reporting on. We heard the president talk about the national security interests here.What more do we know about the reasoning behind these countries targeted in the ban? Laura Barron-Lopez: We spoke to Simon Hankinson, a Heritage Foundation worker who also worked at the State Department for more than two decades. And he argued that this ban was really about cracking down on visa overstays and the refusal of countries to take back their nationals, which the DHS said as well, that essentially they are trying to pressure countries to take deportation flights of their citizens.Now, Hankinson argued that he doesn't think this ban is going to have that big of effect on students and talent coming to the U.S. because of the fact that the countries affected don't include India and China, which are some of the countries that immigrants come from the most to the U.S. for studying.It's important to note, though, Amna, that in the president's order and as well as the president's statements, he has repeatedly said that this is about combating terrorism and to prevent national security threats. Amna Nawaz: And, on that point, you reported on that. The president cited the Boulder attack. The suspect in that case is from Egypt. Egypt is not on this list. What are the facts that we know about terrorist attacks that are committed by people from these countries on the ban list? Laura Barron-Lopez: I spoke to Alex Nowrasteh. And he's with the Cato Institute. He and his team analyzed the actual number of immigrants and the threats from immigrants who come from these banned countries over the last 50 years. Alex Nowrasteh, Cato Institute: Since 1975, only one person has been murdered in a terrorist attack on U.S. soil committed by somebody from one of these banned countries. These bans are more about the president flexing his power and trying to reduce immigration to the United States by first going after countries that aren't that important, frankly, that don't send that many people to the United States.And then I think we will slowly see him add countries to the list over time.

Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: Today's other headlines start with a string of unanimous decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court.For one, the justices ruled that Mexico cannot pursue a $10 billion lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers for allegedly fueling cartel violence. U.S. laws have largely shielded gunmakers from liability when their firearms are used in crimes.The justices also agreed that a Catholic charity in Wisconsin should not have to pay state unemployment taxes while other faith groups were exempted. The group said that was a violation of its First Amendment rights.A third decision made it easier to claim so-called reverse discrimination in the workplace. That case centered on an Ohio woman who claimed she was passed over for positions and even demoted because she is straight.President Trump says trade talks between the world's two biggest economies will resume following weeks of rising tensions. That comes after Mr. Trump held what he called a very good phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping earlier today. In a social media post, Trump said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the U.S. at the talks.The date and location have yet to be determined. The two sides aim to make progress on tariffs and rare earth minerals after prior negotiations stalled last month.Former President Joe Biden is dismissing President Trump's call for an inquiry into his alleged cognitive decline, calling it a distraction. Last night, Mr. Trump called on his Attorney General Pam Bondi and other officials to investigate Biden's use of the autopen and whether certain individuals lied about his health to unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the president.In a statement provided to the \"News Hour,\" Biden said, in part: \"I made the decisions during my presidency. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false.\"In Massachusetts, a high school student who was arrested by immigration officials while on his way to volleyball practice is now free. Earlier today, an immigration judge had ordered Marcelo Gomes Da Silva released on a $2,000 bond. Protester: Release Marcelo Gomes now! Protesters: Release Marcelo Gomes now! Geoff Bennett: Public support for the 18-year-old had been growing steadily since his arrest last weekend. Authorities said they were actually looking for the teenager's father, who owns the car his son was driving when he was detained.Following his release, Gomes da Silva described what happened when an officer confronted him. Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, Detained By ICE: He gave me no reason to stop me, no reason for a traffic stop, nothing. And, apparently, they say they're trying to get my dad, but I'm here, not my dad, so that doesn't make sense. Geoff Bennett: Gomes da Silva came to the U.S. from Brazil when he was 7 on a tourist visa. He was later issued a student visa, which has since lapsed.In the Middle East, Israel said today it recovered the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages who were kidnapped in Hamas' October 7 attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the military brought the remains of Judy Weinstein and Gad Haggai back to Israel after a special operation in Gaza overnight.Meantime, Gaza health official say Israeli airstrikes today killed at least 13 people, including three journalists who were struck in the courtyard of a hospital. The Israeli military said it targeted a militant operating there.And in Southern Gaza, aid distribution resumed today at two sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The group shut its locations yesterday following several fatal shootings near its operations.Turning now to New Zealand, where Parliament suspended three Maori lawmakers today over a traditional dance they performed to protest a contentious bill. A majority of members voted for the temporary removals today, saying the lawmakers acted in a potentially intimidating manner. The suspensions range from seven to 21 days, longer than any prior ban.Last November, the lawmakers performed the dance called the haka as a form of protest to a now defeated bill they said would have reversed indigenous rights.Today brought the launch of the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2. Man: Waiting for Nintendo Switch 2. Woman: It's Nintendo. I'm ride or die. Geoff Bennett: Eager customers like these in New York waited for hours with lines sometimes wrapping around the block. The second Switch is similar to its 8-year-old predecessor, but it has a larger screen and improved graphics. The industry has been looking for a shot in the arm amid slowing growth and widespread layoffs.On Wall Street today stocks slipped ahead of tomorrow's highly anticipated jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average fell around 100 points. The Nasdaq gave back around 160 points on the day. The S&P 500 also closed in negative territory.

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is among them and he joined Geoff Bennett to discuss why. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Amna Nawaz: Several key Republican lawmakers share the concern about the impact the budget bill will have on the national debt. Geoff Bennett: Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson is among them.And I spoke with him earlier today.Senator Johnson, welcome back to the \"News Hour.\" Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI): Thanks for having me on. Geoff Bennett: You have called this bill immoral. You have said it's grotesque, strong language. What specifically do you find so offensive about it? Sen. Ron Johnson: No, that's not how I refer to the bill. I have referred to the fact that we are mortgaging our children's future as immoral and grotesque, and then the level of debt that we have accumulated and that we continue to accumulate. So that is immoral.What we are doing to our children, how we are robbing them of the opportunities and diminishing their prospects, that's truly immoral. And we need to recognize that fact and we need to stop it. Geoff Bennett: Well, the Congressional Budget Office, as you well know, now estimates this bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.The White House says that number is misleading and they say that you have your facts wrong. Here's what the press secretary said earlier this week: Question: But Republicans like Ron Johnson and Rand Paul disagree. They are saying that it will add to the deficit. That is their concern. Is the White House's position that those two Republican senators are \u2014 quote \u2014 \"blatantly wrong\"? Karoline Leavitt, White House Press Secretary: It is. Those senators, it's not news that they disagree with this president on policy, and the president has vocally called them out for it and for not having their facts together. Geoff Bennett: So respond to that, if you will. Sen. Ron Johnson: Well, first of all, I met with the president at the White House yesterday with his economic advisers. They know I have my facts straight. We have got a lot of respect for each other.Now, I thought it was kind of interesting, in that White House meeting, one of the things that President Trump pointed out was, the Democrats are always unified. They're always united. And I pointed out to them, well, that's because they're doing the easy things. They're spending money we don't have. They're mortgaging our children's future.We're trying to do something hard. And I think the good news is that those of us who are trying to do something hard, we do respect each other. Listen, I'm a big supporter President Trump. I respect Speaker Johnson and leader Thune and Chairman Crapo.But we are trying to do something very hard. We have had an unprecedented level of spending increase since the start of COVID from $4.4 trillion to $7 trillion. Our deficits under Biden and the Democrats averaged $1.9 trillion per year. It's very difficult to dial that back.But, again, we're trying to do it. I recognize and I sympathize how difficult this is in the House, even in the Senate. I realize I'm kind of not one of the easiest gets here. But, again, my loyalty is to my children and grandchildren. And I believe that's \u2014 that is shared by the president and by the other leaders who are working on this enormously challenging problem. Geoff Bennett: So what needs to happen to get you to yes? Sen. Ron Johnson: So I have been pretty honest about this. I am up front.We need a commitment, I need a commitment to a reasonable pre-pandemic level of spending \u2014 don't expect that to happen overnight \u2014 and a process to achieve and maintain it. So that gives people pretty light wide latitude to satisfy what I'm trying to do.But the problem is severe. We're starting, according to the CBO projection \u2014 and that's what I'm focusing on. I'm not real fond of the CBO scores either. They're static. They're not dynamic. But their projection is pretty solid. I think you have to look at that. They're projecting $22 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. That's an average of 2.2.Starts about $1.9 trillion up to about $2.5 trillion. It's completely unacceptable. We need to bend that deficit curve down toward a trajectory where we can balance our budget. Again, that's a hard thing to do. But I just need a commitment to that pre-pandemic level. And I want a process and a commitment to work with me to achieve that over the next the few years. Geoff Bennett: President Trump and Speaker Johnson have set a July 4 deadline to pass this bill. It's only a few weeks away.Is that timeline realistic? And what would potentially happen if you don't meet that deadline? Sen. Ron Johnson: Well, I think the skinnier we make this bill, the more realistic that timeline is. It's kind of hard to predict. I do believe that people like Senator Rick Scott and Mike Lee are working on different components with the chairmen of the committees.I think the bill actually will become better in the Senate. I think we will find additional spending reductions, help us solve that problem a little bit better. And, again, I'm working with the White House economic advisers, who are just first-class and very knowledgeable group of people. We want to get our numbers straight, so that nobody's disputing what the projections are, what the scores are, so we're all on the same page from that standpoint.And then we will move forward from that point. Geoff Bennett: Before we let you go, I want to ask you about a separate development, because President Trump today defended the executive order he signed last night imposing travel restrictions on more than a dozen countries, most of them in the Middle East and Africa.Do you support that move? And do you think that policy is necessary right now? Sen. Ron Johnson: I certainly support keeping America safe. Unfortunately, in the last administration, President Biden and his allies in \u2014 Democratic allies here in the House and Senate threw open our borders, allowing millions of people completely unvetted, members of transnational criminal organizations, violent gangs, drug human sex traffickers, into this country.President Trump has to clean up an enormous mess, and he's trying to prevent that mess from becoming even bigger. So, by and large, I support his actions. We have to secure our border. We have to protect Americans, make sure that Americans are kept safe. Geoff Bennett: Senator Ron Johnson, thanks for your time this evening. Sen. Ron Johnson: Have a great night.

Presidential budget proposals are usually seen as symbolic. But President Donald Trump is running the Republican Party and asserting presidential power in ways unseen in American history. At the least, the outline he has presented to Congress this year will influence lawmakers\u2019 decisions. From the White House and Republican perspective, his plan to eliminate some programs underscores that he is pushing for action that others have avoided. Looking at his initial or \u201cskinny\u201d budget proposal, along with an \u201cappendix\u201d the White House released last Friday, Trump\u2019s budget would eliminate at least 46 programs and agencies. Many of these programs have vocal advocates who say that without them, critical oversight, protections and functions will be gone. At the same time, as you\u2019ll see, this target list is composed mostly of programs with relatively small budgets. Eliminating them saves a sum barely worth mentioning relative to the federal deficit. Not the scale many fiscal conservatives hope to see. For example, the largest proposed elimination is the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, a national program that helps people afford heating and energy bills. Its roughly $4 billion in funding is just .06 percent of the discretionary budget Congress controls. What programs does Trump want to cut? Here are programs and agencies Trump proposes to eliminate in his budget.

(AP) \u2014 A former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump says he wants to become governor in the president\u2019s adopted home state of Florida and is running as a Democrat. David Jolly formally announced his bid Thursday, becoming the latest party convert hoping to wrest back control of what had been the country\u2019s premier swing state that in recent years has made a hard shift to the right. Under state law, term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis can\u2019t run for reelection in 2026. Even as Florida serves as a place for the Trump administration to poach staff and test policies, Jolly says he\u2019s confident that issues such as affordability, funding public schools, and strengthening campaign finance and ethics laws will resonate with all voters in 2026. He predicts elections next year will herald nationwide change. \u201cI actually think Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us. I think we should get politicians out of the classrooms, out of the doctor\u2019s offices,\u201d Jolly said. \u201cI think enough people in Florida, even some Republicans, now understand that. That the culture wars have gone too far,\u201d he added. Jolly was first elected to his Tampa Bay-area congressional seat during a 2014 special election and was reelected for one full term. The attorney and former lobbyist underwent a political evolution that spurred him to leave the Republican Party in 2018 to become an independent and then a registered Democrat. He has built a national profile as an anti-Trump political commentator on MSNBC. Jolly said he has considered himself \u201cpart of the Democratic coalition\u201d for five or so years, and believes in what he sees as the party\u2019s \u201cfundamental values\u201d \u2014 that government can help people, that the economy should be \u201cfair\u201d to all, and that immigrants should be celebrated.

DeSantis signs bill making Florida 2nd state to ban fluoride from its water system \u201cI struggled to exercise those values in the Republican Party,\u201d Jolly said, continuing: \u201cThe actual registration as a Democrat wasn\u2019t a pivot. It was a kind of a formality.\u201d Jolly has broken from his old party on immigration, as Florida lawmakers race to help Trump fulfill his promise of mass deportations. Jolly skewered Republicans, whom he said have \u201cconflated immigration and crime,\u201d which he described as wrong and immoral. \u201cIf you were born here or if you immigrated here, or if you\u2019re a Tallahassee politician who steals Medicaid money, we\u2019re going to be tough on crime,\u201d Jolly added, referring to a probe into the use of Medicaid settlement funds by a charity associated with first lady Casey DeSantis. Jolly\u2019s gubernatorial run as a Democrat draws comparisons to the failed bid of former Republican congressman-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, who lost to DeSantis in 2022 by 19 points. Crist, running as a Democrat, ousted Jolly from his congressional seat in 2016. \u201cBy switching from Republican to Independent to Democrat, Jolly has officially completed his transition to become the next Charlie Crist,\u201d the campaign of Trump-backed Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor, said in a statement. Jolly joined the Florida Democratic Party at arguably one of its most vulnerable points in years. Florida currently has no Democrats elected to statewide office, and there are now 1.2 million more registered Republicans than Democrats, according to the state\u2019s active voter rolls. The GOP has made significant inroads in formerly Democratic strongholds in the state, such as Miami-Dade County. The day Jolly announced his new affiliation, the then-top Democrat in the Florida Senate, Jason Pizzo, revealed he was leaving the party, declaring that \u201cthe Democratic Party in Florida is dead.\u201d Pizzo, a former prosecutor, has said he\u2019ll launch his own run for governor as a candidate with no party affiliation. On the Republican side, Jolly will face Donalds, who is also a frequent presence on cable news as a surrogate for the president.

(AP) \u2014 A former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump says he wants to become governor in the president\u2019s adopted home state of Florida and is running as a Democrat. David Jolly formally announced his bid Thursday, becoming the latest party convert hoping to wrest back control of what had been the country\u2019s premier swing state that in recent years has made a hard shift to the right. Under state law, term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis can\u2019t run for reelection in 2026. Even as Florida serves as a place for the Trump administration to poach staff and test policies, Jolly says he\u2019s confident that issues such as affordability, funding public schools, and strengthening campaign finance and ethics laws will resonate with all voters in 2026. He predicts elections next year will herald nationwide change. \u201cI actually think Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us. I think we should get politicians out of the classrooms, out of the doctor\u2019s offices,\u201d Jolly said. \u201cI think enough people in Florida, even some Republicans, now understand that. That the culture wars have gone too far,\u201d he added. Jolly was first elected to his Tampa Bay-area congressional seat during a 2014 special election and was reelected for one full term. The attorney and former lobbyist underwent a political evolution that spurred him to leave the Republican Party in 2018 to become an independent and then a registered Democrat. He has built a national profile as an anti-Trump political commentator on MSNBC. Jolly said he has considered himself \u201cpart of the Democratic coalition\u201d for five or so years, and believes in what he sees as the party\u2019s \u201cfundamental values\u201d \u2014 that government can help people, that the economy should be \u201cfair\u201d to all, and that immigrants should be celebrated.

DeSantis signs bill making Florida 2nd state to ban fluoride from its water system \u201cI struggled to exercise those values in the Republican Party,\u201d Jolly said, continuing: \u201cThe actual registration as a Democrat wasn\u2019t a pivot. It was a kind of a formality.\u201d Jolly has broken from his old party on immigration, as Florida lawmakers race to help Trump fulfill his promise of mass deportations. Jolly skewered Republicans, whom he said have \u201cconflated immigration and crime,\u201d which he described as wrong and immoral. \u201cIf you were born here or if you immigrated here, or if you\u2019re a Tallahassee politician who steals Medicaid money, we\u2019re going to be tough on crime,\u201d Jolly added, referring to a probe into the use of Medicaid settlement funds by a charity associated with first lady Casey DeSantis. Jolly\u2019s gubernatorial run as a Democrat draws comparisons to the failed bid of former Republican congressman-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, who lost to DeSantis in 2022 by 19 points. Crist, running as a Democrat, ousted Jolly from his congressional seat in 2016. \u201cBy switching from Republican to Independent to Democrat, Jolly has officially completed his transition to become the next Charlie Crist,\u201d the campaign of Trump-backed Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor, said in a statement. Jolly joined the Florida Democratic Party at arguably one of its most vulnerable points in years. Florida currently has no Democrats elected to statewide office, and there are now 1.2 million more registered Republicans than Democrats, according to the state\u2019s active voter rolls. The GOP has made significant inroads in formerly Democratic strongholds in the state, such as Miami-Dade County. The day Jolly announced his new affiliation, the then-top Democrat in the Florida Senate, Jason Pizzo, revealed he was leaving the party, declaring that \u201cthe Democratic Party in Florida is dead.\u201d Pizzo, a former prosecutor, has said he\u2019ll launch his own run for governor as a candidate with no party affiliation. On the Republican side, Jolly will face Donalds, who is also a frequent presence on cable news as a surrogate for the president.

The ban that Trump announced Wednesday takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday, a cushion that may avoid the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice in 2017. Trump, who signaled plans for a new ban upon taking office again in January, appears to be on firmer ground this time after the Supreme Court sided with him. WATCH: State Department holds news briefing as Trump creates new travel ban Some of the 12 countries also appeared on the list of banned countries in the Republican president\u2019s first term. The new ban targets Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. There will also be heightened restrictions on visitors from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. North Korea and Syria, which were on the banned list in the first Trump administration, were spared this time. While many of the banned and restricted countries send few people to the United States, Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela had been major sources of immigration in recent years. Trump tied the new ban to Sunday\u2019s terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The suspect, who is accused of turning a makeshift flamethrower on a group of people, is from Egypt, which is not on Trump\u2019s restricted list. The Department of Homeland Security says he overstayed a tourist visa. The travel ban results from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the departments of State and Homeland Security and the director of national intelligence to compile a report on \u201chostile attitudes\u201d toward the U.S. and whether entry from certain countries represented a national security risk. Visa overstays Trump said some countries had \u201cdeficient\u201d screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. His findings rely extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of visa overstays of tourists, business visitors and students who arrive by air and sea, singling out countries with high percentages of those remaining after their visas expired. Measuring overstay rates has challenged experts for decades, but the government has made a limited attempt annually since 2016. Trump\u2019s proclamation cites overstay rates for eight of the 12 banned countries. While Trump\u2019s list captures many of the most egregious offenders, it omits others. Djibouti, for example, had a 23..9% overstay rate among business visitors and tourists in the 12-month period through September 2023, higher than seven countries on the banned list and six countries on the restricted list. The findings are \u201cbased on sketchy data and a misguided concept of collective punishment,\u201d said Doug Rand, a former Biden administration official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Reactions Venezuela\u2019s government had already warned its citizens against traveling to the U.S. A video released last week by the foreign ministry told Venezuelans the U.S. \u201cis a dangerous country where human rights of immigrants are nonexistent.\u201d \u201cIf you are thinking about traveling, cancel your plans immediately,\u201d it urged. But the decision is a significant blow to Venezuelans, who were already limited in their U.S. travel plans since the governments broke off diplomatic relations in 2019. The announcement stunned the family of Mar\u00eda Aldana, who has long worked multiple jobs in Caracas to support her brother\u2019s dream to study engineering in the U.S. The family has spent more than $6,000 to finance his goals. Aldana, 24, said her distraught brother, who enrolled at a Southern California university two years ago, called the family crying. \u201cWe did it all legally,\u201d Aldana said. The African Union Commission, meanwhile, appealed to the United States to reconsider \u201cin a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa.\u201d International aid groups and refugee resettlement organizations took a harsher tone: \u201cThis latest proclamation is an attempt to further eviscerate lawful immigration pathways under the false guise of national security,\u201d said Sarah Mehta, the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s deputy director of policy and government affairs for immigration. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired Cornell University Law School professor and expert in immigration law, said the ban is likely to withstand legal challenges, noting the Supreme Court eventually allowed a ban to take effect in Trump\u2019s first term. Trump\u2019s invocation this week of national security, along with exceptions for green-card holders, athletes and others, could also help the ban stand up in court. Shock in Iran The news came as a shock to many in Iran despite the decades of enmity between the two countries. Reports suggest thousands of university students each year travel to America to study, and others have extended families living in America, some of whom fled after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the shah. \u201cMy elder daughter got a bachelor\u2019s degree from a top Iranian university and planned to continue in the U.S., but now she is badly distressed,\u201d Nasrin Lajvardi said. Tensions also remain high because negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program have yet to reach any agreement, but Tehran resident Mehri Soltani offered rare support for Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cThose who have family members in the U.S., it\u2019s their right to go, but a bunch of bad people and terrorists and murderers want to go there as well,\u201d he said. \u2018America has to cancel it\u2019 Outside the former U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, a Taliban guard expressed his disappointment. \u201cAmerica has to cancel it,\u201d Ilias Kakal said. Travel agents there said the ban would have little practical effect as Afghan passport holders have faced problems for years getting U.S. visas. Since the Taliban took over the country in 2021, only Afghans with foreign passports or green cards were able to travel to the United States with any ease, they said, while even those applying for special visas due to their work with U.S. forces in Afghanistan were facing problems. First term ban During his first term, Trump issued an executive order banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries. It was one of the most chaotic and confusing moments of his young presidency. The order, often referred to as the \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d was retooled amid legal challenges, until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. Trump and others have defended the initial ban on national security grounds, arguing it was aimed at protecting the country and not founded on anti-Muslim bias. However, the president had called for an explicit ban on Muslims during his first campaign for the White House. Amiri reported from the United Nations.

the Trump administration\u2019s stepped-up immigration enforcement, was being returned to the United States to face criminal charges related to what the Trump administration said was a massive human smuggling operation that brought immigrants into the country illegally. Watch in the video player above. He is expected to be prosecuted in the U.S. and, if convicted, will be returned to his home country in El Salvador at the conclusion of the case, officials said Friday.

The charges stem from a 2022 vehicle stop in which the Tennessee Highway Patrol suspected him of human trafficking. A report released by the Department of Homeland Security in April states that none of the people in the vehicle had luggage, while they listed the same address as Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcia was never charged with a crime, while the officers allowed him to drive on with only a warning about an expired driver\u2019s license, according to the DHS report. The report said he was traveling from Texas to Maryland, via Missouri, to bring in people to perform construction work. In response to the report\u2019s release in April, Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife said in a statement that he sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites, \u201cso it\u2019s entirely plausible he would have been pulled over while driving with others in the vehicle. He was not charged with any crime or cited for any wrongdoing.\u201d WATCH: Sen. Van Hollen says El Salvador soldiers blocked him from seeing wrongly deported man The Trump administration has been publicizing Abrego Garcia\u2019s interactions with police over the years, despite a lack of corresponding criminal charges, while it faces a federal court order and calls from some in Congress to return him to the U.S. Authorities in Tennessee released video of a 2022 traffic stop last month. The body-camera footage shows a calm and friendly exchange between officers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol.

One of the officers said, \u201cHe\u2019s hauling these people for money.\u201d Another said he had $1,400 in an envelope. An attorney for Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said in a statement after the footage\u2019s release in May that he saw no evidence of a crime in the released footage. \u201cBut the point is not the traffic stop \u2014 it\u2019s that Mr. Abrego Garcia deserves his day in court,\u201d Sandoval-Moshenberg said. The move comes days after the Trump administration complied with a court order to return a Guatemalan man deported to Mexico despite his fears of being harmed there. The man, identified in court papers as O.C.G, was the first person known to have been returned to U.S. custody after deportation since the start of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.

Abrego Garcia was never charged with a crime, while the officers allowed him to drive on with only a warning about an expired driver\u2019s license, according to the DHS report. The report said he was traveling from Texas to Maryland, via Missouri, to bring in people to perform construction work. In response to the report\u2019s release in April, Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife said in a statement that he sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites, \u201cso it\u2019s entirely plausible he would have been pulled over while driving with others in the vehicle. He was not charged with any crime or cited for any wrongdoing.\u201d WATCH: Sen. Van Hollen says El Salvador soldiers blocked him from seeing wrongly deported man The Trump administration has been publicizing Abrego Garcia\u2019s interactions with police over the years, despite a lack of corresponding criminal charges, while it faces a federal court order and calls from some in Congress to return him to the U.S. Authorities in Tennessee released video of a 2022 traffic stop last month. The body-camera footage shows a calm and friendly exchange between officers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol.

One of the officers said, \u201cHe\u2019s hauling these people for money.\u201d Another said he had $1,400 in an envelope. An attorney for Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said in a statement after the footage\u2019s release in May that he saw no evidence of a crime in the released footage. \u201cBut the point is not the traffic stop \u2014 it\u2019s that Mr. Abrego Garcia deserves his day in court,\u201d Sandoval-Moshenberg said. The move comes days after the Trump administration complied with a court order to return a Guatemalan man deported to Mexico despite his fears of being harmed there. The man, identified in court papers as O.C.G, was the first person known to have been returned to U.S. custody after deportation since the start of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.

The top law enforcement officials from 19 states filed a federal lawsuit after the Republican president signed the executive order in March, arguing that its provisions would step on states\u2019 power to set their own election rules and that the executive branch had no such authority. In a filing supporting that argument, a bipartisan group of former secretaries of state said Trump\u2019s directive would upend the system established by the Constitution\u2019s Elections Clause, which gives states and Congress control over how elections are run. They said the order seeks to \u201cunilaterally coronate the President as the country\u2019s chief election policymaker and administrator.\u201d If the court does not halt the order, they argued, \u201cthe snowball of executive overreach will grow swiftly and exponentially.\u201d Trump\u2019s election directive was part of a flurry of executive orders he has issued in the opening months of his second term, many of which have drawn swift legal challenges. It follows years of him falsely claiming that his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election was due to widespread fraud and an election year in which he and other Republicans promoted the notion that large numbers of noncitizens threatened the integrity of U.S. elections. In fact, voting by noncitizens is rare and, when caught, can lead to felony charges and deportation. Trump\u2019s executive order would require voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections, prohibit mail or absentee ballots from being counted if they are received after Election Day, set new rules for voting equipment and prohibit non-U.S. citizens from being able to donate in certain elections. It also would condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the strict ballot deadline. The hearing Friday in U.S. District Court in Boston comes in one of three lawsuits filed against the executive order. One is from Oregon and Washington, where elections are conducted almost entirely by mail and ballots received after Election Day are counted as long as they are postmarked by then. The provision that would create a proof-of-citizenship requirement for federal elections already has been halted in a lawsuit filed by voting and civil rights groups and national Democratic organizations. In that case, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the judge said the president\u2019s attempt to use a federal agency to enact a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voting usurped the power of states and Congress, which at the time was considering legislation that would do just that. That bill, called the SAVE Act, passed the U.S. House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Trump\u2019s executive order said its intent was to ensure \u201cfree, fair and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion.\u201d The Justice Department, in arguing against the motion by the attorneys general for a preliminary injunction, said the president is within his rights to direct agencies to carry out federal voting laws. The order tasks the U.S. Election Assistance Commission with updating the federal voter registration form to require people to submit documentation proving they are U.S. citizens. Similar provisions enacted previously in a handful of states have raised concerns about disenfranchising otherwise eligible voters who can\u2019t readily access those documents.

A state proof-of-citizenship law enacted in Kansas more than a decade ago blocked the registrations of 31,000 people later found to be eligible to vote.

Economics correspondent Paul Solman explains the ballooning national debt, how we got here and what it means for our economy and future generations. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Amna Nawaz: Republicans in Congress are hashing out a new tax cut and spending bill that's projected to add trillions to the national debt. We will get to some of those specifics in just a moment. Geoff Bennett: But, first, let's take a step back and explain a bit more about our already ballooning national debt, how we got here and what it means for our economy and future generations.Here's economics correspondent Paul Solman. Paul Solman: When we were there the other day, the debt clock that's been in Manhattan since 1989 said our country owed $35 trillion, $903 billion, $414 million.The number's the total of every dollar the U.S. government has borrowed to cover the difference between what it spends and the revenue it collects. That collective debt has long fueled anxiety about how it will burden future generations. Take this ad, which appeared on TV a few years before the clock went up, time so long ago that it's barely video-worthy. Actor: You owe the United States government in round numbers $50,000. Paul Solman: The estimated projection for a baby born today, four times as much. Scary?Natasha Sarin, President, Budget Lab at Yale University: The size and the sort of trajectory of our fiscal path is making a lot of people understandably nervous. Paul Solman: To cover the gap between what the government spends and what it collects, we sell IOUs, call them bonds. About a fifth of our debt is held by different parts of the government itself, while the rest is held by the public, which includes foreign governments, investors and folks like you and me.We rely on this debt to help fund the government. In 2024, that included about $4 trillion on benefit programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and nearly $2 trillion defense and basically everything else. In all, the U.S. spent $1.8 trillion more than it took in, contributing to a national debt that we have been building on and off since the country's founding. Lin-Manuel Miranda, Actor: Welcome to the present. We're running the real nation. Paul Solman: Before he was a Broadway star, our first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, called the young nation's debt the price of liberty and, in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War, advocated for the federal government to take over state debts to cement the colonies into the United States. Lin-Manuel Miranda: If we assume the debts, the Union gets a new line of credit, a financial diuretic. How do you not get it? Paul Solman: The pace of borrowing has ebbed and flowed with peaks due mostly to wartime spending, though, generally, the borrowing ebbed after a crisis was over. But in the aftermath of spending on the war on poverty and Vietnam back in the 1970s, spending again started to rise and hasn't stopped. Kenneth Rogoff, Economist, Harvard University: Our debt relative to our income has doubled in the last 20 years. It has quadrupled since 1980. We borrow very promiscuously, particularly during the financial crisis and during the pandemic.In fact, as things stand now, we owe about as much as all the other large advanced economies put together. Paul Solman: But what's been happening lately? Natasha Sarin: Our society is becoming older, and so more people are Social Security beneficiaries and are getting their Social Security checks. And we haven't scaled up our revenue collection in ways that match that. Paul Solman: And there have also been tax cuts, including during President Trump's first administration in 2017.Donald Trump, President of the United States: It's the largest tax cut in the history of our country. Paul Solman: Those cuts cost about $1.9 trillion over just a decade. Natasha Sarin: Tax reform, or cutting taxes, cutting the revenues that we collect, without raising commensurate revenue to be able to cover the cost of that lower tax burden, and the result is we have every year higher deficits. Paul Solman: So the yearly deficits pile up and keep the total debt swelling? But so what? Today, our debt is approaching levels not seen since the end of World War II. At least so far, our economy sure hasn't collapsed. Far from it. Kenneth Rogoff: If we have problems \u2014 we could have another pandemic. We could have a financial crisis. God forbid we could have a war of some type. And we will want to borrow a lot. And the fact our debt is starting so high, it's a risk. It gives us less flexibility for dealing with these things. Paul Solman: Economists say we have gotten a pass because the dollar is the reserve currency, meaning it's the most widely used currency in the world. But that dominance could be slipping. Kenneth Rogoff: Everybody sees, even if we don't, that we are likely to have a problem. And it's not the end of the dollar. It's not going to collapse. But maybe they want to be a little more diversified. Maybe they want to do other things.That further pushes up our interest rates. That makes it more painful. And we're in the thick of this right now. Paul Solman: Look, our IOUs are not free. We pay interest. And the rate on it, it's been rising. In fact, interest is the fastest growing part of the federal budget pie, making up about 13 percent of spending in 2024. That's more than we spent on defense. And the interest pie slice is more than twice what it was just three years before. Natasha Sarin: It's not just that deficits are going to rise and debt levels are going to be higher. What I actually worry about is what it crowds out in the future, because I think that's going to constrain you from things like investing in future generations and children in early childhood education or dealing with the climate crisis that faces us today. Paul Solman: But our debt hasn't stopped investors from buying it. And the idea that the U.S. would stop paying entirely and default seems pretty unlikely.On the other hand, defaults have happened in other countries throughout history and recently after the financial crisis. Natasha Sarin: We have seen sovereign debt crises across Europe, where questions about the viability of debt in countries like Greece were raised, and the sort of drag on those countries, not from just those moments, but from what drawing into question your integrity and your security and stability is a place to lend really, what that means to the economy. And these aren't short-lived impacts. Paul Solman: In Greece, a budget crisis forced the government to cut spending and raise taxes, contracting the economy. Unemployment reached 27 percent in 2013. It's a crisis that took years for the country to recover from.So is the U.S. nearing the point that it can't pay its debts? Kenneth Rogoff: We're not going to literally tell them that we're not going to pay the debt, but there's, of course, a threat of inflation, the \u2014 which makes the debt work less. You get paid back in dollars that don't buy as much as when you lent them. By the way, that just happened with the excess inflation that we had in the post-COVID years. Paul Solman: And if our dollars are worthless, the interest lenders would demand to buy our new IOUs would go up, and the more we'd have to borrow to pay the interest. Natasha Sarin: That interest rate won't just be the interest rate that the government owes people who lend to us. It will also trickle down to be the interest rate that you have to pay on your mortgage or the interest rate on your car loan or on your student debt. And all of that matters to households in a way that I suspect we're going to start to feel and we're already really feeling differently now than a decade ago. Paul Solman: So the future of our debt really matters. And how much debt we're about to add is being determined in Congress right now.For the \"PBS News Hour,\" Paul Solman.

(AP) \u2014 Hundreds of people squeezed into the Jewish Community Center in Boulder, Colorado, for a vigil that featured prayer, singing and emotional testimony from a victim and witnesses of the firebombing attack in the city\u2019s downtown, after a federal judge blocked the deportation of the suspect\u2019s family. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been charged with a federal hate crime and state counts of attempted murder in Sunday\u2019s attack on a group demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. He is being held in a county jail on a $10 million cash bond and is scheduled to make an appearance in state court on Thursday afternoon.

Rachelle Halpern, who has been walking with the group since 2023, said during Wednesday evening\u2019s vigil that she remembers thinking it was strange to see a man with a canister looking like he was going to spray pesticide on the grass. Then she heard a crash and screams and saw flames around her feet. \u201cA woman stood one foot behind me, engulfed in flames from head to toe, lying on the ground with her husband,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople immediately, three or four men immediately rushed to her to smother the flames.\u201d Her description prompted murmurs from the audience members. One woman\u2019s head dropped into her hands. \u201cI heard a loud noise, and the back of my legs burning, and don\u2019t remember those next few moments,\u201d said a victim, who didn\u2019t want to be identified and spoke off camera, over the event\u2019s speakers. \u201cEven as I was watching it unfold before my eyes, even then, it didn\u2019t seem real.\u201d The attack unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. It happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington. Defendant\u2019s family investigated U.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher on Wednesday granted a request to block the deportation of Soliman\u2019s wife and five children, who like Soliman are Egyptian. U.S. immigration officials took them into custody Tuesday, but they have not been charged in the attack. Federal authorities have said Soliman has been living in the U.S. illegally, and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Wednesday that the family was being processed for removal. It\u2019s rare that a criminal suspect\u2019s family members are detained and threatened with deportation.

Soliman\u2019s wife, Hayam El Gamal, a 17-year-old daughter, two minor sons and two minor daughters were being held at an immigration detention center in Texas, said Eric Lee, one of the attorney\u2019s representing the family. Soliman told authorities that no one, including his family, knew he was planning an attack, according to court documents. El Gamal said she was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn her husband had been arrested in the attack, according to her lawsuit. Victims increase to 15 people and a dog On Wednesday, authorities raised the number of people injured in the attack to 15 from 12, plus a dog. Boulder County officials said in a news release that the victims include eight women and seven men ranging in age from 25 to 88. Details about how the victims were impacted would be explained in criminal charges set to be filed Thursday, according to Boulder County District Attorney\u2019s office spokesperson Shannon Carbone. Soliman had planned to kill all of the roughly 20 participants in Sunday\u2019s demonstration at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, but he threw just two of his 18 Molotov cocktails while yelling \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d police said. According to an FBI affidavit, Soliman told police he was driven by a desire \u201cto kill all Zionist people\u201d \u2014 a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel. Authorities said he expressed no remorse about the attack. The family\u2019s immigration status Before moving to Colorado Springs three years ago, Soliman spent 17 years in Kuwait, according to court documents. He arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, McLaughlin said in a post on X. She said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that has also expired. Hundreds of thousands of people overstay their visas each year in the United States, according to Department of Homeland Security reports. Soliman\u2019s wife is an Egyptian national, according to her lawsuit. She is a network engineer and has a pending EB-2 visa, which is available to professionals with advanced degrees, the suit said. She and her children all are listed as dependents on Soliman\u2019s asylum application. Golden reported from Seattle.

Marcelo Gomes da Silva, 18, who came to the U.S. from Brazil at age 7, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday. Authorities have said the agents were looking for the Milford High School teenager\u2019s father, who owns the car Gomes da Silva was driving at the time and had parked in a friend\u2019s driveway. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place.

She described him as deeply rooted in his community and a dedicated member of both the school marching band and a band at his church. The immigration judge set a placeholder hearing date for a couple of weeks from Thursday, but it might take place months from that, Nice said. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that he\u2019ll have a future in the United States,\u201d she said. A federal judge considering Gomes da Silva\u2019s request to be released while his immigration case proceeds has given the government until June 16 to respond and ordered that Gomes da Silva not be moved out of Massachusetts without 48 hours\u2019 notice given to the court. The government sought permission Wednesday to move Gomes da Silva to a detention facility in a different New England state, Nice said. A judge quickly denied the request. A shaken community \u201cI love my son. We need Marcelo back home. It\u2019s no family without him,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Paulo Gomes Pereira said in a video released Wednesday. \u201cWe love America.

Gomes da Silva\u2019s sister describes watching movies with her brother and enjoying food he cooks for her: \u201cI miss everything about him.\u201d Students at Milford High staged a walkout Monday to protest his detainment. Other supporters wore white and packed the stands of the high school gymnasium Tuesday night, when the volleyball team dedicated a match to their missing teammate.

She said if she had a chance to speak with the president, she\u2019d ask him to \u2018just put yourself in our shoes.\u2019 \u201cHe did say he was going to deport criminals,\u201d she said. \u201cMarcelo is not a criminal. He\u2019s a student. I really want him to take a step in our shoes, witnessing this. Try and understand how we feel. We\u2019re just trying to graduate high school.\u201d Veronica Hernandez, a family advocate from Medford who said she works in a largely Hispanic community where ICE has had an active presence, said cases like Gomes da Silva\u2019s show immigration enforcement is serious about taking \u201canybody\u201d without legal status, not just those accused of crimes. \u201cI think seeing that something so simple as a child driving themselves and their friends to volleyball practice at risk struck a chord,\u201d she said.

The Biden-era guidance argued the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act required hospitals to provide treatment during a medical emergency, even in states with near-total abortion bans. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Sarah Varney. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: The Trump administration rescinded federal guidance that required emergency rooms to provide an abortion if the procedure would save a woman's life.That guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 after Roe v. Wade was overturned argued a law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, required hospitals to stabilize a patient's health during medical emergencies, even in states with near-total abortion bans.Yesterday, the administration said the guidance did not reflect President Trump's policy.For more on how this will affect pregnant women and access to lifesaving medical care at large, we're joined by special correspondent Sarah Varney.Sarah, thanks for being here.So why was this law known as EMTALA, why was it implemented in the first place? What problem was it trying to solve? Sarah Varney: So, President Ronald Reagan signed this bill in 1986. At the time, hospitals were routinely turning away poor patients, patients without insurance, and turning them away even when they might have life-threatening medical conditions.So this law was written. It went into effect, and it said that E.R.s across the country that receive Medicare payments, which is essentially every hospital in the United States, has to stabilize a patient with an emergency medical condition before they can transfer them. Geoff Bennett: So what did the Biden administration require post-Dobbs? And what is the Trump administration now saying it no longer has to do? Sarah Varney: A month or so after the Dobbs decision, the Biden administration issued a memorandum.It went out to all the hospitals around the country that received these Medicare funds, and it reminded them that EMTALA was in effect, and that, according to the Biden administration's reading of EMTALA, it meant that even in states that had very strict abortion bans, that women who presented in emergency rooms with life-threatening medical conditions, if an abortion was the procedure that was needed to stabilize her, that those hospitals had to provide that treatment.What the Trump administration is essentially saying is, we're rescinding that letter and leaving it open to interpretation from the different hospitals about whether or not certain emergency medical conditions meet their state ban. Geoff Bennett: And what state, Sarah, would be most affected by this? Sarah Varney: There's certain states where there's really no exception for the health of the pregnant woman. That includes Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.So these are some places where a pregnant person could go into the emergency room, and there would be some debate about whether or not they could have an abortion if that was necessary to stabilize their health. Just as an example, for instance, in South Dakota, they released a report last year that showed that there were \u2014 according to their records, that there were zero abortions that happened in South Dakota hospitals in 2023. Geoff Bennett: Sarah, how would this affect a pregnant woman in a red state versus a blue state? Sarah Varney: So there's already \u2014 even with the Biden guidance in effect, there has been pretty significant differences between the types of care that pregnant women have gotten in states with abortion bans and states without abortion bans.The Associated Press did an investigation that found dozens of women who were turned away from emergency rooms, including when they needed an abortion to stabilize their health care. ProPublica has also done pretty extraordinary investigative reporting, finding that women have been turned away from emergency rooms or not received the care that they needed.They were either harmed or, in some cases, they died. So we already have seen this divide, really, and this patchwork of care emerging across the United States. Geoff Bennett: And how are anti-abortion groups responding to this announcement? Sarah Varney: Anti-abortion groups are celebrating the rescission of this Biden-era guidance.They say it's actually not necessary. They point to these induced termination of pregnancy reports that I was just mentioning about South Dakota in places like Texas, where you had 14 abortions mostly due to emergency situations in Texas in January of 2025.So the anti-abortion groups and lawmakers, anti-abortion lawmakers say that these laws are working as they were intended and that women can, in fact, get emergency room care when it's necessary. Geoff Bennett: As I understand it, this decision was outlined in Project 2025, that conservative blueprint for a second Trump term. Tell us more about that. Sarah Varney: Well, the EMTALA rescission was actually included in Project 2025, so we're seeing that checked off the list. It also calls for the administration to stop defending existing EMTALA lawsuits that were held over from the Biden administration. They have also done that.And then there's many, many things in Project 2025 that have to do with abortion, including calls for a national abortion surveillance program so that there would be national data about the number of abortions that are happening in the United States. It calls for the reversal of FDA approval of the abortion pill and for the enforcement of what's called the Comstock Act, which would essentially cease the mailing of abortion pills around the country. Geoff Bennett: Special correspondent Sarah Varney.Sarah, thanks again for your time this evening. Sarah Varney: Thank you, Geoff.

READ MORE: 5 reasons federal cuts are hitting veterans especially hard Veterans are disproportionately affected by federal cuts, in part because they make up only 6.1% of the U.S. population but, because of \u201cveterans preference\u201d in federal hiring, they compose 24% of the 3 million federal workers facing mass layoffs under the Trump administration. Veterans also depend on comprehensive, free, federally funded health care through VA clinics throughout the country. But that care is deteriorating due to cuts, rule changes and return-to-work policies that make it impossible for many VA workers to effectively provide care. Looming cuts to the VA may cause an irreversible blow if the VA stops providing comprehensive care to veterans and, instead, pushes veterans into seeing doctors in private practice. This is not the first time that veterans have engaged in mass mobilization. Veterans groups in the U.S. have successfully mobilized for centuries, crossing traditional political divisions such as race, class and gender. They are powerful messengers, and their actions in the past have helped secure back pay and pensions for veterans, a Social Security and welfare system for U.S. civilians, and foreign policy changes to end wars abroad. I\u2019m a scholar of law, social movements and veterans benefits. Here\u2019s a brief history of veterans\u2019 campaigns that illustrates how veterans developed their political clout and effectively advocated to protect themselves, and many others, from harmful federal policies. Then-Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York chats with inmates of the Veterans\u2019 hospital at Castle Point, near Beacon, New York. Photo via Getty Images Fighting for pensions Veterans were not always politically popular, nor were they treated well by the federal government. After the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, Gen. George Washington lobbied Congress to offer lifetime half-pay to officers who served until the end of the war. Given the federal government\u2019s financial precariousness at the end of the war, this effort failed. Veterans were unable to successfully mobilize to advocate for the pensions, given their small numbers and internal divisions between more privileged officers and less privileged soldiers. During the Civil War, Congress passed numerous laws designed to support veterans. The 1862 pension law allocated payouts in proportion to a soldier\u2019s permanent bodily injury or disability caused by their service. The benefits were generous in comparison with prior allocations, and more veterans began applying for them. READ MORE: Veterans say they feel betrayed after firing from federal jobs, including some who voted for Trump Yet, by 1875 only 6.5% of veterans had signed up for pensions. Veterans began to organize to increase awareness about these benefits and to lobby for more. The Grand Army of the Republic became a leading veterans organization that demanded better pension and disability benefits. At the end of the 1800s, earning veterans\u2019 votes became a priority for aspiring politicians. The Grand Army of the Republic directly lobbied Congress to pass bills expanding veterans pensions, one of which Democratic President Grover Cleveland vetoed in 1887. The organization then successfully mobilized its members to vote against Cleveland in the 1888 election, securing victory for presidential candidate William Henry Harrison and for Republicans in both houses of Congress. This secured the 1890 Arrears Act, which expanded veterans\u2019 pensions and disability payments. By the turn of the 19th century, over 40% of federal expenditures went to veterans. Getting back pay As more veterans returned in 1898 from fighting in the Spanish-American War, and with a huge influx of veterans 20 years later from World War I, veterans mobilized to streamline and expand pension and disability benefits. In the 1920s, the two most prominent veterans organizations, the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars, or VFW, formed a national legislative committee dedicated to lobbying for improved benefits. Each group boasted thousands of members whom they could call on to \u201cbarrage\u201d\u2013 a veterans term \u2013 congressmen with letters. By 1929, even as the federal budget ballooned, veterans benefits still represented 20% of the total federal budget. The 1924 \u201cBonus Act,\u201d which Congress passed after overruling Calvin Coolidge\u2019s presidential veto, offered WWI veterans a deferred \u201cbonus\u201d payment available in 1945. But veterans suffered immensely in the Great Depression, along with the rest of the country.

Over the course of three months, from May through July 1932, 40,000 veterans set up encampments throughout the city. During their stay, they crowded congressional galleries and plazas during debates on the bill. When President Herbert Hoover called on the military to disband the encampments, he set himself up for electoral defeat later that year. It took another four years for Congress to pass a law offering an immediate payout, but the veterans got their bonuses in 1936, not 1945. Campaigning to prevent cuts Building from public support bolstered by the Bonus Army march, veterans fought publicly to protect their benefits in the Great Depression. In 1933, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sought to cut veterans\u2019 benefits to help finance other relief programs during the Depression, but veterans successfully lobbied Congress to rescind the cuts. A 1933 VFW encampment in Milwaukee attracted 10,000 veterans who openly decried Roosevelt\u2019s economic policies. The event featured left-wing Louisiana populist Sen. Huey P. Long and former Marine turned anti-Wall Street populist Smedley Butler.

To avoid another spectacle, FDR began developing a compensation program for World War II veterans even before the war\u2019s end. During debates about these expenditures, veterans activism helped ensure the generous educational, housing and vocational benefits from the so-called GI Bill developed by FDR, and the soldier vote helped secure FDR\u2019s fourth-term election in 1944. Scholars credit the GI Bill with creating a booming U.S. economy from the 1950s through the 1970s and creating the contemporary middle class, an economic and social group now shrinking and under threat.

The organization continued to mobilize in more traditional ways, drafting congressional legislation for benefits and promoting investment in psychological support for Vietnam veterans. Veterans have continued to protest wars, particularly the Iraq War, engaging in street protests and also through mainstream politics such as elections and television advertising. Given their experiences, veterans today know what they are standing up for on June 6: their own freedom and prosperity, as well as the country\u2019s and the world\u2019s.

During debates about these expenditures, veterans activism helped ensure the generous educational, housing and vocational benefits from the so-called GI Bill developed by FDR, and the soldier vote helped secure FDR\u2019s fourth-term election in 1944. Scholars credit the GI Bill with creating a booming U.S. economy from the 1950s through the 1970s and creating the contemporary middle class, an economic and social group now shrinking and under threat. Beyond benefits Vietnam war veterans hold a silent march down Pennsylvania Avenue past the White House on April 22, 1971. Photo via Getty Images After World War II, veterans\u2019 mobilization expanded from a focus on benefits to foreign policy. Most famously, after its founding in 1967, Vietnam Veterans Against the War engaged in street theater and gathered testimonies about U.S. military abuses to condemn the U.S. government for violence against the Vietnamese.

The organization continued to mobilize in more traditional ways, drafting congressional legislation for benefits and promoting investment in psychological support for Vietnam veterans. Veterans have continued to protest wars, particularly the Iraq War, engaging in street protests and also through mainstream politics such as elections and television advertising. Given their experiences, veterans today know what they are standing up for on June 6: their own freedom and prosperity, as well as the country\u2019s and the world\u2019s.

It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds. On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions. The law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn\u2019t receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.

With much of Gaza in rubble, men and children were forced to hold the traditional Eid al-Adha prayers in the open air and with food supplies dwindling, families were having to make do with what they could scrape together for the three-day feast. \u201cThis is the worst feast that the Palestinian people have experienced because of the unjust war against the Palestinian people,\u201d said Kamel Emran after attending prayers in the southern city of Khan Younis. \u201cThere is no food, no flour, no shelter, no mosques, no homes, no mattresses \u2026 The conditions are very, very harsh.\u201d The Islamic holiday begins on the 10th day of the Islamic lunar month of Dhul-Hijja, during the Hajj season in Saudi Arabia. For the second year, Muslims in Gaza were not able to travel to Saudi Arabia to perform the traditional pilgrimage. The war broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 hostages. They are still holding 56 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies. Since then, Israel has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians in its military campaign, primarily women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry which does not distinguish between civilians or combatants in its figures. The offensive has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians. After blocking all food and aid from entering Gaza for more than two months, Israel began allowing a trickle of supplies to enter for the U.N. several weeks ago. But the U.N says it has been unable to distribute much of the aid because of Israeli military restrictions on movements and because roads that the military designates for its trucks to use are unsafe and vulnerable to looters. The U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome said Thursday that Gaza\u2019s people are projected to fall into acute food insecurity by September, with nearly 500,000 people experiencing extreme food deprivation, leading to malnutrition and starvation. \u201cThis means the risk of famine is really touching the whole of the Gaza Strip,\u201d Rein Paulson, director of the FAO office of emergencies and resilience, said in an interview. Over the past two weeks, shootings have erupted nearly daily in the Gaza Strip in the vicinity of new hubs where desperate Palestinians are being directed to collect food. Witnesses say nearby Israeli troops have opened fire, and more than 80 people have been killed according to Gaza hospital officials. Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid and trying to block it from reaching Palestinians, and has said soldiers fired warning shots or at individuals approaching its troops in some cases. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a newly formed group of mainly American contractors that Israel wants to use to replace humanitarian groups in Gaza that distribute aid in coordination with the U.N., said Friday that all its distribution centers were closed for the day due to the ongoing violence. It urged people to stay away for their own safety, and said it would make an announcement later as to when they would resume distributing humanitarian aid.

Give Now By \u2014 Associated Press Associated Press\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 Palestinians across the war-ravaged Gaza Strip marked the start of one of Islam\u2019s most important holidays with prayers outside destroyed mosques and homes early Friday, with little hope the war with Israel will end soon. With much of Gaza in rubble, men and children were forced to hold the traditional Eid al-Adha prayers in the open air and with food supplies dwindling, families were having to make do with what they could scrape together for the three-day feast. \u201cThis is the worst feast that the Palestinian people have experienced because of the unjust war against the Palestinian people,\u201d said Kamel Emran after attending prayers in the southern city of Khan Younis. \u201cThere is no food, no flour, no shelter, no mosques, no homes, no mattresses \u2026 The conditions are very, very harsh.\u201d The Islamic holiday begins on the 10th day of the Islamic lunar month of Dhul-Hijja, during the Hajj season in Saudi Arabia. For the second year, Muslims in Gaza were not able to travel to Saudi Arabia to perform the traditional pilgrimage. The war broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 hostages. They are still holding 56 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies. Since then, Israel has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians in its military campaign, primarily women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry which does not distinguish between civilians or combatants in its figures.

The nighttime assault lasted for hours and killed three emergency responders in the capital Kyiv, according to authorities. The barrage included 407 drones and 44 ballistic and cruise missiles, Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said. Ukrainian forces said they shot down about 30 of the cruise missiles and up to 200 of the drones. The latest Russian attack came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia \u201cfight for a while\u201d before pulling them apart and pursuing peace. Trump\u2019s comments were a remarkable detour from his often-stated appeals to stop the war and signaled he may be giving up on recent peace efforts. Ukrainian cities have come under regular bombardment since Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022. The attacks have killed more than 12,000 civilians, according to the United Nations. \u201cRussia doesn`t change its stripes,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy, as well as the Ukrainian Interior Ministry and the general prosecutor\u2019s office, said three emergency workers were killed in Kyiv while responding to the Russian strikes. \u201cThey were working under fire to help people,\u201d the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The war has continued unabated even as a U.S.-led diplomatic push for a settlement has brought two rounds of direct peace talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine. The negotiations delivered no significant breakthroughs, however, and the sides remain far apart on their terms for an end to the fighting. Ukraine has offered an unconditional 30-day ceasefire and a meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian leader Vladimir Putin to break the deadlock. But the Kremlin has effectively rejected a truce and hasn\u2019t budged from its demands. \u201cThe Kremlin continues efforts to falsely portray Russia as willing to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, despite Russia\u2019s repeated refusal to offer any concessions,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said late Thursday. Putin said in a phone call with Trump earlier this week that he would respond to Ukraine\u2019s daring long-range attack on Russian air bases on Sunday. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry claimed it had aimed at Ukrainian military targets with \u201clong-range precision weapons\u201d and successfully struck arms depots, drone factories and repair facilities, among other targets. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said the attacks demonstrated key differences between Russia and Ukraine. \u201cThe difference \u2026 is that Ukraine hits legitimate military targets\u2014such as aircraft equipped to bomb our children. Russia targets residential areas, civilians, and critical infrastructure,\u201d Sybiha wrote on X. \u201cPutting Ukraine and Russia on equal footing is unacceptable.\u201d Russia also reports drone attacks In Russia, air defenses shot down 10 Ukrainian drones heading toward the capital early Friday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. Flights at Moscow airports were temporarily suspended during the night as a precaution. Ukrainian drones also targeted three other regions of Russia, authorities said, damaging apartment buildings and industrial plants. Three people were injured, officials said. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 174 Ukrainian drones over 13 regions early Friday. It added that three Ukrainian Neptune missiles were also shot down over the Black Sea. Ukraine struck airfields and other military targets in Russia, such as fuel storage tanks and transport hubs, the Ukrainian General Staff said. Also, a locomotive derailed early Friday in the Belgorod region after the track was blown up, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Russia has recently accused Ukraine of sabotaging the rail network. Ukrainian air defenses are strained In Kyiv, multiple explosions were heard for hours as falling drone debris sparked fires across several districts, said Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Administration. He urged people to seek shelter. Fourteen-year-old Kyiv resident Vitalina Vasylchenko sheltered in a parking garage with her 6-year-old sister and their mother after an explosion blew one of their windows off its hinges. \u201cI heard a buzzing sound, then my dad ran to me and covered me with his hand, then there was a very loud explosion,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole life flashed before my eyes, I already thought that was it. I started having a panic attack \u2026 I\u2019m shocked that I\u2019m alive.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s human rights chief, Dmytro Lubinets, called for a strong international response to Russia\u2019s latest overnight attack, saying the assault violated basic human rights. \u201cRussia is acting like a terrorist, systematically targeting civilian infrastructure,\u201d Lubinets wrote on Telegram. \u201cThe world must respond clearly and take concrete steps, including condemning the aggressor\u2019s actions.\u201d Several districts of Kyiv are hit Authorities reported damage in several districts in Kyiv, and rescue workers responded to damage and fires at multiple locations. In Solomyanskyi district, a fire broke out on the 11th floor of a 16-story residential building. Emergency services evacuated three people from the apartment. The attack caused a blackout in some areas, and more than 2,000 households on Kyiv\u2019s eastern bank were without power, the Kyiv City Administration said. Elsewhere, 10 people were injured by an aerial attack on the western city of Ternopil, regional governor Viacheslav Nehoda said. The strike damaged industrial and infrastructure facilities, left parts of the city without electricity, and disrupted water supplies. Three people were also injured in Ukraine\u2019s central Poltava region. Russia also targeted the western Lviv and Khmelnytskyi regions, and the northern Chernihiv region.

Laura Barron-Lopez: This ban potentially affects thousands of people, including a young girl from Afghanistan. And we're calling her Saira, blurring her face and altering her voice to protect her identity for her safety.She spoke to producer Zeba Warsi from Peshawar in neighboring Pakistan, where she traveled from \u2014 for her U.S. visa appointment. And now she doesn't know where to go.Saira, Student from Afghanistan: As an Afghan student, we cannot study in our country. I waited for one year to complete this process. The applying for a university in the United States is not easy. Laura Barron-Lopez: Despite her best efforts, Saira feels abandoned again. Saira: Although I have successfully obtained a student visa for this fall semester, but this is a new policy is giving me anxiety. Laura Barron-Lopez: Before the Taliban took over in 2021, she was a first year journalism student at Kabul University with big dreams. But the Taliban crushed them. For the last four years, they have banned women and girls from school and from most of public life.But Saira didn't give up. She fought against the Taliban by protesting in Kabul. And, last year, she applied to 11 colleges in the U.S. and got accepted to five. This fall, she was all set to attend a college in Pennsylvania to study political science. Saira: I really want to study political science because I want to work on Afghanistan politics area, especially for women's rights in Afghanistan. My only goal is to use this opportunity in the United States, use the United States \u2014 United States education only for \u2014 to serve for my country, serve for women like me who are suffering right now, who are banned for education, who cannot have their basic rights. Laura Barron-Lopez: Saira is in neighboring Pakistan, where she traveled with her family for her U.S. student visa appointment. But with the many uncertainties around travel restrictions on Afghan nationals like her, she's worried for her future. Saira: What I will do, how I can return back to home, where the Taliban, if they know that I came to Peshawar, Pakistan, for use visa for my \u2014 continuing my education to use, they would probably tell me or do something to me. Currently, my only hope is in United States. And I hope they hear our voices and know our concern that we are relying on your country, on your education. Laura Barron-Lopez: Amna, the White House told \"News Hour\" that a student like Saira would be able to enter the United States because she was already issued her visa before the president issued this proclamation just last night.But, still, students like Saira are very anxious right now because of the president's larger crackdown on foreign national students like her. Amna Nawaz: All right, Laura Barron-Lopez reporting.As usual, wonderful reporting tonight. Thank you. Laura Barron-Lopez: Thank you.

Donald Trump: That's true. Friedrich Merz: America is again in a very strong position to do something on this war and ending this war. We are looking for more pressure on Russia. Nick Schifrin: But more than three years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Trump today suggested the war should maybe continue. Donald Trump: Sometimes, you see two young children fighting like crazy. They hate each other and they're fighting in a park. And you try and pull them apart. They don't want to be pulled. Sometimes, you're better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart. There's some additional fighting that's going to go on. Nick Schifrin: President Trump also said he hadn't read a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal that would impose sanctions on Russia and its trading partners, and any future sanctions could be Imposed both on Russia and Ukraine. Donald Trump: When I see the moment where it's not going to stop, and I'm sure you're going to do the same thing, we will be very, very, very tough. And it could be on both countries, to be honest. Nick Schifrin: Merz became chancellor of a center-right coalition last month. He's promised to help Ukraine build its own weapons and increase Germany's defense spending to 5 percent of gross domestic product.That's the same goal NATO defense ministers negotiated today in Brussels to spend 3.5 percent on defense, plus 1.5 percent on infrastructure. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said NATO members had no choice. Pete Hegseth, U.S. Defense Secretary: We're here to continue the work that President Trump started, which is a commitment to 5 percent defense spending across this alliance, which we think will happen, we think has to happen, by the summit at The Hague later this month. Nick Schifrin: But not all of NATO's 32 countries are on board. Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles. Margarita Robles, Spanish Defense Minister: We think we are able to accomplish these capability targets for Spain with the 2 percent of GDP. Nick Schifrin: U.S. officials say those plans endorsed today born from estimates that Russia is rebuilding its defense industrial base for war beyond Ukraine. NATO hopes to be able to deploy 300,000 troops to Eastern Europe within six months should Russia attack.The U.S. currently has 80,000 troops based in Europe and could reduce that number, Hegseth hinted today. Pete Hegseth: So, there are reasons why we have troops in certain places and we respect and understand that. It's also prudent that we review that force posture in real time alongside our allies and partners to make sure it's right-sized. Nick Schifrin: But NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte expressed confidence in the U.S.' European presence, given the threat posed by Russia. Mark Rutte, NATO Secretary-General: We all know we will be safe for the next couple of years, but then we need to use those years to learn Russian if we don't do this. Nick Schifrin: Today, it is only Ukraine preventing Russia's advance. A defense official tells \"PBS News Hour\" this weekend's attack by Ukrainian drones destroyed about a dozen Russian bombers and damaged about a dozen more. That's less than Ukraine's public estimate.In their phone call yesterday, President Trump warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to respond. Donald Trump: I said, don't do it. You shouldn't do it. You should stop it. But, again, there's a lot of hatred. Nick Schifrin: Merz hoped to convince President Trump today to pressure Russia. But, in Trump's words, the children will continue to tussle.For the \"PBS News Hour,\" I'm Nick Schifrin.

Hana-R\u0101whiti Maipi-Clarke received a seven-day ban and the leaders of her political party, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi, were barred for 21 days. Three days had been the longest ban for a lawmaker from New Zealand\u2019s Parliament before. The lawmakers from Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori Party, performed the haka, a chanting dance of challenge, in November to oppose a widely unpopular bill, now defeated, that they said would reverse Indigenous rights. WATCH: New Zealand\u2019s rightward shift ignites mass protests from Indigenous M\u0101ori people The protest drew global headlines and provoked months of fraught debate among lawmakers about what the consequences for the lawmakers\u2019 actions should be and the place of M\u0101ori culture in Parliament. Why the punishment was so strict A committee of the lawmakers\u2019 peers in April recommended the lengthy bans. It said the lawmakers were not being punished for the haka, but for striding across the floor of the debating chamber toward their opponents while doing it. Judith Collins, the committee chair, said the lawmakers\u2019 behavior was egregious, disruptive and potentially intimidating. Maipi-Clarke, 22, rejected that description Thursday, citing other instances when legislators have left their seats and approached opponents without sanction. The suspended legislators said they are being treated more harshly than others because they are M\u0101ori.

Is that the real issue here?\u201d Maipi-Clarke asked Parliament. \u201cIs that the real intimidation here? Are our voices too loud for this house?\u201d Why this haka was controversial Inside and outside Parliament, the haka has increasingly been welcomed as an important part of New Zealand life. The sacred chant can be a challenge to the viewer but is not violent. As M\u0101ori language and culture have become part of mainstream New Zealand in recent years, haka appear in a range of cultural, somber and celebratory settings. They also have rung out in Parliament to welcome the passage of high-profile laws. Some who decried the protest haka in Parliament cited its timing, with Maipi-Clarke beginning the chant as votes were being tallied and causing a brief suspension of proceedings. She has privately apologized for the disruption to Parliament\u2019s Speaker, she said Thursday. A few lawmakers urged their peers to consider rewriting rules about what lawmakers could do in Parliament to recognize M\u0101ori cultural protocols as accepted forms of protest. One cited changes to allow breastfeeding in the debating chamber as evidence the institution had amended rules before. Who approved the suspensions Normally the parliamentary committee that decides on punishments for errant lawmakers is in agreement on what should happen to them. But panel members were sharply divided over the haka protest and the lengthy punishments were advanced only because the government has more legislators in Parliament than the opposition. One party in the government bloc wanted even longer suspensions and had asked the committee if the M\u0101ori party lawmakers could be jailed. Most in opposition rejected any punishment beyond the one-day ban Maipi-Clarke already served. Speaker Gerry Brownlee urged lawmakers last month to negotiate a consensus and ordered a free-ranging debate that would continue until all agreed to put the sanctions to a vote. But no such accord was reached after hours of occasionally emotional speeches in which opposition lawmakers accused the government of undermining democracy by passing such a severe punishment on its opponents. While the bans were certain to pass, even as the debate began Thursday it remained unclear whether opposition lawmakers would filibuster to prevent the suspensions from reaching a vote. By evening, with no one\u2019s mind changed, all lawmakers agreed the debate should end. Every government lawmaker voted for the punishments, while all opposition members voted against them. The law that prompted the protest Thursday\u2019s debate capped a fraught episode for race relations in New Zealand, beginning with the controversial bill that the M\u0101ori Party lawmakers opposed. The measures would have rewritten principles in the country\u2019s founding document, a treaty between M\u0101ori tribal leaders and representatives of the British Crown signed at the time New Zealand was colonized. The bill\u2019s authors were chagrined by moves from Parliament and the courts in recent decades to enshrine the Treaty of Waitangi\u2019s promises. Opponents warned of constitutional crisis if the law was passed and tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament last November to oppose it. Despite growing recognition for the treaty, M\u0101ori remain disadvantaged on most social and economic metrics compared to non-M\u0101ori New Zealanders.

Israeli strikes overnight and into Thursday meanwhile killed at least 13 people, including three local journalists who were in the courtyard of a hospital, according to health officials in the territory. The military said it targeted a militant in that strike. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the remains of Judih Weinstein and Gad Haggai were recovered and returned to Israel in a special operation by the army and the Shin Bet internal security agency. \u201cTogether with all the citizens of Israel, my wife and I extend our heartfelt condolences to the dear families. Our hearts ache for the most terrible loss. May their memory be blessed,\u201d he said in a statement. Kibbutz Nir Oz announced the deaths of Weinstein, 70, and Haggai, 72, both of whom had Israeli and U.S. citizenship, in December 2023. Weinstein was also a Canadian citizen. The military said they were killed in the Oct. 7 attack and taken into Gaza by the Mujahideen Brigades, the small armed group that it said had also abducted and killed Shiri Bibas and her two small children. The army said it recovered the remains of Weinstein and Haggai overnight into Thursday from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. A teacher who helped children and a chef who played jazz The couple were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of Oct. 7 when Hamas militants stormed across the border and rampaged through several army bases and farming communities. In the early hours of the morning, Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot, and send a message to her family. Weinstein was born in New York and taught English to children with special needs at Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. \u201cMy beautiful parents have been freed. We have certainty,\u201d their daughter, Iris Haggai Liniado, wrote in a Facebook post. She thanked the Israeli military, the FBI and the Israeli and U.S. governments and called for the release of all the remaining hostages. The couple were survived by two sons, two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. Reporters among 13 killed in Israeli strikes At least 10 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in Khan Younis overnight, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. It was not immediately clear if the strikes were related to the recovery mission. WATCH: Israeli attack survivor describes moment Hamas militants kidnapped her husband In Gaza City, three local reporters were killed and six people were wounded in a strike on the courtyard of the al-Ahli Hospital, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. It did not immediately identify the journalists or say which outlets they worked for. The Israeli military said it struck an Islamic Jihad militant operating in the courtyard. The army says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it is embedded in populated areas. Over 180 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the vast majority of them in Gaza, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Israel has said many of those killed in its strikes were militants posing as reporters. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages. They are still holding 56 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies. Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians. Ceasefire talks deadlocked The United States, Egypt and Qatar have been trying to broker another ceasefire and hostage release after Israel ended an earlier truce in March and imposed a blockade that has raised fears of famine, despite being eased in recent weeks. But the talks appear to be deadlocked. Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. It has offered to hand over power to a politically independent Palestinian committee. Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying Israel will only agree to temporary ceasefires to facilitate the return of hostages. He has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is defeated or disarmed and sent into exile. He has said Israel will maintain control over Gaza indefinitely and will facilitate what he refers to as the voluntary emigration of much of its population to other countries. The Palestinians and much of the international community have rejected such plans, viewing them as forcible expulsion that could violate international law.

The families eventually secured a landmark $73 million settlement with Remington, the maker of the rifle. Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

Amna Nawaz: In the day's other headlines: President Trump says he had a good conversation today with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but that it would not lead to \u2014 quote \u2014 \"immediate peace.\"Trump posted on social media that they discussed Ukraine's Sunday attack on Russian aircraft and that Putin said Russia needs to respond. New satellite images show Belaya air base in Eastern Siberia before the attack and after with the ashes of what appear to be Russian bombers on the tarmac.Ukraine also released video today from the attack. Officials claim to have destroyed or damaged 41 Russian warplanes. Moscow says those estimates are exaggerated. Today, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed a temporary cease-fire until he and Putin can meet. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian President (through interpreter): The Russians are not ready for a cease-fire, at least not at the level of the current delegations. They believe this is an issue for the leaders to decide. They told us directly the cease-fire is a matter for a different level. Amna Nawaz: This comes as the Ukraine Contact Defense Group met in Belgium today for the first time without the U.S. secretary of defense. The Pentagon says that scheduling issues prevented Pete Hegseth from attending. The U.S. has played a leading role in the gathering of Ukraine backers. Former Defense Chief Lloyd Austin helped found the group three years ago.Despite his absence from today's gathering, Hegseth will meet with NATO defense ministers in Brussels tomorrow.A federal judge issued an order today to prevent the deportation of Mohamed Sabry Soliman's family. He's the Egyptian man charged in this week's firebomb attack on a Jewish group in Boulder, Colorado. Soliman's wife and five children were taken into federal custody yesterday by U.S. immigration officials. He faces federal hate crime charges and state charges of attempted murder for the attack that injured 15 people.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said today that the family is being processed for removal proceedings. Soliman's family members have not been charged with any crime.In Gaza, an aid group temporarily paused food deliveries today at its three distribution sites. That's after health officials say dozens of Palestinians were killed this week in multiple shootings near the facilities. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says there's been no violence at the sites themselves. Israel's military says it fired near people it described as suspects after firing warning shots and they're looking into reports of injuries.In the meantime, hospital officials say Israeli strikes killed more than two dozen people overnight and into today across Gaza. One of the attacks hit a tent in Gaza City, killing two women and a child.Turning now to India, a stampede outside of a cricket stadium in the southern city of Bengaluru today killed at least 11 people and injured more than 30 others. Thousands of fans had gathered to celebrate the winners of the Indian Premier League. Authorities say the crush began when some people who didn't have passes tried to break into the stadium.Footage from the scene showed the injured being rushed off in ambulances as festivities inside the stadium continued. This comes roughly five months after a stampede at a Hindu religious festival in Northern India killed at least 30 people.In Saudi Arabia, Muslims from around the world are taking part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to mecca amid warnings of excessive heat. People visited the grand mosque today as temperatures soared past 100 degrees. More than 1,300 pilgrims died in high heat last year, prompting changes this time around.Authorities are cautioning people not to go out during the day and children under 12 are banned. The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and is a once-in-a-lifetime obligation for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it.China's Foreign Ministry says that Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 quote \u2014 \"distorted historical facts\" in his statement marking the 36th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Rubio praised the courage of those who were killed, saying \u2014 quote \u2014 \"The world will never forget.\"Security was tight around the square today. China's leaders banned any public commemoration of the events of 1989, when troops were sent in to break up a massive student-led protest. Officials have never released a death toll, though estimates from eyewitnesses and rights group range into the thousands.On Wall Street today, stocks ended mixed after recent gains. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped about 90 points on the day. The Nasdaq rose about 60 points, so around a third of 1 percent. The S&P 500 ended virtually flat.And the groundbreaking gay writer Edmund White has died. Through essays, articles, and dozens of books like the bestselling \"A Boy's Own Story,\" White chronicled gay life in America. He was present at the Stonewall riots in 1969 that sparked the gay rights movement. He later wrote that up until then \u2014 quote \u2014 \"We had all thought homosexuality was a medical term. Suddenly we saw that we could be a minority group with rights, a culture, an agenda.\"White also wrote about the AIDS epidemic and in 1985 learned that he himself was HIV-positive. He later survived two major strokes. Edmund White was 85 years old.

And that\u2019s just how the ruling Communist Party wants it. Security was tight Wednesday around Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square, where weeks of student-led protests shook the party in 1989. Under then-leader Deng Xiaoping, the military was sent in to end the protest on the night of June 3-4. Using live ammunition, soldiers forced their way through crowds that tried to block them from reaching the square. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed, including dozens of soldiers. The party has tried, with some success, to erase what it calls the \u201cpolitical turmoil\u201d of 1989 from the collective memory. It bans any public commemoration or mention of the June 4 crackdown, scrubbing references from the internet. In recent years, that ban has been extended to Hong Kong, where a once-massive annual candlelight vigil is no longer permitted. Police said they brought 10 people on suspicion of breaching public peace to a police station for investigation. Three were still detained late Wednesday, while the rest were allowed to leave. Police also arrested a woman for failing to show her identity document and a man for obstructing police officers from performing their duties. It is only in Taiwan, a self-governing island that is claimed by China but runs its own affairs, that large June 4 gatherings can still take place. The crackdown reinforced Communist Party control Tiananmen Square is a vast space in the center of Beijing with monumental, communist-era buildings along two sides and the mausoleum of Mao Zedong, who founded the communist era in 1949, on the south end. University students occupied this symbolically important site in the spring of 1989. Their calls for freedoms divided the party leadership. The decision to send in troops marked a decisive turning point in the evolution of modern China, keeping the party firmly in control as it loosened economic restrictions. Chinese officials have said the country\u2019s rapid economic development since then proves the decisions made at the time were correct.

The British and German Embassies in Beijing posted videos commemorating the anniversary on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, but they were later taken down, presumably by censors. The Canadian and German Embassies displayed images of a single lit candle on large screens facing the main street. Hong Kong\u2019s once outspoken populace has been cowed In Hong Kong, a carnival showcasing Chinese food and products was held in Victoria Park, where tens of thousands of people used to gather for a candlelight vigil to mark the anniversary. Hong Kong authorities first shut down the vigil during the COVID-19 pandemic and arrested the organizers in 2021. The moves were part of a broader crackdown on dissent following monthslong anti-government protests in 2019 that turned violent and paralyzed parts of the city. A former district council member, Chan Kim-kam, said customs officers questioned her at her shop on the eve of June 4 after she advertised small white candles for sale in an Instagram post titled \u201cJune, we don\u2019t forget.\u201d \u201cYou know, Hong Kongers have become silent lambs after 2019,\u201d said King Ng, who was at the park on Wednesday. Police were out in force to try to prevent any protest, and took several people away from the park on Wednesday. They included a young woman wearing a school uniform and holding flowers, a man who lowered his head in apparent prayer, and a man wearing a white T-shirt reading \u201cVindication for June 4. It\u2019s getting closer and closer.\u201d Police also questioned a woman who lit up a mosquito lamp, but eventually let her go. Rows of electronic candles lit up the windows of the U.S. consulate, and the British consulate projected \u201cVIIV\u201d \u2014 Roman numerals in reference to June 4 \u2014 on one of its walls.

It relies on support principally from the U.S., along with other democratic partners, to deter China from an invasion.

(AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health. Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket. WATCH: The background and career of Casey Means, Trump\u2019s pick for surgeon general A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses. In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found. Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote. Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health. \u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees. The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy. Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients. The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry. Means\u2019 use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry. A compelling origin story Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine. \u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website. Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors. Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures. \u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly\u2019s podcast last year. But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests. During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest. Growing an audience, and selling products Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness. Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry. \u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added. Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer. Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\u201d; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements. She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process. Disclosing conflicts Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\u201d Means said. \u201cWe know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales. Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company. Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship. Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it. Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil\u2019s founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means\u2019 business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means\u2019 advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi\u2019s prediabetes and other ailments. \u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email. While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair. \u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d Potential conflicts pose new ethical questions Means isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.

Give Now By \u2014 Michelle R. Smith, Associated Press Michelle R. Smith, Associated Press By \u2014 Ali Swenson, Associated Press Ali Swenson, Associated Press\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health. Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket. WATCH: The background and career of Casey Means, Trump\u2019s pick for surgeon general A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses. In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found. Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote. Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health. \u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees. The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy. Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients. The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry. Means\u2019 use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry. A compelling origin story Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine. \u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website. Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors. Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures. \u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly\u2019s podcast last year. But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests. During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest. Growing an audience, and selling products Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness. Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations.

Trump\u2019s proclamation was the latest attempt by his Republican administration to prevent the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest college from enrolling a quarter of its students, who account for much of its research and scholarship. Harvard filed a legal challenge on Thursday, asking for a judge to block Trump\u2019s order and calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard\u2019s rejection of White House demands. Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order. A few hours later, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against Trump\u2019s proclamation. Harvard, she said, had demonstrated it would sustain \u201cimmediate and irreparable injury\u201d before she would have an opportunity to hear from the parties in the lawsuit. Burroughs also extended the temporary hold she placed on the administration\u2019s previous attempt to end Harvard\u2019s enrollment of international students. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard\u2019s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork to them for their visas, only to have Burroughs block the action temporarily. Trump\u2019s order this week invoked a different legal authority. If Trump\u2019s measure were to survive this court challenge, it would block thousands of students who are scheduled to go to Harvard\u2019s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for the summer and fall terms. \u201cHarvard\u2019s more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders \u2014 and their dependents \u2014 have become pawns in the government\u2019s escalating campaign of retaliation,\u201d Harvard wrote Thursday in a court filing. While the court case proceeds, Harvard is making contingency plans so students and visiting scholars can continue their work at the university, President Alan Garber said in a message to the campus and alumni. \u201cEach of us is part of a truly global university community,\u201d Garber said Thursday. \u201cWe know that the benefits of bringing talented people together from around the world are unique and irreplaceable.\u201d Harvard has attracted a growing number of the brightest minds from around the world, with international enrollment growing from 11% of the student body three decades ago to 26% today. As those students wait to find out if they\u2019ll be able to attend the university, some are pursuing other options. Rising international enrollment has made Harvard and other elite colleges uniquely vulnerable to Trump\u2019s crackdown on foreign students. Republicans have been seeking to force overhauls of the nation\u2019s top colleges, which they see as hotbeds of \u201cwoke\u201d and antisemitic viewpoints. Garber says the university has made changes to combat antisemitism.

Give Now By \u2014 Associated Press Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal judge has temporarily blocked a proclamation by President Donald Trump that banned foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University. Trump\u2019s proclamation was the latest attempt by his Republican administration to prevent the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest college from enrolling a quarter of its students, who account for much of its research and scholarship. Harvard filed a legal challenge on Thursday, asking for a judge to block Trump\u2019s order and calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard\u2019s rejection of White House demands. Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order. A few hours later, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against Trump\u2019s proclamation. Harvard, she said, had demonstrated it would sustain \u201cimmediate and irreparable injury\u201d before she would have an opportunity to hear from the parties in the lawsuit. Burroughs also extended the temporary hold she placed on the administration\u2019s previous attempt to end Harvard\u2019s enrollment of international students. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard\u2019s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork to them for their visas, only to have Burroughs block the action temporarily. Trump\u2019s order this week invoked a different legal authority. If Trump\u2019s measure were to survive this court challenge, it would block thousands of students who are scheduled to go to Harvard\u2019s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for the summer and fall terms. \u201cHarvard\u2019s more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders \u2014 and their dependents \u2014 have become pawns in the government\u2019s escalating campaign of retaliation,\u201d Harvard wrote Thursday in a court filing. While the court case proceeds, Harvard is making contingency plans so students and visiting scholars can continue their work at the university, President Alan Garber said in a message to the campus and alumni. \u201cEach of us is part of a truly global university community,\u201d Garber said Thursday. \u201cWe know that the benefits of bringing talented people together from around the world are unique and irreplaceable.\u201d Harvard has attracted a growing number of the brightest minds from around the world, with international enrollment growing from 11% of the student body three decades ago to 26% today. As those students wait to find out if they\u2019ll be able to attend the university, some are pursuing other options. Rising international enrollment has made Harvard and other elite colleges uniquely vulnerable to Trump\u2019s crackdown on foreign students. Republicans have been seeking to force overhauls of the nation\u2019s top colleges, which they see as hotbeds of \u201cwoke\u201d and antisemitic viewpoints. Garber says the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its \u201ccore, legally-protected principles,\u201d even after receiving federal ultimatums. Trump\u2019s administration has also taken steps to withhold federal funding from Harvard and other elite colleges that have rejected White House demands related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Harvard\u2019s $53 billion endowment allows it to weather the loss of funding for a time, although Garber has warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d to come.

It has escalated recently after the Department of Homeland Security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students. Harvard says it has complied with the request, but the government said the school\u2019s response was insufficient. The dispute has been building for months after the Trump administration demanded a series of policy and governance changes at Harvard, calling it a hotbed of liberalism and accusing it of tolerating anti-Jewish harassment. Harvard defied the demands, saying they encroached on the university\u2019s autonomy and represented a threat to the freedom of all U.S. universities. Trump officials have repeatedly raised the stakes and sought new fronts to pressure Harvard, cutting more than $2.6 billion in research grants and moving to end all federal contracts with the university. The latest threat has targeted Harvard\u2019s roughly 7,000 international students, who account for half the enrollment at some Harvard graduate schools. \u201cAdmission to the United States to study at an \u2018elite\u2019 American university is a privilege, not a right,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X. \u201cThis Department of Justice will vigorously defend the President\u2019s proclamation suspending the entry of new foreign students at Harvard University based on national security concerns.\u201d WATCH: The words of wisdom shared with the Class of 2025 by commencement speakers Rep.

It provides a loophole to allow students whose entry would \u201cbenefit the national interest,\u201d as determined by federal officials. Trump\u2019s order alleges that Harvard provided data on misconduct by only three students in response to the Homeland Security request, and it lacked the detail to gauge if federal action was needed. Trump concluded that Harvard is either \u201cnot fully reporting its disciplinary records for foreign students or is not seriously policing its foreign students.\u201d \u201cThese actions and failures directly undermine the Federal Government\u2019s ability to ensure that foreign nationals admitted on student or exchange visitor visas remain in compliance with Federal law,\u201d the order said. For foreign students already at Harvard, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will determine if visas should be revoked, Trump wrote. The order is scheduled to last six months. Within 90 days, the administration will determine if it should be renewed, the order said. A State Department cable sent last week to U.S. embassies and consulates said federal officials will begin reviewing the social media accounts of visa applicants who plan to attend, work at or visit Harvard University for any signs of antisemitism.

Increasing the amount that Medicare pays doctors \u2014 especially over the long-term, tied to inflation \u2014 has been a top priority for physicians groups in Washington for years.

At the Coalition for Health AI summit at Stanford University yesterday, NIH principal deputy director Matthew Memoli announced a request for public input on the agency\u2019s AI strategy. The NIH, he said, sees AI as being an integral part of scientific research going forward \u2014 especially as datasets for research swell in size.

It\u2019s a bit surprising that the NIH made such an announcement at an event for the health AI nonprofit, as four House Republicans last year sent letters to federal officials criticizing the government\u2019s relationship to CHAI, resulting in Biden officials stepping down from the CHAI board. \u2013 Brittany Trang\n(If you like this type of content about AI, you should subscribe to Brittany\u2019s newsletter.)\nMove over, Francis Galton\nAmericans\u2019 self-reported race is a poor proxy for their genetic ancestry, according to a large government study published Thursday that could have major implications for how health disparities are researched.\nWriting in the American Journal of Human Genetics, researchers analyzed the genomes of more than 200,000 participants in the All of Us cohort, which was established by the National Institutes of Health to create a dataset that accurately represented the makeup of the United States.

The new study data showed that taurine rises with age, pulling data from 32 monkeys, 39 mice, one cohort of 742 humans, one cohort of 159 humans, and another cohort of 72 humans.\nThe data are a reminder of just how messy and complicated longevity studies can be, and how elusive treatments, or even just reliable markers, for aging remain.

But the agency\u2019s decision may revive the debate over at-home sexual assault kits, at a time when states and companies selling these kits are battling over their legality, writes Rachell Ekroos, a forensic nursing expert.\nThe concept of at-home sexual assault evidence collection kits emerged in the late 2010s at the height of the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement, when companies began offering them as a way to empower survivors to collect forensic evidence privately and on their own terms. But a legal fight over their accuracy soon emerged, and advocacy groups worried about the lack of oversight, quality control, and linkage to support options for the survivor. To understand why Ekroos is worried that the newly approved at-home cervical screening tests will revive the movement for at-home sexual assault kits, read on.\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n- Breakthrough in search for HIV cure leaves researchers \u2018overwhelmed\u2019, The Guardian\n- The 4chan-coded ideology behind Elon Musk\u2019s war on normies, Mother Jones\n- Tim Walz calls out RFK Jr on children\u2019s health: \u2018Just so blatantly false\u2019, The Independent\n- Kennedy says \u2018charlatans\u2019 are no reason to block unproven stem cell treatments, New York Times\n- ADHD feels like it\u2019s everywhere?

Researchers said the findings have major implications for the way health disparities are studied, and how they are discussed in the public sphere.\nThe new paper offered more nuance and consideration to the complicated relationship between race and genetics than past studies, outside commentators said. Its massive dataset and National Institutes of Health authors give authority to its conclusions, which arrive amid a heated debate over the role racial categories play in research as the Trump administration has targeted grants it deems related to \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d as being \u201cunscientific.\u201d\nIn the study, published Thursday in the American Journal of Human Genetics, researchers analyzed the genomes of more than 200,000 participants in the All of Us cohort, which was established by the NIH to create a dataset that accurately represented the makeup of the United States.\nOutside scientists said the study drives home the important differences between race and genetic ancestry. \u201cThe clear message here is that these are two distinct constructs, they mean different things, and they should not be used interchangeably,\u201d said Luisa Borrell, a social epidemiologist at the CUNY School of Public Health who worked on a 2023 National Academies report on the use of race in genetics research.\nJonathan Kahn, a legal and historical scholar at Northeastern Law School who just published a book on the use of diversity in biology and in law, added, \u201cI thought it was thoughtful and much more nuanced than the kind of language geneticists were using about race and variation, even five years ago, let alone 20 years ago. There was a lot of movement towards a subtler, more well-considered examination and articulation of relationships between race and genetic variation.\u201d\nThe study mapped people\u2019s self-reported race with their genetic ancestry, and through several different analyses, it points to a much fuzzier understanding of race, as opposed to thinking of racial groups as distinct and easily defined.\nIn one case, it used body mass index as an example of how broad racial categories can be misleading. The study found that those with West African ancestry were predisposed to have a high BMI while those with East African ancestry were predisposed to not have a high BMI, but those groups may be lumped together if a study just accounts for someone having African ancestry.\nThe study also revealed how differences in race mapped out across the United States, which is likely the result of migration to different parts of the country from different parts of the world. The paper also hones in on Latinos as an example where a socially defined group of people doesn\u2019t map neatly onto genetic ancestry.\n\u201cAs a representation of the general U.S. population and how complicated it is, this is a pretty big advance, and an important set of results,\u201d said Sasha Gusev, a statistical geneticist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He noted that other studies have pointed out the incongruence between race and genetic ancestry, but those have typically been from smaller biobanks that intentionally collect data from racially minoritized groups. He added that the kind of geographic analyses the study did could only be done because it was a national cohort. \u201cIt also speaks to the fact that not only is racial self-identification a construct, but it\u2019s one that differs across different parts of the country.\u201d\nThe study could have a profound influence on the way geneticists conduct and frame their work. Historically, the idea that race was inextricably linked to biology was used to justify health disparities and other forms of racial bias.\nThere has generally been two camps in the field \u2014 one that claims race is a social construct and a biological understanding of race is too simplistic, and the other that says race is a discrete, identifiable group and is the primary driver in a person\u2019s trajectory. The new study reinforces the shortfalls of using socially defined racial categories in genetics work.\n\u201cRace and ethnicity are poor proxies for genetic ancestry; therefore, biomedical research should adjust directly for ancestries estimated from genetic data rather than relying on self-identified race or ethnicity,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Charles Rotimi, scientific director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, wrote in an email to reporters.\nJust minutes after that email was sent, an NIH spokesperson responded, \u201cHi all \u2013 please hold on using these responses until you hear from me,\u201d but did not follow up by the time of publication.\nSTAT reached out to the paper\u2019s co-authors outside of the NIH. Only one responded, writing that \u201call communication related to the paper is under review by HHS, and we do not have approval to participate in press interviews.\u201d\nThe screening of scientists\u2019 communications contrasts with NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya\u2019s promise to foster a culture of free speech. Bhattacharya\u2019s boss, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has similarly pledged to promote \u201cradical transparency.\u201d\nAfter publication, NIH made Rotimi available for an interview. He said the study results point to race being the wrong way to think about a person\u2019s risk of disease \u2014 and should encourage researchers to think of people on a more individual level. The results don\u2019t necessarily invalidate previous work that has found genetic differences between races, he said, but \u201cthose past findings are not as precise as they should have been, or they should be. As we gather more data with large cohorts like All of Us, we should be in a better position to truly characterize people.\u201d\nA fraught history\nThe current study is part of a long and often-fraught history of geneticists and ideas of race.\nSince Charles Darwin proposed the basics of what would become the field of genetics, people have tried to apply its principles to racial groups. Soon after Darwin proposed his theory of evolution, his cousin, Francis Galton, created the foundations of what would become the eugenics movement. On the first page of his book \u201cHereditary Genius,\u201d Galton writes he was interested in understanding \u201cthe mental peculiarities of different races.\u201d\n\u201cHe spent his career trying to, in the primitive ways that were available at the time, prove that Europeans were biologically superior. It\u2019s continuous, since then, it\u2019s never, ever been dropped,\u201d said Eric Turkheimer, a behavior geneticist at the University of Virginia who has written about the way Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again movement could affect the field of genomics.\nThe All of Us cohort was launched in 2018 to create a database of genetic data that more accurately represented the U.S. \u2014 but even it has had a spotty past when it comes to discussing race.\nThe program caught some flak last year for a paper published by some of its scientists because it used a method of genetic visualization, called UMAP, that can artificially create distinct clusters in data. Several geneticists argued that it amplified genetic differences in racial groups in a misleading way. The worry at the time was that it could send the message that it was reifying a genetic basis for racial groups, a concern that was only amplified because genetics research has at times been used to justify white supremacy.\n\u201cThe majority of population geneticists try not to promote the narrative that there are these discrete genetic racial clusters, because that\u2019s not what the data tells us, not what the last 70 years of research tell us,\u201d said Jedidiah Carlson, a population geneticist who has studied how some population genetics data are used in right-wing circles. While he has not studied the 2024 paper specifically, he did note it seems to be shared frequently by conservatives.\n\u2018Open to interpretation\u2019\nThe new paper does not mince words in its recommendation to scientists, but how it may be interpreted by the general public is much harder to pin down.\nWhile the text and analyses of the paper point to race being a social construct, the way that the paper still leans on ancestry by subcontinental groups could allow for people to interpret the paper as simply calling for more granular racial categories.\n\u201cYou can build a narrative around this that says, \u2018Our socially constructed view is completely true.\u2019 You can also build another view, which is, \u2018It\u2019s a little different than we thought it was back in the day. But the socially defined races look like they have pretty different ancestry components,\u2019\u201d said Aaron Panofsky, the director of the Institute for Society and Genetics at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied how conservatives have used genetics. He said that the paper is written in such a way that it \u201cdoes not just double down on all these straightforward, old-style ways of talking about it, but it can\u2019t emancipate itself from the problematic space of race and ethnicity. In some ways, it slips back in, and I believe it contradicts it. I think it\u2019s very open to interpretation. It doesn\u2019t settle anything.\u201d\nAnother potential interpretation is that the paper supports the rationale the NIH has used in recent weeks when terminating research grants it deems related to DEI, which states, \u201cResearch programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry.\u201d\nFor his part, Rotimi, the lead author, said he tries to stay out of politics and likes \u201cmy data to speak for me.\u201d He said his lab views race \u201cas really a social construct. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not useful, but it\u2019s truly a social construct. And the best way I can describe that is to say that trying to use genetics to define race or to use genetics to support our racial classification is like slicing soup. You can cut all you want \u2014 that soup is going to stay mixed.\u201d\nHe added that \u201cwhen we use concepts as broad as European or Africans or Asians, we distort our understanding of genetic variation, and that distortion can put individuals at risk when we try to prescribe medicine or when we try to treat them.\u201d\nKahn and others noted the paper is making what could be a radical shift in thinking about the role race plays in medical research. In the past, geneticists have largely chalked up variation by race in health outcomes that couldn\u2019t be explained by other variables as genetic differences they did not fully understand yet. But the paper instead says that race is likely a proxy for environmental factors.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying this because we\u2019re a bunch of woke, leftist scientists, we are saying this because this is going to improve the science that we\u2019re doing,\u201d Carlson said. But he also worries that if the paper garners negative attention, it could have a chilling effect on further research that confronts genetic determinism.\nKahn lauded the paper\u2019s use of the word \u201cvariation\u201d as opposed to \u201cdiversity,\u201d a word that he says may have encouraged the connection between the idea of race and genetics.\n\u201cThe two concepts, the social and biological understandings of diversity, have been doing this sort of dance around each other, and sometimes they\u2019re in productive juxtaposition. But oftentimes they\u2019re entangled, and it\u2019s just a mess,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat I see this paper doing is providing a potential template to keep these concepts from being entangled in a way that is both scientifically unproductive but also politically volatile. So I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misspelled Jonathan Kahn\u2019s name in one instance.

Specifically, the use of anti-anxiety meds, antidepressants, or hypnotics/sedatives was associated with a 34%, 26%, and 21% higher risk of ALS respectively. Using these drugs before diagnosis was also linked with poor survival afterward.\nResearchers analyzed data from all patients diagnosed with ALS in Sweden between 2015 and 2023. That constituted more than 1,000 people, each of whom was age- and sex-matched with up to five people from the general population, as well as their siblings and spouses.\nThe results shouldn\u2019t be seen as cause to quit your meds. For people who used medication within a year before their ALS diagnosis, the link could reflect reverse causation, the authors wrote, as the disease can come with psychiatric symptoms. And even for people who used these meds more than five years before their diagnosis, the psych conditions could be initial symptoms.

Yet a new policy from the National Institutes of Health blindsided U.S. researchers and could immediately upend the international research collaborations critical for understanding and responding to global health threats.\nMost of NIH\u2019s research is conducted through grants awarded to U.S. universities and research institutions. When these projects involve collaborative work overseas, U.S.-based researchers need to establish subcontracts with international partners who have the local expertise and infrastructure needed to carry out the research.\nFor example, for a U.S. research team to be able to study the development of HIV drug resistance in sub-Saharan Africa, they need to develop and put in place subcontracts with Africa-based research teams and local clinics providing HIV treatment. Those collaborators can then hire or pay staff members to help the U.S.-based team develop the research protocol that is tailored to the local context, obtain local ethical approval, administer the research project (including consenting of participant volunteers, collection of specimens and other scientific data, conduct laboratory testing), collaborate on data analysis, and co-author scientific manuscripts to disseminate the research findings. Subcontracts outline the scope of work, deliverables, and a budget, and also help ensure scientific and fiscal accountability to the scientists leading the project.\nOn May 1, without warning NIH announced a disruptive policy that affects both new and active grants, eliminating the use of subcontracts with research partners at institutions outside the U.S. Instead, those institutions must apply to become direct NIH grantees themselves. This policy shift effectively eliminates \u2014 sometimes immediately \u2014 the support for many of the NIH\u2019s most impactful global scientific collaborations, leaving scientists unable to pay staff or cover operating costs, while they await a yet-to-be-defined process that won\u2019t be available until the end of September at the earliest. The lack of a clear process and guidance on how to move forward is immediately affecting an estimated 1,800 active international health research projects totaling $10 billion in U.S. taxpayer investment, including ongoing clinical trials in which participants are receiving drugs, vaccines, or other interventions under investigation whose impacts are not yet \u2014 and may never be \u2014 known.\nMany of the affected global research projects have not only generated knowledge that has saved lives abroad but also driven innovation here in the U.S. This sweeping policy change effectively slows or halts scientific progress against HIV, tuberculosis, Covid-19, mpox, and other fast-moving epidemics.\nThe NIH claims this new policy is needed to improve oversight, protect national security, and ensure that research funded by U.S. taxpayers advances U.S. interests. However, it already has systems to help ensure accountability with foreign subcontracts, and there is no evidence of widespread fund misuse justifying an abrupt policy shift that destabilizes global scientific collaborations.\nI\u2019ve spent more than 20 years in public health research, leading and collaborating on NIH-supported global studies to improve HIV treatment outcomes, including those aimed at monitoring and strengthening the impact of HIV treatment programs supported by U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria. This research has been vital in helping to improve health outcomes abroad and in seeding innovations that improve HIV care delivery in the U.S. They represent a high return on U.S. taxpayer investment.\nOne of my international collaborations, focused on optimizing HIV treatment using data from over 40 countries, was abruptly halted due to this new NIH policy. For decades, the work on this project has shaped clinical guidelines, strengthened HIV care systems, and helped prevent infections and deaths among infants, adolescents, and pregnant women. The project, which necessarily included subcontracts to organizations in countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, has not been renewed because of these subcontracts, stopping work and payments to collaborators and research staff in the U.S. and abroad. Funding is being withheld while we try to find a way, without any clear guidance, to continue the research without international subcontracts.\nThat\u2019s not oversight \u2014 it\u2019s both obstructive and destructive to critical research collaborations.\nThis change is also hurting U.S. institutions. These partnerships support U.S. jobs, sustain university-based research teams, and train the next generation of scientists. If the NIH isolates U.S. researchers from the rest of the world, we risk falling behind \u2014 not just scientifically, but diplomatically and economically. And the U.S. risks a scientific brain drain. Indeed, as the NIH pulls back, the European Union is recruiting top U.S. scientists.\nThe rollout process of this policy was especially troubling. It took effect the same day it was released. There was no consultation with grantees, no public comment period, and no transition plan. Changes of this magnitude and with such high-stakes implications should be informed by those who understand how they will play out and deployed with ample lead time to allow transition planning to minimize negative impacts. Instead, the NIH imposed the sweeping policy overnight without transparency or concern for the consequences. That\u2019s not how good policy is made.\nThis policy did not arise in a vacuum. As an anonymous NIH employee recently wrote that we are witnessing a form of \u201cimpoundment\u201d by default \u2014 a quiet and corrosive withholding of research dollars that bypasses normal oversight and appropriations processes. With the fiscal year ending in September, these policies and slowdowns in awarding grants mean that billions of dollars earmarked by Congress for NIH-supported science will be lost if they are not disbursed soon.\nMany of us were worried that something like this could happen. Beginning in March, as U.S. global and domestic health policy entered a period of rapid change, more than 150 scientists and public health leaders from 41 countries \u2014 including me \u2014 signed a declaration warning that abrupt, unilateral policies like this one threaten the infrastructure needed to detect and respond to global health threats. The declaration emphasizes the essential need for global cohort studies and collaborations to fill the growing gaps in evidence and situational awareness needed to respond to and ensure continued progress against global health threats.\nNIH Director Jay Bhattacharya should immediately pause implementation of this policy, at least until another workable system is in place. He should consult with scientists, funders, and global partners to develop a more workable and transparent path forward. Any new policy should avoid sweeping reforms that abruptly destabilize high-functioning systems without warning or consideration of their consequences.\nInstead of an abrupt overhaul, the NIH could have introduced a transition period while finalizing the policy, with structured consultation and clear criteria for when foreign subawards will require enhanced oversight or should be elevated to direct grantees. A smarter, more efficient, and science-friendly policy would build on existing accountability tools while preserving vital scientific collaborations. Any new system should ensure that the lead institution retains both scientific and fiscal oversight of work by international collaborators that is being supported under the project.\nIf NIH leadership will not act, then the House Committee on Appropriations must examine whether this policy amounts to a backdoor impoundment of funds, effectively defying both Congress and taxpayers.\nGlobal health collaborations depend on trust, continuity, and shared purpose. If we sever those ties now, the world will be slower to detect the next pathogen, lose progress against the current threats, and be more alone when the next crisis hits.\nIt\u2019s not too late to protect the science and collaborative partnerships that keep us all safer. The NIH should reverse course \u2014 before the damage becomes permanent.\nDenis Nash is a distinguished professor of epidemiology at the City University of New York\u2019s Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy.

It read, \u201cBritish science is alive and well \u2026 and living in the United States.\u201d\nIn the future, a similar article might reflect China or other nations successfully exploiting the decay in American research and development.\nBehind nearly every prescription filled in America lies a powerful engine of innovation, fueled by the research conducted within the nation\u2019s universities. Picking up a new prescription at the pharmacy represents the culmination of a decades-long choreography between the private, public, and academic sectors that drives this country\u2019s medical innovation and ensures the most cutting-edge care and technology are available here.\nOver the past few decades, the foundational science that informs the basic understanding of the human body\u2019s ailments or the applied research to develop treatments has nearly always begun in an American research university. While pharmaceutical companies, like Merck and Bayer, have become household names, rarely is there an understanding of the academic roots of a new drug or therapy: foundations that in most cases date back years or decades.\nTo quantify this impact, we launched a research project, which is currently preprint, that sought to ask questions about the value of America\u2019s universities to society. We used the narrow area of pharmaceutical drugs as a representative example.\nMany things within academia are measured, from graduation rates and alumni earnings to the economic impact of a campus. Research outputs \u2014 which propel everything from medicine and technology to the military and environmental protection \u2014 provide another opportunity to assess contributions from the nation\u2019s ivory towers. By identifying the inventors of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (and the key patents curated in the FDA Orange Book), our review revealed that from 2020 to 2024, universities contributed patents underpinning 50% of FDA-approved drugs. Even more stunningly, 87% of those academic breakthroughs came from American institutions.\nAchieving a patent listed in the FDA Orange Book is a high bar that requires rigorous review. These key patents can determine when a pioneering medicine loses its proprietary protection and can be offered as a generic formulation. Historically, pharmaceutical companies have preferred to keep these valuable jewels in-house given the financial returns, and our earlier research shows that prior to the 21st century, private sector companies dominated pharmaceutical patents and inventorship. This dominance began to crack in the new millennium, with academic inventors and entrepreneurs playing an increasing role as we progressed through the 2000s and 2010s.\nThese new findings have profound implications. From an economic standpoint, pharmaceutical products account for a substantial and rising portion of American consumer spending and economic activity. The 10 largest pharmaceutical companies have a combined market capitalization of more than $2 trillion. Our updated findings demonstrate that over the past 50 years, these companies have become increasingly reliant upon academic inventors to provide new medicines.\nThis value is even more remarkable given that our new findings are limited to applied research and do not include the impact of fundamental research performed by many academic scientists. Previous work from our team and others has demonstrated that NIH-funded basic science has contributed to the development of more than 90% of new medicines, vaccines, and devices.\nIt must also be recognized that American dominance of drug development allows the nation to determine \u2014 indeed, to dictate \u2014 the diseases studied, and interventions developed. A recent poll in Nature found that 75% of scientists in America were considering leaving the country. Were the nation to allow its academic enterprise to wither, decisions about which diseases to treat and which therapies to develop will be made elsewhere.\nThe rise of American domination began in the post-war era based on the vision of Vannevar Bush, who led the Manhattan Project and served as an adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Bush, in his seminal report, \u201cScience \u2014 The Endless Frontier,\u201d advocated for the need for basic research to ensure national and economic security. This far-sightedness allowed the United States to assert its leadership of the biotechnology revolution that began 50 years ago. The nation\u2019s public and economic health benefited from both training and retaining the world\u2019s top minds.\nLooking to the future, China has been investing heavily in both academic research and pharmaceutical development and seeks to displace American hegemony. Such changes have occurred before: The roots of the pharmaceutical industry were largely located in European nations, especially the United Kingdom and Germany, through the first half of the 20th century.\nAmerican institutions and the innovators within them have succeeded based on a contract between the federal government and U.S. research universities. The result of major funding for research created the country we know today and is why America has been the dominant player in the development of drugs to treat disease and improve lives of people around the globe. The nation\u2019s research universities are indispensable to pharmaceutical innovation, and continued federal support for academic research is essential to maintain U.S. leadership in global drug development and broad economic growth.\nMichael Kinch, Ph.D., is chief innovation officer at Stony Brook University.

For example, a doctor searching for the efficacy of xanomeline-tropsime chloride (a schizophrenia medication) will see detailed results, including charts, pulled from a recent JAMA publication. The company earlier this year announced a similar deal with the New England Journal of Medicine. The company\u2019s CEO and founder Daniel Nadler told me the company\u2019s approach here is like Disney+. Doctors who want to search for information published by top journals and specialty societies will need to use OpenEvidence, just like people who want to stream Moana will need to go to Disney.\nA streaming service isn\u2019t the comparison that immediately comes to mind for OpenEvidence. Founded in 2022, the service uses a conversational prompt interface and generates responses much like OpenAI\u2018s ChatGPT, and OpenEvidence is competing with products like UpToDate that doctors use to search for evidence when making clinical decisions. From the earliest days, Nadler said the big differentiator for OpenEvidence, compared to generative AI chatbots, was that it cites its sources. He said that company has taken care to design the system so that it doesn\u2019t invent answers the way other generative AI products do \u2014 in many cases, the service will respond to queries with verbatim text from studies. He said OpenEvidence is fundamentally a search product designed for the very narrow use case of doctors looking for medical evidence. He said the company\u2019s \u201cmost valuable secret sauce\u201d is a machine learning search algorithm, and he compared the company\u2019s technology to \u201ca really phenomenal colored number sticky system\u201d that a student might use to label a textbook for an open book exam. The product is free for doctors and supported by advertising. The search is HIPAA compliant.\nSo far, OpenEvidence has produced impressive numbers. Nadler said that about 350,000 doctors have registered and on average the company fields \u201c7.2 million clinical consultations a month.\u201d OpenEvidence recently announced a $75 million fundraise led by Sequoia at a $1 billion valuation. It was recently reported that the company is in talks Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins to raise over $100 million more \u2014 Nadler didn\u2019t confirm the raise but confirmed that those firms are investors in OpenEvidence.\nAre you a doctor using OpenEvidence or other AI search tools in your practice? We\u2019re hoping to speak to as many as possible. Reach out if so.\nTakeaways from Medicare\u2019 big DC tech party\nA who\u2019s who of health IT leaders descended on the Hubert Humphrey building in DC on Tuesday for an invite-only event about how the federal health department\u2019s Medicare agency and its health IT regulator might better facilitate the flow of data in the health care system. In recent weeks, Medicare officials have been beating the tech modernization drum. They hope to stimulate the development of more advanced tech products, including AI tools to help people manage their health.\nMy invite must\u2019ve gotten lost in the mail, but a few takeaways from what I heard:\n- CMS spelled out five priority tech areas it hopes to work on, including a few I hinted at in my story last week \u2014 a simpler digital identity authentication system for Medicare, and a national provider directory. The agency said will expand its Blue Button API that allows developers to help patients access their data, and it will plow forward with Data at the Point of Care, an initiative to make Medicare claims data easily accessible to providers so they can better understand a patient\u2019s medical history. Finally, and most provocatively, the agency said it will participate in \u201ctrusted data exchange.\u201d\n- That last one is kind of a doozy! As Lisa Bari, an executive at Innovaccer and a former CMS official, pointed out on LinkedIn, it was a Rorschach Test\u2014 people saw what they wanted to see. If you are in favor of TEFCA (the government supported data sharing framework that\u2019s been inching forward), you saw this as an endorsement of TEFCA. If you are against TEFCA and prefer to see the government support open standards that allow all manner of data sharing frameworks to flourish, you saw the failure to spell out T-E-F-C-A as a very telling omission. As I reported in STAT Health Tech earlier in the week, a health department budget document for 2026 suggested that ASTP/ONC, the HHS IT regulator, will continue to support TEFCA. Is there a disconnect between ASTP and CMS here?\n- It\u2019s notable that CMS announced its plans as health care organizations are mulling responses to an expansive request for information meant to inform its thinking. I\u2019m not saying that the RFI won\u2019t be carefully read by people at CMS, and that it won\u2019t guide policy. But it\u2019s been clear from the very beginning that the super detailed RFI came from leaders who very much have plans in mind.\nI\u2019m following the Medicare RFI and its tech modernization agenda closely. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts about it. Please reach out.\nCHAI descends on Stanford, teasing NIH news\nBrittany Trang writes with updates related to the Coalition for Health AI:\n- Earlier this week, the organization announced that Pacific AI, an AI governance and compliance organization, will go through CHAI\u2019s new assurance service provider certification process and join CHAI\u2019s list of approved vendors. What\u2019s assurance service provider certification? Check out Brittany\u2019s recent AI Prognosis to learn about CHAI\u2019s pivot from \u201cassurance labs\u201d to this broader certification for services across the AI lifecycle. Interestingly, Pacific AI will help CHAI write the standards that will be used to CHAI-certify AI governance providers, including itself \u2014 which seems like a conflict of interest. When asked about this, a CHAI spokesperson said that vendors, health systems, attorneys and others are helping them write these standards and that it\u2019s \u201cconsistent with all of our other working groups and thought processes around gaining consensus.\u201d\n- Also, CHAI\u2019s big summit is taking place today and tomorrow at Stanford, and National Institutes of Health principal deputy director Matthew Memoli is slated to \u201cshare AI-related news\u201d at the conference. Stay tuned for an update.\nFDA AI updates, an Eli Lilly app, and more\n- On Monday, Brittany Trang broke the news that FDA was set to release it generative AI tool, Elsa, to workers. Brittany has fresh intel on the tool, how the rollout is going, and what industry thinks of it in her AI Prognosis newsletter.\n- Welldoc announced that it\u2019s the developer behind a new app meant to support people on Eli Lilly\u2018s GLP-1 medications. It includes features like medication reminders, medication information, and educational content. Welldoc is best known for its apps that support people with diabetes.\n- Yahoo Finance reported that CVS Health plans to spend $20 billion (!) on a broad effort to improve the consumer experience of health care. Executive Keith Shah spelled out some of the ambitions on LinkedIn.\n- h2, a platform for information about providers, acquired Veda Data Solutions, which works on ensuring accuracy of provider data. h2 earlier this year acquired Ribbon Health, another company working in the provider data space.\n- TeleTracking, a platform that helps hospitals manage operations, has a new deal with Palantir Technologies to develop analytics for applications like optimizing staffing.\n- Rune Labs, developer of an app for tracking Parkinson\u2019s disease symptoms for the Apple Watch, is working with the Parkinson\u2019s Foundation on research to correlate genetic data of people with the disease to digital data. A few years ago, I wrote about Rune and others using the Apple Watch to help people manage their Parkinson\u2019s.\n- Two former Ginkgo Bioworks employees, including Renee Wegrzyn, the former head of federal health moonshot agency ARPA-H \u2014 are starting on a new AI venture called Transfyr.

He labeled those contracts \u201cMUNCHABLE.\u201d\nThe code, using outdated and inexpensive AI models, produced results with glaring mistakes. For instance, it hallucinated the size of contracts, frequently misreading them and inflating their value. It concluded more than a thousand were each worth $34 million, when in fact some were for as little as $35,000.\nThe DOGE AI tool flagged more than 2,000 contracts for \u201cmunching.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how many have been or are on track to be canceled \u2014 the Trump administration\u2019s decisions on VA contracts have largely been a black box. The VA uses contractors for many reasons, including to support hospitals, research and other services aimed at caring for ailing veterans.\nVA officials have said they\u2019ve killed nearly 600 contracts overall. Congressional Democrats have been pressing VA leaders for specific details of what\u2019s been canceled without success.\nWe identified at least two dozen on the DOGE list that have been canceled so far. Among the canceled contracts was one to maintain a gene sequencing device used to develop better cancer treatments. Another was for blood sample analysis in support of a VA research project. Another was to provide additional tools to measure and improve the care nurses provide.\nProPublica obtained the code and the contracts it flagged from a source and shared them with a half dozen AI and procurement experts. All said the script was flawed. Many criticized the concept of using AI to guide budgetary cuts at the VA, with one calling it \u201cdeeply problematic.\u201d\nCary Coglianese, professor of law and of political science at the University of Pennsylvania who studies the governmental use and regulation of artificial intelligence, said he was troubled by the use of these general-purpose large language models, or LLMs. \u201cI don\u2019t think off-the-shelf LLMs have a great deal of reliability for something as complex and involved as this,\u201d he said.\nSahil Lavingia, the programmer enlisted by DOGE, which was then run by Elon Musk, acknowledged flaws in the code.\n\u201cI think that mistakes were made,\u201d said Lavingia, who worked at DOGE for nearly two months. \u201cI\u2019m sure mistakes were made. Mistakes are always made. I would never recommend someone run my code and do what it says. It\u2019s like that \u2018Office\u2019 episode where Steve Carell drives into the lake because Google Maps says drive into the lake. Do not drive into the lake.\u201d\nThough Lavingia has talked about his time at DOGE previously, this is the first time his work has been examined in detail and the first time he\u2019s publicly explained his process, down to specific lines of code.\nLavingia has nearly 15 years of experience as a software engineer and entrepreneur but no formal training in AI. He briefly worked at Pinterest before starting Gumroad, a small e-commerce company that nearly collapsed in 2015. \u201cI laid off 75% of my company \u2014 including many of my best friends. It really sucked,\u201d he said. Lavingia kept the company afloat by \u201creplacing every manual process with an automated one,\u201d according to a post on his personal blog.\nLavingia did not have much time to immerse himself in how the VA handles veterans\u2019 care between starting on March 17 and writing the tool on the following day. Yet his experience with his own company aligned with the direction of the Trump administration, which has embraced the use of AI across government to streamline operations and save money.\nLavingia said the quick timeline of Trump\u2019s February executive order, which gave agencies 30 days to complete a review of contracts and grants, was too short to do the job manually. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible \u2014 you have 90,000 contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you write some code. But even then it\u2019s not really possible.\u201d\nUnder a time crunch, Lavingia said he finished the first version of his contract-munching tool on his second day on the job \u2014 using AI to help write the code for him. He told ProPublica he then spent his first week downloading VA contracts to his laptop and analyzing them.\nVA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz lauded DOGE\u2019s work on vetting contracts in a statement to ProPublica. \u201cAs far as we know, this sort of review has never been done before, but we are happy to set this commonsense precedent,\u201d he said.\nThe VA is reviewing all of its 76,000 contracts to ensure each of them benefits veterans and is a good use of taxpayer money, he said. Decisions to cancel or reduce the size of contracts are made after multiple reviews by VA employees, including agency contracting experts and senior staff, he wrote.\nKasperowicz said that the VA will not cancel contracts for work that provides services to veterans or that the agency cannot do itself without a contingency plan in place. He added that contracts that are \u201cwasteful, duplicative or involve services VA has the ability to perform itself\u201d will typically be terminated.\nTrump officials have said they are working toward a \u201cgoal\u201d of cutting around 80,000 people from the VA\u2019s workforce of nearly 500,000. Most employees work in one of the VA\u2019s 170 hospitals and nearly 1,200 clinics.\nThe VA has said it would avoid cutting contracts that directly impact care out of fear that it would cause harm to veterans. ProPublica recently reported that relatively small cuts at the agency have already been jeopardizing veterans\u2019 care.\nThe VA has not explained how it plans to simultaneously move services in-house, as Lavingia\u2019s code suggested was the plan, while also slashing staff.\nMany inside the VA told ProPublica the process for reviewing contracts was so opaque they couldn\u2019t even see who made the ultimate decisions to kill specific contracts. Once the \u201cmunching\u201d script had selected a list of contracts, Lavingia said he would pass it off to others who would decide what to cancel and what to keep. No contracts, he said, were terminated \u201cwithout human review.\u201d\n\u201cI just delivered the [list of contracts] to the VA employees,\u201d he said. \u201cI basically put munchable at the top and then the others below.\u201d\nVA staffers told ProPublica that when DOGE identified contracts to be canceled early this year \u2014 before Lavingia was brought on \u2014 employees sometimes were given little time to justify retaining the service. One recalled being given just a few hours. The staffers asked not to be named because they feared losing their jobs for talking to reporters.\nAccording to one internal email that predated Lavingia\u2019s AI analysis, staff members had to respond in 255 characters or fewer \u2014 just shy of the 280 character limit on Musk\u2019s X social media platform.\nOnce he started on DOGE\u2019s contract analysis, Lavingia said he was confronted with technological limitations. At least some of the errors produced by his code can be traced to using older versions of OpenAI models available through the VA \u2014 models not capable of solving complex tasks, according to the experts consulted by ProPublica.\nMoreover, the tool\u2019s underlying instructions were deeply flawed. Records show Lavingia programmed the AI system to make intricate judgments based on the first few pages of each contract \u2014 about the first 2,500 words \u2014 which contain only sparse summary information.\n\u201cAI is absolutely the wrong tool for this,\u201d said Waldo Jaquith, a former Obama appointee who oversaw IT contracting at the Treasury Department. \u201cAI gives convincing looking answers that are frequently wrong. There needs to be humans whose job it is to do this work.\u201d\nLavingia\u2019s prompts did not include context about how the VA operates, what contracts are essential or which ones are required by federal law. This led AI to determine a core piece of the agency\u2019s own contract procurement system was \u201cmunchable.\u201d\nAt the core of Lavingia\u2019s prompt is the direction to spare contracts involved in \u201cdirect patient care.\u201d\nSuch an approach, experts said, doesn\u2019t grapple with the reality that the work done by doctors and nurses to care for veterans in hospitals is only possible with significant support around them.\nLavingia\u2019s system also used AI to extract details like the contract number and \u201ctotal contract value.\u201d This led to avoidable errors, where AI returned the wrong dollar value when multiple were found in a contract. Experts said the correct information was readily available from public databases.\nLavingia acknowledged that errors resulted from this approach but said those errors were later corrected by VA staff.\nIn late March, Lavingia published a version of the \u201cmunchable\u201d script on his GitHub account to invite others to use and improve it, he told ProPublica. \u201cIt would have been cool if the entire federal government used this script and anyone in the public could see that this is how the VA is thinking about cutting contracts.\u201d\nAccording to a post on his blog, this was done with the approval of Musk before he left DOGE. \u201cWhen he asked the room about improving DOGE\u2019s public perception, I asked if I could open-source the code I\u2019d been writing,\u201d Lavingia said. \u201cHe said yes \u2014 it aligned with DOGE\u2019s goal of maximum transparency.\u201d\nThat openness may have eventually led to Lavingia\u2019s dismissal. Lavingia confirmed he was terminated from DOGE after giving an interview to Fast Company magazine about his work with the department. A VA spokesperson declined to comment on Lavingia\u2019s dismissal.\nVA officials have declined to say whether they will continue to use the \u201cmunchable\u201d tool moving forward. But the administration may deploy AI to help the agency replace employees. Documents previously obtained by ProPublica show DOGE officials proposed in March consolidating the benefits claims department by relying more on AI.\nAnd the government\u2019s contractors are paying attention. After Lavingia posted his code, he said he heard from people trying to understand how to keep the money flowing.\n\u201cI got a couple DMs from VA contractors who had questions when they saw this code,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were trying to make sure that their contracts don\u2019t get cut. Or learn why they got cut.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, humans are the ones terminating the contracts, but it is helpful for them to see how DOGE or Trump or the agency heads are thinking about what contracts they are going to munch. Transparency is a good thing.\u201d\nIf you have any information about the misuse or abuse of AI within government agencies, Brandon Roberts is an investigative journalist on the news applications team and has a wealth of experience using and dissecting artificial intelligence.

Murphy had instructed officials to arrange reasonable fear interviews when he ruled in May that they could not be sent to South Sudan.\n\u201cThe judge did NOT require that anyone be \u2018stranded\u2019 anywhere,\u201d said Reichlin-Melnick. \u201cIn fact, it was the Trump administration that asked the judge for permission to hold the men in Djibouti! ICE could literally bring the men to any other U.S. base (or back to the U.S.) at any time!\u201d\nMurphy\u2019s ruling in May interrupted a deportation flight carrying the migrants \u2014 who have been convicted of crimes and are from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan, and Vietnam \u2014 to South Sudan.\nThe judge said the flight violated his previous order from April 18, which prohibited the administration from sending immigrants to third countries without providing them a chance to request humanitarian protections. That ruling was underpinned by the Convention Against Torture, which bars governments from deporting people to countries where they could be face torture.\n\u201cThe judge gave the government a choice as to how to remedy the government\u2019s violation of the court\u2019s order \u2014 either return them and comply with the order in the United States or comply with the order overseas,\u201d Trina Realmuto, a lawyer for the immigrants, told The Intercept. \u201cThe government opted to comply overseas after telling the court that they had the ability to do so. This is a situation the government both created and can remedy if it so chooses.\u201d\nThe court filing on Thursday by Mellissa Harper of the Office of Refugee Resettlement described how within 72 hours of arriving at the makeshift detention facility in Djibouti, the agents and migrants began to suffer from symptoms for bacterial respiratory infections, including \u201ccoughing, difficulty breathing, fever, and achy joints.\u201d\nThe filing explained that they are unable to get tested to determine what the illness is, and there is only a small supply of inhalers, Tylenol, eye drops, and nasal spray to treat the symptoms.\nBased on what was described, Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney asked: \u201cWhy is the Trump administration forcing them to stay there?\u201d\n\u201cICE\u2019s claims of difficulties here are ENTIRELY self-inflicted,\u201d said Reichlin-Melnick. \u201cTHEY asked the judge for permission to hold the men in Djibouti. The plaintiffs wanted the men brought back here. I have sympathy for the low-level officers stuck there, but it\u2019s ALL their bosses\u2019 fault.\u201d\nThe administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay Murphy\u2019s order requiring screenings for the migrants, claiming that ruling violated officials\u2019 authority to deport immigrants to third countries if their home countries won\u2019t take them back.\nBut in the case of at least one of the migrants, Jesus Munoz Gutierrez, the government of his home country of Mexico was not informed that he had been sent to Djibouti.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested last month that Gutierrez could be repatriated if U.S. followed protocols to send him back to Mexico.\nSetareh Ghandehari, advocacy director for Detention Watch Network, told Newsweek that the administration\u2019s insistence on detaining the migrants in a shipping container at Camp Lemonniere is \u201cthe latest move in Trump\u2019s shocking expansion of third country deportations.\u201d\n\u201cBy expelling people out of sight and out of mind to remote prisons and war-torn, unstable countries,\u201d said Ghandehari, \u201cthe Trump regime is attempting to normalize the offshoring of immigration detention and third country deportations as a new and expanded model of incarceration and deportation.\u201d\nGhandehari added that \u201cthe use of shipping containers to detain people is heinous and enraging \u2014 and coupled with the extreme heat, disease, and threats of rocket attacks in Djibouti, can be deadly.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: We begin today\u2019s show with the escalating feud between President Trump and Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, who, up until just recently, was a top presidential adviser and Trump\u2019s top political benefactor. The fight could have broad implications for Trump\u2019s presidency, the Republican Party and many government programs, including NASA, that rely on technology from Musk\u2019s various companies. The feud became public Tuesday when Musk called Trump\u2019s so-called big, beautiful budget bill a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d because it will increase the federal deficit by $2.5 trillion. The tension then escalated considerably on Thursday.\nDuring a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a reporter asked Trump about Musk\u2019s comment. This is part of his response.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I\u2019m very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out that we\u2019re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that\u2019s billions and billions of dollars. And it really is unfair. \u2026 He knew it better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left. And if you saw the statements he made about me, which I\u2019m sure you can get very easily \u2014 it\u2019s very fresh, on tape \u2014 he said the most beautiful things about me. And he hasn\u2019t said bad about me personally, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be next. But I\u2019m very disappointed in Elon. I\u2019ve helped Elon a lot.\nAMY GOODMAN: The feud then spilled into social media, with the two billionaires launching personal attacks on their own social media platforms, Musk on X and Trump on Truth Social.\nAt 2:37 p.m. Thursday, Trump wrote, \u201cElon was \u2018wearing thin,\u2019 I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\u201d unquote.\nAt 3:10 p.m., Musk wrote, quote, \u201cTime to drop the really big bomb, @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\u201d\nThen Trump wrote, \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn\u2019t do it!\u201d Trump said.\nMusk responded by threatening to decommission the Dragon spacecraft used by NASA. Musk also appeared to back the impeachment of Trump and took credit for Trump winning the presidency.\nTrump ally Steve Bannon went further, calling for Musk to be investigated and deported. He also called Trump to seize Musk\u2019s company SpaceX.\nTo talk more about the fracturing of the Trump-Musk relationship and what this could mean for the Republican Party, we\u2019re joined by Quinn Slobodian, professor of international history at Boston University, working on a book about Elon Musk titled Muskism. He is author of Hayek\u2019s Bastards: Race, Gold, IQ, and the Capitalism of the Far Right, as well as Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy.\nProfessor Slobodian, welcome back to Democracy Now! Were you shocked by what you saw happen yesterday? I mean, who knows? They could be holding a joint news conference soon and announce they\u2019re back in love.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. I mean, they are people who always have their eye on the bottom line, but they also are, obviously, titanically sized egos. And I think that, more than anything, this is just a sign of how dangerous it is to put billions of dollars, even the lives of astronauts, the whole future of the American economy and the political scene, in the hands of two sole human beings.\nAMY GOODMAN: When you said threaten the lives of astronauts, explain.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, the Dragon unit that you mentioned is the only way for the astronauts in the International Space Station to get to and from where they are now. So, were he to decommission it, it might literally mean that they would be stranded out there, kind of Gravity style.\nSo, this is just one of the examples of many of the offloading of core government functions onto private service providers, that Elon Musk has been so masterful at playing, that we feel more and more exposed to, from the use of Starlink satellites in the field of battle in the Ukraine to the use of the same internet connection as leverage in his battle with the Brazilian government. I feel like, over time, we\u2019ll only realize more and more how much we are at the mercy of someone who is acting with total impetuousness, and sometimes not even with his own self-interest in mind.\nAMY GOODMAN: Let\u2019s go from the threat to lives in space to here on the ground, Elon Musk taking on the budget, calling it an \u201cabomination.\u201d When Trump said he knows that \u2014 the budget bill better than almost anyone else, inside and out, Musk\u2019s response was, \u201cThat is false. I never saw it. It was passed in the middle of the night.\u201d Can you talk about the significance? I mean, this is the guy in charge of DOGE. How many thousands of jobs have been lost? And yet, at the same time now he\u2019s viciously attacking the budget that was so narrowly passed, and it could threaten its ultimate passage.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: I mean, I think it\u2019s worth sort of returning to the question of why Musk got involved at all with Trump \u2014 right? \u2014 what he was doing with this DOGE project. And I think it\u2019s possible to kind of split it up into three categories.\nI think, first of all, he was doing a kind of a bear hug strategy. So, I think, especially on the trade war and his many, many interests in China, you know, he has a Gigafactory there that has capacity to make a million Teslas a year. He wanted to get out in front of any possible excess of economic nationalism that might be rolled out.\nAnd then I think he was kind of making a Hail Mary move, that, you know, he hadn\u2019t really clicked with the Biden administration, and this could be a chance to maybe use a window of opportunity to boost his own aspirations, especially in artificial intelligence, where he was being outpaced by people like Sam Altman and OpenAI.\nAnd then, third, I think you could see it as a kind of moonshot strategy, where I think he was trying to really even more plug in his own services, especially SpaceX, to, in fact, not only get to the moon, but divert the whole project towards Mars. So, there was a lot of reasons why Musk would want to be involved.\nBut from Trump\u2019s point of view, he\u2019s never really been a fiscal hawk, right? He\u2019s always actually run against austerity in certain ways and run against this mainstream obsession with the debt ceiling and the deficit that has so defined GOP politics for the last couple decades. So it was always kind of an odd fit, and it\u2019s not surprising in that sense that Musk now feels that this budget is, you know, not hard austerity enough for his liking. It\u2019s telling, for example, that he\u2019s posted multiple Milton Friedman memes over the last couple of days, sort of implying that this problem of runaway debt inflation should be top of mind at all times for the government. But Trump has always profited by playing fast and loose with that kind of ideology.\nAnd the question is: Why now has this led to a snapping point \u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: So \u2014\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: \u2014 for Musk? And I think there\u2019s a \u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: Keep going.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: If I could just say, I think there\u2019s a couple of things there. I think Trump invokes the EV mandate, and that is a serious issue, right? What that is \u2014 it needs to be broken down \u2014 is the capacity of California to enforce a move towards electric cars over time, a part of which is a regulatory credit system that allows normal ICE \u2014 internal combustion engine \u2014 vehicles to buy credits from electric vehicle manufacturers. And this is now 40% of Tesla\u2019s net income in the last year. It went up a billion dollars in the last year alone. And if that gets killed, it really does kind of kill Tesla\u2019s margin. And I think that Musk is starting to feel the heat from Chinese producers like BYD, battery producers like CATL. And I think he sees here maybe the possible demise of the Tesla brand, as he is hated more and more from both sides of the spectrum. So, there\u2019s reasons, as he returns to his businesses, to start to sweat about what he\u2019s actually signed up for.\nAMY GOODMAN: How about what this highlights around a rift within the MAGA movement, and where JD Vance fits into this, the vice president?\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, it\u2019s always interesting to ask what exactly was going on with DOGE, right? I mean, if you want to get into the real kind of Dangerous Liaisons kind of courtesanship, I think, that is happening inside of the White House, it seems that, based on reporting, Stephen Miller was kind of stage managing, along with his wife, a lot of what was happening with DOGE.\nAnd if you look at what actually came out of DOGE \u2014 and this is a good time now for us to sort of do a autopsy or postmortem on it, as it winds down, really \u2014 he said he was going to do 2 trillion cut \u2014 $2 trillion in cuts, out of a $6 trillion budget \u2014 very unlikely \u2014 went back to $1 trillion, scaled it back to $150 billion. What did they end up taking out? I mean, it\u2019s basically culture war stuff, right? I mean, it\u2019s ways to trigger the progressives and the libs \u2014 get rid of USAID, attack NEH funding, arts funding, science funding, education, energy. These ended up being big wins not really for Musk\u2019s own bottom-line, cost-cutting mentality, but very much for the culture war being waged by people like Miller and JD Vance and Russell Vought at the Office of Management and Budget. So there is a way of looking at this as having been a success from their point of view. They were able to use the credibility of Musk as a kind of supposed, you know, brilliant, Edison-like inventor and wonderful, efficiency-creating cost cutter to actually get to some of their political goals.\nBut they never could bring that big number down. Why? Because entitlement spending still dominates the state spending in the GDP. And when you come close to that, you come close to the kind of beating heart of the social contract. And we saw the town hall meetings. We saw the anger when things started to encroach on the questions of Social Security and Medicaid. And for me, that was a very telling moment, and it was one that I think took Musk by surprise, too. He\u2019s not used to the idea of needing to engage with a kind of consent and legitimacy mechanism where people feel like they paid into something and should now get something back. He\u2019s used to interacting with a Twitter fan base, a set of really bought-in Tesla investors, for whom, you know, he always walks on water and he\u2019s a god reincarnate. And when he just was confronted with the anger of average people who want to make sure that they can pay for their next meal, he didn\u2019t know what to do.\nSo, I think that there\u2019s a kind of a \u2014 there\u2019s a way to see this as a victory for the national conservatives. They got to do some of their their easy wins against the progressives and the libs, and now they\u2019re able to keep the door open for more protectionism and expansion of spending, as we see in the so-called big, beautiful bill.\nAMY GOODMAN: Finally, do you think Musk has access to all of the private information that his DOGE army downloaded from all the agencies? Is that possible?\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: I am not a software programmer, and I do not know how databases work that well, but it seems at least likely that part of what they were doing there, when they were converting things done in old programming languages and updating them, was also harvesting a lot of that data for use for we don\u2019t know what. Feeding the machine of Grok or xAI is the most likely answer.\nAMY GOODMAN: And finally, let me ask you: Steve Bannon, who\u2019s on the anti-Musk side of the MAGA rift, has been calling for Trump to nationalize Musk\u2019s businesses and for him to be deported, right? I mean, Elon Musk comes from South Africa.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. I mean, this actually isn\u2019t the harshest thing that Bannon has ever said. He referred to Silicon Valley as an \u201capartheid state\u201d a few months ago. The idea of nationalizing SpaceX is an interesting one. It would certainly run against the core privatization ethos that Trump and the former GOP has been following for decades and decades. So far, I would chalk that up to just saber-rattling rhetoric for his podcast, more than an actual policy proposal.\nAMY GOODMAN: Quinn Slobodian, I want to thank you for being with us, professor of international history at Boston University.

Section 70302, titled \u201cRestriction on Enforcement,\u201d would undermine federal judges\u2019 authority to enforce court orders by limiting their ability to hold government officials in contempt, a key tool for compelling compliance with court orders.\nFollowing court rulings is not optional. If federal officials defy a court order, judges have the authority to hold them in contempt, which is a power that judges exercise to address threats to the integrity of judicial proceedings. When officials fail to follow a court order, judges may hold them and their attorneys in civil contempt, imposing fines, jail time, or other penalties to induce compliance. Judges can also punish past disobedience by holding government officials and their attorneys in criminal contempt.\nSection 70302 would forbid federal courts from issuing such contempt penalties against anyone who disobeys preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders if the party seeking the order did not put down \u201csecurity,\u201d a financial guarantee such as a cash bond that would cover damages if a party is found to have been wrongfully enjoined.\nWithout contempt penalties against officials, judges would be left with few options to induce the government to follow their orders.\nThe timing of this brazen assault on the rule of law is no coincidence. So far this year, more than 190 court rulings have temporarily or permanently halted administration actions, and several judges have found that the administration violated court orders. At least one judge has found probable cause to hold administration officials in criminal contempt for \u201cwillful disobedience.\u201d\nNow the president\u2019s allies in Congress are trying to aid these violations by removing potential consequences for such unlawful behavior.\nThe Senate should remove Section 70302 from the reconciliation bill so judges have the tools they need to ensure that the executive branch abides by the Constitution and the very laws that Congress passes.\nThe Provision Would Undercut Courts\u2019 Inherent Power to Enforce Their Orders\nFederal courts have relied on the contempt power since the founding. Rooted in courts\u2019 innate power to enforce their rulings, the contempt authority was first codified in the Judiciary Act of 1789 and remains good law today. The Supreme Court has described the contempt power as \u201cinherent in all courts\u201d and \u201cessential\u201d to the enforcement of judgments.\nIt is common for judges to weigh contempt proceedings against federal officials. One study found that between 1990 and 2018 there were over 1,400 district court cases featuring a contempt motion or proceedings against a federal agency. And while often the threat of contempt suffices to induce compliance, judges do sometimes issue sanctions against the federal government. Federal agencies and high-ranking officials from both parties, including the attorney general and other cabinet secretaries, have been held in contempt.\nBy forbidding judges from punishing those who disobey preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders unless the party seeking the order posts security, Section 70302 erodes this cornerstone of judicial authority, inviting defiance of court orders.\nThe Provision\u2019s Retroactivity Would Undermine Existing Orders and Disrupt Court Dockets\nCongress does not often pass legislation that applies to past conduct. However, Section 70302 would apply retroactively, rendering past injunctions issued by federal judges that did not require a bond largely unenforceable absent further action by both the court and the parties in the case.\nThis retroactive application of Section 70302 would upend rulings by federal courts in countless federal cases across the country \u2014 and not just for lawsuits against the government. Any defendant who is subject to a federal preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order in which no bond was ordered would be able to disobey these past orders without the risk of contempt penalties.\nIn the case of preliminary injunctions, which are used to avoid irreparable harm while a lawsuit is pending, such orders can be in place for years. Limiting these orders\u2019 enforceability risks chaotic disruptions for parties who rely on them to protect their rights and legal interests, and the prospect is especially troubling given the administration\u2019s actions to avoid judicial oversight.\nTo the extent that Section 70302\u2019s language applies to both preliminary and permanent injunctions \u2014 one potential interpretation of this poorly drafted provision \u2014 it would have the radical result of effectively preventing courts from enforcing every federal injunction currently restraining the government and private individuals in cases where no bond was posted.\nTo restore courts\u2019 ability to use their contempt power, judges in each of these individual cases would likely need to reconvene court and order the plaintiffs to post a bond. Given the high case loads and scheduling backlogs that federal courts already face, the resulting burden on both judges and parties would be substantial. Further, there is no guarantee that all judges would act expeditiously in this way, if at all.\nRequiring Financial Bonds Would Deter Public Interest Litigation\nUnder Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, parties that win preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders are required to post a bond in an amount that the court considers proper to cover anticipated cost and damages of the litigation. However, judges have broad discretion over bond requirements, and they routinely choose to waive the requirement or set a low bond amount.\nWaivers are an especially common practice in public interest cases against the federal government involving everything from voting rights to freedom of speech. In such lawsuits, courts have strong interests in ensuring that monetary requirements do not impede vindication of constitutional rights and public access to judicial review.\nDespite the fact that federal courts already have numerous tools at their disposal to deter frivolous litigation, including sanctions, President Trump issued a memo in March instructing agency heads to demand bonds from plaintiffs requesting injunctions against the federal government to \u201cstop[] judicial overreach and frivolous lawsuits.\u201d Since then, the Department of Justice has asked courts to set exorbitant bonds, even millions of dollars in some cases. Courts have thus far denied these requests, acknowledging that a costly upfront security was inappropriate and would essentially forestall judicial review.\nWhile Section 70302 does not appear to preclude judges from requiring nominal bonds, the provision may still pressure judges concerned about their contempt power to impose sizeable bonds to avoid litigation over the suitability of the amount, even if in their judgment such a large bond amount is unwarranted. As a result, advocacy organizations without deep pockets might think twice before bringing vital public interest litigation and, in some cases, be deterred from bringing such litigation altogether.\nCongress Cannot Use Budget Reconciliation to Change Judges\u2019 Ability to Enforce Orders\nThe budget reconciliation process provides an expedited path for Congress to take up legislation related to taxing, spending, and the national debt. Under this process, reconciliation bills are not subject to a 60-vote threshold for ending debate in the Senate. Instead, they move forward to final passage under a simple majority vote.\nHowever, each provision in a budget reconciliation bill must primarily affect federal spending or revenue and cannot be \u201cextraneous\u201d \u2014 defined as a provision whose budgetary effects are \u201cmerely incidental to the non-budgetary components of the provision.\u201d Based on Congress\u2019s own rules under the Congressional Budget Act, Section 70302 appears extraneous and should not pass Senate muster for budget reconciliation.\nIndeed, Section 70302 is only incidentally related to federal spending and instead constitutes a change to the federal statute governing courts\u2019 contempt powers. The section also alters the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by overriding courts\u2019 longstanding interpretation of Rule 65(c), which allows judges to waive bonds before issuing a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order. There is no clear exception in the Congressional Budget Act allowing Congress to impose changes to the contempt statute or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure via budget reconciliation. If Congress wishes to alter judges\u2019 authority to enforce contempt citations and waive bonds, it should do so via the ordinary legislative process.\nMembers of both parties have publicly stated that the executive branch must comply with court orders, and public opinion is overwhelmingly opposed to defiance of court orders. Rather than shoring up judicial independence, the House has chosen to do the opposite. Congress should remove Section 70302.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

Key to this agenda is the approval of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities across Gulf Coast communities that are disproportionately Black, Brown, and low-income, long treated as expendable \u201csacrifice zones\u201d by the fossil fuel industry.\nJust recently, on May 23, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reauthorized the massive CP2 LNG in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which will be the biggest LNG export facility in the U.S.\nLocal organizers and climate groups have been fighting the expansion of these \u201cmethane export facilities\u201d which they say will intensify climate chaos and environmental racism. To try to halt them, they\u2019re focusing on key actors behind these fossil fuel projects: the big financiers and insurers whose services these projects need in order to gain regulatory approval and to be built and operated.\nA new report by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) maps out the known insurers of the buildout of LNG export facilities in Southwest Louisiana and discusses the numerous financial and reputational risks these companies face in propping up an industry tied to a volatile market fueling climate crisis and threatening local communities.\n\u201cThey\u2019re financing and insuring environmental racism because these projects are overwhelmingly situated in Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities they feel are the path of least resistance,\u201d Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project in Lake Charles, Louisiana, told Truthout.\nGulf Coast \u201cSacrifice Zones\u201d\nU.S. exports of LNG, or fracked gas that has been cooled into liquid to ship, have boomed over the past decade. LNG has been promoted by the fossil fuel industry as a cleaner \u201cbridge fuel\u201d toward renewable energy, a debunked claim that some view as a form of greenwashing. The production, transport, processing, and burning of fracked gas releases large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.\nThe U.S. is the world\u2019s top exporter of fracked gas. In recent years, the fossil fuel industry and its Wall Street investors have sought to expand U.S. LNG export facilities. Immediately after his January 2025 inauguration, Donald Trump restarted applications for new LNG export terminals that were paused by Joe Biden a year earlier.\nThe epicenter of the buildout has been the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, where there are currently around two dozen LNG expansion projects being constructed or proposed. These facilities are located in places like Port Arthur, Texas, and Cameron Parish, Louisiana, communities that are overwhelmingly Black, Brown, and low-income, and where clusters of toxic refining and petrochemical plants have long operated.\nThe United Nations has called areas like these \u201csacrifice zones,\u201d defined as \u201cextremely contaminated areas where vulnerable and marginalized groups bear a disproportionate burden of the health, human rights and environmental consequences of exposure to pollution and hazardous substances.\u201d Research shows that local Black, Brown, and Indigenous workers do not benefit equitably from the jobs and other economic benefits the fossil fuel industry often promises when building new facilities.\nA 2024 Greenpeace report found that the building of planned LNG projects would result annually in 149 premature deaths and $2.33 billion in health costs, with areas in Southwest Louisiana \u201cslated to suffer the worst air pollution impacts per capita\u201d and with air pollution from LNG terminals disproportionately affecting Black and Brown residents.\nEnvironmental Racism and Climate Crisis\nAccording to a new report by RAN, over 20 additional LNG expansion projects have been proposed in the Gulf Coast region in addition to six existing export terminals. These enormous projects have names like Sabine Pass LNG, Cameron LNG, and Calcasieu Pass LNG. Their corporate backers include Sempra, Energy Transfer, Cheniere, Kimmeridge, and Venture Global.\nThese facilities, however, are far from uncontested, facing major opposition from community organizers like Roishetta Ozane.\nA mother of six who lives just outside Lake Charles, Louisiana, Ozane founded the Vessel Project in 2020 amid her efforts to help the community respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and displacement from Hurricanes Laura and Delta. The Vessel Project uses mutual aid to build community and create the conditions for sustained organizing for environmental justice.\n\u201cWe make sure that people\u2019s immediate needs are met before we talk about stopping an LNG facility,\u201d she told Truthout. \u201cThat way, we\u2019ve been able to grow our base of community members who show up at meetings and town halls and who travel with us to D.C. or New York City.\u201d\nOzane spoke of the environmental and health fallouts her community has suffered living \u201cright in the midst of a mixture of industries,\u201d including explosions, fires, and smoke clouds at petrochemical plants, with consequences for her own family. \u201cWe get all the cumulative impacts living in a fenceline community,\u201d she said. \u201cMy children have asthma and eczema. My son has epilepsy, which I believe was exacerbated by the pollution from the facilities.\u201d\nAs Ozane responded to crisis after crisis, she started making connections between the environmental racism and extreme weather her community experienced and the wider climate crisis tied to local industries. \u201cI was trying to connect the dots for people,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these facilities are releasing gas into the air, and it\u2019s what\u2019s warming our planet. It\u2019s what\u2019s causing these storms to be more severe.\u201d\nGoing After the Insurers\nOrganizing to halt the buildout of LNG export facilities and other fossil fuel infrastructure has led Ozane and others toward a concerted strategy: pressuring big financiers and insurers to stop propping up these projects.\n\u201cThe banks and the insurance companies are the ones actually supporting the fossil fuel industry behind the scenes,\u201d Ruth Breech of RAN, and a coauthor of the RAN report, told Truthout.\nThe past decade has seen the climate and environmental justice movement target the money behind the fossil fuel industry, such as banks JPMorgan and Citi, asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and insurers like AIG and Liberty Mutual. While ExxonMobil or Chevron may cling to its core business of oil and gas production, these financial firms are more diversified, risk-averse and susceptible to public shaming.\n\u201cIf our elected officials are going to approve these projects, then our hope lies in the banks and the investors and the insurance companies,\u201d said Ozane.\nOzane co-leads the Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub, a coalition aimed at bringing pressure from local communities to bear on these financial giants. \u201cWe bring frontline folks in front of these banks and insurance companies to say you\u2019re insuring and financing environmental racism,\u201d she said.\nMore than any other financial backers, insurance corporations may be most vulnerable around fossil fuels, since climate chaos presents an existential threat to the industry\u2019s business model.\nThe RAN report, which the Vessel Project and Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub signed onto, maps out some of the known insurers, based on information from FOIA requests and lawsuit filings, behind Southwest Louisiana\u2019s LNG export buildout. For example, insurers behind Cameron LNG include Chubb, AIG, Allianz, Liberty Mutual, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Zurich, Tokio Marine, The Hartford, and others, according to RAN.\nThe report highlights the significant risks for insurers in underwriting the Gulf Coast LNG buildout, including financial instability tied to regulatory and construction delays and the problem of oversupply and overcapacity with these facilities. Multiple reports warn that U.S. shale production is facing decline in prices and market volatility.\nThe report also notes the reputational and financial risks to insurers that prop up an industry that perpetuates harmful health impacts, safety hazards, climate risks, and disruptions to local ecosystems. LNG export facilities have been plagued by thousands of permit violations and extensive operational problems and accidents, with one of the most infamous being a 2022 explosion and fire at Freeport LNG that led to an eight-month shutdown.\n\u201cThey Know Me by Name\u201d\nBoth Breech and Ozane emphasized the hypocrisy behind the insurance industry\u2019s continued underwriting of fossil fuels. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people across the nation lose their home insurance coverage because of the impacts of climate change,\u201d said Breech. \u201cThen we\u2019re seeing these insurance companies continue to provide insurance for new fossil fuel projects.\u201d\nOzane said it\u2019s frustrating to see insurers prop up an industry in her community that is driving the very climate chaos that\u2019s making home insurance in Louisiana unaffordable. \u201cFor insurance companies to insure one of these climate monsters, and then turn around and not insure the people who live in the communities at a reasonable rate, is outright wrong,\u201d she said.\nFor RAN and the Vessel Project, the global insurance powerhouse Chubb has been a key focus. Breech says Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg is \u201can influencer personality\u201d within the insurance industry, similar to JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon in banking. Chubb has also been open to engaging with community members. Ozane has met with representatives from Chubb several times, bringing her children to the meetings. \u201cThey know me by name,\u201d she says.\nIn 2024, Chubb reported dropping 32 major oil and gas clients who didn\u2019t meet its methane emissions standards. Chubb has dropped its coverage of the Rio Grande LNG, a proposed LNG export terminal in Brownsville, Texas, and it ruled out insuring the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. As recently reported by Inside Climate News, Chubb also dropped its coverage of Venture Global\u2019s Calcasieu Pass LNG.\nBut for organizers like Ozane, Chubb isn\u2019t going far enough. She wants them to rule out insuring another LNG export terminal, Venture Global\u2019s huge CP2, which just received FERC approval. Ozane told Truthout that she\u2019s currently trying to arrange a \u201ctoxic tour\u201d for FERC so the commission can see the cumulative impacts of the fossil fuel industry on her community.\nAccording to the Sierra Club LNG Export Tracker, CP2\u2019s annual emissions will be the equivalent of 54 coal burning power plants once two phases of expansion are completed.\nCP2\u2019s insurers are currently unknown, RAN reports.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re insuring this project, you\u2019re ensuring this community\u2019s destruction,\u201d Ozane said. \u201cIt would be easy for Chubb to say, if CP2 gets all of its permits, we\u2019re not going to insure them.\u201d\nTruthout contacted Chubb to ask if the company was insuring CP2, and also if its decision to drop coverage of Calcasieu Pass LNG could mean Chubb would decide to not insure CP2, but received no response.\nRAN told Truthout that it\u2019s demanding Chubb drop its coverage of Cameron LNG by June and Freeport LNG by October, and that it stops insuring all \u201cmethane terminals.\u201d\nChubb CEO Evan Greenberg took in $82 million in total compensation between 2022 and 2024. By contrast, the per capita income in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is $35,847, with a poverty rate of 23.2 percent, according to census data.\n\u201cWe Can\u2019t Take Anymore\u201d\nThe RAN report demands that banks and insurers stop supporting fossil fuel expansion projects. It also demands that banks and insurance companies \u201cfollow a human rights due diligence framework\u201d and consult with community leaders and organizations from municipalities and parishes where LNG export facilities are being sited to identify and assess human rights risks, and for these companies to do their own site visits to conduct human rights, environmental and environmental justice assessments.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about serious human rights implications in these projects,\u201d said Breech. \u201cSouthwest Louisiana is not an energy sacrifice zone, and it\u2019s not acceptable to have all of these proposals in this area.\u201d\nWith hurricane season approaching, Ozane stresses the urgency of halting the LNG export buildout that\u2019s blanketing her community. She is hosting a hurricane preparedness festival highlighting the intersection of fossil fuel pollution and climate-induced disasters.\nTruthout asked Ozane what she would say to Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg if she could speak directly to him.\n\u201cI would say that if you insure CP2 you are insuring the death of my children and my community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are already suffering from the pollution that\u2019s coming from the surrounding facilities. We can\u2019t take anymore.\u201d\nTruthout also asked Ozane what victory would ultimately look like for her.\n\u201cVictory looks like we are no longer dependent on fossil fuels here and that there\u2019s another economy here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re back to our fishermen being able to live off of fishing and oysters and shrimping. We see a beautiful coast free of the industry that\u2019s now polluting the water.\u201d\n\u201cVictory will look like my 7-year-old going outside to play without coming back into the house saying that he can\u2019t breathe,\u201d she says.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

Trump has bypassed congressional oversight on weapons transfers. The Israeli government is currently escalating attacks on the civilian population of Gaza. They are both out of control. Congress needs to assert its oversight authority,\u201d said Congresswoman Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) in a statement.\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Ramirez declared. \u201cBy introducing the Block the Bombs Act, a broad coalition is listening to the American people who don\u2019t want their taxpayers\u2019 money to continue supporting gross violations of U.S., international, and humanitarian law.\u201d\nTwo former leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus \u2014 Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) \u2014 as well as Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) are spearheading the fight for the bill alongside Ramirez. Another 18 Democrats in the House of Representatives have signed on as co-sponsors, including current CPC Chair Greg Casar (D-Texas) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the only Palestinian American in either chamber.\n\u201cFor the last year and a half, Benjamin Netanyahu has laid siege to Gaza, killing at least 54,000 people, repeatedly displacing the entire population, and cutting off access to desperately needed humanitarian aid,\u201d said Pocan. \u201cThis commonsense bill will prevent more unchecked transfers of these offensive weapons systems that are used to violate international human rights laws and hopefully help bring this devastating conflict to an end.\u201d\nAlthough there was a cease-fire in place for nearly two months earlier this year, Netanyahu abandoned it in March. Since then, negotiations for an end to Israel\u2019s annihilation of Gaza and the release of both Palestinians held in Israeli prisons and hostages taken by Palestinian militants in 2023 have been unsuccessful.\nThroughout the war, efforts by progressives in both chambers of Congress \u2014 including multiple resolutions led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 to block U.S. weapons that Israel uses to massacre civilians in Gaza also have not been successful. A growing number of critics across the globe condemn the U.S.-backed Israeli assault as genocide.\nThe new bill is backed by dozens of advocacy groups that have spent the past 20 months sounding the alarm about the soaring death toll, starvation, and destruction of infrastructure in Gaza, including Amnesty International USA, Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), Council on American-Islamic Relations, Demand Progress, Human Rights Watch, IfNotNow Movement, IMEU Policy Project, Indivisible, Jewish Voice for Peace Action, Justice Democrats, Institute for Policy Studies, Progressive Democrats of America, Rabbis for Cease-Fire, Sunrise Movement, Win Without War, and Working Families Party.\n\u201cThe Block the Bombs Act is a historic bill,\u201d but also \u201ca straightforward challenge to United States complicity in Israel\u2019s genocidal campaign in Gaza as Israeli forces block humanitarian assistance and directly target schools, hospitals, and civilians,\u201d said CCR associate director of policy Brad Parker. \u201cAs the Israeli government escalates the murder, starvation, and forcible transfer of Palestinians with President Trump\u2019s full support, we recognize and appreciate the bold leadership of Reps.

While Musk has not criticized it for those negative impacts, he has called the budget bill a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d and said voters should \u201cfire all politicians\u201d who support it.\nDuring a presser in the White House on Thursday, Trump expressed dismay at Musk\u2019s opposition to the bill, saying he believed the Tesla CEO was mainly \u201cupset\u201d about the elimination of electric vehicle tax credits.\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in Elon. I\u2019ve helped Elon a lot,\u201d Trump said.\nMusk, responding to the president in real-time on his social media site X, claimed \u201cthe MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK\u201d was the main reason why he opposed the bill. He also lashed out at Trump.\n\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election,\u201d said Musk, who spent a quarter of a billion dollars of his own wealth to help elect the current president last fall.\nMusk also alleged that Trump\u2019s connection to Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted for paying a minor for sex and was accused of trafficking children for sex before his death in 2019, was stronger than what\u2019s been publicly disclosed.\n\u201c@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,\u201d Musk wrote.\nDemocrats have been well aware of the animosity brewing between Musk and Trump, with some apparently hoping to capitalize on it. According to a report from Politico published earlier this week, a number of prominent Democrats in Congress want to court Musk to their side, now that his relationship with Trump has frayed.\n\u201cWe should ultimately be trying to convince him that the Democratic Party has more of the values that he agrees with,\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) said, according to Politico. \u201cA commitment to science funding, a commitment to clean technology, a commitment to seeing international students like him.\u201d\nDemocrats should \u201cbe in a dialogue\u201d with Musk, particularly over his opposition to Trump\u2019s budget proposal, Khanna added.\nCentrist Democratic Party organizer Liam Kerr was more upfront with the political calculations of befriending Musk.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want anyone wildly distorting your politics, which he has a unique capability to do. But it\u2019s a zero-sum game. Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans,\u201d Politico quoted Kerr as saying.\nBeyond the financial advantages Democrats would gain \u2013 which they already seem to recognize in their fundraising from SpaceX lobbyists \u2013 courting the Tesla CEO makes little to sense as a strategy to distinguish themselves from Trump, as Musk has not signaled any changes in his policy or ideological stances amid his falling out with the president.\nMusk frequently lies on social media, promoting right-wing beliefs and spreading hateful rhetoric, particularly toward LGBTQ people and immigrants \u2014 and he has not disavowed those sentiments. Musk has also falsely framed social security as a \u201cponzi scheme,\u201d and he supports dismantling other social programs.\nMusk has also not repudiated fascistic points of view. Earlier this year, Musk gave his support to Alternative for Germany (AfD), a neo-Nazi political party, in that country\u2019s elections. The billionaire also notably raised his hand during an inauguration celebration for Trump in what appeared to be a Nazi salute.\nEven on Trump\u2019s budget bill itself, Musk has supported aspects of it.\n\u201cKeep the good, remove the bad,\u201d Musk wrote in a tweet on Thursday.\nMultiple left-leaning voices, reacting to the Politico report, spoke out against the idea of trying to persuade Musk to align with the Democratic Party.\n\u201cNo. Absolutely not,\u201d said political commentator Allison Gill. \u201cHe\u2019s a nazi. He smashed the federal government and stole our data. He put USAID and USIP in a wood chipper, leaving hundreds of thousands of children to die. He\u2019s not welcome in any party I belong to.\n\u201cIf Democrats rehab musk like they rehabbed [former President] George W.

Twelve nations would face a total ban: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. People from seven other nations would face severe restrictions: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.\nIn a video posted to social media late Wednesday night, Trump cited this week\u2019s attack, carried out by a lone individual in Colorado, to attempt to justify the need for the far-reaching restrictions, which the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, decried as \u201cunnecessary, overbroad and ideologically motivated.\u201d\nWhile the order sparked fresh condemnation, it does not come as a surprise from the Trump administration, which has made xenophobic rhetoric and anti-immigrant policy a cornerstone of its tenure. As the Washington Post reports:\nReinstating a travel ban has been a long-standing campaign promise for Trump. During his first term,he initially barred travel from seven Muslim-majority countries \u2014 under what became known as \u201cthe Muslim ban.\u201d\nAfter legal challenges, updated versions expanded the list to eight countries, including North Korea and Venezuela. President Joe Biden revoked the policy in 2021.\n\u201cAutomatically banning students, workers, tourists, and other citizens of these targeted nations from coming to the United States will not make our nation safer,\u201d said Nihad Awad, the executive director of CAIR, in response to Trump\u2019s new order. \u201cNeither will imposing vague ideological screening tests that the government can easily abuse to ban immigrants based on their religious identity and political activism.\u201d\nEven with the exceptions outlined in Trump\u2019s executive order, said Awad, \u201cthis new travel ban risks separating families, depriving students of educational opportunities, blocking patients from access to unique medical treatment, and creating a chilling effect on travelers.\u201d\nDemocratic lawmakers, including Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Pramila Jayapal of Washington spoke out forcefully against the presidential order.\n\u201cThis discriminatory policy is beyond shameful,\u201d said Omar in reaction to the news. \u201cJust like his first Muslim Ban, this latest announcement flies in the face of basic morality and goes directly against our values. This racist policy will not make us safe; it will separate families and endanger lives. We cannot let it stand.\u201d\nIn her statement, Jayapal said there \u201care a myriad of reasons that people come to the United States, from travel and tourism to fleeing violence and dangerous situations. This ban, expanded from Trump\u2019s Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage.\u201d\nJayapal continued by saying the \u201cdiscriminatory policy,\u201d which she noted is an attack on legal immigration processes, \u201cnot only flies in the face of what our country is supposed to stand for, it will be harmful to our economy and our communities that rely on the contributions of people who to America from this wide range of countries. Banning a whole group of people because you disagree with the structure or function of their government not only lays blame in the wrong place, it creates a dangerous precedent.\u201d\nReferencing the broader approach of Trump\u2019s policies, Jayapal accused Trump of \u201cindiscriminately taking a chainsaw to our government, destroying federal agencies that keep us safe, indiscriminately cutting jobs, and hindering our progress across research fields. This will only further hurt our country, and cannot be allowed to stand.\u201d\nSen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) offered a similar assessment:\nOxfam America also slammed the announcement.\n\u201cA new travel ban marks a chilling return to policies of fear, discrimination, and division,\u201d said Abby Maxman, the group\u2019s president and CEO.\n\u201cBy once again targeting individuals from Muslim-majority countries, countries with predominantly Black and brown populations, and countries in the midst of conflict and political instability, this executive order deepens inequality and perpetuates harmful stereotypes, racist tropes, and religious intolerance,\u201d said Maxman. \u201cThis policy is not about national security \u2014 it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States.\u201d\nThe travel ban on predominantly Muslim-majority nations attempted by Trump during his first term sparked large public protests as well as a wave of legal challenges. The new ban is likely to garner a similar response.\n\u201cThis latest travel ban would deny entry to individuals and families fleeing war, persecution, and oppression, forcing them to remain in dangerous conditions. It will prevent family reunifications, and America\u2019s historical legacy as a welcoming nation will be further eroded,\u201d said Maxman. \u201cOxfam will continue to advocate to ensure that this ban is struck down. The U.S. must uphold the dignity and rights of all people, no matter their religion or country of origin.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

Last month, the country\u2019s 23 Democratic governors released a joint statement decrying the proposed cuts, writing, \u201cAs governors, we stand united against any attempt to gut these critical programs that keep our country\u2019s kids, seniors, and veterans healthy and safe \u2014 and we invite our Republican colleagues to join us.\u201d\nDemocrats are correct to fight back against Donald Trump\u2019s austerity agenda, which would fund tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of working families, disabled people, and seniors. But attempts to undermine taxpayer-funded health care aren\u2019t only coming from the right. But anyone truly concerned about the latest round of GOP attacks must go beyond playing simple defense and boldly advocate for what most countries around the world already have: free and universal health care.\nIn the budget bill, Republicans have proposed slashing health care spending by at least $715 billion, allowing Affordable Care Act tax credits to expire, and implementing work requirements for Medicaid eligibility. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 16 million people would lose their health insurance by 2034 if Republicans\u2019 proposed budget becomes law, and University of Pennsylvania researchers estimate that the losses would lead to 51,000 more people dying annually.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 widely considered a Democratic frontrunner for the 2028 presidential race \u2014 has been a prominent critic of the GOP\u2019s Medicaid cuts. \u201cIf Republicans move this extreme MAGA proposal forward, millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cWe must sound the alarm because the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\u201d\nBut in his home state, Newsom has sung a different tune. After running for governor on a universal health care platform in 2018, Newsom expanded coverage in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, to undocumented immigrants last year. Now, he has already proposed reversing course, unveiling a budget last month that would cut undocumented adults out of that same program in 2026. This month, Newsom presented another idea for reducing state health care costs: a $2,000 asset test for disabled and elderly Medi-Cal recipients. This means that, to qualify for coverage, an individual would have to have less than $2,000 on hand in cash, savings, or checking accounts.\nNewsom raised California Medi-Cal\u2019s asset limit to $130,000 per person in 2022 and abolished it entirely last year, leading to an uptick in enrollment by Californians aged 65 and older. Reinstating a $2,000 asset test would mean that vulnerable people would have to live with zero financial cushion \u2014 no matter how low their monthly income \u2014 in order to qualify for crucial health coverage. A single medical bill can run more than $2,000, and Medi-Cal already doesn\u2019t cover the long-term care services that disabled and elderly people often need, including assisted living and in-home care. What\u2019s more, the initial $2,000 threshold was set in 1989, when the cost of living was far lower than it is today: In 1990, the median rent in California was $620, compared to roughly $2,800 in 2024. In other words, one month of rent could exceed the proposed limit.\nLow-income disabled Californians have expressed fears that they would no longer be able to afford in-home caretakers if they were forced to give up their savings to meet the new asset requirements. \u201cIt\u2019s draconian \u2014 $2,000 is no safety net for people,\u201d Kim Selfon, an attorney in Los Angeles, told CalMatters.\nIn a recent segment, NPR analysts speculated that Newsom is \u201cshifting to the center\u201d to tee up a 2028 presidential run. That framing isn\u2019t entirely correct \u2014 Newsom has long been a corporate-friendly centrist \u2014 but it\u2019s true that his Medi-Cal rollbacks echo the general direction of the Democratic Party. As I reported last August, the Democratic Party removed mention of a universal public health option from its 2024 platform \u2014 a shift from its messaging four years prior, which stated a goal of \u201cachieving universal, affordable, quality health care.\u201d While Joe Biden promised a public option on the campaign trail in 2020, he stopped advocating for it after that December. In 2021, New York Democratic leaders blocked a vote on a bill that would have created a universal single-payer health care system in the state, even though it had the support from the majority of lawmakers. A similar bill was reintroduced in the state Senate this January, but it has not moved forward.\nAnother state Democratic governor recently made headlines for his unfriendly stance to robust and equitable health care access. On May 29, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed a bipartisan bill, passed unanimously by the state legislature, that would\u2019ve banned surprise ambulance billing. (When Biden banned surprise medical bills in 2022, ground ambulance services were notably exempt.)\nDemocrats\u2019 tack to the right on health care is both morally wrong and politically shortsighted \u2014 polls have shown time and time again that the majority of Americans actually support universal health care. Republicans know that attacks on Medicaid are unpopular: While Trump previously promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he has since tried to rewrite that history. Trump and the GOP have studiously avoided \u201crepeal-and-replace\u201d rhetoric when discussing the current budget package, instead opting to focus on the Medicaid cuts as targeting fraud and abuse. But make no mistake: Republicans are playing their same old game of gutting public health insurance, just with new window dressing.\nAbandoning a public commitment to universal health care did not help the Democrats win the 2024 election. It will not help them in 2028. All it does is leave more and more Americans unhealthy, sick, and dead \u2014 because when the center shifts right, so does everybody else.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

Boasberg also noted that President Donald Trump issued the order for deportations against individuals who his administration had determined were part of the Venezuelan-based Tren de Aragua gang.\nAn independent examination of migrants who were deported to the El Salvador CECOT prison complex on March 15 and 16 shows that there is no evidence of any criminal history for around three-quarters of those individuals. Many family members of those who have been deported there also deny that they have links to gangs.\nBy refusing to allow these individuals the ability to challenge their deportations, the administration \u201cplainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States,\u201d Boasberg wrote in his ruling.\nThe judge\u2019s decree does not apply to all immigrants who were deported to El Salvador, but is narrowly focused on those who were removed from the U.S. based on the Alien Enemies Act proclamation that Trump made earlier this year \u2014 individuals like Kilmar Abrego Garc\u00eda, whose deportation is similarly questionable but was based on other rationales, are not affected by Boasberg\u2019s ruling.\nBoasberg left open the possibility that some deportations could be viewed as justifiable if the administration allowed individuals to challenge their deportations.\n\u201cPerhaps the President lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act. Perhaps, moreover, Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs are gang members. But \u2014 and this is the critical point \u2014 there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government\u2019s say-so,\u201d Boasberg wrote.\nHow to provide the deported migrants their due process \u201cwill be determined in future proceedings,\u201d the judge added.\nBoasberg was also mindful of the incredibly dangerous precedent that could be created by allowing the administration\u2019s actions to remain unchallenged.\n\u201cAbsent this relief\u201d from his ruling, Boasberg said, \u201cThe Government could snatch anyone off the street, turn him over to a foreign country, and then effectively foreclose any corrective course of action.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what appellate courts may do next with the case. While the Supreme Court has authorized, at least temporarily, the administration to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants living in the U.S., the high court also ruled in April that those subjected to his actions must be given the ability to challenge his ability to do so.\nSeveral legal experts praised Boasberg\u2019s ruling.\n\u201c[This is an] important moment for the rule of law and against government lawlessness,\u201d Ryan Goodman, co-editor-in-chief of Just Security, wrote in a Bluesky post.\nNoting that \u201cdetails [of the case still need] to be worked out\u201d \u2014 chiefly, how the deported migrants may see their individual cases remedied \u2014 constitutional law professor and political commentator Harry Litman applauded Boasberg for stating in his ruling that \u201cviolations must be remedied.\u201d\nThis was a \u201cbig important decision,\u201d Litman added.\nSkye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the organizations that is representing the migrants in the lawsuit, also celebrated the order by Boasberg.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling affirms what every American knows: in the United States, people are entitled to due process and no one should be removed from the country without it,\u201d Perryman said. \u201cWe will continue to oppose this administration\u2019s attempts to re-write the Constitution.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

What they challenge is the government\u2019s unprecedented and unlawful decision to hold them in a detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo \u2014 which, under the INA, and for purposes of the application of that statute, is not the United States. Immigration detention outside the United States is straightforwardly illegal under the statute.\u201d\n\u201cMoreover,\u201d the document argues, \u201cthe government\u2019s use of Guant\u00e1namo for immigration detention is arbitrary and capricious, lacks any legitimate purpose, and imposes punitive detention conditions on immigration detainees in violation of their constitutional rights.\u201d\n\u201cNever before this administration has the federal government moved noncitizens apprehended and detained in the United States on civil immigration charges to Guant\u00e1namo, or to any other facility outside the United States, for the purpose of civil immigration detention. Nor is there any legitimate reason to do so,\u201d the document notes. \u201cThe government has ample detention capacity inside the United States, which is far less costly and poses none of the logistical hurdles attendant to detaining people at Guant\u00e1namo.\u201d\nSpecifically, according to the complaint, \u201csince February 4, 2025, the government has held approximately 500 people in immigration detention at Guant\u00e1namo, at a reported cost of more than $40 million, or approximately $100,000 per day per detainee. In contrast, immigration detention at a U.S.-based detention facility costs, on average, $165 per day per detainee.\u201d\nPreviewing the Trump administration\u2019s likely arguments in court, the suit says that \u201cin attempting to justify the transfers, the government has claimed that the individuals it is sending to Guant\u00e1namo are members of gangs and dangerous criminals \u2014 the \u2018worst of the worst.\u2019 That characterization has been proven wrong. Regardless, it is legally irrelevant.\u201d\nThe filing also stresses that \u201cthe government\u2019s real reason for holding immigration detainees at Guant\u00e1namo is to instill fear in the immigrant population. That is not conjecture; it is government policy.\u201d\nThe coalition is asking the court to rule that detaining these migrants at Guant\u00e1namo violates the INA, Administrative Procedure Act, and Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and to block the Trump administration from continuing to do so.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a total of 10.9 million people will lose health insurance by 2034 if the current bill becomes law and Congress allows cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplace to go through. An additional 5.1 million people would lose coverage because the bill fails to extend tax credits for ACA Marketplace plans, and Health and Human Services has proposed new rules limiting the program\u2019s enrollment periods and making other changes, bringing the total to 16 million.\nThe estimate of 51,000 preventable deaths is based on details from a previous analysis from CBO, which initially found that 13.7 million people would lose their health care coverage by 2034. Since CBO has now revised that estimate to be higher in response to queries from Democrats, the estimate of 51,000 deaths could, in fact, be an undercount.\nThe legislation would also repeal federal safe staffing standards that require nursing homes and long-term care facilities to maintain a minimum ratio of nurses to patients in order to provide proper care, which the researchers estimate would result in 13,000 additional deaths annually.\nThe Senate is taking up the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d after House Republicans passed the budget package on a razor thin, one-vote margin, despite protests from Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans from swing districts. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) requested the analysis on mortality as ranking members on the Senate Budget Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, respectively.\n\u201cIn other words, when you throw 13.7 million Americans off the health care they have \u2026 when you increase the cost of prescription drugs for low-income seniors, and when you make nursing homes throughout America less safe, not only will some of the most vulnerable people throughout our country suffer, but tens of thousands will die,\u201d Sanders said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe latest calculations from public health experts adds to a growing pile of research on the devastating potential impacts of budget cuts, which Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing for to cover tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. If the current bill becomes law, annual cuts to Medicaid would average over $70 billion over the coming years \u2014 the same amount millionaires and billionaires would gain in tax cuts each year, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).\nEven with those cuts to critical health care programs, the budget package is projected to increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. In an open letter to the Senate on Monday, EPI and six Nobel laureate economists said the nation\u2019s structural deficits are already too high, and the bill would put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates while reducing incomes for the bottom 40 percent of earners. Taken together, the economists wrote, \u201cthe House budget constitutes an extremely large upward redistribution of income\u201d while adding to the national debt.\n\u201cThese steep cuts to the social safety net are being undertaken to defray the staggering cost of the tax cuts included in the House bill, including the hidden cost of preserving the large corporate income tax cut passed in the 2017 tax law,\u201d the economists wrote. \u201cBut even these sharp spending cuts will pay for far less than half of the tax cuts (not even including the cost of maintaining the corporate income tax cuts of the 2017 law).\u201d\nThe budget reconciliation package makes cuts to health care funding in multiple ways, although the proposal to impose work requirements on adult Medicaid enrollees has received the most media attention. The researchers at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania focused on three policies impacting three distinct groups: individuals who will lose all Medicaid coverage, lower-income seniors who will lose subsidies that help pay for prescription drugs, and people who are expected to die in nursing homes if the safe staffing requirements are removed.\nAccording to their data, the researchers estimated an additional 51,000 preventable deaths annually, including:\n- 11,300 deaths from the loss of Medicaid or Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage, given that CBO first estimated 7.7 million people will lose coverage. That number has since been updated to 10.9 million.\n- 18,200 deaths due to the loss of Medicaid coverage among 1.38 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries, causing loss of access to low-income prescription drug subsidies.\n- 13,000 deaths among Medicaid enrollees in nursing homes due to the rollback of 2024 nursing home minimum staffing rule.\nIn addition, the bill does not extend 2021\u2019s enhanced premium tax credits for ACA Marketplace insurance plans. If lawmakers allow these tax credits to expire and the rule changes at the Department of Health and Human Services become effective, an estimated 5.1 million people will lose affordable health insurance, leading to an additional estimated 8,811 preventable deaths, bringing the total to at least 51,000.\n\u201cWe know that when people are enrolled in Medicaid it saves lives compared to people not having health coverage, and we know the bill will increase churn and disenrollment in Medicaid,\u201d said Rachel Werner, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics and co-author of the analysis, in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s estimated that millions will lose coverage, and that will translate to loss of life.\u201d\nPolling consistently shows that cuts to Medicaid and the health care safety net are deeply unpopular, and many rural and lower-income districts in red states depend on Medicaid to keep hospitals and clinics running. Perhaps this explains why Trump has made a show of publicly urging House Republicans not to \u201ctouch\u201d Medicaid. Now that Medicaid is indeed on the chopping block, Trump and his allies in Congress are turning to lies and misinformation.\nIn a statement on Monday, the White House said the idea that \u201cpeople will literally die\u201d due to Medicaid cuts is a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cdisgusting lie\u201d told by Democrats. The bill would penalize states that used their own funds to expand Medicaid to cover some immigrants who would not qualify for federal funding; the White House claimed Medicaid would be \u201cstrengthened\u201d by removing 1.4 million undocumented immigrants from the rolls. That coverage loss would also extend to documented children and pregnant women under the proposed policy, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a top health policy think tank.\nTrump and his allies in Congress are also defending controversial Medicaid work requirements included in the House bill, which would require adult recipients to prove that they are working at least 80 hours per month to maintain their health coverage. People with disabilities would also likely be required to prove they qualify for exceptions, and all enrollees would face more paperwork and barriers to coverage. The policy would reduce federal spending by $280 billion over 10 years by kicking people off Medicaid rolls.\nThe White House said on Monday that \u201c4.8 million able-bodied adults on Medicaid are choosing not to work,\u201d a claim also made by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who recently told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that the 4.8 million people are \u201crefusing\u201d to work and will not lose coverage \u201cif they choose too.\u201d\nHowever, as the Washington Post points out, 4.8 million is the number of people estimated to become uninsured due to work requirements, not the number of young men \u201csitting around and playing video games\u201d instead of getting a job, as Johnson has previously suggested. KFF analysis shows 92 percent of adults on Medicaid are either working or likely qualify for exceptions to work requirements, as most Medicaid enrollees who do not work are caregivers, parents, students, or have a disability.\nArkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018, which led to 18,000 adults losing health coverage over the four months before a court stepped in to halt further implementation. A study by Harvard University researchers found the work requirements were effective at cutting Medicaid rolls during that time period but had no effect on employment. Research on other states has found that few programs linked to Medicaid work requirements actually help enrollees find jobs.\nSome Republicans have outright lied about the reconciliation bill, suggesting they are not pursuing Medicaid cuts when they are. Others are resorting to callous mockery. When constituents confronted Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa at a recent town hall with questions about people dying without health coverage, she shrugged and told them: \u201cWell, we all are going to die.\u201d\nAfter a video of the exchange went viral, Ernst doubled down with a bizarre video in what appears to be a graveyard, suggesting that those who are afraid of preventable deaths under the Medicaid cuts are like children who believe in the tooth fairy and should embrace \u201cmy lord and savior, Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\u201cSen. Ernst\u2019s flippant comments over the weekend reveal a grim reality: Republicans in Congress know that their tax bill will rip away lifesaving health care from their constituents, jeopardizing lives just to pad billionaires\u2019 pockets \u2026 and they just don\u2019t care,\u201d said Kobie Christian, a spokesperson for the economic justice campaign Unrig Our Economy, in a statement.\nThe \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d will likely undergo changes in the Senate, where conservative fiscal hawks are anxious about increasing the federal deficit, and defenders of public health refuse to blow holes in a safety net that provides coverage for millions of people in order to pay for tax cuts.\n\u201cIn the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,\u201d Sanders said.\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

Officials said first responders including paramedics and rescue workers who rushed to the scene were killed in subsequent strikes, known as \u201cdouble taps\u201d in military parlance.\nHuman Rights Watch said Wednesday that of the strikes\u2019 victims, \u201c49 were people who worked at the port, several were truck drivers, and two were civil defense personnel. Others may have been workers\u2019 family members. Three were identified as children.\u201d\n\u201cThe list contained one person identified as a \u2018colonel,\u2019 but who was not necessarily a military member,\u201d HRW continued. \u201cThe Hodeidah branch of the government-owned Yemen Oil Company posted photographs of 49 employees they said were killed.\u201d\nIn new investigation, @hrw finds that the US attack on Ras Issa Port in #Yemen in April is an apparent war crime.

In March, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon\u2019s Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Office and Civilian Protection Center of Excellence, which was established during the Biden administration, would be closed.\nHegseth \u2014 who has supported pardons for convicted U.S. war criminals \u2014 lamented during his Senate confirmation hearing that \u201crestrictive rules of engagement\u201d have \u201cmade it more difficult to defeat our enemies,\u201d who \u201cshould get bullets, not attorneys,\u201d according to his 2024 book The War on Warriors.\nThe U.S has been bombing and conducting ground raids in Yemen since the beginning of the so-called War on Terror launched by the George W. Bush administration in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Airwars says hundreds of Yemeni civilians have been killed in 181 declared U.S. actions since 2002.\nIn 2015, then-President Barack Obama announced that U.S. forces would provide \u201clogistical and intelligence support\u201d to the Saudi-led coalition intervening in the ongoing Yemeni civil war on behalf of the national government as it battled Iran-backed Houthi rebels. That assistance included refueling Saudi and Emirati warplanes that were bombing Yemeni targets and killing thousands of civilians while a blockade fueled famine and illness that claimed hundred of thousands of lives.\n\u201cThe U.S. has been implicated in laws-of-war violations in Yemen since it began \u2018targeted killing operations\u2019 in 2002 against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,\u201d HRW said Wednesday. \u201cThose strikes continued until at least 2019 and killed many civilians, including 12 people attending a wedding in 2013. To Human Rights Watch\u2019s knowledge, the U.S. has never acknowledged or provided compensation for civilians harmed in this or other unlawful attacks.\u201d\nThe Pentagon has only acknowledged 13 civilian deaths caused by U.S. military action in Yemen since 2002. The Trump administration has been especially tight-lipped about civilian casualties resulting from its operations, a stance some critics have called ironic given that top administration officials including Hegseth discussed highly sensitive plans for attacking Yemen on a Signal group chat in which a journalist was inadvertently included.\n\u201cThe recent U.S. airstrikes in Yemen are just the latest causing civilian harm in the country over the past two decades,\u201d Jafarnia said. \u201cThe Trump administration should reverse past U.S. practice and provide prompt compensation to those unlawfully harmed.\u201d\nHelp Truthout resist the new McCarthyism\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

After shattering fundraising records to sweep Trump into the White House, Musk was tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency and given broad authority \u2014 with little oversight \u2014 to slash his way through the federal bureaucracy.\nOn Friday, the day Musk\u2019s \u201cspecial government employee\u201d status was set to expire, Musk and Trump appeared in the Oval Office together, thanking each other for their work over the course of a friendly, nearly hourlong news conference.\nLess than a week later, that relationship appears to have soured.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said [anything] bad about me personally, but I\u2019m sure that will be next,\u201d the president said on Thursday.\nSure enough, minutes later, Musk said on X: \u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.\u201d\n\u201cSuch ingratitude,\u201d Musk added. He donated nearly $300 million in the 2024 election.\nLater on Thursday, after Musk and Trump continued to trade attacks, Musk suggested that Trump\u2019s name appears in records of the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and said the records \u201chave not been made public\u201d to conceal that fact.\nIn February, the Department of Justice released what it called the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of documents related to the Epstein investigation, which has been a fixation of some of the president\u2019s supporters. It has long been public that Trump \u2014 along with other prominent figures, like Bill Clinton \u2014 are referenced in documents released in court cases surrounding Epstein. But Trump is not accused of any wrongdoing linked to Epstein.\nThe White House and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Musk\u2019s allegations.\nMusk has been on a three-day rampage against Republicans\u2019 reconciliation package in Congress. Before Trump\u2019s Oval Office criticism, he needled Trump directly for the first time \u2014 resurfacing old social media posts in which Trump said he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by Republican efforts to extend the debt limit.\nMusk shared the posts on X, which he owns, adding his own facetious approval.\n\u201cI cannot believe the Republicans are extending the debt ceiling\u2014I am a Republican & I am embarrassed!,\u201d Trump wrote in the January 2013 post.\n\u201cWise words,\u201d Musk replied in a post on Thursday.\nMusk also replied to a Trump post from 2012 in which he said members of Congress should not be eligible for reelection if the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a balanced budget.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more!,\u201d Musk wrote.\nTrump in the Oval Office claimed Musk had known \u201cthe inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody\u201d and \u201che had no problem with it.\u201d That changed, Trump said, once Musk left the government last week. He lumped Musk into a cadre of other former White House aides who have gone on to sharply criticize him, calling it an example of \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d\nTrump said Musk had been \u201cdisturbed\u201d by a part of the over-1,000-page legislation that would cut subsidies for electric vehicles, which would undermine Musk\u2019s company, Tesla. He also suggested Musk had been disappointed when Trump last week pulled the nomination for Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. Musk had recommended Isaacman for the role, but Trump said he had decided to select someone else because Isaacman \u201chappened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat.\u201d\n\u201cSuddenly he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out we\u2019re going to cut the EV mandate that\u2019s billions and billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said.\nMusk quickly brushed aside Trump\u2019s comments at the White House and urged Republicans to scale down the bill\u2019s scope. He also denied Trump\u2019s claim that he knew the \u201cinner workings\u201d of the bill, writing in yet another post that the bill \u201cwas never shown to me even once.\u201d\n\u201cKeep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,\u201d Musk wrote.\nMusk\u2019s attacks began on Tuesday when he called the bill a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d in a post on X. Since then, he\u2019s posted dozens of times chastising the bill for increasing spending and for raising the debt ceiling. In multiple posts, he\u2019s suggested the bill would push the U.S. into \u201cdebt slavery.\u201d\nBut the post on Thursday using Trump\u2019s own words to accentuate his argument escalates the growing tension between the president and the world\u2019s richest man, who was a staunch Trump ally up until this week. Musk shattered records helping Trump and congressional Republicans get elected in 2024, and had spent big in an ultimately unsuccessful effort in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race earlier this year.\nBut last month, Musk said he would step back from political spending. This week, he suggested he may no longer contribute to politicians who support the bill.\nMusk\u2019s attacks come as Senate Republicans work to corral enough support in their ranks to approve the bill.\nOn Wednesday, Trump called for the debt ceiling to be \u201centirely scrapped\u201d to prevent an economic \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d and praised Sen.

If executed, NASA would instead have to rely on Russia to bring supplies and astronauts to the station.

If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches.\nNot everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there \u2014 or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area \u2014 it\u2019s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.\nThanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California \u2014 which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers \u2014 have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.\nIf you\u2019re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.\nLastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won\u2019t cost you to submit a return.\nYour paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that\u2019s not necessarily so.\nOther potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:\n- Interest on your savings\n- Investment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)\n- Pay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle\n- Unemployment income\n- Social Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account\n- Tips\n- Gambling winnings\n- Income from a rental property you own\nOrganize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).\nIf you don\u2019t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts \u2014 a document may have been sent to you electronically.\nHere are some of the tax forms you may have received:\n- W-2 from your wage or salaried jobs\n- 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments\n- 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments\n- 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution\n- 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor\n- 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn\u2019t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022.\n- 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract\n- SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received.\n\u201cBe aware that there\u2019s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you\u2019re responsible for reporting it on your own,\u201d according to the Illinois CPA Society.\nOne very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you\u2019re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven\u2019t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you\u2019re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.\nProofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you\u2019re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.\nLittle mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you\u2019re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.\nWhat to do if you can\u2019t file by April 18: If you\u2019re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.\nNote, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven\u2019t paid by April 18.\nSo if you suspect you still owe tax \u2014 perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn\u2019t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year \u2014 approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.\nYou can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.\nOr the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY.

Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don\u2019t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.\nIf you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state\u2019s revenue department, Martin said.\nUse this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an \u201cinteractive tax assistant\u201d that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.", "Source": "CNN", "Keyword": ["oversight"], "Entities": ["IRS", "more than 100 million", "tens of millions", "IRS", "California", "IRS", "IRS", "less than $12,950", "25,900", "the Earned Income Tax Credit", "IRS", "IRS Free File", "73,000", "Social Security", "over $10", "Venmo", "CashApp", "Etsy", "more than $20,000", "600", "over $10", "SSA-1042S for Social Security", "the Illinois CPA Society", "up to $6,000", "7,000", "Social Security", "IRS", "IRS.gov", "Damien Martin", "IRS", "IRS", "Martin", "IRS"]}, {"Title": "Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back", "Link": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html", "Published": "Fri, 14 Apr 2023 14:29:52 GMT", "Summary": "Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis.", "Content": "Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears.\nRetail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.\nInvestors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts.\nThat led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.\nHowever, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year.\nThe effect of smaller tax returns\nSmaller tax returns likely played a role in last month\u2019s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say.\n\u201cMarch is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,\u201d Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN.\nCredit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth.\nEnhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report.\nA slowing labor market\nAverage hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month\u2019s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month.\nStill, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute.\n\u201cThe big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,\u201d Meyer said.\nEmployers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February \u2014 but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported.\nThe job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\nFor consumers, the effects of last month\u2019s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then.\nThe latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April.\n\u201cOn net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,\u201d Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release.\n\u201cConsumers are expecting a downturn, they\u2019re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they\u2019re waiting for the other shoe to drop,\u201d Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.\nThis story has been updated with context and more details.", "Source": "CNN", "Keyword": ["university of michigan"], "Entities": ["US", "the Commerce Department", "Refinitiv", "IRS", "$84 billion", "about $25 billion", "Aditya Bhave", "US", "BofA Global Research", "CNN", "Bank of America", "the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program", "Bank of America Institute", "the Bureau of Labor Statistics", "ECI", "US", "Michelle Meyer", "Mastercard Economics Institute", "Meyer", "the Bureau of Labor Statistics", "Job Openings", "US", "the Federal Reserve", "US", "Fed", "Silicon Valley Bank", "the University of Michigan", "Joanne Hsu", "the University of Michigan", "Hsu", "Bloomberg TV"]}, {"Title": "Analysis: Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone", "Link": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/media/fox-news-dominion-hnk-intl/index.html", "Published": "Fri, 14 Apr 2023 06:41:00 GMT", "Summary": "This is it.", "Content": "This is it.\nThe media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days.\nJury selection in Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court.

Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color.\nHamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, \u201cwe\u2019re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we\u2019re going to get hit harder.\u201d\nEstablished in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America\u2019s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States.\nHamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital.\nSVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors.\n\u201cWhen other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,\u201d said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors.\nMartinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding.\nMany women and people of color say they are turned away\nMinority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.\nIn 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows.\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that\u2019s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,\u201d Martinez told CNN.\nAsya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB\u2019s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said.\nImmigrant founders often don\u2019t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn\u2019t recognize them.\n\u201cThe community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, \u2018Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,\u2019\u201d Bradley said.\nMany women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the \u201ctop four banks\u201d \u2014 JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank.\nIn her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the \u201ctop four banks\u201d when her brother co-signed for her.\n\u201cThe top four don\u2019t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,\u201d Bradley said.\nNone of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.\nLast week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country.\nWells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank\u2019s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities.\nThe bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund \u2014 a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks.\nBlack-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks.\nOneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets.\nSVB\u2019s collapse could spark future change, entrepreneur says\nBecause of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company \u2014 but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented \u2014 and now we call them underestimated \u2014 founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,\u2019 because I am all three,\u201d Hamilton told CNN.\nSince then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase.\nBut Bradley, who is also an \u2018angel investor\u2019 of minority-owned businesses, said she remains \u201creally hopeful\u201d that community banks, regional banks and fintechs \u201cwill all stand up and say, \u2018Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.\u2019\u201d", "Source": "CNN", "Keyword": ["discrimination", "diversity, equity, and inclusion"], "Entities": ["Silicon Valley Bank", "billions of dollars", "Arlan Hamilton", "Hamilton", "SVB", "Hamilton", "Backstage Capital", "California", "America", "SVB", "the United States", "Hamilton", "CNN", "Hamilton", "State of Black Venture Report", "BLK VC", "SVB", "Joynicole Martinez", "Rising Tide Capital", "Martinez", "the Forbes Coaches Council", "SVB", "the Small Business Credit Survey", "Federal Reserve", "Martinez", "CNN", "Asya Bradley", "Kinley", "SVB", "Bradley", "WhatsApp", "Social Security", "the United States", "Bradley", "SVB", "Bradley", "SVB", "Bradley", "JPMorgan Chase", "Bank of America", "Wells Fargo", "Citibank", "Bradley", "SVB", "Bradley", "CNN", "The Financial Services Forum", "the United States", "millions of dollars", "JPMorgan Chase", "Jamie Dimon", "CNN", "$30 billion", "Black and Brown", "Wells Fargo", "2022 Diversity, Equity", "Inclusion", "the Black Economic Alliance", "the Black Entrepreneur Fund", "$50 million", "Black", "Wells Fargo", "$50 million", "OneUnited Bank", "the United States", "JPMorgan Chase", "$3.7 trillion", "SVB", "Hamilton", "White", "Backstage Capital", "Hamilton", "CNN", "Backstage Capital", "Crunchbase", "Bradley", "SVB"]}, {"Title": "Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs.

And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.\nAt the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store\u2019s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers\u2019 cars cool on hot, sunny days.)\nAs of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.\nBig-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.\nLeveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.\nThe average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That\u2019s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.\n\u201cEvery rooftop in America that isn\u2019t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,\u201d Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America\u2019s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. \u201cNow is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there\u2019s no better place than the roofs of America\u2019s big-box superstores.\u201d\nAdvocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.\nYet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report\u2019s authors told CNN.\nCNN reached out to five of the top US retailers \u2014 Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target \u2014 to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?\nMany renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks \u2014 regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves \u2014 that are preventing more widespread adoption.\nThe need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming \u201cunquestionably urgent\u201d as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.\n\u201cWe are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,\u201d Cowen told CNN. \u201cI would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There\u2019s still a tremendous amount of work to do.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the holdup?\nNeumann said Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space \u2014 an area larger than Manhattan \u2014 and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.\nIt\u2019s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.\nWalmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.\nNeumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it\u2019s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.\n\u201cOf all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,\u201d Neumann told CNN. \u201cAnd for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.\u201d\nAccording to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company\u2019s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location\u2019s electricity needs.\nTarget ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association\u2019s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar \u2014 around a quarter of the company\u2019s stores \u2014 a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties\u2019 energy needs, the spokesperson said.\nRichard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.\nWalmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.\nApproximate number of households companies could power with rooftop solar\n\u201cMy suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cHistorically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.\u201d\nHome Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D\u2019Arcy, the company\u2019s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores\u2019 energy needs on average, he said.\nAging rooftops at stores are a \u201chuge impediment\u201d to solar installation, D\u2019Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn\u2019t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.\n\u201cWe have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,\u201d D\u2019Arcy told CNN.\nCNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties \u2014 stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants \u2014 with solar installations. One of the \u201cmultiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation\u201d was the stores\u2019 ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.\nCowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.\n\u201cFor them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,\u201d Cowen said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.\u201d\nRep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has \u201cfailed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.\u201d The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because \u201cour system is so disjointed\u201d and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,\u201d Casten told CNN. \u201cFor a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn\u2019t want to lose the load.\n\u201cWe could have done this decades ago,\u201d Casten added. \u201cAnd had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we\u2019d also have a lot more money in our pocket.\u201d\nActing on climate, equitably\nFor Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.\nEither way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels \u2014 and it\u2019s doable, Callaway told CNN.\nThe New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.\nIn the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.\n\u201cOne of my huge concerns is social equity,\u201d Cowen said. \u201cAccess to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we\u2019ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.\u201d\nJasmine Graham, WE ACT\u2019s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only \u201cif these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.\u201d\nPressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.\nNeumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.\n\u201cThe sooner we make that transition, the sooner we\u2019ll have cleaner air, the sooner we\u2019ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we\u2019ll have a more livable future for our kids,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cAnd even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Judson Jones contributed to this report.", "Source": "CNN", "Keyword": ["cornell university", "cornell university"], "Entities": ["US", "Walmart", "Target", "Costco", "US", "millions of dollars", "IKEA", "Baltimore", "IKEA", "US", "Frontier Group", "Walmart", "America", "Johanna Neumann", "Environment America\u2019s", "CNN", "America", "CNN", "US", "CNN", "CNN", "US", "Walmart", "Kroger, Home Depot", "Costco", "Target", "Edwin Cowen", "Cornell University", "Cowen", "CNN", "Neumann", "Walmart", "US", "Manhattan", "Mariel Messier", "CNN", "Neumann", "Environment America", "Walmart", "America", "Walmart", "Neumann", "CNN", "Environment America", "Walmart", "US", "California", "Target", "Solar Energy Industries Association\u2019s", "Target", "CNN", "Target", "Richard Galanti", "Costco", "US", "Target", "Costco", "CNN", "Neumann", "Home Depot", "Craig D\u2019Arcy", "Home Depot", "CNN", "CNN", "Kroger", "US", "Kristal Howard", "Kroger", "Howard", "Cowen", "Cornell", "Cowen", "Sean Casten", "Illinois", "House", "US", "Casten", "CNN", "Walmart", "Charles Callaway", "Callaway", "CNN", "New York City", "Callaway", "New York", "Cowen", "Jasmine Graham", "UN", "Neumann", "US", "Neumann", "CNN", "Judson Jones"]}, {"Title": "Here's the real reason to turn on airplane mode when you fly", "Link": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airplane-mode-reasons-why/index.html", "Published": "Fri, 07 Apr 2023 12:52:23 GMT", "Summary": "We all know the routine by heart: \"Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.\"", "Content": "Editor\u2019s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\nWe all know the routine by heart: \u201cPlease ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.\u201d\nNow, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there\u2019s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them.\nAnd mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can\u2019t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask.\nTechnology has advanced a great deal\nAviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s.\nThe digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft\u2019s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference.\nBut in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.)\nThe US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses \u2013 such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications \u2013 so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014.\n2.2 billion passengers\nWhy then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect \u2013 ground interference.\nWireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that\u2019s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here.\nOf course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks \u2013 desirable for their higher speed data transfer \u2013 have caused concern for many within the aviation industry.\nRadio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft.\nAirport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out.\nUltimately, we can\u2019t forget air rage\nMost airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight.\nOn a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls.\nFor me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including \u201cair rage\u201d, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience.\nDisruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews \u2013 typically identified as air rage.\nIn conclusion \u2013 in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft\u2019s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of people to serve.\nHowever, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we\u2019ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional \u2013 but landings are mandatory.\nDoug Drury is Professor, Head of Aviation, at Central Queensland University.\nRepublished under a Creative Commons license from The Conversation.", "Source": "CNN", "Keyword": ["compliance"], "Entities": ["\u2019s Note", "CNN", "the US Federal Aviation Authority", "Boeing", "The US Federal Communications Commission", "EU", "Wireless", "over 2.2 billion", "Australia", "US", "the European Union", "Doug Drury", "Central Queensland University", "Creative Commons"]}, {"Title": "'I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.'

But he had returned to Africa\u2019s bush country \u201cand fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space \u2013 just everything about it. I was at home.\u201d\nTempler said Zimbabwe\u2019s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area\u2019s majestic wildlife \u2013 including the water-loving, very territorial hippos.\n\u201cIt was idyllic,\u201d he told CNN Travel. \u201cLife was really, really good \u2013 until one day I had a really bad day at the office.\u201d\nA good day for a river trek\nMarch 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal\u2019s place. \u201cI loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.\u201d\nThe expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes \u2013 clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak.\nAnd down the famed Zambezi they went. \u201cThings were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.\u201d\nPossible trouble ahead\nEventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That\u2019s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa\u2019s fourth-longest river. They weren\u2019t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But \u201cwe were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. \u2026 The idea was let\u2019s just paddle safely around the hippos.\u201d\nTempler\u2019s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer\u2019s not sure how that happened.\n\u201cSuddenly, there\u2019s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.\u201d The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow.\n\u201cEvans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. \u2026 So I know I\u2019ve got to get him out quickly. I don\u2019t have time to drop my clients off.\u201d He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked.\nBen got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn\u2019t climb.\nAttempting a rescue\nMeanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer\u2019s canoe.\n\u201cI was paddling towards him \u2026 getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you\u2019ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water \u2026 that\u2019s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.\u201d\nHe was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf.\n\u201cI\u2019m leaning over \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie \u2013 Evans is reaching up. \u2026 Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn\u2019t see a thing.\u201d\nWhat happened next was nightmarish and surreal.\n\u201cMy world went dark and strangely quiet.\u201d Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on.\n\u201cFrom the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn\u2019t wet like the river, but it wasn\u2019t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn\u2019t.\n\u201cI realized I was up to my waist down a hippo\u2019s throat.\u201d\nHippos: Huge, territorial and dangerous\nThere\u2019s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic.\nThey sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees.\nTheir teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half.\nThey\u2019re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar\u2019s menagerie).\nHippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles.\nHippos and humans\nThey also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don\u2019t get reported.\n\u201cThe question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: \u2018Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?\u2019 Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview.\n\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure where that started but \u2026 there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.\u201d\nDr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn\u2019t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either.\nWhile more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% \u2013 higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%.\n\u2018He spat me out\u2019\nThose were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer.\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, \u2018We got to get out of here!\u2019 \u201d\nBut Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him \u201cand I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver\u2019s hold when \u2013 WHAM! \u2013 I got hit from below. So once again, I\u2019m up to my waist down the hippo\u2019s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.\u201d\nHe tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn\u2019t grab it. The hippo \u2013 which turned out to be an older, aggressive male \u2013 spat Templer out a second time.\n\u201cThis time when I come to the surface I look around, there\u2019s no sign of Evans.\u201d Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself.\n\u201cI\u2019m making pretty good progress and I\u2019m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm \u2013 and until my dying day I\u2019ll remember this \u2013 there\u2019s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.\u201d\nThis time, Templer was sideways in the hippo\u2019s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth.\nTotal fury\n\u201cAnd then he just goes berserk. \u2026 When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they\u2019re attacking,\u201d Templer said.\n\u201cFor me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he\u2019d go under water, I\u2019d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me\u201d to stop from being ripped apart.\nTempler said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a \u201cvicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.\u201d\nHe figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes.\nMeanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak \u2013 \u201cshowing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine \u2013 pulls his boat in inches from my face.\u201d Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and \u201cMack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.\u201d\nThe expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though.\nWho gets attacked and why\nPeople living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison.\n\u201cMost of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,\u201d Lewison said.\nHuman encroachment from Africa\u2019s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said.\nDespite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos.\n\u201cHippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),\u201d Muruthi said.\n\u201cHippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,\u201d Lewison said. \u201cI don\u2019t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.\u201d\nStuck on a rock and in a hard place\nBack on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, \u201cHe\u2019s gone, man, he\u2019s just gone.\u201d\nTempler knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but \u201cfirst I needed to settle myself down.\u201d\nHe assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered.\n\u201cMy left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.\u201d He couldn\u2019t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was \u201ccrushed to a pulp.\u201d\nBlood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks.\nTempler made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock.\nHe was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back.\nHe described \u201ca profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?\u201d\n\u201cI chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn\u2019t, I kind of wished I would.\u201d\nBen and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn\u2019t have any signs of animal attack on him.\n\u201cEvans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.\u201d\nMeanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock.\n\u201cAnd that was my bad day at the office.\u201d\nNext ordeal: Getting medical help\nTempler was out of the river but not out of the woods.\nIt took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month\u2019s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn\u2019t think he\u2019d live.\nBut not only did the surgeon save Templer\u2019s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation.\nHe realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. \u201cI just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.\u201d\nBut then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was \u201cemotionally all over the map.\u201d\nHe got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis \u201cand then just started trying to get back to life.\u201d\nHow to stay safe in hippo country\nTempler, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education \u2013 and avoiding trouble in the first place.\n\u201cHippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,\u201d Lewison said.\n\u201cDo not get close to them,\u201d Muruthi said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want any intrusion. \u2026 They\u2019re not predators; it\u2019s by accident if they\u2019re injuring people.\u201d\nWant close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses.\nDo not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don\u2019t approach them from behind, Muruthi said.\n\u201cFollow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says \u2018Stay in your vehicle,\u2019 then stay in your vehicle. And even when you\u2019re in your vehicle, don\u2019t drive it right to the animal.\u201d\nMuruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. \u201cIt\u2019s good for them to know you\u2019re around.\u201d\n\u201cHippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,\u201d Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce.\nWarning signals\nGet to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting.\n\u201cThese are signs you should have left already!\u201d Muruthi said.\nIf you\u2019ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill.\nMuruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it\u2019s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said.\nWhat if you\u2019re in a small watercraft?\n\u201cTypically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you\u2019ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. \u2026 If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,\u201d Templer said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said.\nOnce an attack is underway\nUnlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins.\n\u201cOnce attacked, there is nothing you can do,\u201d Muruthi said. \u201cFight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.\u201d He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that\u2019s a tall order.\n\u201cHippos typically hole punch you, so there isn\u2019t much you can do if they get hold of you,\u201d Lewison said.\nBased on his attack, Templer said try not to panic \u201cwhen dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.\u201d\nAnother hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo\u2019s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go.\n\u2018You\u2019re the sum of your choices\u2019\nTwo years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).\nHow did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life?\nAfter a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: \u201cYou\u2019re the sum of your choices. You\u2019re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.\u201d\nTempler said he focused on what\u2019s possible vs. what he\u2019s lost. \u201cIf you look for what\u2019s possible, it generally is.\u201d\nTempler later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book \u201cWhat\u2019s Left of Me\u201d; and is a speaker.\nIs a safari advisable?\nShould people be afraid to even go on safari \u2013 especially in hippo areas \u2013 after learning of a harrowing story like Templer\u2019s?\nMuruthi said go, but go smartly.

She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday\u2019s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit.\n\u201cThe world is your oyster when you are educated\u201d\nCheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. \u201cI know the pain of poverty,\u201d said Cheboi, 29. \u201cI never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.\u201d\nA hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.\nEverything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major.\n\u201cWhen I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,\u201d she told CNN.\nMany basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.\n\u201cI feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,\u201d she said.\nOnce she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.\n\u201cWe have kids here (in Kenya) \u2014 myself included, back in the day \u2014 who don\u2019t even know what a computer is,\u201d she said.\nSo, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya \u2014 in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself.\n\u201cAt one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,\u201d she said.\nA year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals.\nThe hardware is wiped and refurbished before it\u2019s shipped to Kenya. There, it\u2019s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs.\n\u201cWe have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThey can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.\u201d\nThe organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.\n\u201cMy hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they\u2019re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThe world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.\u201d\nAn inspiring night of heroism and advocacy\nCNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and ABC\u2019s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual \u201cCNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,\u201d which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so deeply honored to be here,\u201d said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. \u201cDiane wrote this incredible anthem \u2018Applause\u2019 for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.\u201d\nActor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\u201cFrom his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,\u201d Plaza said.

But we feel really good about the state of our railroad right now,\u201d Hinrichs said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThe yards are in good shape. The network is performing back to where it was in \u201923. And so the team\u2019s done a great job \u2026 quickly getting the network back.\u201d\nCSX (NASDAQ: CSX) was already struggling operationally when it shut down the Howard Street Tunnel for a six-to-eight-month double-stack clearance project. This forced the railroad to detour more than 16 trains per day. The tunnel is a key link in both the north-south Interstate 95 Corridor and the east-west corridor that connects Baltimore with the Midwest and with coal mines in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.\nBy the first week in April, the CSX network had slowed to levels not seen since the 2022 service crisis caused by widespread crew shortages at all four big U.S. railroads.\nThe latest performance metrics, released Wednesday, tell the story of how CSX turned its operations around over the past seven weeks:\nTerminal dwell has improved 20.2% compared to the worst week this year.\nAverage train velocity is running 15.4% above the lowest level posted this year.\nThe number of cars online, a key indication of congestion, has decreased 11.7% compared with this year\u2019s high point.\nAnd CSX is running faster than last year at this time, too. Last week\u2019s dwell was 5.9% lower than the same week last year, while velocity was 3.4% higher.\nAs a result, combined trip plan compliance for intermodal and carload traffic stood at 82.5% in May \u2013 up from 68.1% in early April and in line with December 2024\u2019s 82.7%.\nThe number of cars online is currently 0.7% higher than a year ago. But that figure reflects extended transit times related to detouring traffic around the Howard Street Tunnel and the out-of-service Blue Ridge Subdivision, which has been closed since September due to extensive damage from Hurricane Helene.\nThe recovery came faster than initially expected. Executives had said service improvements wouldn\u2019t come overnight and that the Howard Street and Blue Ridge Sub detours would continue to weigh on the railroad until the projects are completed in the fall.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the team, but I\u2019m not surprised because I know the capability of this organization,\u201d Hinrichs said.\nHinrichs says he also wasn\u2019t surprised by the fragility of the network given a string of unusual events. Sixty miles of the Blue Ridge Sub \u2014 the former Clinchfield Railroad on the rugged North Carolina-Tennessee border \u2014 were wiped off the map in September. Hurricane Milton struck the Southeast right on the heels of Hurricane Helene. Midwestern yards were congested when CSX shut down the Howard Street Tunnel. And then recovery efforts were complicated by spring flooding that hit Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\u201cIn hindsight, we should have made sure that those yards were in better shape before we took the Howard Street Tunnel down,\u201d Hinrichs said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect we\u2019ll have that kind of sequence of events happen again, but we did learn some lessons. Clearly, we\u2019ve got to keep our yards in great shape. And we have to make sure that we stick to our \u2026 service plans, because therein lies our success.\u201d\nIf there is another weather-related disruption, Hinrichs says CSX will be better prepared to respond because the network is running well.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in good shape now and, obviously, our plan and our goal is to keep it running there. What\u2019s encouraging is we\u2019re getting to these levels before we get the Blue Ridge and Howard Street Tunnel back. So we run like this now and we get those two \u2026 projects completed, we\u2019re going to be even in better shape.\u201d\nCSX\u2019s operational problems followed a familiar pattern: As a railroad slows down and gets congested, it eventually runs into crew and locomotive shortages, which makes it harder to run to the operating plan \u2014 much less clear congestion. And when transit times rise, customers add cars to the system, which further snarls operations.\nBut what made CSX\u2019s 2025 meltdown unusual was that it was not accompanied by a wave of customer complaints.\nHinrichs credits this to proactive communication with shippers and close coordination between customer service and operations. The customer service team asked customers to prioritize their shipments. The information was then passed along to operations, which put an emphasis on moving the hot cars. In some instances, CSX trucked containers and trailers around rail congestion so that they would arrive on time.\n\u201cWe did a number of extraordinary things to keep our service focused on our customers and to respond to customer needs,\u201d Hinrichs said. \u201cAnd so what we found really important to customers was visibility and proactive communication. And I think that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t hear a lot of complaints.\u201d\nCSX took several steps to clear congestion. Among them: pulling 45 locomotives from storage, ordering 20 additional locomotive rebuilds, adjusting engineering work blocks to align with natural lulls in traffic, storing 2,000 cars, and collaborating with customers and shortline railroads to pre-block traffic and increase the frequency of interchanges.\nHinrichs says the railroad was adequately staffed on the routes that have had to shoulder the burden of the Howard Street Tunnel and Blue Ridge Sub detours, which account for about 12% of the railroad\u2019s daily train starts. But crew supply got tight once congestion put crews and locomotives out of position.\nTo boost crew levels, the railroad temporarily transferred crews to 13 locations and consolidated extra boards at eight locations. Hinrichs also made two appeals to train crews and other employees to make themselves available, particularly on weekends, to help get traffic moving.\nDid those bulletins make an impact? \u201cI\u2019ll just say I\u2019m really proud of how our team responded. I believe in treating all of our 23,000 railroaders as equals and I felt they needed to know what was happening and what help was needed and where we needed additional help. And they responded,\u201d Hinrichs said.\nIndependent analyst Anthony B. Hatch says CSX did a remarkable job turning its operations around. To please customers, the railroad has been absorbing the extra costs related to the detours. \u201cSo CSX is taking the hit, not shippers,\u201d Hatch said.\nCSX\u2019s first-quarter profits fell as congestion hurt volumes and revenue while driving up the railroad\u2019s expenses.", "Source": "Yahoo News", "Keyword": ["compliance"], "Entities": ["CSX", "the Howard Street Tunnel", "Baltimore", "Joe Hinrichs", "Trains", "Hinrichs", "CSX", "NASDAQ", "CSX", "the Howard Street Tunnel", "Baltimore", "West Virginia", "Pennsylvania", "CSX", "U.S.", "CSX", "Terminal", "CSX", "the Howard Street Tunnel", "Blue Ridge Subdivision", "Hurricane Helene", "the Howard Street", "Blue Ridge Sub", "Hinrichs", "Hinrichs", "the Blue Ridge Sub", "Clinchfield Railroad", "North Carolina-Tennessee", "Hurricane Milton", "Hurricane Helene", "CSX", "the Howard Street Tunnel", "Kentucky", "Tennessee", "the Howard Street Tunnel", "Hinrichs", "Hinrichs", "CSX", "Howard Street Tunnel", "CSX", "CSX", "Hinrichs", "CSX", "Hinrichs", "CSX", "Hinrichs", "the Howard Street Tunnel", "Blue Ridge Sub", "Hinrichs", "Hinrichs", "Anthony B.

Long after he's gone, people will look to the things he's said and the moves he's made for inspiration, an already popular habit on Wall Street.\nBuffett's stock picks are carefully scrutinized because he's made a habit of beating the market over the long run, so for those looking for companies to invest in for a decade or more, it's not a bad idea to take a peek at his conglomerate's portfolio.\nHere are two corporations in Berkshire Hathaway's list of holdings that are worth holding onto for a decade at least: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Visa(NYSE: V).\n1. Amazon\nTrade-related concerns have weighed on Amazon's stock this year. The company could experience decreased sales volume and increased costs within its e-commerce business if President Trump implements his plans for sweeping tariffs aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. Of course, Amazon would also suffer if the economy tanks. Even the company's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), would probably be affected.\nDespite these issues, Amazon is an excellent stock to hold for the next decade. The company is capitalizing on two massive growth drivers: cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), both of which are still in their early stages, according to CEO Andy Jassy.\nThat statement should excite investors, considering that AWS has been one of Amazon's fastest-growing segments and a leading source of profit for a while now. Yet, a massive runway lies ahead. That's not all. Amazon's advertising business continues to grow rapidly. It ended 2024 with a $69 billion annual run rate, a figure that was just $29 billion four years ago -- that's a compound annual growth rate of 24.2%. Besides these fast-growing segments, Amazon's business is diversified. It has footprints in music and video streaming and grocery shopping and is increasingly making a move in healthcare with initiatives that are disrupting the field, such as Amazon Pharmacy.\nThe company may be a leader in several fast-growing markets, but its strongest qualities are its culture of innovation, which has enabled it to identify and pursue attractive opportunities multiple times, and its relentless focus on customer service. Amazon should be able to deliver market-beating results in the next decade thanks to these factors. That makes the stock a buy today despite the issues it faces.\n2. Visa\nHigher tariffs on imported goods could have an indirect impact on Visa. The company generates revenue by charging fees for the credit and debit card transactions it facilitates. If tariffs lead to higher prices for those items, that would be beneficial for the company, as the fees it charges are a percentage of the dollar transaction. It might also lead to less economic activity overall, which would harm the company. It's challenging to predict precisely how things will develop for Visa in the short run, given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policies.\nHowever, the company's business has several advantages that investors should appreciate. Here are three. First, Visa generates juicy margins.\nGross margins in the neighborhood of 80%, while netting nearly $0.50 for every dollar it makes, is a dream come true for a company of this size. Visa's juicy margins stem from the fact that, since it has already built its payment network, additional transactions don't significantly increase the company's costs. Second, Visa doesn't directly issue credit cards. It simply operates a payment network that lets card transactions run smoothly on a global scale.\nSo, the company is not directly at risk of clients defaulting on their obligations. It lets issuing banks deal with that problem. Third, Visa benefits from a strong economic moat from the network effect. The more people hold credit or debit cards that bear its logo, the more attractive it is for businesses to accept them as a payment method.\nThese factors (and others) make Visa's business incredibly strong and consistently profitable. Regardless of what happens in the next few months, the company should continue to perform well as cash and checks increasingly fall out of favor. One factor driving this trend will be the growth of the e-commerce industry, where it's rare and difficult to execute transactions with cash.\nHowever, even in the U.S., e-commerce sales accounted for just 16.2% of total retail sales in the first quarter. It hasn't peaked yet. It should provide ample growth fuel for Visa over the next decade and beyond. Lastly, the company is an excellent dividend stock, even with an unimpressive forward yield of 0.7% -- the S&P 500's average is 1.3%. Visa has increased its payouts by almost 392% in the past decade. The stock should appeal to both growth and dividend investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

(AP) \u2014 As the owner of a marina, Kate Gervais is used to seeing boats in the water. But for the last couple of days, she's been seeing them in the air.\nThe Washington Department of Natural Resources this week used one of its firefighting helicopters to haul abandoned boats off an uninhabited island in the southernmost reaches of Puget Sound, where the vessels had come to rest after drifting with the currents, and fly them to the mainland to be deconstructed later.\nWith 14 vessels removed, it was the agency's largest operation of its kind, officials said.\n\u201cIt was a very, very weird sight,\u201d said Gervais, who owns Boston Harbor Marina, just north of Olympia. \u201cThe sail boat with the mast was the weirdest one to see.\u201d\nA boat removal by helicopter is typically done by a private pilot, but for this operation, which was funded by a federal grant, the DNR opted to use one of its firefighting helicopters. It was cheaper and helped stretch the $1 million NOAA grant, said Commissioner of Public Lands Dave Upthegrove.\nThe state agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment too much. The aquatic lands where the boats land often include kelp beds, which are critical for supporting the forage fish that salmon rely on.\nVessels for this operation where found in hard-to-reach coves, at the tree line or in mud that rendered an airlift a better option, agency staff said.\nSince the boat removal program began in 2002, the department has hauled out more than 1,200 derelict vessels. There are at least 300 more out there, with more found all the time, Upthegrove said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge impacting the Puget Sound when people essentially dump their old boats into the water because they don\u2019t want to deal with disposing of them,\" he said. \"That burden then falls on all of us.\u201d\nThe federal grant allowed the state to clean up boats on Squaxin Island, an uninhabited island that is of particular cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe. The tribe's people once shared vast lands in western Washington state, but following the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek, the island \u2014 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) long and half a mile (800 meters) wide \u2014 was the main area reserved for them, according to the tribe's website.\nMore in U.S.\nEventually, the tribe's members moved off the island, but they continue to use it for fishing, hunting, shellfish gathering and camping.\n\u201cThe Squaxin Island Tribe is very enthusiastic about this opportunity to work with DNR to clean-up derelict vessels on tribal lands,\u201d said Daniel Kuntz, the tribe's policy and program manager. \u201cMaintaining clean beaches and water are essential to the Squaxin Island culture to ensure gathering access for future generations.\u201d", "Source": "Yahoo News", "Keyword": ["federal grant"], "Entities": ["Washington", "OLYMPIA", "Wash.", "AP", "Kate Gervais", "The Washington Department of Natural Resources", "Puget Sound", "Gervais", "Olympia", "DNR", "$1 million", "NOAA", "Vessels", "Upthegrove", "Washington", "Treaty of Medicine Creek", "U.S.", "DNR", "Daniel Kuntz"]}, {"Title": "Analysis-Boeing rebuilding trust as airline bosses see improved jet quality", "Link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-boeing-rebuilding-trust-airline-154712916.html", "Published": "2025-06-05T15:47:12Z", "Summary": null, "Content": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Airline bosses are tentatively voicing greater confidence in Boeing's ability to deliver jets at the right quality in a step towards ending years of reputational damage for the embattled planemaker.\nAn annual summit of airline leaders in New Delhi this week struck a more optimistic tone about Boeing's recovery from overlapping safety, regulatory and industrial crises, though executives stressed Boeing still had much work left to do.\n\"What we've seen quarter to quarter is an improvement in safety, an improvement in quality,\" Seattle-based Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci told Reuters at the International Air Transport Association's annual meeting.\n\"Are they yet there? No, there's still a lot of work.\"\nIn January last year, a door missing four bolts blew off a new Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX jet at 16,000 feet. The ripple effect from the incident caused a crisis throughout the aviation industry, hitting suppliers, carriers and passengers.\nPlanemakers often have to run the gauntlet of airline criticism at IATA's annual meeting, where IATA head Willie Walsh last year urged Boeing to learn from errors that fuelled a crisis beginning with fatal crashes of two MAX jets in 2018 and 2019.\nOne of Boeing's most vocal recent critics has been Tim Clark, president of Emirates, the largest customer for big jets like the Boeing 777 and its long-delayed successor the 777X.\nAt his annual sit-down with reporters at the summit this year, Clark spoke more positively about getting \"clearer messages\" from Boeing's recently appointed leadership.\nHe welcomed a change of style under CEO Kelly Ortberg, revealing he had never met Ortberg's ousted predecessor Dave Calhoun.\n\"It was nice to meet the head of Boeing,\" he said.\nClark, whose airline has 205 of the still uncertified 777X on order, suggested growing confidence from Boeing in private.\n\"When I talk about cautious optimism, in the last few years I had seen none of that\" he said.\nOrtberg, who took the helm last August, has said he will address safety and quality concerns and repair trust with regulators, staff and customers.\nBoeing customers said the measures are showing some results.\nWhile Boeing is still trying to ramp up production, there have been improvements in quality and visibility of deliveries.\n\"There is still further to go but it is definitely an improving story,\" said Peter Barrett, CEO of lessor SMBC Aviation, a major leasing company and Boeing customer.\nAIRLINE INSPECTORS\nFew are taking Boeing's recovery solely on trust.\nAlaska Airlines has sent its own quality inspectors to Boeing's production lines and commissioned a quarterly audit.\nAlaska's Minicucci said Boeing had put in a \"very diligent, deliberate process\" to reduce out-of-sequence work, a disruption to normal factory flows blamed in part for the oversight of the missing bolts.\nHe noted that Ortberg, who has moved to Seattle to be closer to the biggest jet plants, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope, appointed last March, regularly tour factories.\n\"They're getting out there, they're walking the floor, they're feeling what's going on,\" Minicucci said. \"I think that's different to what happened in the past.\"\nOther customers have noted progress, despite a bruising strike last year which halted most of Boeing's jet production.\nUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who took part in a revolt by U.S. airlines that triggered Calhoun's exit after the Alaska incident, said last week Boeing had \"turned the corner\".\nWORK REMAINS TO COMPLETE RECOVERY\nStill, few airline chiefs have any illusions about the scale of turnaround needed to restore the status of Boeing factories.\n\"When I was there last year... I thought this is going nowhere at this rate,\" Clark said, adding he would return this year to see for himself the progress made since then.\nBoeing declined to comment on specific airline opinions.\nNor does the brighter public tone mean airlines will necessarily ease pressure in private as they wait for new jets.\nBut several airline executives at the IATA event acknowledged that Boeing had passed one key test of support at the industry's biggest annual podium, as it slowly stabilises production.\n\"We have got a lot of work still to do (but) there is a lot of positivity from customers on our performance in the first five months of the year,\" Boeing Senior Vice President of Commercial Sales Brad McMullen said.\nIt now faces a decisive test as regulators review higher output after Boeing hit a temporary ceiling of 38 MAX jets a month. It also seeks certification of models including the 777X.\nThe acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday higher output would not happen straightaway.\nOriginally due to receive the 777X in 2020, Clark held out little hope of getting the upgraded jet before IATA meets again in June next year. Boeing has said it is now due in 2026.\n\"The important thing is they get it out and it's certified to the rigours of the new Boeing: the new approach to building aircraft, safety of operation and all the quality controls that they were having difficulties with prior to that,\" Clark said.\n(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)", "Source": "Yahoo News", "Keyword": ["oversight"], "Entities": ["NEW DELHI", "Reuters", "Boeing", "New Delhi", "Boeing", "Boeing", "Seattle", "Alaska Airlines", "Ben Minicucci", "Reuters", "the International Air Transport Association's", "Alaska Airlines", "Boeing", "MAX", "IATA", "IATA", "Willie Walsh", "Boeing", "MAX", "Boeing", "Tim Clark", "Emirates", "Boeing", "Clark", "Boeing", "Kelly Ortberg", "Ortberg", "Dave Calhoun", "Boeing", "Clark", "Boeing", "Ortberg", "Boeing", "Boeing", "Peter Barrett", "SMBC Aviation", "Boeing", "Boeing", "Alaska Airlines", "Boeing", "Alaska", "Minicucci", "Boeing", "Ortberg", "Seattle", "Boeing", "Stephanie Pope", "Minicucci", "Boeing", "United Airlines", "Scott Kirby", "U.S.", "Calhoun", "Alaska", "Boeing", "Boeing", "Clark", "Boeing", "IATA", "Boeing", "Boeing", "Boeing", "MAX", "the Federal Aviation Administration", "Clark", "IATA", "Boeing", "Boeing", "Clark", "Rajesh Kumar Singh", "Elaine Hardcastle"]}, {"Title": "Trump announces travel ban and restrictions on 19 countries set to go into effect Monday", "Link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-announces-travel-ban-affecting-235257056.html", "Published": "2025-06-04T23:52:57Z", "Summary": null, "Content": "Trump announces travel ban and restrictions on 19 countries set to go into effect Monday\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term, announcing that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions.\nThe ban takes effect Monday at 12:01 a.m., a cushion that may avoid the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice in 2017. Trump, who signaled plans for a new ban upon taking office in January, appears to be on firmer ground this time after the Supreme Court sided with him.\nSome, but not all, 12 countries also appeared on the list of banned countries in Trump's first term. The new ban includes Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\nThere will be heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\nIn a video released on social media, Trump tied the new ban to Sunday's terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The suspect in the attack is from Egypt, a country that is not on Trump\u2019s restricted list. The Department of Homeland Security says he overstayed a tourist visa.\nTrump said some countries had \u201cdeficient\u201d screening and vetting or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. His findings rely extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of visa overstays of tourists, business visitors and students who arrive by air and sea, singling out countries with high percentages of remaining after their visas expired.\n\u201cWe don't want them,\u201d Trump said.\nThe inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who have worked to resettle its people. The ban makes exceptions for Afghans on Special Immigrant Visas, generally people who worked most closely with the U.S. government during the two-decade-long war there.\nAfghanistan was also one of the largest sources of resettled refugees, with about 14,000 arrivals in a 12-month period through September 2024. Trump suspended refugee resettlement his first day in office.\n\u201cTo include Afghanistan \u2014 a nation whose people stood alongside American service members for 20 years \u2014 is a moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold,\u201d said Shawn VanDiver, president and board chairman of #AfghanEvac.\nTrump wrote that Afghanistan \u201clacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.\u201d He also cited its visa overstay rates.\nHaiti, which avoided the travel ban during Trump\u2019s first term, was also included for high overstay rates and large numbers who came to the U.S. illegally. Haitians continue to flee poverty, hunger and political instability deepens while police and a U.N.-backed mission fight a surge in gang violence, with armed men controlling at least 85% of its capital, Port-au-Prince.\nMore in Politics\n\u201cHaiti lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and dissemination of law enforcement information necessary to ensure its nationals do not undermine the national security of the United States,\u201d Trump wrote.\nThe Iranian government government offered no immediate reaction to being included. The Trump administration called it a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism,\u201d barring visitors except for those already holding visas or coming into the U.S. on special visas America issues for minorities facing persecution.\nOther Mideast nations on the list \u2014 Libya, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 all face ongoing civil strife and territory overseen by opposing factions. Sudan has an active war, while Yemen\u2019s war is largely stalemated and Libyan forces remain armed.\nInternational aid groups and refugee resettlement organizations roundly condemned the new ban. \"This policy is not about national security \u2014 it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,\" said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America.\nThe travel ban results from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the departments of State and Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence to compile a report on \u201chostile attitudes\u201d toward the U.S. and whether entry from certain countries represented a national security risk.\nDuring his first term, Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\nIt was one of the most chaotic and confusing moments of his young presidency. Travelers from those nations were either barred from getting on their flights to the U.S. or detained at U.S. airports after they landed.

Weeks later, scientists say there\u2019s more to the story\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nA tiny sign revealed in April seemed like it might change the universe as we know it.\nAstronomers had detected just a hint, a glimmer of two molecules swirling in the atmosphere of a distant planet called K2-18b \u2014 molecules that on Earth are produced only by living things. It was a tantalizing prospect: the most promising evidence yet of an extraterrestrial biosignature, or traces of life linked to biological activity.\nBut only weeks later, new findings suggest the search must continue.\n\u201cIt was exciting, but it immediately raised several red flags because that claim of a potential biosignature would be historic, but also the significance or the strength of the statistical evidence seemed to be too high for the data,\u201d said Dr. Luis Welbanks, a postdoctoral research scholar at Arizona State University\u2019s School of Earth and Space Exploration.\nWhile the molecules identified on K2-18b by the April study \u2014 dimethyl sulfide, or DMS, and dimethyl disulfide, or DMDS \u2014 are associated largely with microbial organisms on our planet, scientists point out that the compounds can also form without the presence of life. Now, three teams of astronomers not involved with the research, including Welbanks, have assessed the models and data used in the original biosignature discovery and got very different results, which they have submitted for peer review.\nMeanwhile, the lead author of the April study, Nikku Madhusudhan, and his colleagues have conducted additional research that they say reinforces their previous finding about the planet. And it\u2019s likely that additional observations and research from multiple groups of scientists are on the horizon.\nThe succession of research papers revolving around K2-18b offers a glimpse of the scientific process unfolding in real time. It\u2019s a window into the complexities and nuances of how researchers search for evidence of life beyond Earth \u2014 and shows why the burden of proof is so high and difficult to reach.\nNoisy data\nLocated 124 light-years from Earth, K2-18b is generally considered a worthy target to scour for signs of life. It is thought to be a Hycean world, a planet entirely covered in liquid water with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, according to previous research led by Madhusudhan, a professor of astrophysics and exoplanetary science at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Institute of Astronomy. And as such, K2-18b has rapidly attracted attention as a potentially habitable place beyond our solar system.\nConvinced of K2-18b\u2019s promise, Madhusudhan and his Cambridge colleagues used observations of the planet by the largest space telescope in operation, the James Webb Space Telescope, to study the planet further. But two scientists at the University of Chicago \u2014 Dr. Rafael Luque, a postdoctoral scholar in the university\u2019s department of astronomy and astrophysics, and Michael Zhang, a 51 Pegasi b / Burbidge postdoctoral fellow \u2014 spotted some problems with what they found.\nAfter reviewing Madhusudhan and his team\u2019s April paper, which followed up on their 2023 research, Luque and Zhang noticed that the Webb data looked \u201cnoisy,\u201d Luque said.\nNoise, caused by imperfections in the telescope and the rate at which different particles of light reach the telescope, is just one challenge astronomers face when they study distant exoplanets. Noise can distort observations and introduce uncertainties into the data, Zhang said.\nMore in Science\nTrying to detect specific gases in distant exoplanet atmospheres introduces even more uncertainty. The most noticeable features from a gas like dimethyl sulfide stem from a bond of hydrogen and carbon molecules \u2014 a connection that can stretch and bend and absorb light at different wavelengths, making it hard to definitively detect one kind of molecule, Zhang said.\n\u201cThe problem is basically every organic molecule has a carbon-hydrogen bond,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cThere\u2019s hundreds of millions of those molecules, and so these features are not unique. If you have perfect data, you can probably distinguish between different molecules. But if you don\u2019t have perfect data, a lot of molecules, especially organic molecules, look very similar, especially in the near-infrared.\u201d\nDelving further into the paper, Luque and Zhang also noticed that the perceived temperature of the planet appeared to increase sharply from a range of about 250 Kelvin to 300 Kelvin (-9.67 F to 80.33 F or -23.15 C to 26.85 C) in research Madhusudhan published in 2023 to 422 Kelvin (299.93 F or 148.85 C) in the April study.\nSuch harsh temperatures could change the way astronomers think about the planet\u2019s potential habitability, Zhang said, especially because cooler temperatures persist in the top of the atmosphere \u2014 the area that Webb can detect \u2014 and the surface or ocean below would likely have even higher temperatures.\n\u201cThis is just an inference only from the atmosphere, but it would certainly affect how we think about the planet in general,\u201d Luque said.\nPart of the issue, he said, is that the April analysis didn\u2019t include data collected from all three Webb instruments Madhusudhan\u2019s team used over the past few years. So Luque, Zhang and their colleagues conducted a study combining all the available data to see whether they could achieve the same results, or even find a higher amount of dimethyl sulfide. They found \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d of both molecules in the planet\u2019s atmosphere.\nInstead, Luque and Zhang\u2019s team spotted other molecules, like ethane, that could fit the same profile. But ethane does not signify life.\nDisappearing evidence\nArizona State\u2019s Welbanks and his colleagues, including Dr. Matt Nixon, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of astronomy at the University of Maryland College Park, also found what they consider a fundamental problem with the April paper on K2-18b.\nThe concern, Welbanks said, was with how Madhusudhan and his team created models to show which molecules might be in the planet\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cEach (molecule) is tested one at a time against the same minimal baseline, meaning every single model has an artificial advantage: It is the only explanation permitted,\u201d Welbanks said.\nWhen Welbanks and his team conducted their own analysis, they expanded the model from Madhusudhan\u2019s study.\n\u201c(Madhusudhan and his colleagues) didn\u2019t allow for any other chemical species that could potentially be producing these small signals or observations,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cSo the main thing we wanted to do was assess whether other chemical species could provide an adequate fit to the data.\u201d\nWhen the model was expanded, the evidence for dimethyl sulfide or dimethyl disulfide \u201cjust disappears,\u201d Welbanks said.\nBurden of proof\nMadhusudhan believes the studies that have come out after his April paper are \u201cvery encouraging\u201d and \u201cenabling a healthy discussion on the interpretation of our data on K2-18b.\u201d\nHe reviewed Luque and Zhang\u2019s work and agreed that their findings don\u2019t show a \u201cstrong detection for DMS or DMDS.\u201d When Madhusudhan\u2019s team published the paper in April, he said the observations reached the three-sigma level of significance, or a 0.3% probability that the detections occurred by chance.\nFor a scientific discovery that is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance, the observations must meet a five-sigma threshold, or below a 0.00006% probability that the observations occurred by chance. Meeting such a threshold will require many steps, Welbanks said, including repeated detections of the same molecule using multiple telescopes and ruling out potential nonbiological sources.\nWhile such evidence could be found in our lifetime, it is less likely to be a eureka moment and more a slow build requiring a consensus among astronomers, physicists, biologists and chemists.\n\u201cWe have never reached that level of evidence in any of our studies,\u201d Madhusudhan wrote in an email. \u201cWe have only found evidence at or below 3-sigma in our two previous studies (Madhusudhan et al. 2023 and 2025). We refer to this as moderate evidence or hints but not a strong detection. I agree with (Luque and Zhang\u2019s) claim which is consistent with our study and we have discussed the need for stronger evidence extensively in our study and communications.\u201d\nIn response to the research conducted by Welbanks\u2019 team, Madhusudhan and his Cambridge colleagues have authored another manuscript expanding the search on K2-18b to include 650 types of molecules. They have submitted the new analysis for peer review.\n\u201cThis is the largest search for chemical signatures in an exoplanet to date, using all the available data for K2-18b and searching through 650 molecules,\u201d Madhusudhan said. \u201cWe find that DMS continues to be a promising candidate molecule in this planet, though more observations are required for a firm detection as we have noted in our previous studies.\u201d\nWelbanks and Nixon were pleased that Madhusudhan and his colleagues addressed the concerns raised but feel that the new paper effectively walks back central claims made in the original April study, Welbanks said.\n\u201cThe new paper tacitly concedes that the DMS/DMDS detection was not robust, yet still relies on the same flawed statistical framework and a selective reading of its own results,\u201d Welbanks said in an email. \u201cWhile the tone is more cautious (sometimes), the methodology continues to obscure the true level of uncertainty. The statistical significance claimed in earlier work was the product of arbitrary modeling decisions that are not acknowledged.\u201d\nLuque said the Cambridge team\u2019s new paper is a step in the right direction because it explores other possible chemical biosignatures.\n\u201cBut I think it fell short in the scope,\u201d Luque said. \u201cI think it restricted itself too much into being a rebuttal to the (Welbanks) paper.\u201d\nSeparately, however, the astronomers studying K2-18b agree that pushing forward on researching the exoplanet contributes to the scientific process.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just a good, healthy scientific discourse to talk about what is going on with this planet,\u201d Welbanks said. \u201cRegardless of what any single author group says right now, we don\u2019t have a silver bullet. But that is exactly why this is exciting, because we know that we\u2019re the closest we have ever been (to finding a biosignature), and I think we may get it within our lifetime, but right now, we\u2019re not there. That is not a failure. We\u2019re testing bold ideas.\u201d\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "Source": "Yahoo News", "Keyword": ["arizona state university", "university of chicago"], "Entities": ["CNN", "Luis Welbanks", "Arizona State University\u2019s School of Earth and Space Exploration", "DMDS", "Nikku Madhusudhan", "Noisy", "Madhusudhan", "the University of Cambridge\u2019s Institute of Astronomy", "Madhusudhan", "Cambridge", "James Webb Space Telescope", "the University of Chicago", "Rafael Luque", "the university\u2019s department", "Michael Zhang", "Pegasi b / Burbidge", "Madhusudhan", "Luque", "Zhang", "Webb", "Luque", "Noise", "Zhang", "Zhang", "Zhang", "hundreds of millions", "Luque", "Zhang", "Kelvin", "Madhusudhan", "Kelvin", "Zhang", "Webb", "Luque", "Madhusudhan", "Luque", "Zhang", "Luque", "Arizona State\u2019s Welbanks", "Matt Nixon", "the University of Maryland College Park", "Welbanks", "Madhusudhan", "Madhusudhan", "Madhusudhan", "Nixon", "Madhusudhan", "Luque", "DMS", "DMDS", "Madhusudhan", "Madhusudhan", "Madhusudhan", "Luque", "Zhang\u2019s", "Madhusudhan", "Cambridge", "Madhusudhan", "Nixon", "Madhusudhan", "Welbanks", "DMS", "Luque", "Cambridge", "Luque", "CNN", "CNN.com"]}, {"Title": "Ukraine\u2019s Operation Spider Web destroyed more than aircraft \u2013 it tore apart the old idea that bases far behind the front lines are safe", "Link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-operation-spider-destroyed-more-125227990.html", "Published": "2025-06-05T12:52:27Z", "Summary": null, "Content": "Ukraine\u2019s Operation Spider Web destroyed more than aircraft \u2013 it tore apart the old idea that bases far behind the front lines are safe\nA series of blasts at airbases deep inside Russia on June 1, 2025, came as a rude awakening to Moscow\u2019s military strategists. The Ukrainian strike at the heart Russia\u2019s strategic bombing capability could also upend the traditional rules of war: It provides smaller military a blueprint for countering a larger nation\u2019s ability to launch airstrikes from deep behind the front lines.\nUkraine\u2019s Operation Spider Web involved 117 remote-controlled drones that were smuggled into Russia over an 18-month period and launched toward parked aircraft by operators miles away.\nThe raid destroyed or degraded more than 40 Tu-95, Tu-160 and Tu-22 M3 strategic bombers, as well as an A-50 airborne-early-warning jet, according to officials in Kyiv. That would represent roughly one-third of Russia\u2019s long-range strike fleet and about US$7 billion in hardware. Even if satellite imagery ultimately pares back those numbers, the scale of the damage is hard to miss.\nThe logic behind the strike is even harder to ignore.\nTraditional modern military campaigns revolve around depth. Warring nations try to build combat power in relatively safe \u201crear areas\u201d \u2014 logistics hubs that are often hundreds if not thousands of miles from the front line. These are the places where new military units form and long-range bombers, like those destroyed in Ukraine\u2019s June 1 operation, reside.\nSince the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin has leaned heavily on its deep-rear bomber bases \u2014 some over 2,000 miles from the front in Ukraine. It has paired this tactic with launching waves of Iranian-designed Shahed attack drones to keep Ukrainian cities under nightly threat.\nThe Russian theory of victory is brutally simple: coercive airpower. If missiles and one-way drones fall on Kyiv often enough, civilian morale in Ukraine will crack, even as the advance of Russian ground forces get bogged down on the front line.\nFor Kyiv\u2019s military planners, destroying launch platforms undercuts that theory far more cheaply than the only other alternative: intercepting every cruise missile in flight, which to date has achieved an 80% success rate but relies heavily on Western-donated equipment coming increasingly in short supply.\nAirfield vulnerability\nAirfields have always been critical targets in modern warfare, the logic being that grounded bombers and fighters are more vulnerable and easier to hit.\nIn the North African desert during World War II, the United Kingdom\u2019s Special Air Service used jeep raids and delayed-action explosives to knock out an estimated 367 enemy aircraft spread across North Africa \u2014 firepower the Luftwaffe never regenerated. That same year, German paratroopers seized the airstrips on Crete, denying the British Royal Air Force a forward base and tipping an entire island campaign.\nA generation later in Vietnam, Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army assault teams armed with satchel charges and mortars repeatedly penetrated U.S. perimeters at Phan Rang, Da Nang and Bien Hoa, burning fighters on the ramp and forcing the diversion of thousands of American soldiers to base security.\nThe underlying playbook of hitting aircraft on the ground remains effective because it imposes cascading costs. Every runway cratered and every bomber torched obliges the military hit to pour money into ways to frustrate such attacks, be it hardened shelters or the dispersal of squadrons across multiple bases. Such air attacks also divert fighters from the front lines to serve as guards.\nA new age of drone warfare\nIn Operation Spider Web, Ukraine has sought to repeat that strategy while also leveraging surprise to achieve psychological shock and dislocation.\nBut the Ukraine operation taps into a uniquely 21st-century aspect of warfare.\nThe advent of unmanned drone warfare has increasingly seen military practitioners talk of \u201cair littorals\u201d \u2014 military speak for the slice of atmosphere that sits above ground forces yet below the altitude where high-performance fighters and bombers traditionally roam.\nDrones thrive in this region, where they bypass most infantry weapons and fly too low for traditional radar-guided defenses to track reliably, despite being able to incapacitate targets like fuel trucks or strategic bombers.\nBy smuggling small launch teams of drones within a few miles of each runway, Kyiv created pop-up launchpads deep into Russia and were able to catch the enemy off guard and unprepared.\nThe economic benefits of Ukraine\u2019s approach are stark. Whereas a drone, a lithium-battery and a warhead cost well under $3,000, a Russian Tu-160 bomber costs in the region of $250 million.\nThe impact on Russia\nUkraine\u2019s Operation Spider Web will have immediate and costly consequences for Russia, even if the strikes end up being less destructive than Kyiv currently claims.\nSurviving bombers will need to be relocated. Protecting bases from repeat attacks will mean erecting earthen revetments, installing radar-guided 30 mm cannons and electronic-warfare jammers to cover possible attack vectors. This all costs money. Even more importantly, the operation will divert trained soldiers and technicians who might otherwise rotate to the front line in support of the coming summer offensive.\nThe raid also punches a hole in Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons capabilities.\nLosing as many as a dozen Tu-95 and Tu-160 aircraft, which double as nuclear-capable bombers, would be strategically embarrassing and may prod the Kremlin to rethink the frequency of long-range air patrols.\nBeyond the physical and financial damage to Russia\u2019s fleet, Ukraine\u2019s operation also comes with a potent psychological effect. It signals that Ukraine, more than three years into a war aimed at grinding down morale, is able to launch sophisticated operations deep into Russian territory.\nUkraine\u2019s security service operation unfolded in patient, granular steps: 18 months of smuggling disassembled drones and batteries across borders inside innocuous cargo, weeks of quietly reassembling kits, and meticulous scouting of camera angles to ensure that launch trucks would be indistinguishable from normal warehouse traffic on commercial satellite imagery.\nOperators drove those trucks to presurveyed firing points and then deployed the drones at treetop height.\nBecause each of the drones was a one-way weapon, a dozen pilots could work in parallel either close to the launch site or remotely, steering live-video feeds toward parked bombers. Videos of the strike suggest multiple near-simultaneous impacts across wide swaths of runway \u2014 enough to swamp any ad hoc small-arms response from perimeter guards.\nA new front line?\nFor Ukraine, the episode demonstrates a repeatable method for striking deep, well-defended assets. The same playbook can, in principle, be adapted to missile storage depots and, more importantly, factories across Russia mass-producing Shahed attack drones.\nKyiv has needed to find a way to counter the waves of drones and ballistic missile strikes that in recent months have produced more damage than Russian cruise missiles. The Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 Firepower Strike Tracker has shown that Shaheds are now the most frequent and most cost-effective air weapon in Russia\u2019s campaign.\nBut the implications of Operation Spider Web go far beyond the Russia-Ukraine conflict by undermining the old idea that rear areas are safe. Comparatively inexpensive drones, launched from inside Russia\u2019s own territory, wiped out aircraft that cost billions and underpin Moscow\u2019s long-range strike and nuclear signaling. That\u2019s a strategy than can be easily replicated by other attackers against other countries.\nAnyone who can smuggle, hide and pilot small drones can sabotage an adversary\u2019s ability to generate air attacks.\nAir forces that rely on large, fixed bases must either harden, disperse or accept that their runway is a new front line.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

Because tomorrow, this could be any one of us -- if we let power go unchecked, if we ignore our Constitution.\"\nIn a detention memo filed Friday afternoon in court in Tennessee, federal prosecutors moved to have Abrego Garcia held in pretrial custody \"because he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight, and no condition or combination of conditions would ensure the safety of the community or his appearance in court.\"\nFederal prosecutors, in a detention memo filed this afternoon in court in Tennessee, have moved for pre-trial detention of Abrego Garcia, writing that \"\u2026the United States will request that the defendant be held in pretrial custody because he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight, and no condition or combination of conditions would ensure the safety of the community or his appearance in court.\"\n\"If convicted at trial, the defendant faces a maximum punishment of 10 years' imprisonment for 'each alien' he transported,\" the memo said, \"Accordingly, the sentencing exposure for the defendant -- given the number of undocumented aliens involved -- goes well beyond the remainder of the defendant's life.\"\nMORE: Timeline: Wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who had been living with his wife and children in Maryland, was deported in March to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13. His wife and attorneys deny that he is an MS-13 member.\nThe Justice Department's move to criminally prosecute Abrego Garcia represents the most aggressive step yet in the administration's efforts to gather potentially incriminating information about Abrego Garcia's background, following a federal judge's order requiring the government to facilitate his return to the U.S. to be afforded due process in deportation proceedings.\nThe Trump administration has acknowledged in court filings that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador in March was in error, because it violated a U.S. immigration court order in 2019 that shielded Abrego Garcia from deportation to his native country, according to immigration court records. An immigration judge had determined that Abrego Garcia would likely face persecution there by local gangs that had allegedly terrorized him and his family.\nThe administration argued, however, that Abrego Garcia should not be returned to the U.S. because he is a member of the transnational Salvadoran gang MS-13, a claim his family and attorneys have denied. In recent weeks, Trump administration officials have been publicizing Abrego Garcia's interactions with police over the years, despite a lack of corresponding criminal charges.\nIn March, Abrego Garcia's family filed a lawsuit over his deportation. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ultimately ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that ruling on April 10.\nAbrego Garcia was initially sent to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison but was believed to have later been transferred to a different facility in the country.\nThe criminal investigation that led to the charges was launched in April as federal authorities began scrutinizing the circumstances of a 2022 traffic stop of Abrego Garcia by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, according to the sources. Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding in a vehicle with eight passengers and told police they had been working construction in Missouri.\nAccording to body camera footage of the 2022 traffic stop, the Tennessee troopers -- after questioning Abrego Garcia -- discussed among themselves their suspicions that Abrego Garcia might be transporting people for money because nine people were traveling without luggage, but Abrego Garcia was not ticketed or charged.\nThe officers ultimately allowed Abrego Garcia to drive on with just a warning about an expired driver's license, according to a report about the stop released last month by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\nAsked what circumstances have changed since Abrego Garcia was not taken in custody during that traffic stop in Tennessee, Bondi replied, \"What has changed is Donald Trump is now president of the United States, and our borders are again secure, and thanks to the bright light that has been shined on Abrego Garcia -- this investigation continued with actually amazing police work, and we were able to track this case and stop this international smuggling ring from continuing.\"\nAsked by ABC News' Pierre Thomas asked whether this should be seen as resolving the separate civil case in Maryland in which a federal judge ordered the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said, \"There's a big difference between what the state of play was before the indictment and after the indictment. And so the reason why he is back and was returned was because an arrest warrant which was presented to the government and in El Salvador. So there's, there's a big difference there as far as whether it makes the ongoing litigation in Maryland moot. I would think so, but we don't know about this. He just landed today.\"\nAs ABC News first reported last month, the Justice Department had been quietly investigating the Tenessee traffic stop. As part of the probe, federal agents in late April visited a federal prison in Talladega, Alabama to question Jose Ramon Hernandez-Reyes, a convicted felon who was the registered owner of the vehicle Abrego Garcia was driving when stopped on Interstate 40 east of Nashville, sources previously told ABC News. Hernandez-Reyes was not present at the traffic stop.\nHernandez-Reyes, 38, is currently serving a 30-month sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a prior felony conviction for illegal transportation of aliens.\nAfter being granted limited immunity, Hernandez-Reyes allegedly told investigators that he previously operated a \"taxi service\" based in Baltimore. He claimed to have met Abrego Garcia around 2015 and claimed to have hired him on multiple occasions to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to various locations in the United States, sources told ABC News.\nMORE: Newly released video shows Abrego Garcia's 2022 Tennessee traffic stop\nWhen details of the Tennessee traffic stop were first publicized, Abrego Garcia's wife said her husband sometimes transported groups of fellow construction workers between job sites.\n\"Unfortunately, Kilmar is currently imprisoned without contact with the outside world, which means he cannot respond to the claims,\" Jennifer Vasquez Sura said in mid-April.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who flew to El Salvador and met with Abrego Garcia shortly after his deportation, said Friday that the Trump administration had \"relented\" regarding his return.\n\"After months of ignoring our Constitution, it seems the Trump Admin has relented to our demands for compliance with court orders and due process for Kilmar Abrego Garcia,\" Van Hollen posted on X. \"This has never been about the man -- it's about his constitutional rights & the rights of all.\"\nAbrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2012, according to court records. He had been living in Maryland for the past 13 years, and married Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen, in 2019. The couple has one child together.\nABC News' Laura Romero contributed to this report.", "Source": "Yahoo News", "Keyword": ["compliance", "federal authorities", "department of homeland security", "deportation", "lawsuit"], "Entities": ["Abrego Garcia", "US", "Kilmar Abrego Garcia", "the United States", "U.S.", "Trump", "Abrego Garcia", "Maryland", "El Salvador", "the United States", "Tennessee", "Abrego Garcia", "Texas", "Justice Department", "Abrego Garcia", "Mexico", "thousands of dollars", "Abrego-Garcia", "Abrego-Garcia", "U.S.", "Trump", "Pam Bondi", "Nayib Bukele", "Abrego Garcia", "the United States", "El Salvador", "Bondi", "Bondi", "Abrego Garcia", "El Salvador", "Abrego Garcia", "Bondi", "U.S.", "Abrego Garcia", "Ben Schrader", "Tennessee", "Schrader", "ABC News", "U.S.", "Nashville", "ABC News", "ABC News", "Abrego Garcia's", "Abrego Garcia", "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg", "Kilmar", "Constitution", "Tennessee", "Abrego Garcia", "Tennessee", "Abrego Garcia", "the United States", "Kilmar Abrego Garcia", "El Salvador", "Abrego Garcia", "Maryland", "El Salvador's", "Trump", "The Justice Department's", "Abrego Garcia", "Abrego Garcia's", "U.S.", "Trump", "Abrego Garcia's", "El Salvador", "U.S.", "Abrego Garcia", "Abrego Garcia", "Abrego Garcia", "U.S.", "Trump", "Abrego Garcia's", "Abrego Garcia's", "U.S.", "Paula Xinis", "Maryland", "Trump", "U.S.", "The U.S. Supreme Court", "Abrego Garcia", "El Salvador's", "Abrego Garcia", "the Tennessee Highway Patrol", "Abrego Garcia", "Missouri", "Tennessee", "Abrego Garcia", "Abrego Garcia", "Abrego Garcia", "Abrego Garcia", "the U.S. Department of Homeland Security", "Abrego Garcia", "Tennessee", "Bondi", "Donald Trump", "the United States", "Abrego Garcia", "ABC News'", "Pierre Thomas", "Maryland", "Abrego Garcia's", "Todd Blanche", "El Salvador", "Maryland", "ABC News", "the Justice Department", "Tenessee", "Talladega", "Alabama", "Jose Ramon Hernandez-Reyes", "Abrego Garcia", "Nashville", "ABC News", "Hernandez-Reyes", "Hernandez-Reyes", "U.S.", "Hernandez-Reyes", "Baltimore", "Abrego Garcia", "Texas", "the United States", "ABC News", "Abrego Garcia's", "Tennessee", "Tennessee", "Abrego Garcia's", "Kilmar", "Jennifer Vasquez Sura", "Chris Van Hollen", "Maryland", "El Salvador", "Abrego Garcia", "Trump", "Constitution", "Trump Admin", "Kilmar Abrego Garcia", "Van Hollen", "X.", "Abrego Garcia", "U.S.", "Maryland", "Vasquez Sura", "U.S.", "ABC News'", "Laura Romero"]}, {"Title": "Power bills in California have jumped nearly 50% in four years.

Democrats think they have solutions\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California lawmakers this week advanced several efforts aimed at reining in utility profits and slashing electricity bills as part of their agenda to tackle the sky-high costs of living.\nThe proposals would make sweeping changes to how utilities fund expensive infrastructure projects like putting power lines underground to guard against wildfires. They also would add more oversight around wildfire mitigation spending and put new requirements on utility requests to increase rates. Supporters said the goal is to make the big investor-owned utilities start sharing some of the costs to fight wildfires and build new transmission infrastructure.\n\u201cThis is not a set of modest tweaks that will make minor improvements at the edges of a problem without offending anyone,\u201d said Democratic State Sen. Josh Becker, the bill\u2019s author. \u201cThis is a big deal.\u201d\nOne of the bills is part of the state Senate's package to address affordability amid growing concern about the high costs of everything from gas to groceries. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order last year urging lawmakers to do something to address skyrocketing electricity rates, which rose 47% on average for residential customers between 2019 and 2023, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analysts Office.\nBut Republicans, who are in the minority in both chambers, say Democrats are not meaningfully addressing high prices. They did not support the energy reform bills, saying it wouldn't lower costs, and they unsuccessfully tried to force a vote on a proposal to limit utilities from raising power rates above the rate of inflation.\nRising rates\nUtility rate increases in recent years have been approved by state regulators in part to help investor-owned utilities bury power lines aimed at stopping wildfires. Some of the deadliest and most destructive fires in recent years have been sparked by power equipment. Pacific Gas & Electric, whose equipment sparked a 2018 wildfire that killed 85 people in 2024, raised its rates six times to help cover the costs of putting power lines underground and other improvement projects.\nWhile one in every five ratepayers can't pay their power bills, utilities like PG&E raked in record-breaking profits last year, according to The Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group. The group supports Becker's measure and has sponsored a similar effort in the Assembly.\n\u201cThere are no limits to how much the utilities can ask for in rate increases. There are no limits to how many times a year they can ask,\u201d said Mark Toney, the group's executive director. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame them for asking for the sky.\u201d\nUnder Becker's proposal, utilities would be required to use public financing to fund the first $15 billion spent on capital investment projects. The option would allow utilities to access funding with lower interest rates, and utilities also would be prohibited from collecting a return on that investment for shareholders. That would save customers $8.8 billion over the next 10 years, Becker said.\nThe bill would also set up a state-backed fund to reimburse utilities for wildfire projects, among other things. But the state may not have money to pay for that this year.\nThe bill would also increase oversight of utility budgets and their wildfire spending. Utilities would have to include at least one rate increase proposal that doesn't exceed the rate of inflation in their requests. The proposal also calls for $60 billion worth of credits to apply on bills over the years during the summer months when usage is often at its peak.\nMore in Politics\nOpposition from Republicans, utilities\nSenate Democrats overwhelmingly advanced Becker's measure this week. But Republicans, utilities and the California Chamber of Commerce said it would only drive up more costs. The legislation \u201cmoves today's utility costs around without eliminating them,\u201d the chamber said in a letter in opposition. New regulations around rate increase and shareholder returns also could halt utilities' investment in preventing wildfires or enhancing the grid, the letter said.\nRepublican State senators said rising power bills are caused by Democrats' policies and push for more electric vehicles and less reliance on fossil fuels. In the Assembly, meanwhile, Republicans have called for permitting reforms to make it faster and cheaper to build better utility infrastructure.\n\u201cThe regulation regime that we have in this state is oppressive and definitely drives prices,\u201d said Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican. \u201cYour package of affordability is rather modest in number, but it is even more modest in its potential impact.\u201d\nLawmakers also advanced a slew of other measures aiming to provide relief to ratepayers, including one that would prohibit utilities from using rates to pay for lobbying efforts and one that would allow California to join a regional energy market with other Western states to help increase grid reliability.", "Source": "Yahoo News", "Keyword": ["executive order", "oversight", "executive order"], "Entities": ["California", "SACRAMENTO", "Calif.", "AP", "California", "Josh Becker", "Senate", "Gavin Newsom", "Legislative Analysts Office", "Pacific Gas & Electric", "PG&E", "The Utility Reform Network", "Becker", "Assembly", "Mark Toney", "Becker", "$15 billion", "$8.8 billion", "Becker", "Utilities", "$60 billion", "Senate", "Becker", "the California Chamber of Commerce", "State", "Assembly", "Roger Niello", "California"]}, {"Title": "'Coming for us': Expert sounds alarm on CCP's mission to 'kill Americans' after FBI makes shocking arrests", "Link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/coming-us-expert-sounds-alarm-173921409.html", "Published": "2025-06-05T17:39:21Z", "Summary": null, "Content": "'Coming for us': Expert sounds alarm on CCP's mission to 'kill Americans' after FBI makes shocking arrests\nFollowing news that two Chinese nationals were charged with allegedly smuggling a \"dangerous biological pathogen\" into the U.S. to study at an American university, Fox News Digital spoke to an expert on China who said the arrests should be a wake-up call to the country.\n\"I was entirely unsurprised, which is a sad commentary, but it speaks to the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP wants to kill Americans,\" Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute focusing on U.S. and China relations, told Fox News Digital after FBI Director Kash Patel announced the arrests of the two Chinese nationals.\n\"Look at what they've done with smuggling fentanyl precursors into our country to kill Americans, look at the effects of them failing to stop the spread of COVID-19,\" Sobolik said. \"Dead Americans.

The final version \u2014 filled with last-minute changes meant to placate various factions \u2014 didn\u2019t materialize until 10:40 p.m. the evening before the House\u2019s self-imposed Memorial Day weekend deadline, leaving lawmakers just eight overnight hours to digest it.\nAnd in part it\u2019s because experts \u2014 including, on Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \u2014 keep releasing in-depth analyses detailing how much Trump\u2019s bill would actually cost, and who it would actually affect.\nHere are five things buried in the bill that even some Republicans didn\u2019t realize were there \u2014 or at least aren\u2019t admitting they know about.\n1. Making it easier for Trump to defy the courts\nTo make their orders stick, federal judges really only have one tool at their disposal: holding anyone who defies them in contempt, then enforcing these contempt citations with fines or jail time.\nBut House Republicans quietly inserted language into the bill stating that federal courts may not \u201cenforce a contempt citation for failure to comply with an injunction or temporary restraining order\u201d unless the plaintiff pays what\u2019s known as a security bond at the beginning of the case.\nThe problem? Federal judges often waive such bonds when plaintiffs claim the government did something unconstitutional.\nMore in Politics\nThe second Trump administration, it turns out, has been embroiled in dozens of cases concerning the constitutionality of its actions. In several \u2014 mainly involving deportations \u2014 judges are considering holding administration officials in contempt for refusing to comply with their orders.\nAnd so, if the bill passes as written, it would \u201cpotentially shiel[d] President Trump and members of his administration from the consequences of violating court orders,\u201d as the New York Times recently explained \u2014 in part by \u201cmaking it prohibitively expensive to sue.\u201d\nRep. Flood, for one, is not a fan.\n\u201cWhen I found out that provision was in the bill, I immediately reached out to my Senate counterparts and told them of my concern,\u201d Flood told his (booing) constituents last week. \u201cAnd when I return to Washington, I am going to very clearly tell the people in my conference that we cannot support undermining our court system, and we must allow our federal courts to operate and issue injunctions.\u201d\n2. Blocking states from regulating AI\nIn lieu of any sort of federal oversight, dozens of U.S. states have passed \u2014 or are actively considering \u2014 new laws regulating how artificial intelligence is used or developed.\nBut in a concession to tech companies that claim that patchwork regulations stifle innovation, the House bill would block states from enforcing these laws \u2014 or passing new ones \u2014 for the next decade.\n\u201cNo state or political subdivision may enforce any law or regulation regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act,\u201d the bill reads.\nApparently, Rep. Greene missed that part.\n\u201cFull transparency, I did not know about this section,\u201d she wrote on X. \u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous. This needs to be stripped out in the Senate.\u201d\nAsked why she didn\u2019t \u201cknow about\u201d the AI provision, Greene told the New York Times that \u201cit\u2019s hard to read over 1,000 pages when things keep changing up to the last minute before we voted on it.\u201d\n3. Making single parents work harder than married parents for food benefits\nOne of the biggest cost-cutting measures in the bill is the new work requirement for low-income Americans who receive SNAP benefits (aka food stamps). This includes parents with children age 7 or older; to qualify, they would have to work 80 hours a month.\nBut late in the process, House Republicans created a loophole specifically for married parents. According to the final bill, if a parent is \u201cresponsible for a dependent child 7 years of age or older and is married to, and resides with, an individual who is in compliance,\u201d then they don\u2019t have to complete the work requirement.\nNo such exemption applies, however, to single parents. Since there\u2019s no other parent around to work those 80 hours, they would have to do it themselves (on top of parenting alone).\n\u201cIf you\u2019re married, then you could have one person in the couple as a stay-at-home parent, and only one person has to work,\u201d Carolyn Vega, associate director of policy at Share Our Strength, told Axios. \u201cBut if you\u2019re in any other kind of household arrangement, then everyone needs to be meeting the work requirements.\u201d\nAs of 2022, the bulk of SNAP recipients (53%) were children in single-parent families \u2014 and 80% of single-parent households are headed by mothers, according to census data.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether House Republicans realize their bill would effectively penalize single parents who rely on SNAP \u2014 or whether they\u2019re simply more focused on encouraging married couples to embrace stay-at-home motherhood than anything else.\n4. Cutting Medicaid for U.S. citizens (and not just immigrants)\nIn recent days, Trump and his allies have claimed that the bill wouldn\u2019t cut Medicaid, the program that provides health insurance to more than 70 million low-income Americans.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing any cutting of anything meaningful,\u201d the president told reporters on May 20. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re cutting is waste, fraud and abuse. With Medicaid, waste, fraud and abuse. There\u2019s tremendous waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not cutting Medicaid in this package,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson added on CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there about this, Jake. The numbers of Americans who are affected are those that are entwined in our work to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse. So, what do I mean by that? You got more than 1.4 million illegal aliens on Medicaid.\u201d\n\u201cNo one\u201d \u2014 presumably meaning no U.S. citizens \u2014 \u201cwill lose coverage as a result of this bill,\u201d agreed Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s director of the Office of Management and Budget.\nBut Trump & Co. either don\u2019t know, or aren\u2019t admitting, that their claims aren\u2019t accurate. According to the latest nonpartisan CBO estimate, released Wednesday, the bill would actually slash federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over the next decade, causing the number of people enrolled in the program to fall by 7.8 million.\nHow would it do that? By forcing childless adults without disabilities to work in order to receive Medicaid benefits; by requiring states to impose new co-payments on medical services for Medicaid beneficiaries who live above the poverty line; and by making it easier for a state to cancel its residents\u2019 Medicaid coverage if they don\u2019t complete additional paperwork.\nAs for \u201cillegal aliens,\u201d 14 states currently use their own tax revenues to provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants; the bill would penalize those states by reducing their share of federal Medicaid funding. As a result, the CBO estimates that about 1.4 million more people without \u201cverified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status\u201d would be uninsured in 2034.\nBut the CBO also projects that overall, Trump\u2019s bill would cause the total number of uninsured U.S. residents to grow by 10.9 million over the same period \u2014 meaning the other 9.5 million would presumably be U.S. citizens.\nNoting this, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri has argued that the bill\u2019s Medicaid changes would harm \u201cworking people and their children.\u201d\n\u201cOver 20 percent of Missourians, including hundreds of thousands of children, are on Medicaid,\u201d Hawley said on CNN last month. \u201cThey\u2019re not on Medicaid because they want to be. They\u2019re on Medicaid because they cannot afford health insurance in the private market.\u201d\n5. Adding trillions to the deficit\nMultiple members of the Trump administration have claimed that the bill would not add to the federal debt.\n\u201cThe One Big Beautiful Bill ... helps get our fiscal house in order by carrying out the largest deficit reduction in nearly 30 years with $1.6 trillion in mandatory savings,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a news conference last month.\n\u201cThe bill REDUCES deficits by $1.4 trillion over ten years,\u201d Vought insisted Wednesday on X. \u201cIf you care about deficits and debt, this bill dramatically improves the fiscal picture.\u201d\nIt can be tricky to project forward when it comes to fiscal matters, but it\u2019s worth noting that pretty much every expert disagrees with Vought and Leavitt. By extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts, Trump\u2019s bill would add $3.8 trillion in spending over the next decade; new investments in the border and the military would pile another $400 billion on top of that sum.\nOn the other side of the ledger are spending cuts totaling $1.8 trillion, according to the CBO.\nThat leaves a $2.4 trillion gap \u2014 otherwise known as debt.\nTrump\u2019s allies argue that the CBO isn\u2019t making the right \u201cbaseline\u201d assumptions about policy and revenue; some claim Trump\u2019s tariffs will raise trillions of dollars to offset deficits, or that tax cuts will pay for themselves by spurring economic growth.\nBut the CBO isn\u2019t alone in its approach. According to the New York Times, \u201cthe Budget Lab at Yale ... found the Republican proposal could add $2.4 trillion to the debt by 2034. The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated it would raise deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period. And the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit public policy organization that supports deficit reduction, pegged the uncovered cost at $3.3 trillion over the next nine years.\u201d\n\u201cNot sure what shoddy assumptions someone is seeing, but advocates who claim this bill will improve the fiscal situation are completely at odds with all serious outside experts who conclude it would increase borrowing by trillions,\u201d CRFB president Maya MacGuineas told the Times.\nMusk, for one, seems to agree with the scorekeepers.\nThe bill \u201cwill massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt,\u201d he wrote earlier this week on X. \u201cThis immense level of overspending will drive America into debt slavery!\u201d\nThe bill would also raise America\u2019s debt ceiling from $36 trillion to $40 trillion. On Wednesday, Trump called for scrapping the debt ceiling altogether.", "Source": "Yahoo News", "Keyword": ["compliance", "oversight", "deportation", "temporary restraining order"], "Entities":

The program currently serves about 25,000 people at 120 Job Corps centers run by contractors.\nWhen the Department of Labor announced it was pausing Job Corps center operations, it said the program was not cost-effective, had a low graduation rate and was not placing participants in stable jobs. The department also said there had been thousands of instances of violence, drug use and security breaches at Job Corps centers.\n6. Judge tells ICE not to remove trans migrant seeking asylum from Washington detention facility\nA federal judge in Oregon on Tuesday issued an order barring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from removing a Mexican asylum seeker from a Washington detention facility, according to local reports.\nThe migrant, a 24-year-old transgender woman identified as \"O-J-M\" in court documents, was arrested outside a Portland courtroom on Monday and transferred to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington.\nU.S. District Court Judge Amy Baggio, a President Joe Biden appointee, also demanded that ICE provide the exact date and time of the removal from Portland and explain why it was deemed immediately necessary.\n7.

From online shopping habits to fitness tracking logs, personal information ends up in hundreds of company databases. While most people worry about social media leaks or email hacks, a far less visible threat comes from data brokers.\nI still find it hard to believe that companies like this are allowed to operate with so little legal scrutiny. These firms trade in personal information without our knowledge or consent. What baffles me even more is that they aren\u2019t serious about protecting the one thing that is central to their business model: data.\nJust last year, we saw news of a massive data breach at a data broker called National Public Data, which exposed 2.7 billion records. And now another data broker, LexisNexis, a major name in the industry, has reported a significant breach that exposed sensitive information from more than 364,000 people.\nLexisNexis breach went undetected for months after holiday hack\nLexisNexis filed a notice with the Maine attorney general revealing that a hacker accessed consumer data through a third-party software development platform. The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files. It remains unclear whether this person was responsible for the breach or merely came across the exposed data.\nMASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS\nA spokesperson for LexisNexis confirmed that the hacker gained access to the company\u2019s GitHub account. This is a platform commonly used by developers to store and collaborate on code. Security guidelines repeatedly warn against storing sensitive information in such repositories; however, mistakes such as exposed access tokens and personal data files continue to occur.\nThe stolen data varies from person to person but includes full names, birthdates, phone numbers, mailing and email addresses, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. LexisNexis has not confirmed whether it received any ransom demand or had further contact with the attacker.\nCUSTOM DATA REMOVAL: WHY IT MATTERS FOR PERSONAL INFO ONLINE\nWhy the LexisNexis hack is a bigger threat than you realize\nLexisNexis isn\u2019t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.\nIn 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.\nLaw enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure. And as the recent breach shows, that failure is no longer hypothetical.\nMASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS\n7 expert tips to protect your personal data after a data broker breach\nKeeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands:\n1. Remove your data from the internet: The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.\n2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.\n3. Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers (such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger). You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved, and regularly clear your cookies and cache. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n4. Beware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may try to get access to your financial details and other important data using phishing links. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.\n5. Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores and check app permissions.\n6. Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide, \"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online,\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.\n7. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.\nHR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK\nKurt\u2019s key takeaway\nFor many, the LexisNexis breach may be the first time they realize just how much of their data is in circulation. Unlike a social media platform or a bank, there is no clear customer relationship with a data broker, and that makes it harder to demand transparency. This incident should prompt serious discussion around what kind of oversight is necessary in industries that operate in the shadows. A more informed public and stronger regulation may be the only things standing between personal data and permanent exposure.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShould companies be allowed to sell your personal information without your consent?

Jessica Ramos became the latest to flip-flop on Cuomo and endorse him, casting the former governor as the candidate best suited to run the city.\n\u201cWe need results, we need experience and someone who knows how to deliver under pressure,\u201d she said at a press conference held by the Cuomo campaign in Manhattan.\nThough she is backing Cuomo, Ramos said she will remain in the race to advocate for \u201chigher wages, more housing, and a stronger voice for working people.\u201d\nThe reversal from Ramos, who had called on Cuomo to resign in 2021, came just months after she described him a \u201ccorrupt bully\u201d who \u201cbrings nothing to this race but baggage\" when he entered the race.\nWith her endorsement, Ramos joined lawmakers such as Rep. Adriano Espaillat, state Assembly member and Brooklyn Democratic Chair Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn and Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, along with others who have changed positions on Cuomo and now welcome his leadership ahead of the city\u2019s Democratic primary later this month.\n\u201cThere are a lot of elected officials that have decided they want to look past any bad behavior because they want to look at more immediate needs,\u201d said Basil Smikle, a Democratic political strategist and professor at Columbia University. \u201cThey seem him as a strong person. They probably think he\u2019s the only one that can push back against Donald Trump.\u201d\nCuomo left office after the state attorney general released a report that determined he sexually harassed at least 11 women. He has said he did not intentionally mistreat the women but had instead fallen behind what was considered appropriate workplace conduct, while at the same criticizing the pressure for his ouster politically motivated.\nFor Cuomo, securing the endorsements of those who once castigated him could ease voter concerns about his past scandals and bolster his long-held thesis that he was wrongfully forced to resign.\nIn a statement, Cuomo said he was proud to have Ramos' support and looked forward to working with her to \"put this city back on the right track and make this a stronger and more affordable place for all working men and women.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re both proud Queens kids and with it comes a \u2018Queens attitude\u2019 that is both tough and protective of our families and our neighbors and by extension all New Yorkers,\u201d he said.\nRamos' endorsement came a day after U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez threw her weight behind mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist who has surged in the months leading up to the primary.\nRamos has grown critical of Mamdani as the left flank of the Democratic Party has coalesced behind him.\nShe jabbed at the social media-savvy Mamdani during a debate this week, saying she wished she'd run for mayor sooner but \u201cI thought I needed more experience but turns out you just need to make good videos.\"", "Source": "ABC News", "Keyword": ["columbia university"], "Entities": ["Cuomo", "NYC", "Andrew Cuomo", "New York\u2019s", "Andrew Cuomo", "New York City", "Jessica Ramos", "Cuomo", "Cuomo", "Manhattan", "Cuomo", "Ramos", "Ramos", "Cuomo", "Ramos", "Adriano Espaillat", "Assembly", "Brooklyn Democratic", "Gregory W.

Now activists say he's their top threat\nWhen he first ran for office, Donald Trump seemed like he could be a new kind of Republican when it came to LGBTQ+ rights\nWASHINGTON -- When he first ran for office, Donald Trump appeared to be a new kind of Republican when it came to gay rights.\nYears earlier, he overturned the rules of his own Miss Universe pageant to allow a transgender contestant to compete. He said Caitlyn Jenner could use any bathroom at Trump Tower that she wanted. And he was the first president to name an openly gay person to a Cabinet-level position.\nBut since returning to office this year, Trump has engaged in what activists say is an unprecedented assault on the LGBTQ+ community. The threat from the White House contrasts with World Pride celebrations taking place just blocks away in Washington, including a parade and rally this weekend.\n\u201cWe are in the darkest period right now since the height of the AIDS crisis,\u201d said Kevin Jennings, who leads Lambda Legal, a longtime advocacy organization. \u201cI am deeply concerned that we\u2019re going to see it all be taken away in the next four years.\u201d\nTrump's defenders insist the president has not acted in a discriminatory way, and they point to public polling that shows widespread support for policies like restrictions on transgender athletes.\n\u201cHe\u2019s working to establish common sense once again,\u201d said Ed Williams, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, which represents LGBT conservatives.\nHarrison Fields, the principal deputy press secretary at the White House, said, \u201cthe overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people.\u201d\n\u201cThe president continues to foster a national pride that should be celebrated daily, and he is honored to serve all Americans,\u201d Fields said.\nTrump made anti-transgender attacks a central plank of his campaign reelection message as he called on Congress to pass a bill stating there are \u201conly two genders\u201d and pledged to ban hormonal and surgical intervention for transgender minors. He signed an executive order doing so in January.\nHis rally speeches featured a spoof video mocking transgender people and their place in the U.S. military. Trump has since banned them outright from serving. And although June is recognized nationally as Pride month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters this week that Trump has \u201cno plans for a proclamation.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell you this president is very proud to be a president for all Americans, regardless of race, religion or creed,\u201d she added, making no mention of sexual orientation or gender identity.\nWilliams described Pride activities as a progressive catch-all rather than a civil rights campaign. \u201cIf you\u2019re not in the mood to protest or resist the Trump administration,\u201d he said, \u201cPride is not for you.\u201d\nTrump declined to issue Pride Month proclamations in his first term, but did recognize the celebration in 2019 as he publicized a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality headed by Richard Grenell, then the U.S. Ambassador to Germany and the highest-profile openly gay person in the administration. (Grenell now serves as envoy for special missions.)\n\u201cAs we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation,\u201d Trump posted on social media.\nThis time, there is no celebrating.\nThe Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which Trump named himself chairman of after firing members of the board of trustees, canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., at one of the nation\u2019s premier cultural institutions.\nTrump, who indicated when he took up the position that he would be dictating programming, had specifically said he would end events featuring performers in drag. The exterior lights that once lit the venue on the Potomac River in the colors of the rainbow were quickly replaced with red, white and blue.\nMultiple artists and producers involved in the center\u2019s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues.\nInside the White House, there's little second-guessing about the president's stances. Trump aides have pointed to their decision to seize on culture wars surrounding transgender rights during the 2024 campaign as key to their win. They poured money into ads aimed at young men \u2014 especially young Hispanic men \u2014 attacking Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for supporting \u201ctaxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,\u201d including one spot aired during football games.\n\u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,\u201d the narrator said.\nJennings flatly rejected assertions that the administration hasn\u2019t been discriminatory. \u201cAre you kidding me? You\u2019re throwing trans people out of the military. That\u2019s example No. 1.\u201d\nHe points to the cancellation of scientific grants and funding for HIV/AIDS organizations, along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's \u201cpetty and mean\u201d order to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, which commemorates the gay rights activist and Navy veteran.\nJennings also said it doesn't help that Trump has appointed openly gay men like Grenell and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to high-profile positions: \u201cI would call it window dressing.\u201d\nCraig Konnoth, a University of Virginia professor of civil rights, compared the U.S.\u2019 trajectory to that of Russia, which has seen a crackdown on gay and lesbian rights after a long stretch of more progressive policies. In 2023, Russia\u2019s Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism.\nWilliams said Trump has made the Republican Party more accepting of gay people. First lady Melania Trump, he noted, has hosted fundraisers for his organization.\n\u201cOn the whole, we think he\u2019s the best president ever for our community. He\u2019s managed to support us in ways that we have never been supported by any administration,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe are vastly accepted within our party now.\u201d\nTrump's approach to LGBTQ+ rights comes amid a broader shift among Republicans, who have grown less tolerant in recent years.\nWhile overall support for same-sex marriage has been stable, according to Gallup, the percentage of Republicans who think marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized as valid with the same rights as traditional marriage dropped to 41% this year. That's the lowest point since 2016, a year after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, and a substantial decline from a high of 55% in 2021.\nThere's been a similar drop in the share of Republicans who say that gay and lesbian relations are morally acceptable, which has dropped from 56% in 2022 to 38% this year. Democrats, meanwhile, continue to overwhelmingly support same-sex marriage and say that same-sex relations are morally acceptable.\nAn AP-NORC poll from May also found that Trump\u2019s approach to handling transgender issues has been a point of relative strength for the president. About half (52%) of U.S. adults said they approve of how he\u2019s handling transgender issues \u2014 a figure higher than his overall job approval (41%).\nDouglas Page, who studies politics and gender at Gettysburg College, said that \u201ctrans rights are less popular than gay rights, with a minority of Republicans in favor of trans rights. This provides incentives for Republicans to speak to the conservative side of that issue.\u201d\n\u201cGay people are less controversial to Republicans compared to trans people,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cso gay appointees like Secretary Bessent probably won\u2019t ruffle many feathers.\u201d\n___\nColvin reported from New York.

As Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith recently put it, \u201cWe are really the experts in this space when it comes to crowd management.\u201d\nOver the next eight days. in the sprawling city that is the nation's capital, that expertise will be put to the test.\nThe District of Columbia is playing host to massive events on back-to-back weekends. Two wildly divergent events each carry the extra possibility of counterprotests or disruption, adding a layer of anxiety to the usual logistical hassles.\nJune 7 and 8 brings the peak of the two-week World Pride celebration with two days of mass gatherings \u2014 a parade on Saturday and a rally and protest March Sunday. Both days culminate in a giant street party and concert covering a multi-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue.\nThen as cleanup from World Pride wraps up, preparations will begin for the much-hyped June 14 military parade to celebrate the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army (and the 79th birthday of a certain White House resident).\nAnd while D.C. officials can claim they have seen it all before in terms of mass events, June 14 will present some genuinely unique challenges \u2014 actual 60-ton M1 Abrams battle tanks and Paladin self-propelled howitzers rolling through the city streets.\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has gone out of her way to stay on the good side of President Donald Trump, has not disguised her discomfort at the prospect of armored vehicles chewing up the downtown asphalt. And she is still openly leery, despite assurances from the military that it will cover the costs of all repairs, and a plan to install protective plates at intersections.\n\u201cI think that there has been time and attention paid to how to move this heavy equipment in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt (roads),\u201d Bowser said last week. \"I remain concerned about it. If they are rendered unusable, we have to make them usable and then go seek our money from the feds.\u201d\nFor each of these high-profile weekends, police and security officials are on alert for any sort of counterprotest or attempts to disrupt the proceedings. Trump's campaign against transgender protections and oft-stated antipathy for drag shows have fueled fears of violence against World Pride participants; at one point earlier this spring, rumors circulated that the Proud Boys were planning to disrupt this weekend's celebrations.\nThose fears have proven to be unfounded so far, although one D.C. queer bar was vandalized last week. With those fears in mind, organizers will install security fencing around the entire two-day street party.\n\u201cWe wanted to provide some extra safety measures (based on) concerns from some people in the community,\u201d said Ryan Bos, executive director of the Capital Pride Alliance.\nThe bi-annual World Pride has, in the past, drawn as many as 1 million visitors to its host city. It remains to be seen just how large the final influx will be for the nation\u2019s capital. Early hotel reservation numbers had indicated that attendance would be down somewhat, a possible result of international participants staying away out of either fear of harassment or in protest of Trump's policies.\nBut Elliott Ferguson, president of Destination D.C. \u2014 which tracks hotel reservations \u2014 told reporters last week they were witnessing \u201ca surge at the last minute\u201d of people coming in for the final World Pride weekend.\nThe military parade, meanwhile, is expected to draw as many as 200,000 people, according to Army estimates. A large counterprotest against Trump \u2014 dubbed the No Kings rally \u2014 will march down 16th Street to within sight of the White House but isn't expected to get close enough to the military parade to disrupt things.\nLindsey Appiah, the deputy mayor for public safety, acknowledges that longstanding plans for the Army's 250th birthday \u201cgot a lot bigger on short notice\u201d when Trump got involved.\n\u201cYou have to be very flexible, very nimble. Things change and you have plans and then those plans change,\" she said. \"I think we\u2019ve really learned to do that.\u201d\nAppiah points out an example of the District's capabilities from early this year, when the city hosted the congressional certification of Trump\u2019s electoral win, the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter and then Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20 \u2014 all in the span of two weeks and in the midst of a huge winter storm.\nD.C. officials also point out that the logistical challenge facing the capital city doesn't actually end on June 14. The military parade will be followed by three matches for the FIFA Club World Cup starting on June 18 and running through June 26, which will then roll straight into preparations for the traditional July 4 fireworks extravaganza.\nClint Osborn, head of the city's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, said the summer planning schedule \"feels like Super Bowl after Super Bowl after Super Bowl.\u201d", "Source": "ABC News", "Keyword": ["protests"], "Entities": ["DC", "WASHINGTON", "Metropolitan Police Department", "Pamela Smith", "The District of Columbia", "World Pride", "the U.S. Army", "White House", "D.C.", "Paladin", "D.C.", "Muriel Bowser", "Donald Trump", "Bowser", "Trump", "World Pride", "D.C.", "Ryan Bos", "the Capital Pride Alliance", "World Pride", "Trump", "Elliott Ferguson", "World Pride", "Army", "Trump", "the White House", "Lindsey Appiah", "Army", "Trump", "Appiah", "Trump", "Jimmy Carter", "Trump", "D.C.", "World Cup", "Clint Osborn", "Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency", "Super Bowl", "Super Bowl"]}, {"Title": "Transgender troops face a deadline and a difficult decision: Stay or go?", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/transgender-troops-face-deadline-difficult-decision-stay-122580396", "Published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 12:30:24 -0400", "Summary": "As transgender service members face a deadline to leave the U.S. military, hundreds are taking the financial bonus to depart voluntarily", "Content": "Transgender troops face a deadline and a difficult decision: Stay or go?\nAs transgender service members face a deadline to leave the U.S. military, hundreds are taking the financial bonus to depart voluntarily\nWASHINGTON -- As transgender service members face a deadline to leave the U.S. military, hundreds are taking the financial bonus to depart voluntarily. But others say they will stay and fight.\nFor many, it is a wrenching decision to end a career they love, and leave units they have led or worked with for years. And they are angry they are being forced out by the Trump administration's renewed ban on transgender troops.\nActive duty service members had until Friday to identify themselves and begin to leave the military voluntarily, while the National Guard and Reserve have until July 7. Then the military will begin involuntary separations.\nFriday's deadline comes during Pride Month and as the Trump administration targets diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying it's aiming to scrub the military of \u201cwokeness\u201d and reestablishing a \u201cwarrior ethos.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re tired of the rollercoaster. They just want to go,\u201d said one transgender service member, who plans to retire. \u201dIt\u2019s exhausting.\u201d\nFor others, it's a call to arms.\n\u201cI\u2019m choosing to stay in and fight,\u201d a noncommissioned officer in the Air Force said. \u201cMy service is based on merit, and I\u2019ve earned that merit.\u201d\nThe troops, who mainly spoke on condition of anonymity because they fear reprisals, said being forced to decide is frustrating. They say it's a personal choice based on individual and family situations, including whether they would get an infusion of cash or possibly wind up owing the government money.\n\u201cI'm very disappointed,\u201d a transgender Marine said. \u201cI've outperformed, I have a spotless record. I'm at the top of every fitness report. I'm being pushed out while I know others are barely scraping by.\u201d\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said this is President Donald Trump\u2019s directive and what America voted for. The Pentagon, he said, is \u201cleaving wokeness & weakness behind\u201d and that includes \u201cno more dudes in dresses.\u201d\nSen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a veteran, and 22 other Democratic senators have written to Hegseth urging him to allow transgender troops to keep serving honorably.\nAlready, more than 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and are slated to begin leaving, according to rough Defense Department estimates. Defense officials say there are about 4,240 active duty transgender troops but acknowledge the numbers are fuzzy.\nFor many, the decision is financial.\nThose who voluntarily leave will get double the amount of separation pay they would normally receive and won't have to return bonuses or tuition costs. Those who refuse to go could be forced to repay reenlistment or other bonuses as high as $50,000.\nThat was the tipping point for Roni Ferrell, an Army specialist at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington.\nFerrell, 28, lives on base with her wife and two children and had planned to stay in the Army for at least another decade. But she said she felt \u201cbacked into a corner\u201d to sign the voluntary separation agreement, fearing she would have to repay an $18,500 reenlistment bonus.\n\u201cMy commander basically said it was my only option in order to make sure my kids are taken care of,\u201d Ferrell said.\nThe Marine, who has served for more than 25 years, said she had planned to stay and fight, but changed her mind. Lawyers, she said, told her an involuntary separation would put a code in her record saying she was forced to leave \u201cin the interests of national security.\u201d\nThat designation, she said, could mean those involuntarily separated could lose their security clearances, hurting future job prospects.\nIn a statement Friday, a defense official said the code \u201cis not intended\u201d to trigger clearance revocations and that gender dysphoria is not a security reporting requirement, according to the director of national intelligence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\nCynthia Cheng-Wun Weaver, senior director of litigation for Human Rights Campaign, said it\u2019s important for troops to talk with judge advocates general in their services to ensure they understand the different procedures being implemented.\nThe Air Force service member and a transgender officer in the Army National Guard both said they plan to stay and fight. Lawsuits over the ban continue and could change or block the policy.\nFor troops involved in the court battles as plaintiffs, leaving voluntarily now would likely hurt their standing in the case. For others, it's simply dedication to their career.\n\u201cI\u2019ve really embraced military culture, and it\u2019s embraced me,\u201d the Air Force member said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s the career that I love.\u201d\nThe Guard soldier echoed that sentiment, saying he will stay on \"because it is important to me to serve. Frankly, I\u2019m good at it, I\u2019m well trained so I want to continue.\u201d\nOthers without bonuses to repay or who have been in the military only a short while and won't get much in separation bonus pay may opt to stay and see what happens.\nNational Guard members who are heading to their monthly drill weekend or annual two-week drill in June could be required to go but serve as the gender they were assigned at birth.\nThat means they would have to wear uniforms and haircuts of that gender, use that bathroom and be referred to as \u201csir\u201d or \u201cma'am\u201d based on that gender.\nFor many, that could be close to impossible and create uncomfortable situations.\n\u201cIf I were to show up to drill this weekend, I\u2019d be expected to use all female facilities, I would be expected to wear a woman\u2019s uniform,\u201d said the Army Guard officer, who transitioned to male about five years ago and says others in his unit know him as a man. \u201cI don\u2019t look like a woman. I don\u2019t feel like a woman. It would be disruptive to good order and discipline for me to show up and to tell my soldiers, you have to call me \u2018ma\u2019am\u2019 now.\u201d\nIt's not clear if Guard units are handling it all the same way, and it could be up to individual states or commanders. Some may allow troops to postpone the drill or go on administrative leave.\nThe service members interviewed by The Associated Press said they don\u2019t know what will happen once the deadline passes to leave voluntarily.\nSome believe that unit commanders will quickly single people out and start involuntary separations. Others say the process is vague, may involve medical review boards and could take months.\nThe defense official said Friday that as the Pentagon takes these steps, it \u201cwill treat our service members with dignity and respect.\u201d\nUnder Hegseth\u2019s directive, military commanders will be told to identify troops with gender dysphoria \u2014 when a person\u2019s biological sex does not match their gender identity \u2014 and send them to get medical checks to force them out of the service, defense officials have said. The order relies on routine annual health checks \u2014 so it could be months before that evaluation is scheduled.\n\u201cMy real big sticking point is that this administration's whole push is to reform this country based around merit, and that gender, race, etc., should have no factor in hiring,\u201d the Air Force service member said. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, I\u2019m solely being removed for my gender, and merit is no longer a factor.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer R.J.

Murphy in Boston found the Trump administration had violated his order by swiftly sending eight migrants from countries including Cuba and Vietnam to the east African nation.\nThe judge said that men from other countries must have a real chance to raise fears about dangers they could face in South Sudan.\nThe men's lawyers, though, have still not been able to talk to them, said Robyn Barnard, senior director of refugee advocacy at Human Rights First, whose stated mission is to ensure the United States is a global leader on human rights. Barnard spoke Friday at a hearing of Democratic members of Congress and said some family members of the men had been able to talk to them Thursday.\nThe migrants have been previously convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., and President Donald Trump's administration has said that it was unable to return them quickly to their home countries. The Justice Department has also appealed to the Supreme Court to immediately intervene and allow swift deportations to third countries to resume.\nThe case comes amid a sweeping immigration crackdown by the Republican administration, which has pledged to deport millions of people who are living in the United States illegally. The legal fight became another flashpoint as the administration rails against judges whose rulings have slowed the president\u2019s policies.\nThe Trump administration said the converted conference room in the shipping container is the only viable place to house the men on the base in Djibouti, where outdoor daily temperatures rise above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), according to the declaration from an ICE official.\nNearby burn pits are used to dispose of trash and human waste, and the smog cloud makes it hard to breathe, sickening both ICE officers guarding the men and the detainees, the documents state.

Yet cross-national strategizing has still been central to the gathering as international attendees echoed that they wanted to send a clear message of opposition to U.S. officials with their presence.\n\u201cThis is World Pride on Trump\u2019s doorstep,\" said Yasmin Benoit, a British model and asexual activist. \"And that\u2019s all the more reason to be here. We want to show the U.S. that there\u2019s a lot of eyes on what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\nWorld Pride gathers LGBTQ+ advocates from around the globe and has taken place most recently in Australia, Sweden and Denmark. This year, which marks the 50th anniversary of Washington's Pride festival, is the first time the city is hosting the gathering. Yet for many, the global celebration has been complicated by President Donald Trump's policies targeting transgender people and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nTrump, a Republican, has said that whether a person is a man or woman is determined by that person's biological characteristics at birth, and about two-thirds of U.S. adults agree with him, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. He has denounced DEI policies as a form of discrimination that threatens merit-based decision-making.\nSeveral countries, including Denmark, Finland and Germany, issued cautions for LGBTQ+ travelers visiting the U.S. for World Pride, culminates in a closing festival this weekend with a parade, a rally and concerts. Capital Pride Alliance, which organized World Pride D.C., included an advisory for transgender and nonbinary international travelers alongside security protocols.\nEgale Canada, one of the country\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, announced in February that its members would not attend any events in the U.S. through June, including World Pride. It cited concerns for transgender and nonbinary staff members.\n\u201cI didn't feel it was safe to have our staff crossing into the U.S. with the current hostilities, through legislation and rhetoric,\u201d said Helen Kennedy, the organization\u2019s executive director.\nThe African Human Rights Coalition, meanwhile, called for a boycott of World Pride in Washington \u201cbecause the event is being held in a venue ... governed now by an antagonistic fascist regime which presents distinct dangers to foreign LGBTQI+ attendees,\u201d the organization said in a statement.\nJessica Stern, a former U.S. special envoy for the human rights of LGBTQI+ people, acknowledged that many potential attendees decided to skip World Pride as they \u201cwonder if they\u2019ll be safe in U.S. airports and on our streets.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for coming to the U.S. amid a time of great uncertainty,\u201d she said in her opening remarks before an emcee later instructed attendees to shout out where they had traveled from. Answers included New Zealand, Sweden, England, Zimbabwe, Australia, Nigeria and India.\nAs an increasing number of international travelers have expressed anxiety, John Tanzella, president of the International LGBTQ+ Travel Association, said he has assured people that Washington is an inclusive city but advised them to stay informed of local policies, connect with LGBTQ+ organizations on the ground and book with trusted businesses with track records of inclusion. The organization is working on guidance for transgender and nonbinary travelers in the U.S. for the World Pride parade and march.\n\u201cSafety always comes up, especially in the current climate, but there\u2019s also a deep desire to bring our community together,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many, World Pride in Washington, D.C., feels extra meaningful given its location. There\u2019s caution, yes, but above all, people want to show up, be seen and be heard.\u201d\nBenoit's friends had warned her not to travel to the U.S., and her anxiety was mounting in the days leading up to her flight. She planned to avoid telling customs agents she was traveling for World Pride. But when that information surfaced, she said agents took her passport and asked her questions for an additional hour about where she was staying and for how long.\nStill, she said, it is more important now than ever to \u201csend a message to Trump in his own backyard\" and to embrace the global nature of World Pride.\n\u201cThe ability to bring people together to understand how interconnected everything is, how this harmful rhetoric may bleed over to other countries, is really important,\" she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an opportunity to access resources and people you may not have access to back home.\u201d\nEssy Adhiambo, executive director of the Initiative for Equality and Non Discrimination, deleted all the social media apps on her phone before her 35-hour journey from Mombasa, Kenya, worrying that her phone might be searched.

The rule said that existing policies against sex discrimination covered discrimination based on gender identity, so that health care providers risked losing federal funds if they refused to provide gender-affirming care.\nWelte also barred the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from telling employers that a failure to have health plans cover gender-affirming care for their workers would represent discrimination based on sex that could lead to a lawsuit against them and penalties.\nThe judge rejected a request from an order of nuns, two Catholic homes and the Catholic Benefits Association, which represents employers, to impose similar bans on each agency covering abortion and fertility treatments Catholic organizations consider immoral. He said those claims were \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d and not ready for court review.\nBut he concluded that allowing the two agencies to enforce policies on gender-affirming care or health coverage for it would restrict employers' and health care providers' ability to live out their religious beliefs, violating a 1992 federal law meant to provide broad protections for religious freedoms. The HHS rule had a provision allowing the agency to make case-by-case exceptions based on religious beliefs, but Welte said that would be insufficient.\n\u201cThe case-by-case exemption procedure leaves religious organizations unable to predict their legal exposure without furthering any compelling antidiscrimination interests,\u201d wrote Welte, who is based in Fargo.\nThe two agencies did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment Thursday.\nThe Catholic Benefits Association serves more than 9,000 employers and about 164,000 employees enrolled in member health plans, according to its website.\nThe group, founded in 2013, says it \u201cadvocates for and litigates in defense of our members\u2019 First Amendment rights to provide employee benefits and a work environment that is consistent with the Catholic faith.\u201d The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects religious freedoms.\nAssociation General Counsel Martin Nussbaum welcomed the ruling, saying the organization\u2019s members \u201cwant to do the right thing in their health plan and in their medical services that they provide for those medical providers, and this gives them protection to doing that.\u201d\nAnd he said the judge's ruling suggests there are no mandates from the federal government on abortion or fertility treatments, so there is \u201cno need to provide protection.\u201d\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the Civil Rights Act's protections against discrimination based on sex also cover anti-LGBTQ+ bias in employment. The landmark 1964 act doesn't have specific provisions dealing with bias based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\nBut courts also have intervened to limit how far the federal government can go in combating anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination when religious organizations or employers with religious beliefs against LGBTQ+ rights are involved.\nBoth the HHS rule and the EEOC's policy on sex discrimination have their roots in efforts by President Barack Obama to protect LGBTQ+ rights in 2016, in his last year in office.\nWhen President Donald Trump began his second term in January, he issued an order saying the federal government would not recognize transgender people's gender identities. In April, two employees said the EEOC was classifying all new gender identity-related discrimination cases as its lowest priority, essentially putting them on indefinite hold.\nThe 2024 HHS rule also covered bias based on \u201dpregnancy or related conditions,\" and the Catholic health care providers argued that they might face losing federal funds if they refused to perform abortions, in line with Catholic opposition to abortion. But HHS said the rule wouldn't have forced them to perform abortions or provide health coverage for abortions \u2014 only that it couldn't refuse to care for someone because they'd had one, according to Welte.\n___\nHanna reported from Topeka, Kansas.", "Source": "ABC News", "Keyword": ["civil rights", "discrimination", "lawsuit"], "Entities": ["N.D.", "U.S.", "Peter Welte", "North Dakota", "the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services", "Joe Biden", "Welte", "the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission", "the Catholic Benefits Association", "HHS", "Welte", "Welte", "Fargo", "The Catholic Benefits Association", "The First Amendment", "the U.S. Constitution", "Martin Nussbaum", "The U.S. Supreme Court", "the Civil Rights Act's", "HHS", "EEOC", "Barack Obama", "Donald Trump", "EEOC", "HHS", "HHS", "Welte", "Hanna", "Topeka", "Kansas"]}, {"Title": "As Louisiana's governor faces ethics charges, his lawyer raises bar for future ethics investigations", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/louisianas-governor-faces-ethics-charges-lawyer-raises-bar-122560057", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 23:58:17 -0400", "Summary": "Louisiana is poised to adopt new measures that watchdogs warn raise barriers to holding public officials accountable via the state&rsquo;s ethics board", "Content": "As Louisiana's governor faces ethics charges, his lawyer raises bar for future ethics investigations\nLouisiana is poised to adopt new measures that watchdogs warn raise barriers to holding public officials accountable via the state\u2019s ethics board\nNEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana is poised to adopt new measures that watchdogs warn raise barriers to holding public officials accountable via the state's ethics board. The legislation was drafted by the personal attorney of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who faces charges brought by the board for violating state ethics laws.\nProponents say the measures give those accused of ethics violations more opportunities to respond to allegations, increases transparency and limits abuses of a process they claim is often unjust. But watchdog groups \u2014 and the Board of Ethics \u2014 warn the changes will undermine the board's ability to hold public officials accountable.\nWhile the changes would not apply to Landry\u2019s current charges, the legislation further bolsters the governor\u2019s power over a state board largely made up of his own appointees. Having overwhelmingly passed in the House and Senate this week \u2014 only three lawmakers voted against it \u2014 the bill awaits Landry's signature.\nRepublican Rep. Gerald \u201cBeau\u201d Beaullieu, who sponsored the bill, said it was brought forth after officials complained that the board's investigation process was \u201cmore like being investigated by the Gestapo.\u201d\nLandry\u2019s office declined to comment.\nAnother bill would share the names of complainants with officials they are accusing of wrongdoing, as well as limit the board's ability to launch investigations.\nLandry\u2019s private attorney, Stephen Gel\u00e9, drafted the legislation, which the governor supports.\nGel\u00e9 is defending Landry against ethics charges brought in 2023 for undisclosed free plane rides to Hawaii when he served as the state's attorney general. Gel\u00e9 said negotiations are progressing to \u201camicably resolve the charges.\u201d\nLast year, Gel\u00e9 warned lawmakers that the ethics board\u2019s investigatory powers are \u201cdangerous, unwarranted, and threaten well-established fundamental constitutional rights\" and he has sought to rein them in with new legislation.\nThe bill's supporters say it gives the board more discretion about whether to pursue investigations and bring charges, cuts down on waste of taxpayer dollars and strengthens due process rights for the accused.\nYet these changes are raising red flags.\nIn a letter to lawmakers, the Board of Ethics warned that the bill\u2019s requirement to share copies of all subpoenas with officials under investigation allows them to \u201cinfluence a witness\u2019s documents or responses.\u201d\nCritics say the bill undercuts the board's authority by granting local courts the power to quash investigations, gives officials opportunities to run out the clock on the board's one-year timeline to bring charges and prevents the board from investigating violations that were disclosed by public officials seeking the board\u2019s advisory opinion.\nThe bill also requires a two-thirds board vote to approve an investigation into a sworn complaint and another two-thirds vote on whether to file charges. Current policy requires only majority votes.\nBarry Erwin, president of the Council for a Better Louisiana, a nonpartisan government accountability group, said the bill's two-thirds vote requirements constitute a \u201chigh bar to overcome\u201d for a board of political appointees.\n\u201cI just think in real life, in very political situations, it\u2019s hard for some of these board members to act with the independence in the system we had before,\u201d Erwin said.\nThe other bill under consideration \u2014 which Gel\u00e9 said he did not craft and Landry has not publicly supported \u2014 would require anyone bringing an ethics complaint to disclose their name and file the complaint in person at the ethics board offices in Baton Rouge. The bill passed in the House with only seven lawmakers opposed and is pending final passage in the Senate.\nIn a legislative committee hearing, David Bordelon, general counsel for the ethics board, warned that the bill would enable officials \u201cto intimidate a witness or potentially alter information that's requested.\u201d Bordelon said the measure would \u201cdrastically reduce the number of complaints.\"\nThe legislation's sponsor, Republican Rep. Kellee Hennessey Dickerson, said her bill is part of a fight for \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cjustice.\u201d\n\u201cFor those of us who have been through it, it helps develop peace of mind, knowing who your accuser is, especially when you are spending thousands upon thousands of dollars to try and clear your good name,\u201d said Dickerson, who was fined $1,500 for an ethics violation in 2023.\nShe argued people frequently file complaints to harass their political opponents. Bordelon countered that the board dispassionately evaluates complaints and provides the accused with the opportunity to defend themselves if charges are brought.\nThe bill also prevents the ethics board from launching investigations based on non-governmental sources such as media reports.\nFollowing legislation passed last year, the governor directly appoints nine of the board's 15 members, with the Legislature appointing the rest.\nOfficials with the legislative and executive branches now have more control over those who may be tasked with investigating them, watchdogs note.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone from a process that was as much arm's length away from politics as we could make it, and we had it that way for many years, to a process now that is very much more political than we've ever seen it,\" Erwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for the board to act in a way that guarantees that kind of oversight we want to have.\u201d\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that the bill has already passed the House and Senate, not that it is awaiting approval in the House.\n___\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Trump is also casting doubts on the legitimacy of the Biden White House's use of the autopen to sign pardons and other documents.\nIt marks a significant escalation in Trump\u2019s targeting of political adversaries, and could lay the groundwork for arguments by leading Republicans in Congress and around the country that a range of Biden\u2019s actions as president were invalid.\n\u201cEssentially, whoever used the autopen was the president,\u201d Trump said Thursday.\nHe then went further, suggesting that rogue elements within the Biden administration might have effectively faked the president's signature and governed without his knowledge \u2014 especially when it came to pushing policies that appeased the Democratic Party's far-left wing.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have much of an idea what was going on,\u201d Trump said, though he also acknowledged that he had no evidence to back up those assertions.

He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s designed to continue to fuel a narrative that the administration wants to elevate, but courts are not going to second-guess these sorts of executive actions\u201d undertaken by Biden.\nTrump has long questioned the legitimacy of pardons his predecessor issued for his family members and other administration officials just before leaving office on Jan. 20, people whom Biden was worried could be targeted by a Trump-led Justice Department.\nBut Trump has more recently suggested Biden was unaware of immigration policies during his own administration, and said Thursday that aides to his predecessor pushed social issues like transgender rights in ways Biden might not have agreed with.\nIt is well-established that a president\u2019s executive orders can easily be repealed by a successor issuing new executive actions \u2014 something Trump has done repeatedly since retaking the White House. That lets Trump wipe out Biden administration policies without having to prove any were undertaken without Biden's knowledge \u2014 though his predecessor's pardons and judicial appointments can't be so easily erased.\n\u201cWhen it comes to completed legal acts like pardons or appointing judges,\u201d Pildes said, a later president \u201chas no power to overturn those actions.\u201d\nAutopens are writing tools that allow a person\u2019s signature to be affixed automatically to documents. The Justice Department, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has recognized the use of an autopen by presidents to sign legislation and issue pardons for decades \u2014 and even Trump himself acknowledges using it.\n\u201cAutopens to me are used when thousands of letters come in from young people all over the country and you want to get them back,\u201d Trump said Thursday.\nMichigan State University law professor Brian Kalt said the \u201cconsensus view is that, as long as the president has directed the use of the autopen in that particular instance, it is valid.\u201d\n\u201cThe only issue would be if someone else directed the use of the autopen without the President\u2019s approval,\u201d Kalt, an expert on pardons, wrote in an email.\nYes. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution bestows the president with the power \u201cto grant Reprieves and Pardons.\u201d\n\u201cA president\u2019s pardons cannot be revoked. If they could, no pardon would ever be final,\u201d American University politics professor Jeffrey Crouch, author of a book on presidential pardons, said in an email. \u201cThere is no legal obstacle I am aware of to a president using an autopen on a pardon.\u201d\nKent Greenfield, a Boston College law professor, said, \u201cOnce you pardon somebody, you can\u2019t go back and un-pardon them.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s done with a president\u2019s authority, I don\u2019t think it matters whether it\u2019s done with an autopen or not,\u201d Greenfield added. \u201cThe president\u2019s authority is the president\u2019s authority.\u201d\nTrump's suggestions that Biden's administration effectively functioned without his knowledge on key policy matters go beyond questions about pardons and the president using the autopen. Even there, though, the Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. At the time, Trump celebrated the ruling as a \u201cBIG WIN\u201d because it extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against him on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 election loss.\nSuch immunity would likely cover Biden as a former president. It might not extend to Biden administration officials allegedly acting without his knowledge \u2014 though Trump himself acknowledged he's not seen evidence of that occurring.\nBiden has dismissed Trump's investigation as \u201cnothing more than a mere distraction.\u201d\n\u201cLet me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn\u2019t is ridiculous and false,\u201d he said in a statement.\nIn a word, no.\nThere have been allegations of presidents being impaired and having their administrations controlled by intermediaries more than the public knew \u2014 including Edith Wilson, who effectively managed access to her husband, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, after his serious stroke in 1919. Wilson's critics grumbled about a shadow presidency controlled by his wife, but the matter was never formally investigated by Congress, nor was it a major source of criticism for Wilson's Republican successor, Warren G. Harding.\nMore recently, some questioned whether President John F. Kennedy struggled more than was publicly known at the time with Addison\u2019s Disease and debilitating back pains while in office. And there were questions about whether dementia might have affected Ronald Reagan during his second term, before he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 1994, five years after he left office.\nTrump himself was indicted four times, and convicted once, while Biden was in office \u2014 but those investigations were not ordered by Biden.\n__\nAssociated Press writer Mark Sherman contributed to this report.", "Source": "ABC News", "Keyword": ["executive order", "executive order", "american university", "new york university"], "Entities": ["Trump", "Biden", "Donald Trump", "Joe Biden", "WASHINGTON", "Donald Trump", "Joe Biden", "Trump", "Biden", "Biden", "Trump", "Trump", "White House", "Biden", "Trump", "White House's", "Trump", "Congress", "Biden", "Trump", "Biden", "the Democratic Party's", "Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Richard Pildes", "New York University School of Law", "Biden", "Trump", "Biden", "Trump", "Trump", "Biden", "Biden", "Trump", "the White House", "Trump", "Biden", "Biden", "Autopens", "The Justice Department", "Trump", "Autopens", "Trump", "Michigan State University", "Brian Kalt", "Article II", "Section 2", "Constitution", "Reprieves", "American University", "Jeffrey Crouch", "Kent Greenfield", "Boston College", "Greenfield", "Trump", "Biden", "the Supreme Court", "Trump", "Washington", "Biden", "Biden", "Trump", "Biden", "Trump", "Edith Wilson", "Woodrow Wilson", "Wilson", "Congress", "Wilson", "Warren G.

They said the order seeks to \u201cunilaterally coronate the President as the country\u2019s chief election policymaker and administrator.\u201d\nIf the court does not halt the order, they argued, \u201cthe snowball of executive overreach will grow swiftly and exponentially.\"\nTrump's election directive was part of a flurry of executive orders he has issued in the opening months of his second term, many of which have drawn swift legal challenges. It follows years of him falsely claiming that his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election was due to widespread fraud and an election year in which he and other Republicans promoted the notion that large numbers of noncitizens threatened the integrity of U.S. elections. In fact, voting by noncitizens is rare and, when caught, can lead to felony charges and deportation.\nTrump's executive order would require voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections, prohibit mail or absentee ballots from being counted if they are received after Election Day, set new rules for voting equipment and prohibit non-U.S. citizens from being able to donate in certain elections. It also would condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the strict ballot deadline.\nThe hearing Friday in U.S. District Court in Boston comes in one of three lawsuits filed against the executive order. One is from Oregon and Washington, where elections are conducted almost entirely by mail and ballots received after Election Day are counted as long as they are postmarked by then.\nThe provision that would create a proof-of-citizenship requirement for federal elections already has been halted in a lawsuit filed by voting and civil rights groups and national Democratic organizations.\nIn that case, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the judge said the president's attempt to use a federal agency to enact a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voting usurped the power of states and Congress, which at the time was considering legislation that would do just that. That bill, called the SAVE Act, passed the U.S. House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate.\nTrump's executive order said its intent was to ensure \u201cfree, fair and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion.\u201d The Justice Department, in arguing against the motion by the attorneys general for a preliminary injunction, said the president is within his rights to direct agencies to carry out federal voting laws.\nThe order tasks the U.S. Election Assistance Commission with updating the federal voter registration form to require people to submit documentation proving they are U.S. citizens. Similar provisions enacted previously in a handful of states have raised concerns about disenfranchising otherwise eligible voters who can't readily access those documents. That includes married women, who would need both a birth certificate and a marriage license if they had changed their last name.\nA state proof-of-citizenship law enacted in Kansas more than a decade ago blocked the registrations of 31,000 people later found to be eligible to vote.\nThe two sides will argue over whether the president has the authority to direct the election commission, which was created by Congress as an independent agency after the Florida ballot debacle during the 2000 presidential election.\nIn its filing, the Justice Department said Trump's executive order falls within his authority to direct officials \u201cto carry out their statutory duties,\u201d adding that \u201cthe only potential voters it disenfranchises are noncitizens who are ineligible to vote anyway.\u201d", "Source": "ABC News", "Keyword": ["civil rights", "executive order", "deportation", "executive order", "lawsuit"], "Entities": ["Trump", "Donald Trump", "U.S.", "BOSTON", "Donald Trump", "U.S.", "Trump", "Constitution", "Congress", "Trump", "Joe Biden", "U.S.", "Trump", "U.S.", "U.S.", "District Court", "Boston", "Oregon", "Washington", "the District of Columbia", "Congress", "the SAVE Act", "the U.S. House", "Senate", "Trump", "The Justice Department", "the U.S. Election Assistance Commission", "U.S.", "Kansas", "Congress", "Florida", "the Justice Department", "Trump"]}, {"Title": "Trump's surgeon general pick criticizes others' conflicts but profits from wellness product sales", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trumps-surgeon-general-pick-criticizes-conflicts-profits-wellness-122563408", "Published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 00:14:31 -0400", "Summary": "President Donald Trump&rsquo;s pick to be U.S. surgeon general has said the nation&rsquo;s medical and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans&rsquo; health", "Content": "Trump's surgeon general pick criticizes others' conflicts but profits from wellness product sales\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be U.S. surgeon general has said the nation\u2019s medical and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.\nYet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.\nA review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.\nIn her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.\nMeans, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.\nStill, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.\n\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.\nThe nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.\nThough scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.\nThe aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.\nMeans' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.\nMeans earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.\n\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.\nMeans turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.\nMeans has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.\n\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.\nBut even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.\nDuring the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.\nInfluencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d\nWith more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.\nAffiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.\n\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.\nMany companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.\nMeans has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.\nShe also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d\nOn a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d\nIt's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.\nMeans has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d\nIn November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d\nOn the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d\nInfluencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.\nMeans has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.\nMeans also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.\nThough the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.\nRepresentatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.\n\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.\nWhile the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.\n\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d\nMeans isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.\nJerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.\nHe divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.\nVivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.\nMeans has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.\nHund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.\nOther administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.\n\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d\n___\nSwenson reported from New York.", "Source": "ABC News", "Keyword": ["stanford university"], "Entities": ["Trump", "Donald Trump", "U.S.", "PROVIDENCE", "R.I.", "Donald Trump", "U.S.", "Casey Means", "The Associated Press found Means", "AP", "Jeff Hauser", "the Revolving Door Project", "Trump", "Levels", "U.S.", "Robert F.

A federal jury in February found Kirk guilty of one felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law, a crime that carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Felony convictions also prevent law enforcement officials from continuing to serve or owning a gun.\nBut when U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli took office a few months later, federal prosecutors offered Kirk a plea deal \u2014 a dismissal of the felony if Kirk pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and a recommendation of one year of probation. A judge agreed to the lessened charge but sentenced Kirk to four months in prison on Monday.\nEssayli said in a video posted online that prosecutors also offered Kirk a misdemeanor plea agreement under the prior administration, which he turned down.\n\u201cAfter reviewing this case extensively and thoroughly and carefully reviewing the facts and the law, I made the decision to re-extend the misdemeanor plea agreement to Deputy Kirk,\u201d Essayli said.\nIn court filings signed off by Essayli, prosecutors wrote they believed that Kirk's actions fell on the lower end of the excessive force spectrum, the woman did not suffer \u201cserious bodily injury,\" and that the case was prosecuted improperly.\nSome former prosecutors and police conviction experts called the step highly unusual, especially without any indication of prosecutorial misconduct, ethical violations or new evidence in the case. It follows President Donald Trump's vow to \u201cprotect and defend\" law enforcement officers from prosecution and his efforts to assert greater control over the U.S. Justice Department.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual to offer a plea deal after a conviction,\u201d said Jeffrey Bellin, a former federal prosecutor from Washington, D.C., who is now a law professor at William and Mary Law School. In cases where it could happen, there's usually new evidence of innocence, \u201cnot just the same evidence from a different perspective,\u201d he said.\nKirk's attorney, Tom Yu, said they filed a motion for acquittal that was denied but planned to appeal the decision.\nCaree Harper, who represents the woman Kirk injured, said in court filings that the federal government changed its account of the incident to make Kirk's actions seem justified.\nIn the original indictment, prosecutors wrote Kirk \u201cviolently\u201d threw the woman to the ground. In the new plea agreement, the government alleged the woman \u201cswatted\u201d at Kirk and \u201cresisted,\u201d Harper wrote, which she said was not proven in the criminal trial nor testified to in civil litigation.\nShe said her client did not commit a crime, had no weapon, and did not try to flee or resist.

Trump's April executive order on policing promised the \u201cunleashing\u201d of law enforcement and support for their legal defense.\nThe Justice Department announced in May it was canceling proposed consent decrees reached with Minneapolis and Louisville to implement policing reforms in the wake of the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The department also announced it would retract its findings in six other sweeping investigations into police departments that the Biden administration had accused of civil rights violations.\nTrump-appointed federal judges have also played a hand in dismissing cases against police officers, including murder charges against a former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man hiding in a closet in 2019.\nExperts say the reliance on the federal government to perform this policing oversight comes from the close relationship between local prosecutors and police officers, who regularly work together to investigate crimes.\n\u201cWe are often looking at the federal government to serve as a check and balance for local law enforcement officials who are accused of really egregious activity toward the public,\u201d said Devin Hart, a spokesperson for the National Police Accountability Project.\nAll four members of the original prosecutors withdrew from the case after the new plea deal was presented, and at least one resigned from the office, according to court filings.

The lawsuit filed Thursday is the latest escalation in a brewing dispute that began when the GOP took majority control of the state's House of Representatives last year.\nSince winning control of the chamber in the 2024 election, statehouse Republicans have repeatedly scrutinized the state's election processes and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026. The conflict comes as some state Republicans echo past false claims of election fraud in Michigan, which was a prime target of President Donald Trump and his backers after his 2020 election loss.\nRepublicans on the chamber\u2019s Oversight Committee subpoenaed Benson in April, seeking access to training materials for local clerks and staff who administer elections, including access to the Bureau of Elections\u2019 online learning portal.\nBenson\u2019s office released some requested materials in response to the subpoena, but not all, citing cybersecurity and physical security concerns related to administering elections and the voting process. The office has said it needs to review the online portal for \u201csensitive information\" and make redactions.\n\u201cSince the beginning of this saga, Secretary Benson has asked lawmakers to let a court review their request for sensitive election information that, in the wrong hands, would compromise the security of our election machines, ballots and officials,\u201d Michigan Department of State spokesperson Cheri Hardmon said in a statement Thursday.\nHouse Republicans say the goal of reviewing the material is to ensure clerks are trained in accordance with Michigan law. The House voted along party lines in May to hold Benson in contempt for not completely complying with the subpoena.\nThe request for training materials originally came from GOP state Rep. Rachelle Smit, who has pushed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Smit is the chair of the House elections committee, which was renamed to the Elections Integrity Committee with the new Republican majority.\n\u201cSecretary Benson has proven she is unwilling to comply with our subpoena and Michigan law,\u201d Rep. Smit said in a statement Thursday. \u201cShe\u2019s skirted the rules and done whatever she could to avoid public scrutiny. It\u2019s become overwhelmingly clear that she will never release the training materials we\u2019re looking for without direction from a court.\"\nThe lawsuit asks the Michigan Court of Claims to intervene and compel Benson to comply with the subpoena.\n\u201cThe public interest is best served if the constitutional order of the State of Michigan is preserved and the Legislature can properly perform its duty to regulate the manner of elections in the state and, if deemed necessary, enact election laws for the benefit of Michigan residents,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nBenson gained national attention for defending the results of the 2020 election in the face of Trump\u2019s attempts to undercut the outcome nationwide and in Michigan. Multiple audits \u2014 including one conducted by the then-Republican-controlled Michigan Senate \u2014 concluded former President Joe Biden won the state in 2020 and that there was no widespread or systemic fraud.\nBenson has remained a subject of GOP scrutiny this year.\nA Republican state representative introduced three articles of impeachment against Benson on Tuesday, and several of the accusations continue to cast doubts on the results of the 2020 election.

Under Trump, it's becoming a liability\nThree decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body\nWASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.\nLike other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world\u2019s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation\u2019s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.\nTrump\u2019s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His proclamation applies only to Harvard, and a federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked it. But Trump's order poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.\nIt\u2019s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump\u2019s gatekeeping powers.\n\u201cColumbia\u2019s exposure to this \u2018stroke of pen\u2019 risk is uniquely high,\u201d the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.\nPeople from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia\u2019s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.\nOther highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.\nAs the middle class has grown in other countries, more families have been able to afford test prep and admissions guidance to compete for spots in the Ivy League, said Rajika Bhandari, who leads a firm of higher education consultants.\n\u201cThe Ivy League brand is very strong overseas, especially in countries like India and China, where families are extremely brand-aware of top institutions in the U.S. and other competing countries,\u201d Bhandari said in an email.\nOver the last two decades, she said, U.S. universities have increasingly recognized the benefits of international exchange, seeing it as a crucial revenue source that subsidizes U.S. students and keeps enrollments up in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.\nAmerica\u2019s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.\nIt was part of a \u201cgold rush\u201d in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.\n\u201cWhether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,\" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.\nThe race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren\u2019t eligible for financial aid and, at some schools, they pay much higher tuition than their American counterparts. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.\nSome wealthier universities \u2014 including Harvard \u2014 offer financial aid to foreign students. But students who get into those top-tier U.S. universities often have the means to pay higher tuition rates, Brustein said. That provides further incentive to enroll more foreign students, he said, saving more scholarship money for American students.\nStill, international enrollment didn't expand equally across all types of colleges. Public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don\u2019t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their enrollment of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by rising costs and student debt loads.\nProponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation\u2019s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study STEM fields.\nIn the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard\u2019s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia\u2019s schools.\nHarvard's undergraduate foreign population increased by about 100 students from 2013 to 2023, while graduate numbers increased by nearly 2,000. Part of that growth can be explained by increasing global competition at the graduate level, said William Kirby, a historian at Harvard who has written about the evolution of higher education.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t recruit the very best students internationally in your most important graduate programs, particularly in science and engineering, then you will not be competitive,\" Kirby said.\nThe Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.\n\u201cThat was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, \u2018If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,\u2019\u201d he said.\nLast week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.\n\u201cWe have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can\u2019t get in because we have foreign students there,\u201d Trump said at a news conference.\nThe university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard \u201cyet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights.\u201d\nIn a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of \u201ca painstaking, decades-long project\u201d to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school\u2019s mission and reputation, it said.\n\u201cIn our interconnected global economy,\" the school said, \u201ca university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Under state law, term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis can\u2019t run for reelection in 2026.\nEven as Florida serves as a place for the Trump administration to poach staff and test policies, Jolly says he\u2019s confident that issues such as affordability, funding public schools, and strengthening campaign finance and ethics laws will resonate with all voters in 2026. He predicts elections next year will herald nationwide change.\n\u201cI actually think Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us. I think we should get politicians out of the classrooms, out of the doctor\u2019s offices,\u201d Jolly said.\n\u201cI think enough people in Florida, even some Republicans, now understand that. That the culture wars have gone too far,\u201d he said.\nJolly was first elected to his Tampa Bay-area congressional seat during a 2014 special election, and was reelected for one full term. The attorney and former lobbyist underwent a political evolution that spurred him to leave the Republican Party in 2018 to become an independent and then a registered Democrat. And he has built a national profile for himself as an anti-Trump political commentator on MSNBC.\nJolly said he has considered himself \u201cpart of the Democratic coalition\u201d for five or so years, and believes in what he sees as the party\u2019s \u201cfundamental values\u201d \u2014 that government can help people, that the economy should be \u201cfair\u201d to all, and that immigrants should be celebrated.\n\u201cI struggled to exercise those values in the Republican Party,\u201d Jolly said, continuing: \u201cThe actual registration as a Democrat wasn\u2019t a pivot. It was a kind of a formality.\u201d\nJolly has broken from his old party on immigration, as Florida lawmakers race to help Trump fulfill his promise of mass deportations. Jolly skewered Republicans who he said have \u201dconflated immigration and crime,\u201d which he described as wrong and immoral.\n\u201cIf you were born here or if you immigrated here, or if you\u2019re a Tallahassee politician who steals Medicaid money, we\u2019re going to be tough on crime,\u201d Jolly added, referring to a probe into the use of Medicaid settlement funds by a charity associated with first lady Casey DeSantis.\nJolly\u2019s gubernatorial run as a Democrat draws comparisons to the failed bid of former Republican congressman-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, who lost to DeSantis in 2022 by 19 points. It was Crist, running as a Democrat, who ousted Jolly from his congressional seat in 2016.\nJolly joined the Florida Democratic Party at what is arguably one of its most vulnerable points in years. Florida currently has no Democrats elected to statewide office, and there are now 1.2 million more registered Republicans than Democrats, according to the state\u2019s active voter rolls. The GOP has made significant inroads in formerly Democratic strongholds in the state, such as Miami-Dade County.\nThe day that Jolly announced his new affiliation, the-then top Democrat in the Florida Senate, Jason Pizzo, revealed he was leaving the party, declaring that \u201cthe Democratic Party in Florida is dead.\u201d Pizzo, a former prosecutor, has said he\u2019ll launch his own run for governor as a candidate with no party affiliation.\nOn the Republican side, Jolly will face Trump-backed Rep.

A federal court in Boston blocked the Department of Homeland Security from barring international students at Harvard last week. Trump\u2019s order invokes a different legal authority.\nTrump invoked a broad federal law that gives the president authority to block foreigners whose entry would be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d On Wednesday, he cited the same authority when announcing that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the U.S. and those from seven others would face restrictions. Trump\u2019s Harvard order cites several other laws, too, including one barring foreigners associated with terrorist organizations.\nIn a statement Wednesday night, Harvard said it will \u201ccontinue to protect its international students.\u201d\n\u201cThis is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights,\u201d university officials said.\nIt stems from Harvard\u2019s refusal to submit to a series of demands made by the federal government. It has escalated recently after the Department of Homeland Security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students.\nHarvard says it has complied with the request, but the government said the school's response was insufficient.\nThe dispute has been building for months after the Trump administration demanded a series of policy and governance changes at Harvard, calling it a hotbed of liberalism and accusing it of tolerating anti-Jewish harassment. Harvard defied the demands, saying they encroached on the university\u2019s autonomy and represented a threat to the freedom of all U.S. universities.\nTrump officials have repeatedly raised the stakes and sought new fronts to pressure Harvard, cutting more than $2.6 billion in research grants and moving to end all federal contracts with the university. The latest threat has targeted Harvard\u2019s roughly 7,000 international students, who account for half the enrollment at some Harvard graduate schools.\n\u201cAdmission to the United States to study at an \u2018elite\u2019 American university is a privilege, not a right,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X. \u201cThis Department of Justice will vigorously defend the President\u2019s proclamation suspending the entry of new foreign students at Harvard University based on national security concerns.\u201d\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the measure ridiculous and said it has nothing to do with national security.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thinly veiled revenge ploy in Trump\u2019s personal feud with Harvard, and continued authoritarian overreach against free speech,\u201d Jayapal said on the social media site X.\nThe order applies to all students attempting to enter the United States to attend Harvard after the date of the executive order. It provides a loophole to allow students whose entry would \u201cbenefit the national interest,\u201d as determined by federal officials.\nTrump\u2019s order alleges that Harvard provided data on misconduct by only three students in response to the Homeland Security request, and it lacked the detail to gauge if federal action was needed. Trump concluded that Harvard is either \u201cnot fully reporting its disciplinary records for foreign students or is not seriously policing its foreign students.\u201d\n\u201cThese actions and failures directly undermine the Federal Government\u2019s ability to ensure that foreign nationals admitted on student or exchange visitor visas remain in compliance with Federal law,\u201d the order said.\nFor foreign students already at Harvard, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will determine if visas should be revoked, Trump wrote.\nThe order is scheduled to last six months. Within 90 days, the administration will determine if it should be renewed, the order said.\nA State Department cable sent last week to U.S. embassies and consulates said federal officials will begin reviewing the social media accounts of visa applicants who plan to attend, work at or visit Harvard University for any signs of antisemitism.\nIn a court filing last week, Harvard officials said the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of \u201cprofound fear, concern, and confusion.\u201d Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said in the filing. ___\nAssociated Press writer Cheyanne Mumphrey in Phoenix contributed to this report.\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

It just happened in one swing state\nIn a bipartisan move, Nevada's Democratic-controlled Legislature has passed a last-minute bill supported by the Republican governor that will require photo ID to vote in person\nLAS VEGAS -- Facing a legislature dominated by Democrats, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo stood before Nevada lawmakers earlier this year with a message that some did not expect to go far: \u201cSet aside partisan politics.\u201d\nIt was a plea that might have seemed more aspirational than realistic, given the country's deep polarization. Yet it set the stage for one of the session's most unexpected outcomes \u2014 a bipartisan agreement to bring voter ID requirements to the perennial battleground state by next year's midterm elections.\nIn a deal that came together in the waning days of the session, the Democratic-controlled Legislature approved a bill that combined a requirement for voter ID \u2014 a conservative priority across the country and something that has been on Lombardo's legislative wish list \u2014 with a Democratic-backed measure to add more drop boxes for mailed ballots in the state's most populous counties.\nLombardo is expected to sign the bill.\nThe compromise represents a form of bipartisan dealmaking that has been especially scarce in recent years as the country's political divisions have deepened, especially around any potential reform to voting and election laws.\nPresident Donald Trump's lies about his loss in the 2020 presidential election fueled a wave of restrictive voting laws in Republican-led states that Democrats countered with changes to make voting more accessible, while an executive order Trump signed earlier this year seeking to overhaul how elections are run was met with a wave of Democratic lawsuits. Election legislation has mostly hit a dead end in states where the parties share power, making Nevada's bill all the more remarkable.\nA requirement for voters to show photo identification at the polls has long been a nonstarter for Nevada Democrats, who have argued that it threatened to disenfranchise low-income voters and make it more difficult for people to vote, especially older voters, those with disabilities and those without driver\u2019s licenses.\nAssembly Speaker Steve Yeager, the Democrat who brokered the deal with Lombardo after the governor vetoed his original bill to expand drop box access, acknowledged it was a tough concession. But he said it was the best they could do with the time they had left.\n\u201cIf you told me at the beginning of the session that we would be passing a voter ID bill, I probably would have told you you\u2019re crazy,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cBut I think that highlights the importance of being open and receptive.\u201d\nIt's a stark contrast to the 2023 legislative session, the last time lawmakers met. Lombardo outlined voter ID as one of his main priorities, but Democrats in the statehouse refused to give the proposal a hearing.\nThe governor vowed he would take the issue directly to voters.\nLast November, Nevada voters overwhelmingly approved the voter ID ballot initiative that Lombardo supported. Voters will have to pass it again in 2026 to amend the state constitution, and the requirement would then be in place for the 2028 presidential election.\nYeager said he was nervous about presenting the bill because he wasn't sure how Democrats would receive it, but told his colleagues over the weekend that voters seemed poised to give their final approval to the measure. He argued that passing a voter ID law now would give the state a two-year head start on implementing the requirements, to get ready before the next presidential contest.\nSecretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat, said he respects the will of the voters and will work with the governor and local election officials \u201cto continue strengthening our elections.\u201d That includes, under the proposal, a new \u2014 and free \u2014 digital form of voter ID that his office will be in charge of rolling out.\nPolls have shown that most Americans support voter ID laws, and that has been consistent over the years and across party lines. A 2024 Gallup poll found 84% of Americans supported requiring all voters to provide photo ID at their voting place to cast a ballot, consistent with Gallup findings from 2022 and 2016. That includes about two-thirds of Democrats, according to the 2024 survey.\n\u201cThis may not be my favorite policy to have to implement, but I think as a Legislature we have a responsibility to do this,\u201d Yeager told his colleagues.\nState Sen. Carrie Ann Buck, a Republican, praised the effort, saying, \u201cI think this is very thoughtful and very courageous of you to bring this in a bipartisan way ... I think our common goals are that every legitimate voter gets to vote.\u201d\nBut not all Democrats were on board, with five voting against it when it passed the Senate.\n\u201cI recognize what you're attempting to do, to stave off something worse,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Dina Neal. But she said she was \u201cwrestling with the philosophical issue with voter ID.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not in the space where I am openly willing to disenfranchise a population who may not even understand this law as written.\u201d\nIf Lombardo signs the bill, Nevada will join 36 other states that either require or request voters show ID when voting in person, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Not all states require photo ID, though. Some accept documents such as a bank statement, and some allow voters without ID to vote after signing an affidavit. A few states allow poll workers to vouch for voters without an ID.\nUnder Nevada\u2019s bill, voters will be required to show a form of photo ID when voting in person, which will include government-issued IDs and Nevada-issued university student IDs.\n\u201cNevada has some of the most secure and accessible elections in the country,\u201d Yeager said when he introduced the legislation, \u201cand this bill is a set of compromises between the Legislature and the governor that I believe can ensure that tradition continues.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Christina A.

The line ends in Baramulla, a town near the highly militarized Line of Control dividing the Himalayan region between India and Pakistan.\nThe line travels through 36 tunnels and over 943 bridges. The Indian government pegged the total project cost at around $5 billion.\nOne of the project\u2019s highlights is a 1,315-meter-long (4,314-foot) steel and concrete bridge above the Chenab River connecting two mountains with an arch 359 meters (1,177 feet) above the water. Indian Railways compared the height to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which stands 330 meters (1,082 feet), and said the bridge is built to last 120 years and endure extreme weather, including wind speeds up to 260 kph (161 mph).\nModi visited the Chenab bridge with tight security, waving an Indian tri-color flag before boarding a test train that passed through picturesque mountains and tunnels to reach an inauguration ceremony for another high-elevation bridge named Anji.\nThe prime minister also helped launch a pair of new trains called \u201cVande Bharat\u201d that will halve the travel time between Srinagar and the town of Katra in Jammu to about three hours from the usual six to seven hours by road.\nModi travelled to Indian-controlled Kashmir on Friday for the first time since a military conflict between India and Pakistan brought the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of their third war over the region last month, when the countries fired missiles and drones at each other.\nThe conflict began with a gun massacre in late April that left 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, dead in Indian-controlled Kashmir.

-- The advocate general for the European Union\u2019s highest court on Thursday urged the court to rule that Hungary violated the bloc\u2019s laws and fundamental values when it passed legislation barring the availability of LGBTQ+ content to minors under 18.\nThe non-binding opinion from the European Court of Justice\u2019s Advocate General, Tamara Capeta, states that the legislative changes adopted by Hungary's right-wing populist government violate several rights protected by the EU, \u201cnamely the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex and sexual orientation, the respect for private and family life, the freedom of expression and information, as well as the right to human dignity.\u201d\nHungary's law, adopted in 2021 by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's ruling Fidesz party, prohibited the display of content to minors that depicts homosexuality or gender change, while also providing harsher penalties for crimes of pedophilia.\nThe government has argued its policies, including a more recent law and constitutional amendment that effectively ban the popular Budapest Pride event, seek to protect children from what it calls \u201csexual propaganda.\u201d\nBut critics of the legislation have compared it to Russia\u2019s gay propaganda law of 2013, and say it conflates homosexuality with pedophilia as part of a campaign ploy to mobilize Fidesz's conservative voter base.\nIn her opinion, Capeta rejected Hungary's justification that the measures are aimed at protecting children, since the legislation \u201cprohibits portrayal of ordinary lives of LGBTI people, and is not limited to shielding minors from pornographic content, which was prohibited by the law in Hungary already.\u201d\nShe also wrote that Hungary has not offered any proof that content which portrays the ordinary lives of LGBTQ+ people has a negative effect on the healthy development of minors.\n\u201cConsequently, those amendments are based on a value judgment that homosexual and non-cisgender life is not of equal value or status\u201d to heterosexual life, Capeta wrote.\nShe urged the EU court to rule in favor of the bloc's executive commission

Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.\n\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.\nIn a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.\nThat rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.\nBut experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.\nAt stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.\nAnd what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.\nThe registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.\n\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.\nSymons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.\nIt\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.\nBut the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.\nGina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.\n\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d\nThe potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.\n\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.\nThe EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.\nCleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d\nResearch strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.\nIndiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren\u2019t satisfied. They\u2019re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.\nFighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.\n\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed from Washington.\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order.\nA few hours later, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against Trump\u2019s Wednesday proclamation.

After long months when Donald Trump and Elon Musk appeared united in their chaotic mission to remake Washington, their relationship imploded this week like a star going supernova.\nIt began with Musk complaining about the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, which the president at first took in stride. Eventually Trump let slip that he was disappointed in his former adviser, prompting Musk to unleash a flood of insults and taunts.\nHe accused Trump of betraying promises to cut federal spending, shared a suggestion that the president should be impeached and claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about his association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Perhaps most viciously, Musk insisted that Trump wouldn\u2019t have won last year\u2019s election without his help.\nTrump, not one to slouch from a fight, could hold back no longer. He posted that Musk had been \u201cwearing thin,\u201d that he had \u201casked him to leave\u201d his administration, that the tech titan had \u201cgone CRAZY.\u201d\nMaybe, Trump threatened, he should save taxpayer money by canceling government contracts and subsidies for Musk\u2019s companies.\nOn and on it went, as liberals savored the spectacle of their most despised political opponents clawing at each other's digital throats and conservatives reeled at the prospect of having to pick sides. Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur and conspiracy theorist, saw an opportunity to position herself as the voice of reason.\n\u201cThis fight should be taken offline,\u201d she said \u2014 on social media, of course.\nThe question now is whether Trump and Musk find some way to step back from a battle that is tearing apart one of the most consequential relationships in modern American politics. If they don\u2019t, there\u2019s little telling how far the fallout could spread from a collision between the world\u2019s most powerful man and its wealthiest.\nAt stake are the future of Musk's companies, including electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX; government programs that rely on the billionaire entrepreneur's technology; legislation for advancing tax cuts and Trump's other priorities in Congress; Republican chances in next year's midterm elections; and an entire political ecosystem that has orbited around Trump and Musk's deteriorating partnership.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like India and Pakistan,\u201d said Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, referring to two nuclear-armed nations that recently skirmished along their border. \u201cIt just escalates and neither one of them seem to back down and understand the strength of each other.\u201d\nTrump and Musk were always an odd pairing, with contrasting world views and deep generational and stylistic differences.\nTrump, 78, comes from old-school New York real estate and never appears in public without a suit and tie unless he's on the golf course. Before running for president, he became a household name as a reality television star.\nMusk, 53, is an immigrant from South Africa who struck it rich in Silicon Valley. In addition to running Tesla and SpaceX, Musk owns the social media company X. He's fashioned himself as a black-clad internet edgelord, and his wealth vastly outstrips Trump's.\nBut Trump and Musk are kindred spirits in other ways. They're experts at generating attention who enjoy stirring the pot by riling up their opponents. Each has sought more power to accomplish existential quests. Trump assails the federal \u201cdeep state\u201d that resisted him during his first term, while Musk warns about the country going bankrupt from excessive spending and promotes an interplanetary future powered by his rocket technology.\nMusk endorsed Trump after the Republican candidate was nearly assassinated in Butler, Pennsylvania, and he began spending millions to support him. His social media megaphone was a powerful addition to Trump's comeback campaign, magnifying his efforts to court tech leaders and young, very online men.\nTrump rarely tolerates sharing the spotlight, but he seemed enamored with his powerful backer, mentioning him in stump speeches and welcoming him onstage at rallies.\nAfter the election, Musk was a fixture around Mar-a-Lago, posing for photos with Trump's family, joining them for dinner, sitting in on meetings. Instead of growing tired of his \u201cfirst buddy,\u201d Trump made plans to bring Musk along to Washington, appointing him to lead a cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\nMusk tried to establish himself as the president's omniscient and omnipresent adviser. He held court in Cabinet meetings, slept over in the Lincoln Bedroom and helped himself to caramel ice cream from the White House kitchen.\nThe federal bureaucracy practically trembled before Musk, who oversaw layoffs and downsizing with his team of acolytes and engineers embedded in various agencies.\nMusk appeared thrilled at his opportunity to tinker with the government and exulted in his bromance with Trump, posting on Feb. 7 that he loved the president \u201cas much as a straight man can love another man.\u201d\nTrump returned the favor on March 11, allowing Musk to line up Tesla vehicles on the White House driveway as his company was struggling with declining sales. Trump made a show of choosing a cherry red electric car for himself.\nBut cracks were emerging, especially as Trump pursued tariffs that could raise costs for Musk's businesses. Musk said Peter Navarro, the president's trade adviser, was \u201ctruly a moron\" and \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks\" on April 8.\nThe billionaire entrepreneur, who had never before worked in public service, seemed to be souring on government. He suggested there wasn't enough political will, either in Congress or in the White House, to adequately reduce spending.\nTrump started signaling that it was time for him to leave even though Musk said he would be willing to stay.\nShortly before announcing his departure, Musk said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by legislation that Trump called the \u201cbig beautiful bill\" because it would increase the deficit. The measure includes tax cuts, more money for border security and changes to Medicaid that would leave fewer people with health insurance.\n\u201cI think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it could be both.\u201d\nThe criticism didn't prevent Trump from giving Musk a send-off in the Oval Office, where he presented his outgoing adviser with a ceremonial key.\n\u201cElon is really not leaving,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be back and forth.\u201d\nMusk said, \u201cI\u2019ll continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president.\"\nIt's hard to imagine that now.\nMusk escalated his attacks on the legislation Tuesday, calling it a \u201cdisgusting abomination,\" and Trump tried to fend off the criticism.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said bad about me personally, but I\u2019m sure that will be next,\u201d the president said Thursday in the Oval Office during a meeting with the German chancellor.\nIt was.\nMusk quickly took to X to vent his anger at Trump, saying his tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and accusing him of lying. He also said it was \u201cvery unfair\u201d that the legislation would eliminate tax incentives for electric vehicles.\nTrump fired back in real time as he tried to maintain momentum for his legislation, which faces a difficult debate in the Senate.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,\u201d the president posted. \u201cThis is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.\u201d\nMeanwhile, some of Trump's allies plotted revenge.\nSteve Bannon, a former Trump adviser who hosts an influential conservative podcast, said the president should direct the U.S. government to seize SpaceX. He also encouraged Trump to investigate allegations that Musk uses drugs and \u201cgo through everything about his immigration status\" in preparation for potential deportation.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how good Elon Musk takes a little of that pressure,\" Bannon said, \"because I happen to think a little of that pressure might be coming.\u201d\n____\nAssociated Press writers Tom Beaumont, Kevin Freking and Michelle L.

In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.\nMeans, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.\nStill, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.\n\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.\nThe nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.\nThough scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.\nThe aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.\nMeans' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.\nMeans earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.\n\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.\nMeans turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.\nMeans has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.\n\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.\nBut even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.\nDuring the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.\nInfluencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d\nWith more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.\nAffiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.\n\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.\nMany companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.\nMeans has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.\nShe also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d\nOn a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d\nIt's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.\nMeans has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d\nIn November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d\nOn the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d\nInfluencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.\nMeans has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.\nMeans also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.\nThough the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.\nRepresentatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.\n\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.\nWhile the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.\n\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d\nMeans isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.\nJerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.\nHe divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.\nVivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.\nMeans has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.\nHund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.\nOther administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.\n\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d\n___\nSwenson reported from New York.", "Source": "ABC News", "Keyword": ["stanford university"], "Entities": ["Trump", "Donald Trump", "U.S.", "PROVIDENCE", "R.I.", "Donald Trump", "U.S.", "Casey Means", "The Associated Press found Means", "AP", "Jeff Hauser", "the Revolving Door Project", "Trump", "Levels", "U.S.", "Robert F.

It launched the fundraising campaign quietly in 2022 in response to a wave of bills in state legislatures that targeted LGBTQ+ rights.\nSome of those laws sought to limit the discussion of sexuality and gender in schools, remove books featuring LGBTQ+ characters from school libraries, ban public drag shows, prohibit students from using their preferred pronouns and limit access to gender-affirming care for trans youth.\nThis year, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has focused on transgender people. It has ordered trans people to leave the military, sought to remove fair housing protections for them and denied the existence of trans, nonbinary and intersex people through an executive order recognizing only two sexes.\nTrump has tried to cut federal funding for any gender-affirming medical care for trans children.\nLambda Legal has brought multiple legal cases against the administration, including challenges to its ban on trans members in the military and on gender-affirming care for trans youth.\nLambda Legal is a large nonprofit, spending more than $20 million annually since 2021 and holding assets exceeding $54 million in 2023, according to its tax filing.\nBut the scale of this campaign significantly increases its resources.\nJennings said since its founding in 1973, Lambda Legal had received three gifts of over $1 million. In this campaign, 14 individuals, two foundations and one law firm gave at least $1 million, with several giving tens of millions, he said.\n\u201cIt was really individuals in the community who stepped up and made this campaign happen,\" he said. \"It wasn\u2019t corporations. It wasn\u2019t law firms. It wasn\u2019t foundations.\u201d\nAmong the donors is billionaire author MacKenzie Scott, who gave the nonprofit gifts in 2020 and 2021. The largest gift, $25 million, came from the Kathryn G. Graham Trust. Graham served as an early board member for Lambda Legal.\nSome $80 million of the raised funds will be spent in the next five years, with the remaining $205 million pledged by donors in their estates, often called planned gifts.\nLambda Legal will use the infusion of cash to hire more attorneys, set up a new mechanism to coordinate pro bono representation from major law firms and hold public trainings about the rights of LGBTQ+ people.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to win every battle,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to win every fight, but we\u2019re going to fight every fight and we will keep fighting and we will be able to keep fighting because of this campaign until we eventually win.\u201d\nEven with this new fundraising push, Lambda Legal's resources still fall short of the funding that has gone to conservative nonprofits that also use litigation to pursue public policy goals. For example, Alliance Defending Freedom has raised more than $100 million in each 2022 and 2023, according to its tax filings. The group has represented female athletes challenging sports participation by transgender women and girls and has challenged laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.\nThe acceptance and visibility of gay, trans, intersex and gender queer people has transformed dramatically within the living memory of many Americans.\nIn 1961, Illinois became the first state to decriminalize homosexuality. The American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1972. But fights for equal treatment across social arenas and to protect against discrimination continued for decades.\nTwo major Supreme Court decisions in the past 25 years reflect a rapid shift in public attitudes to support the rights of LGBTQ+ people. The first in 2003 struck down sodomy laws that criminalized sex between gay adults and the second, in 2015, eliminated bans on gay marriage.\nMarc Stein, a historian and professor at San Francisco State University, attributed those and other wins to the LGBTQ+ movements' mobilization, court-based strategies and direct protests.\nHe also said over decades, the fundraising base of the movement changed significantly. In the 1950s and 60s, the movement largely was supported by its members.\n\u201cOne main source was that they published magazines and newsletters and had subscribers and had members that paid membership fees,\u201d Stein said, though some wealthy patrons also offered support. By the 1980s, the movement began pushing wealthy donors to give to LGBTQ+ causes, he said.\n\u201cI think there was a real change in that period from funding that kept the movement close to the community,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAnd then developments that led some, especially national organizations, to move away from the model of grassroots fundraising to a model of corporate and business fundraising.\u201d\nNow, numerous Pride events around the country \u2014 including San Francisco and New York City \u2014 are reporting budget shortfalls because corporate sponsors have withdrawn their support. Some experts say the corporate retreat from brand activism, which peaked between 2016 to 2022, is due to a changing cultural landscape and a growing number of consumers who don\u2019t want companies to take positions on social issues.\nJennings of Lambda Legal noted the recent withdrawal of corporate money from supporting LGBTQ+ groups and credited his group's recent fundraising success to its individual donors, many of whom he said were motivated to prevent a rollback on the rights that had been won in their lifetimes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of cowardice on the part of corporate America right now.

The department cited an internal review that concluded the program was costly and had a low success rate.\nThe review also identified safety issues at the residential campuses. The Department of Labor said it would transition students and staff out of the locations by June 30.\nThe program was designed for teenagers and young adults who struggled to finish high school in traditional school settings and then go on to obtain training and find jobs. Participants received tuition-free housing, meals and health care.\nCritics have argued that closing the campuses would leave young people homeless and deprive them of opportunities and hope. They also maintained the Trump administration did not have legal authority to suspend Job Corps because it was created by Congress.\nLawmakers asked Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer about the decision when she appeared before the House Education and Workforce Committee on Thursday.\n\u201cJob Corps, which you know has bipartisan support in Congress, trains young, low-income people, and helps them find good-paying jobs and provides housing for a population that might otherwise be without a home,\u201d U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott said.\nScott, a Virginia Democrat, read from a letter Chavez-DeRemer wrote in support of Job Corps last year. The letter said the program increased participants' employment and wages, and decreased their reliance on public benefits.\n\u201cYou've made a starkly abrupt shift from a champion to a destroyer of this important program,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, adding that students in her district were distraught.\nIn response, Chavez-DeRemer said she recognized that only an act of Congress could eliminate Job Corps. She said the Labor Department had instead used its authority to halt the program's operations but planned to comply with a federal court order that temporarily blocked the action.\nU.S. District Judge Andrew Carter of New York issued a temporary restraining order on Wednesday that prohibited the Labor Department from terminating jobs, removing students from the 99 contractor-run centers or eliminating the Job Corps program without congressional authorization.\nThe order was sought as part of a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the National Job Corps Association, a trade group which includes business, labor, volunteer and community organizations. The group alleged the Labor Department's decision would have disastrous consequences, including displacing tens of thousands of vulnerable young people and forcing mass layoffs.\nDuring Thursday's House committee hearing, Scott asked several Job Corps students in attendance to stand.\n\u201cThese students were on their way to getting a good job and earning a living wage. On behalf of them, I urge you to immediately reverse the decision to effectively shut down all Job Corps centers,\u201d Scott said.\nChavez-DeRemer responded that the Trump administration wanted to eliminate ineffective training interventions. The report released in April by the Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration said Job Corps operated at a $140 million deficit during the last fiscal year and had an average graduation rate of under 39%.\n\u201cOur recently released Job Corps transparency report showed that in 2023 alone, more than 14,000 serious incidents were reported at the Job Corps centers, including cases of sexual assault, physical violence, and drug use,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said. \u201cThis program is failing to deliver safe and successful outcomes our young people deserve.\u201d\nThe National Job Corps Association maintained the statistics were misleading. It said the 14,000 serious incidents included power outages, inclement weather, athletic injuries that required treatment and adult students leaving campus without prior approva.\nThe group also said that Job Corps' graduation rates have historically been above 60%, but were depressed by COVID-19 policies during the year the Labor Department reviewed.\nSeth Harris, senior fellow at the Burnes Center for Social Change at Northeastern University, said in an interview that Job Corps is wildly popular on Capitol Hill. He recalled having to slow down Job Corps due to funding challenges when he served as acting secretary of labor during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\u201cI got angry calls from elected members of the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Harris said.\nThe Job Corps program was designed to help young people who were not succeeding in school or who had left school without a place to go, placing them in a residential setting outside their community and providing them with vocational training, he said.\nThe Labor Department shutting down Job Corps would be illegal because there\u2019s a process outlined for closing down the centers which includes publishing performance data, justifying the closure and allowing time for public comment and remediation, he said.\n\u201cThis is plainly illegal,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut it is entirely on brand for Donald Trump to beat up on poor kids, largely kids of color, who are trying to make their lives better.\u201d", "Source": "ABC News", "Keyword": ["lawsuit", "temporary restraining order", "mass layoffs"], "Entities": ["Trump", "Job Corps", "Congress", "Trump", "Job Corps", "Congress", "Trump", "Job Corps", "The Department of Labor", "Job Corps", "The Department of Labor", "Trump", "Job Corps", "Congress", "Labor", "Lori Chavez-DeRemer", "the House Education", "Workforce Committee", "Congress", "U.S.", "Bobby Scott", "Scott", "Virginia", "Chavez-DeRemer", "Job Corps", "Suzanne Bonamici", "Oregon", "Chavez-DeRemer", "Congress", "Job Corps", "the Labor Department", "U.S.", "Andrew Carter", "New York", "the Labor Department", "Job Corps", "the National Job Corps Association", "the Labor Department's", "House", "Scott", "Job Corps", "Job Corps", "Scott", "Chavez-DeRemer", "Trump", "the Labor Department's", "Employment and Training Administration", "Job Corps", "$140 million", "Job Corps", "Job Corps", "Chavez-DeRemer", "The National Job Corps Association", "Job Corps'", "the Labor Department", "Seth Harris", "the Burnes Center for Social Change", "Northeastern University", "Job Corps", "Capitol Hill", "Job Corps", "Barack Obama", "House", "Senate", "Harris", "Job Corps", "The Labor Department", "Job Corps", "Harris", "Donald Trump"]}, {"Title": "Top US universities raced to become global campuses.

Under Trump, it's becoming a liability\nThree decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body\nWASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.\nLike other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world\u2019s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation\u2019s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.\nTrump\u2019s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His order applies only to Harvard, but it poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.\nIt\u2019s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump\u2019s gatekeeping powers.\n\u201cColumbia\u2019s exposure to this \u2018stroke of pen\u2019 risk is uniquely high,\u201d the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.\nPeople from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia\u2019s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.\nOther highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.\nAmerica\u2019s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.\nIt was part of a \u201cgold rush\u201d in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.\n\u201cWhether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,\" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.\nThe race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren\u2019t eligible for financial aid, and at some schools they pay two or three times the tuition rate charged to U.S. students. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.\nBut the expansion wasn\u2019t equal across all types of colleges \u2014 public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don\u2019t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their numbers of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by the rising costs and student debt loads.\nProponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation\u2019s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.\nIn the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard\u2019s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia\u2019s schools.\nThe Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.\n\u201cThat was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, \u2018If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,\u2019\u201d he said.\nLast week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.\n\u201cWe have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can\u2019t get in because we have foreign students there,\u201d Trump said at a news conference.\nThe university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard \u201cyet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights.\u201d\nIn a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of \u201ca painstaking, decades-long project\u201d to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school\u2019s mission and reputation, it said.\n\u201cIn our interconnected global economy,\" the school said, \u201ca university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.\nMeans, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.\nStill, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.\n\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.\nThe nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.\nThough scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.\nThe aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.\nMeans' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.\nMeans earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.\n\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.\nMeans turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.\nMeans has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.\n\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.\nBut even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.\nDuring the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.\nInfluencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d\nWith more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.\nAffiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.\n\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.\nMany companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.\nMeans has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.\nShe also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d\nOn a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d\nIt's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.\nMeans has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d\nIn November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d\nOn the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d\nInfluencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.\nMeans has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.\nMeans also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.\nThough the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.\nRepresentatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.\n\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.\nWhile the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.\n\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d\nMeans isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.\nJerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.\nHe divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.\nVivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.\nMeans has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.\nHund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.\nOther administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.\n\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d\n___\nSwenson reported from New York.", "Source": "ABC News", "Keyword": ["stanford university"], "Entities": ["Trump", "Donald Trump", "U.S.", "PROVIDENCE", "R.I.", "Donald Trump", "U.S.", "Casey Means", "The Associated Press found Means", "AP", "Jeff Hauser", "the Revolving Door Project", "Trump", "Levels", "U.S.", "Robert F.

So much of its real business selling electric cars is struggling now and so it needs the promise of a new age of driverless cars to be realized\u2014 and fast.\n\u201cThe whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Tesla's biggest fans, but now worried. \"If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.\u201d\nHe added, \"There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.\u201d\nTrump's threat to cut government contracts seems targeted more to another of Musk's businesses, SpaceX, than his car company. The privately held rocket company has received billions of dollars for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, providing launches and doing other work for NASA. The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to moon next year.\nA subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk's once-close relationship with the president.\nOn a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use. Though its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.\nOne measure of SpaceX's success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares in recent months reportedly valued it at an $350 billion, up from an estimated $210 billion a year ago.\nNow all that is possibly in danger. Tesla shares got even a bigger lift from Musk's close relationship with Trump, initially at least.\nAfter the presidential election in November, investors rushed into the stock, adding more than $450 billion to its value in a few weeks. The belief was that the company would see big riches as Trump eased regulatory oversight of Tesla. They also were betting that the new administration would embrace Musk's plans for millions of cars on U.S. roads without drivers behind the wheel.\nAfter hitting an all-time high on Dec. 17, the shares retreated as Musk\u2019s time as head of a government cost-cutting group led to boycotts and a hit to Tesla's reputation. They've recently popped higher again after Musk vowed to focus more on Tesla and its upcoming driverless taxi launch.\nNow investors aren't so sure, a worry that has translated into big paper losses in Tesla stock held by Musk personally \u2014 down $20 billion for the day.", "Source": "ABC News", "Keyword": ["oversight"], "Entities": ["Nice Guy", "Trump", "Donald Trump", "hundreds of billions of dollars", "Donald Trump", "$150 billion", "Tesla", "Starbucks", "U.S.", "Tesla", "Musk", "Trump", "Trump", "Budget", "Billions of Dollars", "Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts", "Truth Social", "Biden", "Musk", "Tesla", "Austin", "Texas", "Trump", "U.S.", "Wedbush Securities", "Dan Ives", "Tesla", "Trump", "Nice Guy", "Trump", "Musk", "SpaceX", "billions of dollars", "the International Space Station", "NASA", "SpaceX", "Starlink", "Musk", "Trump", "Saudi Arabia", "Starlink", "Bangladesh", "Pakistan", "India", "Trump", "SpaceX", "$350 billion", "an estimated $210 billion", "Musk", "Trump", "more than $450 billion", "Trump", "Musk", "U.S.", "boycotts", "Tesla", "Musk", "Tesla", "$20 billion"]}, {"Title": "Top US universities raced to become global campuses, now it's becoming a liability", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/top-us-universities-raced-become-global-campuses-trump-122559977", "Published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 03:31:50 -0400", "Summary": "Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body", "Content": "Top US universities raced to become global campuses, now it's becoming a liability\nThree decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body\nWASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.\nLike other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world\u2019s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation\u2019s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.\nTrump\u2019s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His proclamation applies only to Harvard, and a federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked it. But Trump's order poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.\nIt\u2019s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump\u2019s gatekeeping powers.\n\u201cColumbia\u2019s exposure to this \u2018stroke of pen\u2019 risk is uniquely high,\u201d the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.\nPeople from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia\u2019s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.\nOther highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.\nAs the middle class has grown in other countries, more families have been able to afford test prep and admissions guidance to compete for spots in the Ivy League, said Rajika Bhandari, who leads a firm of higher education consultants.\n\u201cThe Ivy League brand is very strong overseas, especially in countries like India and China, where families are extremely brand-aware of top institutions in the U.S. and other competing countries,\u201d Bhandari said in an email.\nOver the last two decades, she said, U.S. universities have increasingly recognized the benefits of international exchange, seeing it as a crucial revenue source that subsidizes U.S. students and keeps enrollments up in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.\nAmerica\u2019s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.\nIt was part of a \u201cgold rush\u201d in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.\n\u201cWhether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,\" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.\nThe race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren\u2019t eligible for financial aid and, at some schools, they pay much higher tuition than their American counterparts. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.\nSome wealthier universities \u2014 including Harvard \u2014 offer financial aid to foreign students. But students who get into those top-tier U.S. universities often have the means to pay higher tuition rates, Brustein said. That provides further incentive to enroll more foreign students, he said, saving more scholarship money for American students.\nStill, international enrollment didn't expand equally across all types of colleges. Public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don\u2019t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their enrollment of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by rising costs and student debt loads.\nProponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation\u2019s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study STEM fields.\nIn the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard\u2019s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia\u2019s schools.\nHarvard's undergraduate foreign population increased by about 100 students from 2013 to 2023, while graduate numbers increased by nearly 2,000. Part of that growth can be explained by increasing global competition at the graduate level, said William Kirby, a historian at Harvard who has written about the evolution of higher education.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t recruit the very best students internationally in your most important graduate programs, particularly in science and engineering, then you will not be competitive,\" Kirby said.\nThe Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.\n\u201cThat was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, \u2018If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,\u2019\u201d he said.\nLast week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.\n\u201cWe have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can\u2019t get in because we have foreign students there,\u201d Trump said at a news conference.\nThe university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard \u201cyet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights.\u201d\nIn a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of \u201ca painstaking, decades-long project\u201d to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school\u2019s mission and reputation, it said.\n\u201cIn our interconnected global economy,\" the school said, \u201ca university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Liu, 34, is thought to be in China.\nAccording to the FBI, Liu had small baggies of the fungus stashed in his backpack when he flew to the U.S. last year and, after claiming ignorance about the plant material inside them, said he was planning to use it for research at a University of Michigan lab where Jian worked and where Liu previously worked.\nFusarium graminearum causes a disease called Fusarium head blight that can wipe out cereal crops such as wheat, barley and maize and rice \u2014 it inflicts $1 billion in losses annually on U.S. wheat and barley crops, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nIt isn\u2019t the only fungus to cause Fusarium head blight, but it\u2019s the most common culprit in the U.S. The fungus infects plants early in the growing season, shriveling wheat grains and blanching crop heads a whitish-tan color. It also causes a toxin to accumulate in wheat kernels that can make them unsafe for people and livestock to eat.\nNicknamed \u201cvomitoxin\u201d because it\u2019s most known for causing livestock to throw up, it can also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and fever in animals and people.\nWheat and other grain crops are screened for various toxins, including Fusarium graminearum, before they can be used to feed animals and humans.

It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.\nOn Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions.\nThe law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn't receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.\nEmergency room staff observed that Thurman's hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube \u2014 all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.\nThurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.\nCMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman\u2019s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was \u201cat risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,\u201d the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.\nAscension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman\u2019s case, saying only that it is \u201cis committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.\u201d\nDoctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman's life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.\n\u201cWe see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,\u201d said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. \u201cThis is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.\u201d\nThe Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman\u2019s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life was on the line.\nBut CMS\u2019 announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.\nThe agency said it will still enforce the law, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d\nWhile states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive.\nThurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won't be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.\n\u201cYou cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone, still.

The foreign ministry of Laos did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported.\nThere was no immediate response from Iran, but Jamal Abdi, the president of the National Iranian American Council, said: \u201cThe impact of the ban will once again be felt by Americans who were denied the ability to see their loved ones at weddings, funerals, or the birth of a child.\u201d\nThe move bans all travel to the US by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\nTrump imposed a partial ban on travellers from seven countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from these countries would be allowed, his administration said. The bans would come into effect on Monday 9 June, the White House said.\nThe African Union said the ban would harm \u201cpeople-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement and broader diplomatic relations\u201d built with the US over decades. It appealed to Washington to adopt a \u201cconsultative approach and to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned\u201d.\nTrump said the bans were spurred by a makeshift flame-thrower attack on a Jewish protest in Colorado that US authorities blamed on a man they said was in the country illegally.\nSeveral countries on the list \u2013 Myanmar, Libya, Sudan and Yemen \u2013 face continuing civil strife and territory overseen by opposing factions. Sudan has an active war, while Yemen\u2019s war is largely stalemated and Libyan forces remain armed.\nFor citizens of war-stricken countries such as Myanmar, which has been gripped by violence since a military coup in 2021, the announcement is yet another blow. It follows a freeze on refugee resettlements announced by Trump in January, and cuts to scholarship programmes that provided rare opportunities for young people to go abroad and study in safety.\nA 21-year-old student from Myanmar, who asked not be named, said his plan to study computer science at a community college in New York was in tatters. \u201c[My] visa appointment is 25 June \u2013 but then there was this breaking news in the morning \u2026 I felt upset. I couldn\u2019t do anything. This was my only hope, to study in the United States.\u201d\nHe is now studying in Thailand but his visa will expire in October and he is unsure what he will do next, as it is not safe to return home.\nHe had been studying medicine in Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, but fled after he was told he would be forcibly conscripted to join the military.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to the army. Going to the army would be like I\u2019m already dead. My name is on their list so I [had to] sneak out of my country,\u201d he said, adding that his family stayed in Myanmar.\nYoung people have desperately sought ways to leave Myanmar after the widely loathed military junta announced last year it would impose mandatory conscription to boost its numbers.\nAside from the fear of conscription, people are living with the constant threat of military airstrikes in many areas of the country, the aftermath of a devastating earthquake that struck in March and sky-high inflation.\n\u201cMost of the people are jobless, most of the students are hopeless, we have no future. I think our generation is just for sacrifice,\u201d the student said.\nThe travel ban was yet more bad news for Myanmar refugees in neighbouring Thailand, some of whom had been close to moving to the US when Trump abruptly suspended refugee resettlements earlier this year, said Joe Freeman, Amnesty International\u2019s Myanmar researcher.\nSince the 2021 military coup in Myanmar, 3.2 million people have been displaced within the country, while 176,400 have fled to neighbouring countries. \u201cSome had already done their orientations for the US. They\u2019ve already had their medical checkups. They\u2019ve already gotten their flight tickets \u2013 and then just like [that] the hammer comes down,\u201d Freeman said.\nThe inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who had worked to resettle its people. The ban makes exceptions for Afghans on special immigrant visas, generally people who worked most closely with the US government during the two-decade-long war there.\nAfghanistan was also one of the largest sources of resettled refugees, with about 14,000 arrivals in a 12-month period through September 2024. Trump suspended refugee resettlement on his first day in office.\nShawn VanDiver, the president and board chair of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit, said: \u201cTo include Afghanistan \u2013 a nation whose people stood alongside American service members for 20 years \u2013 is a moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold,.\u201d\nInternational aid groups and refugee resettlement organisations roundly condemned the bans. \u201cThis policy is not about national security \u2013 it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,\u201d said Abby Maxman, the president of Oxfam America.", "Source": "The Guardian", "Keyword": ["visa"], "Entities": ["Venezuela", "Trump", "US", "Somalia", "Washington", "Donald Trump", "Afghanistan", "Iran", "Yemen", "the United States", "Diosdado Cabello", "Caracas", "US", "Dahir Hassan Abdi", "US", "Somalia", "the United States", "Myanmar", "Laos", "Reuters", "Iran", "Jamal Abdi", "the National Iranian American Council", "US", "Afghanistan", "Myanmar", "Chad", "the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea", "Eritrea", "Haiti", "Iran", "Libya", "Somalia", "Sudan", "Yemen", "Burundi", "Cuba", "Laos", "Sierra Leone", "Togo", "Turkmenistan", "Venezuela", "the White House", "The African Union", "US", "Washington", "Trump", "Colorado", "US", "Myanmar", "Libya", "Sudan", "Yemen", "Sudan", "Yemen", "Myanmar", "Trump", "Myanmar", "New York", "the United States", "Thailand", "Mandalay", "Myanmar", "Myanmar", "Myanmar", "Myanmar", "Thailand", "US", "Trump", "Joe Freeman", "Amnesty International\u2019s", "Myanmar", "Myanmar", "US", "Freeman", "Afghanistan", "US", "Afghanistan", "Trump", "Shawn VanDiver", "AfghanEvac", "Afghanistan", "the United States", "Abby Maxman"]}, {"Title": "Supreme court strikes down Mexico\u2019s lawsuit against US gunmakers", "Link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/supreme-court-mexico-gun-lawsuit", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:04:58 GMT", "Summary": "<p>Lawsuit alleged that Smith &amp; Wesson and Interstate Arms aided the illegal trafficking of firearms to drug cartels</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/us-supreme-court\">US supreme court</a> on Thursday spared two American gun companies from a lawsuit by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico\">Mexico</a>\u2019s government accusing them of aiding illegal firearms trafficking to drug cartels and fueling gun violence on the south side of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border\">US-Mexico border</a>.</p><p>The justices, in a unanimous ruling, overturned a lower court\u2019s decision that had allowed the lawsuit to proceed against the firearms maker Smith &amp; Wesson and distributor Interstate Arms.

Social media is a key battleground in China\u2019s information warfare, as it seeks to convince or coerce Taiwan into accepting annexation without military conflict.\nThe DoubleThink Lab report claimed the more active TikTok users showed stronger correlations with an openness to Chinese propaganda and the idea that unification with China is inevitable and democracy should be sacrificed for peace.\nThere was also correlation with unhappiness about current domestic issues, including opposition-driven accusations of judicial unfairness and erosions of free speech. Differences were stark among supporters of Taiwan\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which the CCP has labelled illegal separatists.\n\u201cOur analysis suggests that active TikTok use is more likely to influence users\u2019 political attitudes toward being more anti-democratic establishment and positive attitudes toward PRC governance, even among groups traditionally opposed to the CCP,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Eric Hsu.\nThe percentage of DPP supporters who used TikTok and thought it was acceptable to give up Taiwan\u2019s democratic system \u201cfor the sake of cross-strait peace\u201d was 10 points higher than non-users, at 26.8%, the report said. And in response to statements that the DPP was \u201cno different from the CCP and Taiwan lacks freedom of speech\u201d, 23.9% of DPP supporters who used TikTok agreed, compared with 9.3% who were not active on the app.\nTikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and fears of it being used to spread pro-CCP propaganda have already resulted in restrictions or threats of outright bans in several countries, including the US. In Taiwan, there are rules against TikTok being used on government devices.\nIn 2019, the Guardian revealed how ByteDance used TikTok to advance Beijing\u2019s foreign policy aims by moderating sensitive content. A 2023 study, by Rutgers University\u2019s Network Contagion Research Institute in the US, found TikTok\u2019s algorithms consistently amplify pro-CCP content and suppress anti-CCP narratives, with much of the pro-CCP content originating from state-linked entities.\nByteDance has long denied the allegations.\n\u201cFrom the CCP\u2019s founding, there has always been a strong emphasis on both the \u2018pen\u2019 and the \u2018gun\u2019 \u2013 meaning propaganda and force,\u201d said Yu-hui Tai, an assistant professor at Taiwan\u2019s National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.\nTai said Taiwan was on the frontline of China\u2019s propaganda efforts, and its digital environment was \u201ccomplex\u201d. She added: \u201cTikTok is not the only app young people use\u201d, noting that Douyin \u2013 the Chinese domestic version of TikTok, which some Taiwanese also use \u2013 is very different in content and moderation to TikTok.\nThe Guardian has reported previously on the popularity of other Chinese apps that have increased their cultural influence among young Taiwanese.\nTitus C Chen, a research fellow at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University, said the vast majority of TikTok users \u201caren\u2019t actively seeking out political content when they use the platform\u201d.\nHe said it could not be ruled out that users were just more inclined to agree with such views and so were being fed content that aligned with their interests.\n\u201cThat said, it\u2019s undeniably true that TikTok\u2019s content \u2013 both its Chinese and international versions \u2013 is heavily influenced and controlled by the Chinese government,\u201d said Chen. \u201cSo it\u2019s very unlikely you\u2019ll come across much content on TikTok that supports liberal democracy.\u201d\nAdditional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu", "Source": "The Guardian", "Keyword": ["rutgers university", "rutgers university"], "Entities": ["TikTok", "Taiwan", "DoubleThink Lab", "Taiwan", "Taiwan", "China", "Taiwan", "China", "TikTok", "China", "Communist party", "CCP", "Taiwan", "China", "China", "Taiwan", "TikTok", "China", "Taiwan", "Democratic Progressive party", "DPP", "CCP", "TikTok", "PRC", "CCP", "Eric Hsu", "DPP", "TikTok", "Taiwan", "DPP", "CCP", "Taiwan", "DPP", "TikTok", "TikTok", "ByteDance", "pro-CCP", "US", "Taiwan", "TikTok", "Guardian", "ByteDance", "TikTok", "Beijing", "Rutgers University\u2019s Network Contagion Research Institute", "US", "TikTok", "pro-CCP", "the pro-CCP", "ByteDance", "CCP", "Yu-hui Tai", "Taiwan", "Tai", "Taiwan", "China", "TikTok", "Douyin", "TikTok", "TikTok", "Guardian", "Chen", "Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University", "TikTok", "TikTok", "Chen", "TikTok", "Jason Tzu Kuan Lu"]}, {"Title": "Endangered sharks being killed at alarming levels in Pacific, Greenpeace claims, after cutting 20km of vessel\u2019s longline", "Link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/06/endangered-sharks-being-killed-at-alarming-levels-in-pacific-greenpeace-claims-after-cutting-20km-of-vessels-longline-ntwnfb", "Published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 02:28:02 GMT", "Summary": "<p>Activists on Rainbow Warrior in waters north of New Zealand claim Spanish vessel hauled in and killed three mako sharks in 30 minutes</p><ul><li><p>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl\">breaking news email</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></p></li></ul><p>Endangered sharks are being killed at alarming levels in the Pacific and industrial fishing is putting marine biodiversity at increasing risk, Greenpeace has claimed, after its activists disrupted a Spanish vessel operating north of New Zealand.</p><p>The campaign group said activists on the Rainbow Warrior this week observed a longline fishing operation by the Playa Zahara in the South Fiji Basin.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/06/endangered-sharks-being-killed-at-alarming-levels-in-pacific-greenpeace-claims-after-cutting-20km-of-vessels-longline-ntwnfb\">Continue reading...</a>", "Content": "Endangered sharks are being killed at alarming levels in the Pacific and industrial fishing is putting marine biodiversity at increasing risk, Greenpeace has claimed, after its activists disrupted a Spanish vessel operating north of New Zealand.\nThe campaign group said activists on the Rainbow Warrior this week observed a longline fishing operation by the Playa Zahara in the South Fiji Basin.\nGeorgia Whitaker, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace Australia Pacific, was on board during the operation. She claimed the activists watched as the vessel hauled in and killed three endangered mako sharks in half an hour.\nShe said a small crew, including a trained shark handler, boarded a support boat to approach the Spanish vessel after releasing 14 animals caught on its line \u2013 among them eight near-threatened blue sharks, four swordfish and an endangered longfin mako shark.\nThe activists also removed more than 210 hooks and 20km of longline.\n\u201cIt was devastating seeing these beautiful creatures being caught, often on their gills, in their mouth, by huge baited hooks,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cThey were fighting for their lives and then minutes later you\u2019d see blood spilling over the side of the boat.\u201d\nWhitaker said the vessel\u2019s crew told Greenpeace they were acting legally and primarily targeting swordfish.\nAccording to the European Union\u2019s reporting to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the Playa Zahara caught more than 600,000kg of blue shark in 2023 in the Pacific Southwest.\nPatricia Rodr\u00edguez, a spokesperson for Viverdreams Fish, the company that owns Playa Zahara, said in a statement the boat acted in accordance with international law and capturing species such as the mako shark and blue shark was not prohibited.\n\u201cThe species mentioned by Greenpeace are within the quotas and limits allowed by the competent authorities, and the capture, handling and unloading procedures are controlled and documented, by all the systems established by the EU and Spanish authorities,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said.\nThe statement accused Greenpeace of \u201ca campaign of disinformation\u201d, violating maritime laws, stealing the fishing gear and posing risks to crews on both vessels by its intervention.\n\u201cOur company is strongly committed to the sustainability of marine resources and regularly collaborates with scientists, independent observers and fisheries authorities to ensure compliance with conservation standards,\u201d she said.\nA Greenpeace analysis has estimated that almost half a million blue sharks were caught as bycatch in the Pacific Ocean last year \u2013 the highest number recorded since 1991.\nThe same report found nearly 70% of EU longline catches in the region in 2023 were blue sharks.\nWorld leaders will meet in Nice next week for the UN ocean conference to discuss the high seas biodiversity treaty, which Australia signed in 2023 but is yet to ratify.\nGreenpeace has urged the government to ratify the treaty within the first 100 days of its second term. The treaty requires 60 countries to ratify it before it comes into force, but as yet only 32 have done so.\nShark fishing is a lucrative global trade, worth an estimated $1bn annually. Global demand for shark meat has doubled in the past two decades.\nDr Leonardo Guida, a shark scientist with the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the level of exploitation was alarming, given more than one-third of shark and ray species are threatened with extinction globally.\n\u201cSharks are important in the ecosystem, they typically occupy the top of marine food webs,\u201d he said. \u201cSteep population declines will cause food webs to potentially become unstable and ultimately collapse, there is a clear impact their loss could have on food security for a lot of nations.\u201d\nGuida said the creation of no-take marine sanctuaries was essential \u2013 to preserve marine life and to understand how ecosystems respond to the combined pressures of overfishing and the climate crisis.\n\u201cThese sanctuaries act as controls,\u201d he said. \u201cThey help us compare areas impacted by fishing with those that are not, which is critical to building resilience in ocean wildlife and managing our fisheries in a rapidly changing world, such that we reduce our impact on different species.\u201d", "Source": "The Guardian", "Keyword": ["compliance"], "Entities": ["Greenpeace", "New Zealand", "the Playa Zahara", "Georgia Whitaker", "Greenpeace Australia Pacific", "mako", "longfin mako shark", "Whitaker", "Whitaker", "Greenpeace", "the European Union\u2019s", "Central Pacific Fisheries Commission", "WCPFC", "Playa Zahara", "Patricia Rodr\u00edguez", "Viverdreams Fish", "Playa Zahara", "Greenpeace", "EU", "Rodr\u00edguez", "Greenpeace", "Greenpeace", "EU", "Nice", "UN", "Australia", "Greenpeace", "an estimated $1bn", "Leonardo Guida", "the Australian Marine Conservation Society", "Guida"]}, {"Title": "\u2018Total discrimination\u2019: Chinese students facing US visa ban say their lives are in limbo", "Link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/chinese-students-visa-ban-trump-international-study", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 23:27:42 GMT", "Summary": "<p>Across the US, hundreds of thousands of Chinese students are now uncertain about their academic future and some are considering moving away</p><p>Chinese students in the United States are questioning their future in the country after the state department announced last week that it would \u201caggressively\u201d revoke visas for Chinese students and enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong.</p><p>Chinese students hoping to study at Harvard, the US\u2019s oldest and wealthiest university, are under particular pressure after the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/trump-restricts-harvard-student-visas\">announced on Wednesday</a> that it was banning the school from enrolling new foreign students.

The presidential proclamation cited Harvard\u2019s links with China as a particular cause for concern.\nFor Jerry*, a 22-year-old applied mathematics student at the University of California, Los Angeles, the uncertainty started last month, when the Trump administration suddenly halted Harvard University\u2019s ability to enrol any international students.\nJerry has a place on a health data science masters programme at Harvard, which is due to start in the autumn. The US government\u2019s attempt to ban Harvard from accepting international students appears to have been blocked, at least temporarily, by the courts. But Trump\u2019s announcement on Wednesday invokes a different legal authority.\nMarco Rubio, the secretary of state, has announced that the authorities will be targeting Chinese students specifically, nationwide.\nIt is \u201ctotal discrimination,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would consider that reason sufficient. That\u2019s just pushing Chinese students to go elsewhere\u201d.\nUnsure about whether or not he will be able to enrol at Harvard, Jerry is considering taking up a place on a DPhil (PhD) programme at Oxford University in the UK. He said on Thursday that following Trump\u2019s latest attack on Harvard, Oxford seems like an even more likely option.\nAlthough he hopes to study at Harvard, Jerry feels lucky to have a back-up plan. \u201cA lot of the people who accepted Harvard offers don\u2019t have other options. So it must be much more anxious for them\u201d.\nAcross the US, universities have been scrambling to find ways to reassure the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students on their campuses about their academic future.\nIn a memo sent to Chinese students at University of Oregon, the school described the state department\u2019s announcement about revoking the visas for Chinese students as \u201cvague\u201d and said: \u201cA revoked passport does not impact your legal status in the US because it is only an entry document used when entering the US\u201d. However, the university warned that a revoked visa could lead to removal proceedings by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).\nWarning about being targeted by ICE have taken on a new gravity since the agency started targeting international students with the lawful right to remain in the country. They include Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestine activist who was detained despite holding a green card to reside in the US. Khalil is now fighting a deportation order.\nSteven*, a 34-year-old Chinese PhD student at the University of Oregon, said that although he is not planning to apply for a new student visa soon, the prospect of an encounter with ICE concerned him. \u201cNowadays, even if you have a green card, you have legitimate status, you could get caught by ICE, because these guys are crazy\u201d.\nSteven has been in the US for a decade. In that time, the US has become a less attractive destination for Chinese students, he said, something he sees borne out in his part-time job helping Chinese students with their college applications. The numbers wanting to study in the US have declined, with people favouring countries in South-east Asia, such as Singapore, which are more culturally similar to China. The US is \u201cjust not that friendly\u201d any more, Steven says.\nThe loss of top Chinese students in the US would be a blow to academic research, and to the funding for higher education institutions, experts say.\nIn the 2023-2024 academic year, there were about 277,400 Chinese students in the US, according to government statistics. That is a 25% drop compared to 2019-2020.\n\u201cBy barring Chinese students and scholars from America, the Trump administration will strangle the pipeline of high-end talent into our universities, companies, and research institutes, sparking a serious deficit in talent and expertise that will damage American competitiveness,\u201d said Denis Simon, non-resident fellow at the Quincy Institute, who specialises in science and technology policy in China.\nThe state department\u2019s announcement last week specified that students with connections to the Chinese Communist party (CCP) or studying in \u201ccritical fields\u201d would be included in the visa crackdown.\nFor years, the US has tried to root out Chinese espionage in academia, with concerns raised about CCP-backed programmes to recruit top talent in science and technology fields that are strategically important to China. But academics and campaigners say that this has bled over into racism, with all Chinese researchers or those of Chinese heritage being treated with suspicion.\nJerry, the mathematics student, said he has experienced discrimination in the US, but not on campus. But if Chinese researchers, staff and PhD students feel they have to leave the US because of an increasingly hostile environment, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a disaster for American universities,\u201d he said.\n*Names have been changed\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang", "Source": "The Guardian", "Keyword": ["discrimination", "international students", "revoking", "deportation", "legal status", "student visa", "columbia university", "harvard university", "university of oregon", "visa"], "Entities": ["the United States", "the state department", "China", "Hong Kong", "Harvard", "US", "Trump", "Harvard", "China", "Jerry*", "the University of California", "Los Angeles", "Trump", "Harvard University\u2019s", "Jerry", "Harvard", "US", "Harvard", "Trump", "Marco Rubio", "state", "Jerry", "Harvard", "Jerry", "DPhil", "Oxford University", "UK", "Trump", "Harvard", "Oxford", "Harvard", "Jerry", "Harvard", "US", "University of Oregon", "US", "US", "the Immigration and Customs Enforcement", "Mahmoud Khalil", "Columbia University", "US", "Khalil", "Steven*", "the University of Oregon", "Steven", "US", "US", "US", "Singapore", "China", "US", "Steven", "US", "US", "America", "Trump", "Denis Simon", "the Quincy Institute", "China", "the Chinese Communist party", "CCP", "US", "CCP", "China", "Jerry", "US", "US", "Lillian Yang"]}, {"Title": "Russia is at war with Britain and US is no longer a reliable ally, UK adviser says", "Link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/06/russia-is-at-war-with-uk-and-us-no-longer-reliable-ally", "Published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 17:32:33 GMT", "Summary": "<p>Government defence expert Fiona Hill warns UK to respond to threats by becoming more cohesive and resilient</p><p>Russia is at war with Britain, the US is no longer a reliable ally and the UK has to respond by becoming more cohesive and more resilient, according to one of the three authors of the strategic defence review.</p><p>Fiona Hill, from County Durham, became the White House\u2019s chief Russia adviser during Donald Trump\u2019s first term and contributed to the British government\u2019s strategy.

She made the remarks in an interview with the Guardian.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in pretty big trouble,\u201d Hill said, describing the UK\u2019s geopolitical situation as caught between \u201cthe rock\u201d of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and \u201cthe hard place\u201d of Donald Trump\u2019s increasingly unpredictable US.\nHill, 59, is perhaps the best known of the reviewers appointed by Labour, alongside Lord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, and the retired general Sir Richard Barrons. She said she was happy to take on the role because it was \u201csuch a major pivot point in global affairs\u201d. She remains a dual national after living in the US for more than 30 years.\n\u201cRussia has hardened as an adversary in ways that we probably hadn\u2019t fully anticipated,\u201d Hill said, arguing that Putin saw the Ukraine war as a starting point to Moscow becoming \u201ca dominant military power in all of Europe\u201d.\nAs part of that long-term effort, Russia was already \u201cmenacing the UK in various different ways,\u201d she said, citing \u201cthe poisonings, assassinations, sabotage operations, all kinds of cyber-attacks and influence operations. The sensors that we see that they\u2019re putting down around critical pipelines, efforts to butcher undersea cables.\u201d\nThe conclusion, Hill said, was that \u201cRussia is at war with us\u201d. The foreign policy expert, a longtime Russia watcher, said she had first made a similar warning in 2015, in a revised version of a book she wrote about the Russian president with Clifford Gaddy, reflecting on the invasion and annexation of Crimea.\n\u201cWe said Putin had declared war on the west,\u201d she said. At the time, other experts disagreed, but Hill said events since had demonstrated \u201che obviously had, and we haven\u2019t been paying attention to it\u201d. The Russian leader, she argues, sees the fight in Ukraine as \u201cpart of a proxy war with the United States; that\u2019s how he has persuaded China, North Korea and Iran to join in\u201d.\nPutin believed that Ukraine had already been decoupled from the US relationship, Hill said, because \u201cTrump really wants to have a separate relationship with Putin to do arms control agreements and also business that will probably enrich their entourages further, though Putin doesn\u2019t need any more enrichment\u201d.\nWhen it came to defence, however, she said the UK could not rely on the military umbrella of the US as during the cold war and in the generation that followed, at least \u201cnot in the way that we did before\u201d. In her description, the UK \u201cis having to manage its number one ally\u201d, though the challenge is not to overreact because \u201cyou don\u2019t want to have a rupture\u201d.\nThis way of thinking appears in the defence review published earlier this week, which says \u201cthe UK\u2019s longstanding assumptions about global power balances and structures are no longer certain\u201d \u2013 a rare acknowledgment in a British government document of how far and how fast Trumpism is affecting foreign policy certainties.\nThe review team reported to Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, and the defence secretary, John Healey. Most of Hill\u2019s interaction were with Healey, however, and she said she had met the prime minister only once \u2013 describing him as \u201cpretty charming \u2026 in a proper and correct way\u201d and as \u201chaving read all the papers\u201d.\nHill was not drawn on whether she had advised Starmer or Healey on how to deal with Donald Trump, saying instead: \u201cThe advice I would give is the same I would give in a public setting.\u201d She said simply that the Trump White House \u201cis not an administration, it is a court\u201d in which a transactional president is driven by his \u201cown desires and interests, and who listens often to the last person he talks to\u201d.\nShe added that unlike his close circle, Trump had \u201ca special affinity for the UK\u201d based partly on his own family ties (his mother came from the Hebridean island of Lewis, emigrating to New York aged 18) and an admiration for the royal family, particularly the late queen. \u201cHe talked endlessly about that,\u201d she said.\nOn the other hand, Hill is no fan of the populist right administration in the White House and worries it could come to Britain if \u201cthe same culture wars\u201d are allowed to develop with the encouragement of Republicans from the US.\nShe noted that Reform UK had won a string of council elections last month, including in her native Durham, and that the party\u2019s leader, Nigel Farage, wanted to emulate some of the aggressive efforts to restructure government led by Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge) before his falling-out with Trump.\n\u201cWhen Nigel Farage says he wants to do a Doge against the local county council, he should come over here [to the US] and see what kind of impact that has,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is going to be the largest layoffs in US history happening all at once, much bigger than hits to steelworks and coalmines.\u201d\nHill\u2019s argument is that in a time of profound uncertainty, Britain needs greater internal cohesion if it is to protect itself. \u201cWe can\u2019t rely exclusively on anyone any more,\u201d she said, arguing that Britain needed to have \u201ca different mindset\u201d based as much on traditional defence as on social resilience.\nSome of that, Hill said, was about a greater recognition of the level of external threat and initiatives for greater integration, by teaching first aid in schools or encouraging more teenagers to join school cadet forces, a recommendation of the defence review. \u201cWhat you need to do is get people engaged in all kinds of different ways in support of their communities,\u201d she said.\nHill said she saw that deindustrialisation and a rise of inequality in Russia and the US had contributed to the rise in national populism in both countries. Politicians in Britain, or elsewhere, \u201chave to be much more creative and engage people where they are at\u201d as part of a \u201cnational effort\u201d, she said.\nIf this seems far away from a conventional view of defence, that\u2019s because it is, though Hill also argues that traditional conceptions of war are changing as technology evolves and with it what makes a potent force.\n\u201cPeople keep saying the British army has the smallest number of troops since the Napoleonic era. Why is the Napoleonic era relevant? Or that we have fewer ships than the time of Charles II. The metrics are all off here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Ukrainians are fighting with drones. Even though they have no navy, they sank a third of the Russian Black Sea fleet.\u201d\nHer aim, therefore, is not just to be critical but to propose solutions. Hill recalled that a close family friend, on hearing that she had taken on the defence review, had told her: \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t tell us how shite we are, tell us what we can do, how we can fix things.\u2019 People understand that we have a problem and that the world has changed.\u201d", "Source": "The Guardian", "Keyword": ["dei"], "Entities": ["Russia", "Britain", "US", "UK", "Fiona Hill", "County Durham", "Russia", "Donald Trump\u2019s", "Guardian", "Hill", "UK", "Vladimir Putin\u2019s", "Russia", "Donald Trump\u2019s", "US", "Hill", "Labour", "Robertson", "Nato", "Richard Barrons", "US", "Russia", "Hill", "Putin", "Ukraine", "Moscow", "Russia", "UK", "Hill", "Russia", "Russia", "Clifford Gaddy", "Crimea", "Putin", "Hill", "Ukraine", "the United States", "China", "North Korea", "Iran", "Putin", "Ukraine", "US", "Hill", "Putin", "Putin", "UK", "US", "the cold war", "UK", "UK", "Keir Starmer", "Rachel Reeves", "John Healey", "Hill", "Healey", "Hill", "Starmer", "Healey", "Donald Trump", "Trump White House", "Trump", "UK", "Lewis", "New York", "Hill", "the White House", "Britain", "US", "UK", "Durham", "Nigel Farage", "Elon Musk\u2019s", "Trump", "Nigel Farage", "US", "US", "Hill", "Britain", "Britain", "Hill", "Hill", "Russia", "US", "Britain", "Hill", "Napoleonic", "Charles II", "Hill"]}, {"Title": "Russia attacks Ukraine with missiles and drones \u2013 as it happened", "Link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/06/ukraine-war-live-update-russia-kyiv-drone-air-attack-putin-zelenskyy-latest-news", "Published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 02:32:35 GMT", "Summary": "<p>This blog is now closed</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">See all our Ukraine war coverage</a></p></li></ul><p>We\u2019re about to wrap up this live coverage for now \u2013 thanks for reading.

With agencies\nLooking back at the lead-up to Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine this morning, Moscow had vowed to respond to Ukraine\u2019s drone operation \u201chow and when\u201d it saw fit, amid reports that Vladimir Putin had told Donald Trump that Moscow was obliged to retaliate.\nUkraine had been bracing for retaliation after its SBU security service carried out a surprise drone strike over the weekend targeting four airbases and damaging up to 20 Russian warplanes deep inside the country, according to US officials, Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer have reported.\nThe Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, was asked on Thursday what Moscow\u2019s response would be and said:\nHow and when our military deems it appropriate.\nTrump said Putin had \u201cstrongly\u201d told him during their unannounced call on Wednesday that Russia would respond to the recent attacks on its airfields.\nThe US embassy in Ukraine warned of a continuing risk of \u201csignificant airstrikes\u201d and advised its citizens to exercise caution.\nHours after Trump and Putin spoke, Russia launched a series of missiles and drones across Ukraine, killing at least five people in the northern city of Pryluky.\nAt least three wounded in missile and drone attack on Kyiv \u2013 officials\nBallistics missiles are also involved in Russia\u2019s ongoing attack on Kyiv and at least three people have been wounded, officials say.\n\u201cOur air defense crews are doing everything possible,\u201d Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv city administration, said on Telegram. \u201cBut we must protect one another \u2014 stay safe.\u201d\nAuthorities reported damage in several districts and rescue workers were responding at multiple locations, the Associated Press reports.\nLocal officials urged residents to seek shelter.\nIn Solomyanskyi district, a fire broke out on the 11th floor of a 16-story residential building. Emergency services evacuated three people from the apartment and rescue operations were ongoing. Another fire broke out in a metal warehouse.\nIn northern Chernihiv region, a Shahed drone exploded near an apartment building, shattering windows and doors, according to regional military administration chief Dmytro Bryzhynskyi.\nHe added that explosions from ballistic missiles were also recorded on the outskirts of the city.\nUkrainian air defences trying to repel drone waves, says Kyiv\nRussian drones approached Kyiv in waves and air defence units were attempting to repel them, the head of the city\u2019s military administration said.\nTymur Tkachenko later warned of a risk of ballistic missiles being deployed against the capital, Reuters reports.\nHe said Russia\u2019s drone attack on Kyiv early on Friday triggered fires in residential buildings in different parts of the city\nTkachenko said drones had struck the upper floors of a high-rise apartment building and started a fire in Darnytskyi district on the east side of the city, where he said emergency power cuts were possible.\nOne unofficial Telegram channel said a shopping centre in the area was ablaze.\nTkachenko said a fire had also broken out in an apartment building in a western district. Drone fragments had been spotted in three districts, he said.\nWelcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine, where the capital is under attack from Russian drones early and authorities say drone fragments have fallen in different parts of the city.\nWitnesses reported a series of explosions in Kyiv, with one of them reporting a large fire at a site where one drone had fallen.\n\u201cEnemy drones are approaching one after the other on approaches to the capital from different directions and in the city\u2019s airspace,\u201d Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city\u2019s military administration, wrote on Telegram.\nThe attacks came after Russia accused Kyiv of state terrorism over its daring drone operation striking Russian heavy bomber planes at air bases in Siberia and the far north at the weekend and said it it would respond as and when its military saw fit.\nDonald Trump said that during a call with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday he urged the Russian president to refrain from retaliating, but fully expected Moscow to strike back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not going to be pretty. I don\u2019t like it,\u201d said Trump, who described what he called \u201cgreat hatred\u201d between Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nTkachenko said on Friday that in Kyiv drone fragments had been spotted in three districts on opposite sides of the Dnipro River that bisects the city. One drone had fallen on a building, he said, and details on damage and possible casualties were being collated.\nIn other key developments:\nThe IAEA\u2019s team at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine heard repeated rounds of gunfire that appeared to be aimed at drones reportedly attacking the site\u2019s training centre, the head of the UN\u2019s nuclear safety watchdog said on Thursday. There were no immediate reports of damage to the centre, it said.\nRussia launched a series of missiles and drones across Ukraine hours after Trump and Putin spoke on Wednesday.

In a social media post on X, Yair Golan, the leader of the Democrats in the Knesset, said: \u201cNetanyahu is a threat to Israel\u2019s national security. Instead of bringing about a deal \u2026 bringing the hostages home and providing security for Israeli citizens, he is creating a new ticking timebomb in Gaza.\u201d\nPalestinians in Gaza marked the start of Eid al-Adha, one of Islam\u2019s most important holidays, on Friday with prayers outside destroyed mosques and homes and food supplies dwindling. Food distribution points run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation reopened on Friday before closing a few hours later.\nWork at the sites was previously halted this week in response to a series of deadly shootings by Israeli soldiers that on Tuesday killed 27 Palestinians and injured hundreds as they were waiting for food. The UN says more than 2,700 children in Gaza are suffering from acute malnutrition.\nIsraeli jets meanwhile continued to pound the territory and, according to Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency, 38 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military on Friday, including 11 in a single strike in the north.

Abu Shabab\u2019s group has previously been accused of involvement in smuggling operations linked to Egyptian jihadi groups.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAbu Shabab\u2019s involvement with Israeli troops was confirmed last week through several videos circulating on social media in Gaza, showing him operating alongside Israeli soldiers in IDF-controlled areas.\nLast week, Abu Shabab\u2019s family issued a statement disowning him, accusing him of collaborating with Israeli forces. \u201cWe, like everyone else, were surprised by video footage broadcast by the resistance showing the involvement of Yasser\u2019s groups within a dangerous security framework, reaching the point of operating within undercover units and supporting the Zionist occupation forces, who are brutally killing our people,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cWe affirm that we will not accept Yasser\u2019s return to the family.

But an alternative plan seeks to extend the duration of military service for conscripts and raise the age for reservists, while also urging an end to the customary exemptions granted to yeshiva students.\nDue to the war in Gaza, the IDF is saying yeshiva students must be drafted, as it urgently needs an additional 10,000 combat soldiers and about 3,000 soldiers for other roles.\n.", "Source": "The Guardian", "Keyword": ["protests"], "Entities": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Gaza", "Hamas", "Netanyahu", "Yasser Abu Shabab", "Bedouin", "Israel", "Abu Shabab\u2019s", "Anti-Terror Service", "Kalashnikov", "Hamas", "Gaza", "Hamas", "Netanyahu", "Hamas", "Israel", "Knesset", "Netanyahu", "Israel", "Gaza", "Gaza", "Islam", "US", "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation", "UN", "Gaza", "Gaza", "Israel", "Hamas", "Gaza", "Netanyahu", "Israel", "Hamas", "Avigdor Lieberman", "Abu Shabab\u2019s", "Islamic State", "Islamic State", "Lieberman", "Yisrael Beiteinu", "Kan Bet", "Lieberman", "Abu Shabab\u2019s", "The Israel Defense Forces", "Abu Shabab\u2019s", "Gaza", "Abu Shabab\u2019s", "Yasser\u2019s", "Yasser\u2019s", "Jonathan Whittall", "United Nations", "the Kerem Shalom", "Gaza", "Guardian", "Abu Shabab", "Abu Shabab", "Gaza", "Hamas", "Netanyahu", "Netanyahu", "Knesset", "The Shas party\u2019s", "Israel", "Haredi", "Torah", "Gaza", "IDF"]}, {"Title": "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to reopen two distribution centres intended to supply aid \u2013 as it happened", "Link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/05/gaza-israel-war-hostages-hamas-benjamin-netanyahu-aid-latest-live-news", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 14:31:25 GMT", "Summary": "<p>US-backed Israeli logistics group to reopen facilities today after closures following IDF warnings.

It\u2019s creating layers and layers of restrictions.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s first travel ban in January 2017, issued days after he took office, targeted the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The order came as a shock \u2013 including to many administration officials. Customs and Border Protection officials were initially given little guidance on how to enact the ban. Lawyers and protesters rushed to international airports where travellers were stuck in limbo. Confusion spread through colleges and tech companies in the US, and refugee camps across the world.\nThis time, Trump\u2019s travel ban came as no surprise. He had cued up the proclamation in an executive order signed on 20 January, his first day back in the White House, instructing his administration to submit a list of candidate countries for a ban by 21 March. Though he finally signed a proclamation enacting the ban on Wednesday, it will not take effect until 9 June \u2013 allowing border patrol officers and travellers a few days to prepare.\nThe ban includes several exemptions, including for people with visas who are already in the United States, green-card holders, dual citizens and athletes or coaches traveling to the US for major sporting events such as the World Cup or the Olympics. It also exempts Afghans eligible for the special immigrant visa program for those who helped the US during the war in Afghanistan.\nBut the policy, which is likely to face legal challenges, will undoubtedly once again separate families and disproportionately affect people seeking refuge from humanitarian crises.\n\u201cThis is horrible, to be clear \u2026 and it\u2019s still something that reeks of arbitrary racism and xenophobia,\u201d Al-Juburi said. \u201cBut this does not yield the type of chaos that January 2017 yielded, because immigration overall has been upended to such a degree that the practice of immigration laws is in a state of chaos.\u201d\nIn his second term, Trump has taken unprecedented steps to tear down legal immigration. He has eliminated the legal status of thousands of international students and instructed US embassies worldwide to stop scheduling visa interviews as it prepares to ramp up social media vetting for international scholars.\nThe administration has arrested people at immigration check-ins, exiled asylum seekers to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, and detained scholars and travellers at airports without reason. Although Trump\u2019s travel ban excludes green-card holders, his Department of Homeland Security has made clear that it can and will revoke green cards as it sees fit \u2013 including in the cases of the student activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi.\n\u201cThe first Muslim ban was very targeted, it was brutal, it was immediate, and it was massive,\u201d said Nihad Awad, the executive director at the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations. \u201cNow, the administration is not only targeting nations with certain religious affiliations, but also people of color overall, people who criticise the US government for its funding of the genocide in Gaza.\u201d\nAnd this new travel ban comes as many families are still reeling and recovering from Trump\u2019s first ban. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at, essentially, a ban being in place potentially for eight out of 12 years,\u201d said Ryan Costello, policy director at the National Iranian American Council. \u201cAnd even in that period where the Biden administration lifted the ban, it was still very hard for Iranians to get a visa.\u201d\nIranian Americans who came to the US fleeing political persecution back home, who couldn\u2019t return to Iran, have in some cases been unable to see their parents, siblings or other loved ones for years. \u201cYou want your parents to be able to come for the birth of a child, or to come to your wedding,\u201d Costello said. \u201cSo this is a really hard moment for so many families. And I think, unfortunately, there\u2019s much more staying power for this ban.\u201d\nExperts say the new ban is more likely to stand up to legal challenges than his first ban. It also doesn\u2019t appear to have registered the same intense shock and outrage, culturally.\n\u201cThe first time, we saw this immediate backlash, protests at airports,\u201d said Costello.

and hateful extremist is serving in the United States Congress.

Throughout the country \u2013 and in the Central Valley \u2013 Sikh-Americans are valued and respected members of our communities, yet they continue to face harassment and discrimination.\u201d\nJared Huffman, another Democratic US House member from California, wrote on X: \u201cI often say that I serve in Congress with some of the greatest minds of the 18th century.

America was founded as free nation, and I believe the conduct of its legislators should reflect that truth, not drift further from it.\u201d\nGrace Meng, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, also weighed in on Miller\u2019s tweets, saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s deeply disturbing is the blatant ignorance and anti-Sikh, anti-Muslim xenophobia coming from my colleague across the aisle. There is no place in our country, and especially the halls of Congress, for this hate and intolerance.\u201d\nMeng went on to add: \u201cThe tweet may have been deleted, but we still have the receipts.\u201d\nThe Congressional Asian Pacific American caucus (Capac) also condemned Miller, saying she had engaged in \u201canti-Sikh and anti-Muslim bigotry\u201d.\n\u201cSikhs and Muslims practice two separate and distinct religions, and conflating the two based on how someone looks is not only ignorant, but also racist,\u201d Capac said in a statement.\nThe Sikh Coalition also responded on X, saying: \u201cTo be clear, deleting the tweet is not enough. Congresswoman Miller should apologize for her remarks \u2013 to both the Sikh and Muslim communities, because no one should be targeted on the basis of their identity.\u201d\nSimilarly, the Hindu American Foundation said: \u201cWhichever version of the tweet [Miller] was going with, it is racist, xenophobic and plainly un-American to lash out over a Sikh prayer.

But he is discovering painfully and quickly that it has not bought him love, loyalty or even fear among many GOP members of Congress on Capitol Hill.\nFaced with the choice of siding with Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, or Donald Trump, after the two staged a public relationship breakdown for the ages on Thursday, most Republicans went with the man in the Oval Office, who has shown an unerring grasp of the tactics of political intimidation and who remains the world\u2019s most powerful figure even without the boss of Tesla and SpaceX by his side.\nThe billionaire tech entrepreneur, who poured about $275m into Trump\u2019s campaign last year, tried to remind Washington\u2019s political classes of his financial muscle on Thursday during an outpouring of slights against a man for whom he had once professed platonic love and was still showering with praise up until a week before.\nOne after another, Republican House members came out to condemn him and defend Trump, despite having earlier been told by Musk that \u201cyou know you did wrong\u201d in voting for what has become Trump\u2019s signature legislation that seeks to extend vast tax cuts for the rich.\nTroy Nehls, a GOP representative from Texas, captured the tone, addressing Musk before television cameras:\nYou\u2019ve lost your damn mind. Enough is enough. Stop this.\nIt chimed with the sentiments of many others. \u201cNobody elected Elon Musk, and a whole lot of people don\u2019t even like him, to be honest with you, even on both sides,\u201d Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey congressman, told Axios.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting people calling our offices 100% in support of President Trump,\u201d Kevin Hern, a representative from Oklahoma, told the site.\nEvery tweet that goes out, people are more lockstep behind President Trump and [Musk is] losing favour.\nRepublicans were balancing the strength of Trump\u2019s voice among GOP voters versus the power of the increasingly unpopular Musk\u2019s money \u2013 and most had little doubt which matters most.\n\u201cOn the value of Elon playing against us in primaries compared to Trump endorsing us in primaries, the latter is 100 times more relevant,\u201d Axios quoted one unnamed representative as saying.\nTrump administration preparing to strip federal funding from California \u2013 CNN\nLauren Gambino\nThe Trump administration is preparing to make good on the president\u2019s threat to strip \u201clarge scale\u201d federal funding from California, an effort that could begin as early as Friday, according to CNN.\nThe report says agencies have been directed to start identifying grantsthe administration can withhold from the state. A whistleblower reportedly told a congressional committee that the administration was planning to cut all research grants to California.\nThe White House has not commented on the plans. The timeline remains speculative, and it is unclear what grants would be targeted.\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to cut federal funding as a way to force states, institutions and universities to comply with his agenda. Last week, he said California could lose \u201clarge scale\u201d funding \u201cmaybe permanently\u201d if the state continued to allow transgender athletes to participate in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.\nThe declaration appeared to be in reference to a transgender track-and-field star from southern California. On Saturday, she won two gold medals and a silver, which she shared with other teen athletes under a new rule by the state\u2019s high school sports body.\nTrump had also repeatedly threatened to withhold federal disaster aid, assailing the state\u2019s Democratic leaders for their handling of the wildfires that devastated Los Angeles earlier this year.\nMore from House speaker Mike Johnson, who has told CNBC he has been texting with Elon Musk and hopes the dispute is resolved quickly.\nHe said of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d:\nI don\u2019t argue with [Musk] about how to build rockets and I wish he wouldn\u2019t argue with me about how to craft legislation and pass it.\nJohnson earlier issued a warning: \u201cDo not second-guess and don\u2019t ever challenge the president of the United States, Donald Trump.\u201d\nHe had also projected confidence that the Trump-Musk dispute won\u2019t affect prospects for the tax and border bill. \u201cMembers are not shaken at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pass this legislation on our deadline.\u201d", "Source": "The Guardian", "Keyword": ["transgender athletes", "deportation", "research grants"],

Sikh \u2013 then opted to delete it.\nHer comments triggered swift outrage, with the Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s deeply troubling that such an ignorant and hateful extremist is serving in the United States Congress. That would be you, Mary.\u201d\nSimilarly, David Valadao, a Republican congressman of California, said on Friday: \u201cI\u2019m troubled by my colleague\u2019s remarks about this morning\u2019s Sikh prayer, which have since been deleted. Throughout the country \u2013 and in the Central Valley \u2013 Sikh-Americans are valued and respected members of our communities, yet they continue to face harassment and discrimination.\u201d\nJared Huffman, another Democratic US House member from California, wrote on X: \u201cI often say that I serve in Congress with some of the greatest minds of the 18th century. With [representative] Miller I may need to take it back a few more centuries.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the Democratic congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey said on X: \u201cIt\u2019s deeply troubling that someone with such contempt for religious freedom is allowed to serve in this body. This should have never been allowed to happen. America was founded as free nation, and I believe the conduct of its legislators should reflect that truth, not drift further from it.\u201d\nGrace Meng, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, also weighed in on Miller\u2019s tweets, saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s deeply disturbing is the blatant ignorance and anti-Sikh, anti-Muslim xenophobia coming from my colleague across the aisle. There is no place in our country, and especially the halls of Congress, for this hate and intolerance.\u201d\nMeng went on to add: \u201cThe tweet may have been deleted, but we still have the receipts.\u201d\nThe Congressional Asian Pacific American caucus (Capac) also condemned Miller, saying she had engaged in \u201canti-Sikh and anti-Muslim bigotry\u201d.\n\u201cSikhs and Muslims practice two separate and distinct religions, and conflating the two based on how someone looks is not only ignorant, but also racist,\u201d Capac said in a statement.\nThe Sikh Coalition also responded on X, saying: \u201cTo be clear, deleting the tweet is not enough. Congresswoman Miller should apologize for her remarks \u2013 to both the Sikh and Muslim communities, because no one should be targeted on the basis of their identity.\u201d\nSimilarly, the Hindu American Foundation said: \u201cWhichever version of the tweet [Miller] was going with, it is racist, xenophobic and plainly un-American to lash out over a Sikh prayer. When you took your oath of office [congresswoman] Miller, you swore to uphold our constitution, whose first amendment prohibits your establishing an official religion or favoring one religion over

The reasoning stated in the order is that they all pose security threats measured by \u201cwhether each country has a significant terrorist presence within its territory, its visa-overstay rate, and its cooperation with accepting back its removable nationals\u201d.\nVisa overstays, the order elaborates, \u201cindicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws\u201d. Yet the latest data on overstays from Customs and Border Protection does show these countries high on the list, along with others not included.\nIf we sit with this list a little longer, though, with attention to the history of the world we share, we can see a different unifying logic. All of these countries are in the global south, their citizens are racialized as Black or brown and Muslim. Most have high poverty rates that hover at or above half their population. Several have recently been sites of social upheaval or horrific wars. Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan, for example, all appear on the World Food Program\u2019s list of the world\u2019s most dire food crises.\nThese facts do not, as the travel ban assumes, tell of the inherent violence of people from these nations, nor of a penchant to \u201cdisregard\u201d law. In fact, even the data on overstays says nothing of people\u2019s legal status. Nationals of Afghanistan, Burma, El Salvador, Haiti, Somalia, Sudan and Venezuela have long had a right to apply for temporary protected status due to the insecurity of their countries. We do not know how many of the so-called \u201coverstayers\u201d applied for other protections like asylum.\nThe poverty and insecurity of these nations are mainly an indication that they have been subject to imperialism, including US military and economic intervention and coercion.\nYou cannot understand the endemic violence or economic destitution that forces people to leave Haiti without attending to both the French extortion of the island nation in exchange for their freedom from enslavement, and the United States\u2019 occupation of it. You cannot understand the mass exodus of people from Afghanistan, one of the world\u2019s largest refugee populations, without understanding the United States\u2019 funding of the mujahideen, or the so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d, that did little more than further destabilize the nation. Iran\u2019s current regime is only possible because the US supported British efforts in destroying Iranian democracy to save British Petroleum.\nUS sanctions, whether in Iran or Venezuela or in Cuba, have not contributed to pressuring regime change, but rather to economic devastation and mass displacement. American shrapnel has been pulled from the bodies of Yemeni children. Since March, 250 people have been killed in US strikes on Saada and Sanaa, at least 68 of whom were detained African migrants.\nTime and time again data shows that African countries such as oil-rich Equatorial Guinea and Chad, ravaged by companies such as ExxonMobil, and gold-rich Sudan, are not victims of poverty, but victims of theft. The United Nations estimates that $86bn leaves the continent each year in \u201cillicit financial flows\u201d, or theft through criminal activities and tax evasion. What\u2019s more, between 1970 and 2022, countries in the global south, including those on this list, are estimated to have paid more than $2.5tn in interest alone to the benefit of the global north. Thomas Sankara, a former president of Burkina Faso, once called debt a \u201cskillfully managed reconquest of Africa\u201d.\nThe wealthiest nations in the world are causing the climate crisis that the poorest nations pay for. Climate activists estimate that governments in the global north owe $5tn each year to countries in the global south for the devastation they are causing them.\nSeen from this vantage, Trump\u2019s travel ban, which proudly cites what came to be known as the \u201cMuslim ban\u201d of his first administration in its opening paragraphs, is a cruel escalation of a longstanding policy of profiting off Black and brown lives and disposing of the most vulnerable among them.\nIn displacement camps in New York and Tijuana and the Aegean islands of Greece, I have met pharmacists, artists, DJs and journalists from many of the targeted countries. Just this week I spoke to a political activist who, forced to flee a massacre in one of the targeted countries, left her three young children behind. Speaking to me after the issuance of this ban, she worried whether she would be able to secure her asylum, which is currently being adjudicated, and whether she could ever reunify her family. Her voice broke as she said: \u201cI wish they could understand that I never wanted to come here.\u201d\nTrump justified the ban by referencing a recent incident in which an Egyptian man in Boulder, Colorado, injured 12 people calling for the release of Israeli hostages (though notably Egypt is not on the list). That this one act justifies the banning of millions of people is absurd. This latest ban is simply another installment in a series of policies meant to \u201cMake America white again\u201d, following a ban on asylum and a cancellation of humanitarian parole.

I\u2019ll pass on the movie, but that description seems pretty apt to what living under this Trump administration feels like: a gratuitously more violent sequel to a ghoulish original.\nConsider the Muslim ban. Back in late 2015, candidate Donald Trump called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on\u201d. He signed the first version of the Muslim ban on 27 January 2017, and protests erupted at airports across the nation at the revival of a national policy, similar to the Chinese Exclusion Act, that bars entry of whole swaths of people based on our national prejudices. It took the Trump administration three attempts at crafting this policy before the supreme court tragically greenlit it.\nWhile Joe Biden later reversed the policy, congressional moves to restrict the president\u2019s ability to institute these blanket bans \u2013 such as the No Ban Act \u2013 have not succeeded. And on the first day of his second term, Trump indicated he was prepared to institute a wider-reaching travel ban. He has now done just that. The new executive order will \u201cfully restrict and limit the entry [to the US] of nationals of the following 12 countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen\u201d and will also \u201cpartially restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 7 countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela\u201d.\nYes, there are key cutouts in the latest travel ban that make it a different animal from the original 2017 ban, but it still derives from the same family. Green-card holders, those with valid visas issued before the executive order was proclaimed, and professional athletes representing their countries in the forthcoming World Cup, for example, are exempt, illustrating how the administration has learned to write more litigation-resistant immigration exclusion orders.\nBut make no mistake. Such a policy is alienating, counterproductive and simply racist. For one thing, Trump claims that the ban is necessary because the selected countries exhibit either \u201ca significant terrorist presence\u201d, a lack of cooperation in accepting back their nationals, or high rates of visa overstays. According to the Entry/Exit Overstay Report for fiscal year 2023 (the last one available), the number of people from Equatorial Guinea, a small African country, who overstayed their B1/B2 visas (travel to the US for business or pleasure) was 200. From the United Kingdom, it was 15,712.\nIt\u2019s true that the percentage (as opposed to the number) of people overstaying their visas from Equatorial Guinea is significantly higher than UK overstays. But Djibouti, which hosts the primary US military base in for operations in Africa, has an even higher percentage of B1/B2 visa overstayers than Equatorial Guinea \u2013 yet it isn\u2019t part of the ban, illustrating how much it is based on narrow political calculations and cheap theatrics.\nThe capriciousness of the policy was immediately evident after Trump released a video explaining his decision. \u201cThe recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed for our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstayed their visas,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t want them.\u201d Yet, as everyone knows, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, attack is an Egyptian national, another key US ally. And Egypt is not on the list.\nNor should it be, because these lists of banned countries collapse individuals into vague categories of suspicion and malfeasance. Why should the actions of one person from any given country mark a completely different person as inadmissible? Trump may sound tough to his supporters when announcing the ban, but such broad-brush applications against basically all the nationals of comparatively powerless countries is hardly the flex that Trump thinks it is. In the eyes of the rest of the world, the new policy mostly makes the administration look like a bully, picking on a handful of Muslim-majority countries, a few African and Asian states, a couple of its traditional enemies, and Haiti.\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world also sees how the Trump administration has withdrawn temporary protections from more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and Nicaragua, suspended refugee resettlement from around the world, and yet welcomed in dozens of white Afrikaners from South Africa to the United States as refugees. The ethnocentrism of the policy is as naked as it is opportunistic.\nThe truth is that the damage from Trump\u2019s first-term Muslim ban was long-lasting and had all kinds of collateral impact, including on the mental health of family members living in the United States. And immigrant advocacy organizations are already sharply criticizing this latest version. AfghanEvac, a non-profit organization that facilitates the resettlement of Afghans who worked with American troops, stated that the new ban \u201cis not about national security \u2013 it is about political theater\u201d. To include Afghanistan among the banned countries, even as thousands of Afghans worked alongside American forces, is to Shawn VanDiver, the group\u2019s founder and president, \u201ca moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s latest travel ban, his ramped-up immigration deportation regime, his international student crackdown, and his all but ending asylum in the United States add up to a clearly a concerted attempt to stave off the inevitable while vilifying the marginal. Demographers have been telling us for years now that the US will be a \u201cmajority minority\u201d country around 2045, a prospect that has long frightened many of the white conservatives who make up Trump\u2019s base. In response, Trump is pursuing a policy that draws on the most basic kind of nativism around, and one we\u2019ve seen before in the United States.\nThe 1924 Immigration Act severely restricted immigration to the US to keep America as white and as western European as possible. Only in 1965 were the laws finally changed, with the national immigration quotas lifted, laying the foundation for the multicultural society we have today. That earlier movie of epic exclusion lasted some 41 years. So far, this sequel is violent, scary and authoritarian. It had better be a short film.\n-\nMoustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnist", "Source": "The Guardian", "Keyword": ["executive order", "deportation", "executive order", "protests", "visa"], "Entities": ["Black Phone 2", "Trump", "Donald Trump", "the United States", "the Chinese Exclusion Act", "Trump", "the supreme court", "Joe Biden", "the No Ban Act", "Trump", "US", "Afghanistan", "Burma", "Chad", "Congo", "Equatorial Guinea", "Eritrea", "Haiti", "Iran", "Libya", "Somalia", "Sudan", "Yemen", "Burundi", "Cuba", "Laos", "Sierra Leone", "Togo", "Turkmenistan", "Venezuela", "World Cup", "Trump", "the Entry/Exit Overstay Report", "Equatorial Guinea", "US", "the United Kingdom", "Equatorial Guinea", "UK", "Djibouti", "US", "Equatorial Guinea", "Trump", "Boulder", "Colorado", "Boulder", "Colorado", "US", "Egypt", "Trump", "Haiti", "Trump", "Cuba", "Haiti", "Venezuela", "Nicaragua", "South Africa", "the United States", "Trump", "the United States", "Afghanistan", "Shawn VanDiver", "Trump", "the United States", "US", "Trump", "Trump", "the United States", "US", "America", "Moustafa Bayoumi", "Guardian US"]}, {"Title": "Musk and Trump are enemies made for each other \u2013 united in their ability to trash their own brands | Jonathan Freedland", "Link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/06/donald-trump-elon-musk-enemies-trash-twitter-tesla", "Published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 16:37:17 GMT", "Summary": "<p>What one did to Twitter and Tesla, the other is doing to the United States of America.

The latest plot development \u2013 the epic falling-out between the title character and his best buddy, Elon Musk \u2013 was so predictable, and indeed predicted, that it counts as the opposite of a twist. Still, surprise can be overrated. Watching the two men \u2013 one the richest in the world, the other the most powerful \u2013 turn on each other in a series of ever-more venomous posts on their respective social media platforms has been entertainment of the highest order. X v Truth: it could be a Marvel blockbuster.\nBut this is more than mere popcorn fodder. Even if they eventually patch things up, the rift between the president and Musk has exposed a divide inside the contemporary right, in the US and beyond \u2013 and a fatal flaw of the Trump project.\nNaturally, much of it is personal. That\u2019s why so many declared from the start that this was a star-cross\u2019d bromance, whose destiny was only ever heartbreak. Even as Musk was declaring, back in February, that \u201cI love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man,\u201d wiser heads knew it was doomed. The egos were too large, the narcissism too strong, for their love to survive. In the Trump universe, as in the Musk galaxy, there is room for only one sun.\nIn their case, the personal combines with business. On this reading, Musk\u2019s disenchantment began in his pocket, his opposition to Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d, or \u201cBBB\u201d, currently before Congress, fuelled chiefly by the legislation\u2019s axing of a $7,500 tax credit on the purchase of electric vehicles. With Tesla sales plunging, Musk needed that incentive to lure potential Tesla customers and was furious with Trump for scrapping it. That\u2019s certainly the story Trump is telling. \u201cI took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted \u2026 and he just went CRAZY!\u201d Trump posted.\nThe suggestion that Musk\u2019s driving motive was profit seems to have particularly antagonised the billionaire, prompting him to call for his former paramour to be impeached and to claim that Trump is named in the Jeffrey Epstein files, in effect implicating the president in a paedophile ring. Musk wants to present his objection not as self-serving but as ideological, casting himself as the fiscal conservative appalled by Trump\u2019s \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d of a bill because it will increase the already gargantuan US deficit by trillions of dollars.\nWho\u2019s right? It seems a stretch to argue that Trump\u2019s hostility to electric cars was the problem: as Trump himself pointed out, Musk knew about that when he jumped on the Maga train last year. As for ballooning the deficit, you can see why that would irritate Musk. Adding trillions in red ink makes a mockery of the \u201ccost-cutting\u201d drive he headed up with his so-called department of government efficiency.\nThe billionaire was already smarting from the failure of Doge to cut anything like the $2tn in spending he promised would be easy. All he succeeded in doing by, for instance, feeding the US agency for international development, or USAID, into \u201cthe wood chipper\u201d was to take the lives of 300,000 people, most of them children, who had depended on that agency and its grants, according to a Boston University study. Even if you are minded, charitably, to accept Musk\u2019s own estimate, he only shrank the federal budget by about $150bn. To watch as that effort was cancelled out by a $600bn tax cut to people earning more than $1m a year would be a humiliation indeed.\nWhatever its true cause, the Trump-Musk spat has illuminated a fault line in the right \u2013 and not only in the US. Battered and quieted by the Trump phenomenon, there still remain a few old-school conservatives with a vestigial presence in the Senate, for whom fiscal rectitude remains an article of faith. While Democrats oppose the \u201cBBB\u201d because its cuts to Medicaid will deprive more than 10 million Americans of basic health cover, these traditional Republicans are queasy about the Liz Truss-style risks of a massive unfunded tax giveaway. Overnight, Musk has become their champion.\nRanged against them are the forces of nationalist conservatism, embodied by former Trump strategist and ex-convict Steve Bannon. They don\u2019t have a libertarian yearning for a minimal state; on the contrary, they quite like muscular displays of state power. Witness Trump\u2019s insistence on a Pyongyang-style military parade to celebrate his birthday, and note Bannon\u2019s response to Musk\u2019s impudence in challenging the ruler \u2013 he called for Musk\u2019s businesses, Starlink and SpaceX, to be nationalised. Indeed, nationalist conservatism might not be quite the right term for what Bannon offers: nationalist socialism might be more apt, though something close to that has already been taken.\nThere have been other manifestations of this divide. Musk opposed Trump\u2019s tariffs; Bannon is for them. Musk wanted to see the US remain open to high-skilled, tech-savvy immigrants; Bannon wants to shut the door on them. These, then, are the two camps. (You can see similar faultlines on the British right, dividing Thatcherite Conservatives from Reform UK.) For a while, the anti-woke loathing of DEI policies was strong enough to keep the opposing blocs \u2013 free traders and protectionists; deficit hawks and big spenders \u2013 together. But that glue, as Trump said of Musk, is \u201cwearing thin\u201d.\nThat has some serious implications for US politics and Trump\u2019s presidency. It is conceivable that Trump won\u2019t have the numbers to pass this bill, his central legislative goal, in its current form: the Republican majority in the House is wafer-thin, and one more defecting Republican could sink the proposal in the Senate. Musk has given would-be dissenters cover. The gazillionaire had promised to spend big to help Republicans in the November 2026 midterm elections. Much can happen between now and then, but Trump may now need to look elsewhere for a patron. Who knows, Musk might even follow through on his threat to fund the president\u2019s Democratic opponents. Even if he does not go that far, he controls a prime platform of the right: X could soon become hostile territory for Trump. The point is, Musk is not your usual Trump antagonist. He has as loud a megaphone, and more money, than the president.\nIt all adds up to a sad tale of two men who once had so much in common \u2013 perhaps one thing above all. Each has been lucky enough to find themselves in charge of a brand that once enjoyed global admiration and clout \u2013 and each man has systematically set about trashing that brand in the eyes of the world. Musk has done it more than once. He bought what had become an admittedly imperfect meeting place of some of the planet\u2019s most influential people, Twitter, and turned it into a sewer of bigotry and lies, X. He built a company, Tesla, whose most obvious customers were high earners concerned about the planet and repelled them by association with a nationalist authoritarian who wants to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d.\nTrump, meanwhile, has taken the US, once a magnet for talent from across the globe, and done his best to dismantle all that made it attractive: its stability, its protection of free speech, the independence of its institutions, the quality of its science and universities. This week\u2019s moves \u2013 the travel ban, the suspicion of overseas students, the war on Harvard \u2013 to say nothing of the ongoing hostility to democratic allies and coddling of foreign dictators, are just the latest instances of Trump doing to the US brand what Musk has done to Twitter and Tesla. No wonder Trump and Musk have broken up: they were always far too alike.\n-\nJonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Targeting only those who are coming to the U.S. to study at Harvard doesn\u2019t qualify as a \u201cclass of aliens,\u201d Harvard said in its filing.\n\u201cThe President\u2019s actions thus are not undertaken to protect the \u2018interests of the United States,\u2019 but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,\u201d the university wrote.\nThe amended complaint came in a lawsuit filed last month challenging the previous action from Homeland Security. A federal judge in Boston blocked the move after Harvard said it violated the school\u2019s First Amendment rights. The new filing asks the same judge to block Trump\u2019s latest action too.\nIf Trump\u2019s measure stands, it would block thousands of students who are scheduled to come to the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for summer and fall terms.\n\u201cHarvard\u2019s more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders \u2014 and their dependents \u2014 have become pawns in the government\u2019s escalating campaign of retaliation,\u201d Harvard wrote.\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.\nWinning admission to Harvard University fulfilled a longtime goal for Yonas Nuguse, a student in Ethiopia who endured the Tigray conflict, internet and phone shutdowns, and the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 all of which made it impossible to finish high school on time.\nNow, it\u2019s unclear if he will make it this fall to the Ivy League campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He and other admitted students around the world are anxiously tracking the school\u2019s feud with the Trump administration, which is seeking to keep it from enrolling international students.\nThe war in the country\u2019s Tigray region forced schools to close in many parts of the province. Nuguse, 21, took a gap year to study and save money to pay for his TOEFL English proficiency test in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\u2019s capital.\n\u201cThe war affected me a great deal and when I found out the news that I was accepted to Harvard, I was ecstatic. I knew it was a proud moment for my family, teachers, mentors and friends, who were instrumental in my achievement,\u201d he said.\nIncreasingly, the nation\u2019s oldest and best-known university has attracted some of the brightest minds from around the world, with international students accounting for one-quarter of its enrollment. As Harvard\u2019s fight with the administration plays out, foreign students are now navigating deep uncertainty and weighing other options.\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed a directive seeking to block U.S. entry for Harvard\u2019s international students. It marked the administration\u2019s latest effort to squeeze Harvard\u2019s foreign enrollment after a federal judge in Boston blocked the withdrawal of its certification to host students from overseas.\n\u201cHarvard will continue to protect its international students,\u201d the university said in a statement.\nThe standoff with Harvard comes as the administration has been tightening scrutiny of student visas nationwide. Thousands of students around the country abruptly lost permission to be in the U.S. this spring before the administration reversed itself, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week the U.S. would \u201caggressively revoke\u201d visas for students from China.\n\u201cIt is one blow after another,\u201d said Mike Henniger, CEO of Illume Student Advisory Services, who works with colleges in the U.S., Canada and Europe to recruit international students. \u201cAt this point, international student interest in the U.S. has basically dropped to nil.\u201d\nThe future of Harvard\u2019s international students has been hanging in the balance since the Department of Homeland Security first moved to block its foreign enrollment on May 22.\nFor many, the twists and turns have been exhausting. Jing, a 23-year-old master\u2019s student, is currently completing an internship in China this summer, and unsure if he can reenter the U.S. for the fall semester.\n\u201cIt is tiring, we all feel numb now. Trump just makes big news headlines once every few days since he got back to the White House,\u201d said Jing, who agreed to speak under his family name out of concern about retaliation from the Trump administration.\nJing said he is going to watch and see what happens for now, in case the move against international students is a negotiating tactic that does not stick.\nThe possibility that Trump could block foreign enrollment at other colleges only raises the uncertainty for students planning to pursue their education overseas, said Craig Riggs, who has been working in international education for about 30 years and is the editor of ICEF Monitor. He said he urges families to consult carefully with advisers and not to overreact to the day\u2019s headlines.\n\u201cThe rules under which students would make this huge decision to devote years of their lives and quite a bit of money to studying at Harvard have been shown to change quite quickly,\u201d Riggs said.\nAn aspiring economist, Nuguse was the only student accepted to Harvard this year from Kalamino Special High School, which caters to gifted students from underprivileged backgrounds from across Tigray.\nAfter receiving acceptances also to Columbia University and Amherst College, Nuguse chose Harvard, which he had long dreamed of attending. He said he hopes it will work out to attend Harvard.\nNuguse was granted a visa to study at Harvard, and he worries it might be too late to reverse his decision and attend another university anyway. He received an email from Harvard last week, telling him to proceed with his registration and highlighting a judge\u2019s order in Harvard\u2019s favor in the dispute over foreign enrollment.\n\u201cI hope the situation is temporary and I can enroll on time to go on and realize my dream far from reality in Ethiopia,\u201d he said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Collin Binkley, Jocelyn Gecker and Cheyanne Mumphrey contributed to this report.\n___", "Source": "Huffington Post", "Keyword": ["international students", "department of homeland security", "revoking", "lawsuit", "student visa", "columbia university", "harvard university", "visa"], "Entities": ["Harvard University", "Donald Trump", "the United States", "Harvard", "White House", "Harvard", "the Department of Homeland Security", "Harvard", "Trump", "U.S.", "Harvard", "Harvard", "the United States", "Harvard", "Homeland Security", "Boston", "Harvard", "the school\u2019s First Amendment", "Trump", "Trump", "Cambridge", "Massachusetts", "Harvard", "Harvard", "AP", "Harvard University", "Yonas Nuguse", "Ethiopia", "COVID-19", "Cambridge", "Massachusetts", "Trump", "Nuguse", "TOEFL", "Addis Ababa", "Ethiopia", "Harvard", "Harvard", "Donald Trump", "U.S.", "Harvard", "Harvard", "Boston", "Harvard", "Harvard", "U.S.", "State", "Marco Rubio", "U.S.", "China", "Mike Henniger", "Illume Student Advisory Services", "U.S.", "Canada", "U.S.", "Harvard", "the Department of Homeland Security", "China", "U.S.", "the White House", "Jing", "Trump", "Jing", "Trump", "Craig Riggs", "ICEF Monitor", "Harvard", "Riggs", "Nuguse", "Harvard", "Kalamino Special High School", "Tigray", "Columbia University", "Amherst College", "Nuguse", "Harvard", "Harvard", "Nuguse", "Harvard", "Harvard", "Harvard", "Ethiopia", "Associated Press", "Collin Binkley", "Jocelyn Gecker", "Cheyanne Mumphrey"]}, {"Title": "Man Accused Of Boulder, Colorado, Firebombing Charged With 118 Criminal Counts", "Link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-boulder-attack_n_68420f3de4b04e411be656d2", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 17:49:09 -0400", "Summary": "Mohamed Soliman, 45, is accused of yelling \u201cFree Palestine\u201d and throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.", "Content": "BOULDER, Colo.

(AP) \u2014 A Massachusetts high school student who was arrested by immigration agents on his way to volleyball practice has been released from custody after a judge granted him bond Thursday.\nMarcelo Gomes da Silva, 18, who came to the U.S. from Brazil at age 7, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday. Authorities have said the agents were looking for the Milford High School teenager\u2019s father, who owns the car Gomes da Silva was driving at the time and had parked in a friend\u2019s driveway.\nSpeaking with members of the media outside the detention center shortly after his release on $2,000 bond, Gomes da Silva described \u201chumiliating\u201d conditions and said his faith helped him through his six days of detention.\nOn his wrist, he wore a bracelet made from the thin sheet of metallic blanket he was given to sleep on the cement floor.\n\u201cI\u2019ll always remember this place,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll always remember how it was.\u201d\nHis lawyer, Robin Nice, told reporters after the hearing in Chelmsford that his arrest \u201cshouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place. This is all a waste.\u201d\n\u201cWe disrupted a kid\u2019s life. We just disrupted a community\u2019s life,\u201d Nice said. \u201cThese kids should be celebrating graduation and prom, I assume? They should be doing kid stuff, and it is a travesty and a waste of our judicial process to have to go through this.\u201d\nShe said Gomes da Silva was confined to a room holding 25 to 35 men, many twice his age, most of the time he was detained, with no windows, time outside, privacy to use the restroom or permission to shower. Nice said that at one point Gomes da Silva, who is active in his local church, asked for a Bible and was denied.\nGomes da Silva, who said his father taught him to \u201cput other people first,\u201d said many of the men imprisoned with him didn\u2019t speak English and didn\u2019t understand why they were there. He had to inform some of them they were being deported, and then watched them break down in tears.\n\u201cI told every single inmate down there: When I\u2019m out, if I\u2019m the only one who was able to leave that place, I lost,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to do whatever I can to get them as much help as possible. If they have to be deported, so be it. But in the right way, in the right conditions. Because no one down there is treated good.\u201d\nHe said some days, he was given only crackers to eat, which he shared with cellmates. His first stop after being released was for McDonald\u2019s chicken nuggets and french fries.\nNot ICE\u2019s target, but detained anyway\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said earlier this week ICE officers were targeting a \u201cknown public safety threat\u201d and Gomes da Silva\u2019s father \u201chas a habit of reckless driving at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour through residential areas.\u201d\n\u201cWhile ICE officers never intended to apprehend Gomes da Silva, he was found to be in the United States illegally and subject to removal proceedings, so officers made the arrest,\u201d she said in a statement.\nActing ICE Director Todd Lyons said Monday that \u201clike any local law enforcement officer, if you encounter someone that has a warrant or \u2026 he\u2019s here illegally, we will take action on it.\u201d\nUpon his release, Gomes da Silva pushed back on ICE\u2019s characterizations of his father: \u201cEverything I got was from my dad. He\u2019s a good person. He never did anything wrong.\u201d\nWhen he was able to call his parents during his detainment, Gomes da Silva said his father sobbed and told him the family was scared to leave the house.\nGomes da Silva initially entered the country on a visitor visa and was later issued a student visa that has since lapsed, Nice said. He told reporters he didn\u2019t know his immigration status until he was arrested.\nHe said an officer asked him, \u201cDo you know why you were arrested?\u201d He said no.\n\u201cI told her, ma\u2019am, I was 7 years old. I don\u2019t know nothing about that stuff,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how it works.\u201d\nNice described him as deeply rooted in his community and a dedicated member of both the school marching band and a band at his church.\nThe immigration judge set a placeholder hearing date for a couple of weeks from Thursday, but it might take place months from that, Nice said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that he\u2019ll have a future in the United States,\u201d she said.\nA shaken community\n\u201cI love my son. We need Marcelo back home. It\u2019s no family without him,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Paulo Gomes Pereira said in a video released Wednesday. \u201cWe love America. Please, bring my son back.\u201d\nThe video showed the family in the teen\u2019s bedroom. Gomes da Silva\u2019s sister describes enjoying watching movies with her brother and the food he cooks for her: \u201cI miss everything about him.\u201d\nStudents at Milford High staged a walkout Monday to protest his detainment. Other supporters packed the stands of the high school gymnasium Tuesday night, when the volleyball team dedicated a match to their missing teammate.\nAmani Jack, a recent Milford High graduate, said her classmate\u2019s absence loomed large over the graduation ceremony, where he was supposed to play in the band. She said if she had a chance to speak with the president, she\u2019d ask him to \u201cput yourself in our shoes.\u201d\n\u201cHe did say he was going to deport criminals,\u201d she said. \u201cMarcelo is not a criminal.

We\u2019re just trying to graduate high school.\u201d\nVeronica Hernandez, a family advocate from Medford who said she works in a largely Hispanic community where ICE has had an active presence, said cases like Gomes da Silva\u2019s show immigration enforcement is serious about taking \u201canybody\u201d without legal status, not just those accused of crimes.\n\u201cI think seeing that something so simple as a child driving themselves and their friends to volleyball practice at risk struck a chord,\u201d she said.\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Kathy McCormack in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed to this story.", "Source": "Huffington Post", "Keyword": ["department of homeland security", "legal status", "student visa", "visa"], "Entities": ["CHELMSFORD", "Mass.", "AP", "Massachusetts", "Marcelo Gomes da Silva", "U.S.", "Brazil", "U.S. Immigration", "Customs Enforcement", "the Milford High School", "Gomes da Silva", "2,000", "Gomes da Silva", "Robin Nice", "Chelmsford", "Gomes da Silva", "Gomes da Silva", "Gomes da Silva", "McDonald\u2019s", "U.S. Department of Homeland Security", "Tricia McLaughlin", "Gomes da Silva", "Gomes da Silva", "the United States", "Todd Lyons", "Gomes da Silva", "Gomes da Silva", "Gomes da Silva", "Nice", "Nice", "the United States", "Marcelo", "Jo\u00e3o Paulo Gomes Pereira", "America", "Gomes da Silva\u2019s", "Amani Jack", "Milford", "Marcelo", "Veronica Hernandez", "Medford", "ICE", "Gomes da Silva\u2019s", "Associated Press", "Kathy McCormack", "Concord", "New Hampshire"]}, {"Title": "Christiane Amanpour Now Treats Travel To U.S. 'As If I Was Going To North Korea'", "Link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/christiane-amanpour-now-treats-travel-to-us-as-if-i-was-going-to-north-korea_n_6841af4ee4b084373e24f998", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 12:27:31 -0400", "Summary": "\"I literally prepared to go to America as if I was going to North Korea,\" the British-born journalist said. \"I took a burner phone.

Ames, who is straight, alleged that she had been discriminated against by gay superiors.\nAmes started working at the agency that oversees juvenile corrections in 2004 and, after a decade, she had moved up the ranks from the role of an executive secretary to program administrator. When a bureau chief position opened up at the department in 2019, she applied.\nJust a year earlier, Ames underwent a performance evaluation by her boss, a gay woman. Her boss found Ames mostly met expectations but rarely exceeded them. According to court records, there were concerns that Ames lacked the \u201cvision\u201d and leadership skills required for the bureau chief role.\nAmes was passed over for the promotion and then demoted to another role that paid less than she had previously been earning. According to Ames, this wasn\u2019t due to her performance but because she was straight. The agency said it passed on Ames because of concerns over her leadership abilities and that, historically, she had been \u201cabrasive and not collaborative\u201d though her work ethic was considered strong.\nWhen she sued for discrimination based on her sexual orientation, Ames noted that the person who evaluated her was gay and so was the person who got the promotion she had applied for. The individual who actually made the hiring decision for that position, however, was straight.\nInitially, a federal district court in Ohio tossed Ames\u2019 lawsuit, finding she had failed to prove there was a pattern of discrimination by gay people at the department against straight people.\nAs a heterosexual, the courts consider Ames part of a majority group, as opposed to people who are part of a protected class. Protected classes cover a person\u2019s sex, sexual orientation, age, ancestry, color, religion and more. But for a person in the majority to successfully sue for discrimination, some courts \u2014 not all \u2014 require evidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d to support their claim.\nBackground circumstances must show that the person or people outside the majority are engaged in an unusual pattern of discrimination against the majority. Ames never proved that pattern, according to the district court, and when she appealed, judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit didn\u2019t think she had proved it either. (Currently, only a handful of circuits require background circumstances, including the 6th Circuit; others, like the uber-conservative 5th Circuit, don\u2019t apply the standard at all. And notably, the background circumstances rule has also been rejected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission itself, the very body that oversees enforcement of laws that make discrimination illegal.)\nWhen Ames\u2019 lawyers came to the Supreme Court in February and asked the high court to reverse the 6th Circuit\u2019s decisions, the justices seemed to signal how they would rule, as they asked questions about the fairness of requiring more burden of proof for one group of people versus another when they are suing for discrimination.\n\u201cFor most plaintiffs,\u201d Justice Jackson wrote, the initial steps they must take to provide a burden of proof \u201cis not onerous.\u201d\n\u201cA plaintiff may satisfy it simply by presenting evidence \u2018that she applied for an available position for which she was qualified, but was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.\u2019 But, under Sixth Circuit precedent, plaintiffs who are members of a majority group bear an additional burden at step one: They must also establish \u2018background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.\u2019\u201d\nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule, the justice added, can\u2019t \u201cbe squared with the text of Title VII or our longstanding precedents.\u201d\n\u201cAnd nothing Ohio has said, in its brief or at oral argument, persuades us otherwise,\u201d she wrote.\nIn the concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said the \u201cbackground circumstances rule also highlights how judge-made doctrines can be difficult for courts to apply.\u201d\n\u201cBecause courts lack an underlying legal authority on which to ground their analysis, there is no principled way to resolve doctrinal ambiguities. The \u2018background circumstances\u2019 rule suffers from this flaw. A number of courts have described the rule as \u2018vague and ill-defined,\u2019\u201d he wrote, citing a series of rulings in reverse discrimination from years past. \u201cMost notably, the \u2018background circumstances\u2019 rule requires courts to perform the difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 task of deciding whether a particular plaintiff qualifies as a member of the so-called \u2018majority.\u2019\u201d\nThomas continued: \u201cHow a court defines the boundaries of a population can affect whether a particular person falls into a majority or minority group. Women, for example, make up the majority in the United States as a whole, but not in some States and counties.\u201d\nWhen trying to define the majority in terms of race, it becomes \u201ceven more difficult,\u201d Thomas wrote, noting the growth of \u201cmulticultural families\u201d throughout the U.S.\nAttempts to \u201cdivide us all up into a handful of groups have only become more incoherent with time,\u201d Thomas wrote, quoting directly from Justice Neil Gorsuch in the 2023 decision for Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v.

(is) unconstitutional and invalid.\u201d\n\u201cEnding this discriminatory and un-American provision is a major victory for Texas,\u201d Paxton said.\nTexas was the first state to pass a law allowing \u201cDreamers,\u201d or young adults without legal status, to be eligible for in-state tuition if they meet certain residency criteria.\nAnd while two dozen states now have similar laws, the Trump administration filed the lawsuit in conservative Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and state lawmakers have long sought to support the president\u2019s hard-line goals on the border.\nThe lawsuit and ruling also come just two days after the end of the state legislative session, during which a repeal bill pushed by group of Republicans was considered but ultimately did not come up for a vote.\nThe lawsuit leaned heavily into recent executive orders signed by Trump designed to stop any state or local laws or regulations the administration feels discriminate against legal residents.\n\u201cUnder federal law, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said. \u201cThe Justice Department will relentlessly fight to vindicate federal law and ensure that U.S. citizens are not treated like second-class citizens anywhere in the country.\u201d\nTexas has about 57,000 undocumented students enrolled in its public universities and colleges, according to the Presidents\u2019 Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a nonpartisan nonprofit group of university leaders focused on immigration policy. The state has about 690,000 students overall at its public universities.\nAbbott did not immediately comment on the ruling.\nThe lawsuit was filed in the Wichita Falls division of the Northern District of Texas, where Paxton and conservative litigants have often challenged the federal government and issues such as health care and gay and transgender rights.\nThe Texas tuition policy was initially passed by sweeping majorities in the state Legislature and signed into law by then-Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, as a way to open access to higher education for students without legal residency already living in the state. Supporters then and now say it boosts the state\u2019s economy by creating a better educated and better prepared work force.\n\u201cTargeted attacks on Texas students who are seeking an affordable college education, led by the Trump administration, won\u2019t help anyone, they only hurt us all,\u201d said Luis Figueroa of Every Texan, a left-leaning public policy group.\nThe difference in tuition rates is substantial. For example, at the flagship University of Texas at Austin, a state resident paid about $11,000 for the 2024-2025 academic year compared with about $41,000 for students from outside of Texas. Other expenses for housing, supplies and transportation can add nearly $20,000 more, according to school estimates.\nThe law allowed for students without legal resident status to qualify for in-state tuition if they have lived in the state for three years before graduating from high school, and for a year before enrolling in college. They must also sign an affidavit promising to apply for legal resident status as soon as possible.\nBut the policy soon came under fire as debates over illegal immigration intensified, and critics called it unfair to legal residents. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, Perry ended up apologizing after saying critics of the law \u201cdid not have a heart.\u201d\nLegislative efforts to repeal the Texas law have repeatedly failed, but have started to gain traction elsewhere. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed a bill this year that will repeal that state\u2019s in-state tuition law in July.\n\u201cEnding Texas\u2019s in-state tuition policy is a direct attack on the educational aspirations of thousands of students who have grown up in our communities and call Texas home,\u201d said Judith Cruz, Assistant Director for the Houston Region for EdTrust in Texas, which advocates for education access for minority and low-income students.", "Source": "Huffington Post", "Keyword": ["executive order", "executive order", "lawsuit", "legal status", "legislature"], "Entities": ["AUSTIN", "Texas", "AP", "Texas", "Trump", "the Justice Department", "Texas", "Ken Paxton", "U.S.", "Reed O\u2019Connor", "the United States", "Texas", "Paxton", "Texas", "Trump", "Texas", "Greg Abbott", "Trump", "U.S.", "U.S.", "Pam Bondi", "The Justice Department", "U.S.", "Texas", "the Presidents\u2019 Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration", "Abbott", "Wichita Falls", "Texas", "Paxton", "Texas", "Legislature", "Rick Perry", "Texas", "Trump", "Luis Figueroa", "University of Texas", "Austin", "about $11,000", "about $41,000", "Texas", "nearly $20,000", "Perry", "Texas", "Florida", "Ron DeSantis", "Texas", "Judith Cruz", "the Houston Region", "Texas"]}, {"Title": "MyPillow Guy Mike Lindell Is Already In Trouble With The Judge As His Trial Begins", "Link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mypillow-guy-mike-lindell-is-already-in-trouble-with-the-judge-as-his-trial-begins_n_6840db7de4b00b2e94c5822d", "Published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 22:42:40 -0400", "Summary": "Plaintiff's attorneys argued Lindell violated a court order by posting online and participating in interviews about the proceedings.", "Content": "MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell on Tuesday violated court orders not to discuss proceedings amid his defamation trial, prompting the judge to warn him against further violations.\nFormer Dominion Voting Systems employee Dr. Eric Coomer is suing Lindell, a vocal ally of President Donald Trump, for defamation over Lindell\u2019s baseless 2020 election conspiracy theories.

Although they\u2019ve been used in the White House for decades, Trump claims that Biden\u2019s aides were usurping presidential authority.\nBiden issued pardons for his two brothers and his sister shortly before leaving office, hoping to shield them from potential prosecution under Trump, who had promised retribution during last year\u2019s campaign. Other pardon recipients included members of a congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\nTrump often suggests that his political opponents should be investigated, and he has directed the Justice Department to look into people who have angered him over the years. They include Chris Krebs, a former cybersecurity official who disputed Trump\u2019s claims of a stolen election in 2020, and Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who wrote an anonymous op-ed sharply critical of the president in 2018.\nMeanwhile, House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky, a Republican, requested transcribed interviews with five Biden aides, alleging they had participated in a \u201ccover-up\u201d that amounted to \u201cone of the greatest scandals in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\u201cThese five former senior advisors were eyewitnesses to President Biden\u2019s condition and operations within the Biden White House,\u201d Comer said in a statement. \u201cThey must appear before the House Oversight Committee and provide truthful answers about President Biden\u2019s cognitive state and who was calling the shots.\u201d\nInterviews were requested with White House senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn, former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, former deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti, a former counselor to the president.\nComer reiterated his call for Biden\u2019s physician, Kevin O\u2019Connor, and former senior White House aides Annie Tomasini, Anthony Bernal, Ashley Williams and Neera Tanden to appear before the committee. He warned subpoenas would be issued this week if they refuse to schedule voluntary interviews.\n\u201cI think that people will start coming in the next two weeks,\u201d Comer told reporters. He added that the committee would release a report with its findings, \u201cand we\u2019ll release the transcribed interviews, so it\u2019ll be very transparent.\u201d\nDemocrats have dismissed the effort as a distraction.\n\u201cChairman Comer had his big shot in the last Congress to impeach Joe Biden and it was, of course, a spectacular flop,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who served as the ranking member on the oversight committee in the previous Congress. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s just living off of a spent dream. It\u2019s over. And he should give up the whole thing.\u201d\nRepublicans on the committee are eager to pursue the investigation.\n\u201cThe American people didn\u2019t elect a bureaucracy to run the country,\u201d said Rep. Brandon Gill, a freshman Republican from Texas. \u201cI think that the American people deserve to know the truth and they want to know the truth of what happened.\u201d\nThe Republican inquiry so far has focused on the final executive actions of Biden\u2019s administration, which included the issuing of new federal rules and presidential pardons that they claim may be invalid.\nComer cited the book \u201cOriginal Sin\u201d by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Axios\u2019 Alex Thompson, which details concerns and debates inside the White House and Democratic Party over Biden\u2019s mental state and age.\nIn the book, Tapper and Thompson wrote, \u201cFive people were running the country, and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board.\u201d\nBiden and members of his family have vigorously denied the book\u2019s claims.\n\u201cThis book is political fairy smut for the permanent, professional chattering class,\u201d said Naomi Biden, the former president\u2019s granddaughter.", "Source": "Huffington Post", "Keyword": ["executive order", "oversight", "department of homeland security", "executive order"], "Entities": ["WASHINGTON", "AP", "Donald Trump", "Joe Biden\u2019s", "Trump", "Biden", "Biden", "The Justice Department", "Trump", "Biden", "the U.S. Constitution", "Trump", "Biden", "Pam Bondi", "White House", "David Warrington", "Trump", "Biden", "Trump", "Biden", "the White House", "Trump", "Biden", "Biden", "Trump", "U.S.", "the Justice Department", "Chris Krebs", "Trump", "Miles Taylor", "Department of Homeland Security", "House", "James Comer", "Kentucky", "Biden", "Biden", "Biden White House", "the House Oversight Committee", "Biden", "Interviews", "White House", "Mike Donilon", "Anita Dunn", "White House", "Ron Klain", "Bruce Reed", "Steve Ricchetti", "Biden", "Kevin O\u2019Connor", "White House", "Annie Tomasini", "Anthony Bernal", "Ashley Williams", "Neera Tanden", "Congress", "Joe Biden", "Jamie Raskin", "Maryland", "Congress", "Brandon Gill", "Texas", "Biden\u2019s", "CNN", "Jake Tapper", "Alex Thompson", "the White House", "Democratic Party", "Biden", "Tapper", "Thompson", "Joe Biden", "Biden", "Naomi Biden"]}, {"Title": "Neighbors Band Together To \u2018Shame\u2019 ICE Agents Out Of Their Community", "Link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/neighbors-band-together-to-shame-ice-agents-out-of-their-community-and-its-powerful_n_68406078e4b09bb4b588f19b", "Published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 17:44:46 -0400", "Summary": "Heavily armed ICE agents raided two restaurants in San Diego Friday, but residents fought back despite the deployment of flash-bang grenades.", "Content": "A powerful video circulating on social media is reminding some that \u201cthere are more of us than there are of them.\u201d\nThe video features residents in the San Diego, California neighborhood of South Park standing up to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents donned full tactical gear and were armed with assault rifles.\n\u201cShame, shame, shame!\u201d the residents chant as they pump their fists into the air and the agents back away.\nAlthough the video is currently still on some platforms, it has been removed on X and TikTok.

Locals responded to the terrifying scene by protesting, calling federal agents \u201cNazis\u201d and \u201cfascists.\u201d\nEventually, agents used flash-bang grenades to get away, at least according to what Yasmeen Pitts O\u2019Keefe, a spokesperson for HSI, a branch within ICE, told the Times.\n\u201cThe demonstrators became unruly and as a result less lethal noise flash diversionary devices were deployed to allow law enforcement to exit the scene as safely as possible,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said. \u201cWhen gatherings like these are formed, it not only places law enforcement in danger but also the demonstrators and onlookers attempting to impede law enforcement activity.\u201d\nO\u2019Keefe also told the Times that four people living in the country illegally were taken into custody.\nRenato Ametrano, the general manager of Buona Forchetta in South Park, told local news station KSWB/KUSI that ICE agents arrived at 4 p.m. before his restaurant opened and put all 15 workers in handcuffs \u2014 including himself \u2014 before releasing most of them.\n\u201cIt was very, very uncomfortable.

(AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the government to immediately halt deportation proceedings against the family of a man charged in the firebombing attack in Boulder, Colorado, to ensure the protection of the family\u2019s constitutional rights.\nU.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher granted a request from the wife and five children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who are Egyptian, to block their deportation. U.S. immigration officials took the family into custody Tuesday.\nSoliman, 45, has been charged with a federal hate crime and state counts of attempted murder in the attack in downtown Boulder on Sunday. Witnesses say he threw two Molotov cocktails at a group demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, and he confessed to the attack in custody.\nHis family members have not been charged.\nFederal authorities have said Soliman has been living in the U.S. illegally, and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said earlier Wednesday that the family was being processed for removal. It\u2019s rare that a criminal suspect\u2019s family members are detained and threatened with deportation.\n\u201cIt is patently unlawful to punish individuals for the crimes of their relatives,\u201d attorneys for the family wrote in the lawsuit.\nEric Lee, one of the attorney\u2019s representing the family, said efforts to deport them should not happen in a democracy.\n\u201cThe punishment of a four-year-old child for something their parent allegedly did, who also has a presumption of innocence, is something that should outrage Americans regardless of their citizenship status,\u201d he said.\nA spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Colorado referred requests for comment to an email account for the Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond.\nWitnesses describe attack at vigil\nAround 200 people squeezed into the local Jewish Community Center Wednesday evening for a vigil that featured prayer, songs and emotional testimony from a victim and witnesses to the attack.\nRachelle Halpern, who has been walking with the group since 2023, said she remembers thinking it was strange to see a man with a canister looking like he was going to spray pesticide on the grass. Then she heard a crash and screams and saw flames around her feet.\n\u201cA woman stood one foot behind me, engulfed in flames from head to toe, lying on the ground with her husband,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople immediately, three or four men immediately rushed to her to smother the flames.\u201d\nHer description prompted murmurs from the audience members. One woman\u2019s head dropped into her hands.\nDefendant\u2019s family investigated\nSoliman\u2019s wife, Hayam El Gamal, a 17-year-old daughter, two minor sons and two minor daughters all are Egyptian citizens, according to El Gamal\u2019s lawsuit. They were being held at an immigration detention center in Texas, Lee said.\n\u201cWe are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it,\u201d Noem said in a statement.\nNoem also said federal authorities would immediately crack down on people who overstay their visas, following the Boulder attack.\nSoliman told authorities that no one, including his family, knew about his planned attack, according to court documents. El Gamal said she was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn her husband had been arrested in the attack, according to her lawsuit.\nVictims increase to 15 people and a dog\nEarlier Wednesday, authorities raised the number of people injured in the attack from 12 to 15, plus a dog.\nBoulder County officials said in a news release that the victims include eight women and seven men ranging in age from 25 to 88. Details about how the victims were impacted would be explained in criminal charges set to be filed Thursday, according to Boulder County District Attorney\u2019s office spokesperson Shannon Carbone.\nSoliman had planned to kill all of the roughly 20 participants in Sunday\u2019s demonstration at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, but he threw just two of his 18 Molotov cocktails while yelling \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d police said. Soliman didn\u2019t carry out his full plan \u201cbecause he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,\u201d police wrote in an affidavit.\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, Soliman told police he was driven by a desire \u201cto kill all Zionist people\u201d \u2014 a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel. Authorities said he expressed no remorse about the attack.\nThe family\u2019s immigration status\nBefore moving to Colorado Springs three years ago, Soliman spent 17 years in Kuwait, according to court documents.\nSoliman arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. She said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that has also expired.\nHundreds of thousands of people overstay their visas each year in the United States, according to Department of Homeland Security reports.\nSoliman\u2019s wife was born in Saudi Arabia and is an Egyptian national, according to her lawsuit. She is a network engineer and has a pending EB-2 visa, which is available to professionals with advanced degrees, the suit said. She and her children all are listed as dependents on Soliman\u2019s asylum application.\nThe case against Soliman\nSoliman told authorities that he had been planning the attack for a year, the affidavit said.\nSoliman is being held in a county jail on a $10 million cash bond and is scheduled to make an appearance in state court on Thursday. His attorney, Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after a state court hearing Monday. Public defenders\u2019 policy prohibits speaking to the media.\nThe attack unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. It happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.\n___\nThis story has been updated to correct the age of the defendant\u2019s oldest daughter to 17, not 18, according to attorneys for the family.\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Eric Tucker in Washington, Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri, Samy Magdy in Cairo, Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City, Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City and Hallie Golden in Seattle contributed to this report.", "Source": "Huffington Post", "Keyword": ["federal authorities", "department of homeland security", "deportation", "lawsuit", "visa"], "Entities": ["BOULDER", "Colo.", "AP", "Boulder", "Colorado", "U.S.", "Gordon P.

The two IPOs come after a multiyear drought for healthcare public market debuts.\nAnd so far, Omada's IPO hasn't disappointed. While the chronic care company priced its initial shares at $19, its stock opened at $23 a share and jumped as high as $28.40 Friday morning, nearly a 50% increase.\nOmada Health launched in 2011 to provide virtual care for prediabetes, making its name in the years following for diabetes management.\nIn recent years, its business has surged in new areas beyond diabetes care. Omada's weight care business has boomed as more patients taking GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic for weight loss seek companion care. The San Francisco-based company says most of its new employer and health plan clients approach Omada initially, interested in its metabolic health track.\nOmada's initial valuation of $1.1 billion is roughly where it was privately valued. Omada's last private fundraise, a $192 million Series E round announced in February 2022, put Omada's valuation over $1 billion.\nIt's perhaps the best outcome Omada's investors could've hoped for, given that many digital health startups now looking to IPO last raised at huge valuations during VC's ZIRP period. Those valuations could be difficult to realize in today's market. Hinge Health, for example, went public at a $2.6 billion valuation after being valued in its 2021 fundraise at $6.2 billion.\nWe don't know what Omada Health's investors paid for their shares, so we can't calculate their profit. However, since Omada's shares opened on the stock market at $23, we used that price to determine the worth of its investors' stakes. None of Omada's major investors sold any shares in its IPO.\nHere's what the stakes of Omada Health's major investors and executives are worth after its IPO.\nRevelation Partners, an investor: $120 million\nRevelation Partners is a healthcare-focused investment firm that says it provides flexible capital to companies, especially to give liquidity to startups.\nThe firm first invested in Omada in September 2019, according to its website. Revelation Partners told Business Insider in an email that the firm invested in Omada through a series of secondary transactions. Omada hasn't mentioned Revelation Partners in previous press releases about its fundraises.\nRevelation Partners owns about 5.2 million shares, or 9.3% of the company. At the $23 market debut price, the firm's stake is worth about $120 million.\nUS Venture Partners, an investor: $108.5 million\nSan Francisco-based US Venture Partners makes early-stage investments across healthcare, software, consumer, and security. The firm says it's invested $4.5 billion across 532 companies.\nUSVP led Omada Health's $4.7 million Series A fundraise in 2013. The firm contributed additional financing in Omada's Series B through D rounds.\nGeneral partner Dr. Jonathan Root has served on Omada's board of directors since the firm's 2013 investment.\nUSVP owns about 4.72 million shares, or 8.5% of Omada Health. At the $23 market debut price, the firm's stake is worth about $108.5 million.\nAndreessen Horowitz, an investor: $106 million\nVC giant Andreessen Horowitz, or A16z, first invested in Omada Health in 2015, when the firm led Omada's $23 million Series B.\nThe firm went on to invest in Omada's Series C and D fundraises, per PitchBook.\nAt the time of A16z's 2015 investment, former general partner Balaji Srinivasan joined Omada's board of directors. It's unclear when he stepped down from the board; he moved into a part-time role at A16z that same year.\nA16z owns about 4.6 million shares, or 8.3% of the company. At the $23 market debut price, the firm's stake is worth about $106 million.\nFidelity Management and Research Company, an investor: $102 million\nFidelity Management and Research Company is the parent company of financial services giant Fidelity Investments. Fidelity has invested in a handful of healthcare startups over the years, leading rounds like now-public insurtech Oscar Health's $400 million raise in 2016 and smart ring maker Oura's $200 million Series D in December.\nFMR led Omada's $192 million Series E fundraise in February 2022.\nFidelity owns about 4.4 million shares, or 8.0% of the company.

Omada Health was one of the firm's first bets.\nCigna began working with the diabetes company in 2015.

Williams will serve as co-chair of both the firm's Litigation Department and its Investigations, Compliance, and Defense Practice.\nThe high-profile defection is a blow for Paul Weiss, an elite law firm that was the first to broker an agreement with President Donald Trump in March. As part of the deal, Paul Weiss said it would devote $40 million in pro bono hours toward Trump's political priorities. After it was announced, Trump rescinded an executive order that would have, among other sanctions, stripped Paul Weiss employees of security clearances and cut off government contracts.\nEight other firms have since made similar deals with the White House. Four \u2014 including Jenner & Block \u2014 opted to sue instead. All four have won court rulings blocking Trump's orders.\n\"Jenner & Block fearlessly advocates for its clients and provides outstanding strategic counsel through their most difficult challenges,\" Williams said in a press release. \"I've seen firsthand how this firm expertly tackles the toughest cases and lives its values.\"\n\"I'm excited to join a team with an extraordinary depth of legal talent that doesn't shy away from hard fights \u2014 and delivers results that matter,\" his statement continued.\nWilliams isn't the only notable attorney to leave Paul Weiss in recent weeks.

It also put new technologies to the test.\n\"You have to control the air, the water, and the land all at once and come ashore with an inherent disadvantage,\" says National WWII Museum curator Cory Graff about Operation Overlord.\" To do so successfully meant deploying not only manpower, but also a host of pioneering technologies and inventions \u2014 many of them American-made \u2014 from specialized landing craft to underwater breathing equipment to amphibious trucks.\n\"This idea of combined arms integration requires military formations to do three things: shoot, move, and communicate,\" adds John Curatola, senior historian at the National WWII Museum. The Normandy invasion required the US Army, Navy, and Army Air Force to collaborate in a unified manner for a singular objective, while also working with counterparts for the cross-Channel invasion, he says.\nThese are some of the inventions that helped Allied troops win D-Day, all of which have evolved into systems still in use today.\nM4 Sherman\nThe M4 Sherman was the backbone of the Allied armored force during World War II. Weighing roughly 40 tons, it was fast, reliable, and built by the thousands.\nSherman tanks proved key in helping the Allies break through German defenses at Utah and Omaha Beaches. Some were equipped with a bulldozer blade on the front that could cut through the defenses on the beach \u2014 and that would later function as hedgecutters used to break through wall-like hedges throughout Normandy.\nOther Shermans were converted into Duplex Drive (DD) tanks \u2014 an amphibious design pioneered by the British. Outfitted with canvas flotation skirts and rear-mounted propellers, the DDs were meant to hit the beach alongside the first wave of infantry. While rough seas and weather doomed many off Omaha, those that made it ashore at Utah and Gold Beaches delivered crucial early support.\n\"Everybody thinks the Germans had the coolest tanks, and I categorically reject that,\" says Curatola. \"The Shermans are relatively easy to maintain. The crews can fix them. They're relatively reliable with simple parts, and you're basically overwhelming the Germans with armor.\"\nInvented by: Developed by the U.S. Army Ordnance Department in 1941 and mass-produced by automakers including Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. The US manufactured 50,000 throughout the war.\nModern connection: While the Sherman was retired from combat decades ago, its simple, rugged design shaped post-war tank development and reinforced the importance of armored vehicles. Curatola considers the M1 Abrams tank that the US Army uses today the \"grandson\" of the Sherman.\n'Walkie Talkie'\nNicknamed the \"Walkie-Talkie,\" the Signal Corps Radio 300 was the first backpack radio for mobile infantry communication \u2014 and one of many radio varieties used on D-Day. Initially issued to US infantry in 1943, a soldier carried the nearly 40-pound SCR-300 transmitter and receiver on their back. With a three-mile range and 41 channels, the SCR-300 came in handy for real-time battalion-level communication during the highly chaotic, noisy beach landings\nInvented by: Engineer Daniel E. Noble and his project team at Galvin Manufacturing Corporation. Originally founded by brothers Paul and Joseph Galvin pre-war to develop early car radios, Galvin became Motorola in 1947. Galvin engineers also developed a handheld, single-channel AM radio \u2014 the SCR-536, or \"Handie-Talkie\" \u2014 for battlefield communication at the platoon or company level.\nModern connection: The SCR-300's pioneering use of frequency modulation (or \"FM\") technology paved the foundation for future portable communication devices, including cell phones.\nHiggins boats\nThe Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel was a 36-foot landing craft made famous in the opening scene of the 1998 film, \"Saving Private Ryan.\" Known as Higgins boats for its American inventor, 1,000 LCVPs were used to deliver troops across all five beaches during the Normandy landings, which marked the single largest deployment of LCVPs. Without these shallow-bottomed boats, landing directly on the open beaches with armor and troops would've been logistically impossible.\nInvented by: New-Orleans-based shipbuilder and entrepreneur Andrew Higgins of Higgins Industries. He is said to have borrowed the front ramp idea from Japanese boats after seeing photos from the Sino-Japanese War. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower called Higgins \"the man who won the war for us.\"\nModern connection: The front-ramp design has continued to inspire modern amphibious landing craft, including the US Navy's Landing Craft Air Cushion and Landing Craft Utility.\nLanding ship, tank\nThe LST was a large cargo vessel used to land troops and armored vehicles without docking to a pier. Its large bow doors were designed to open to a ramp that let tanks and trucks drive directly from the ship to land. \"To liberate continents, you need bulk. You need throughput\u2026so you can do operations inland. And the LST allowed the Allies to do that without a fixed port,\" Curatola says.\nInvented by: The LST was designed by American naval architect John C. Niedermair in response to Prime Minister Winston Churchill's request for a ship that would carry some 500 tons worth of tanks following the Dunkirk evacuation.\nModern connection: In a matter of hours, Niedermair sketched the design for a ship regarded as one of the most successful in the history of the US Navy.\nThe DUKW amphibious truck\nThe DUKW (pronounced \"duck\") was a 6-wheel-drive amphibious truck capable of transporting about 5,000 pounds of cargo (or 24 troops) on land and water; a propeller could chug it through water with a max speed of 6 mph. \"The beauty of this thing is, not only is it amphibious, but it can drive inland and provide supplies to troops well beyond the beach at up to 50 miles an hour,\" says Curatola.\nInvented by: The DUKW was a product of collaborations among GMC, the naval architecture firm Sparkman & Stephens, and a Michigan-based bus manufacturer.\nModern connection: The DUKW pioneered a feature that allowed drivers to change the tire pressure from inside the cab to accommodate different terrains, which remains a common feature on military vehicles today.\nDouglas C-47 transport\nThe C-47 Dakota, nicknamed \"the workhorse,\" had many uses in both World War II theaters, from cargo and troop transportation to casualty evacuation and towing. More than 800 C-47s were used in the D-Day campaign to insert thousands of paratroopers and huge amounts of equipment behind enemy lines.\nInvented by: Douglas Aircraft Company adapted its pre-war commercial airliner, the DC-3, for military use. It was relatively quiet and could carry up to 28 troops or 6,000 pounds of cargo. The US produced more than 10,000 C-47s.\nModern connection: Valued for its versatility, the C-47 was used in the Vietnam War. Variants are still in use for civilian cargo transport.\nA rebreather for divers\nThe Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit was a closed-circuit rebreather designed to recycle exhaled air by removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen. The apparatus enabled divers to operate underwater for prolonged periods without leaving a trail of bubbles. Lambertsen, working for the Office of Strategic Services, trained OSS commandos to use the LARU for underwater reconnaissance and demolition missions in support of D-Day and other key landings.\nInvented by: Christian Lambertsen, who, as a University of Pennsylvania medical student in the early 1940s, designed the LARU as a self-contained breathing device ideal for covert underwater missions.\nModern connection: Lambertsen himself coined the acronym \"SCUBA\" (Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus). His equipment and techniques paved the way for rebreathing technologies still used by military divers, including Navy SEALs. He's considered \"the father of US Combat Diving.\"\nDummy paratroopers\nThese burlap, straw-stuffed mannequins were relatively small, lightweight decoys that could be dropped from planes to give the illusion of incoming paratroopers. A form of psychological warfare, the dolls were used to confuse and mislead the enemy. Dummies were sometimes equipped with noisemakers that sounded like gunfire or explosive charges that detonated on landing, adding to the illusion.\nOn the night of June 5, 1944, Allied planes dropped hundreds of these fake paratroopers, along with inflatable tanks, across the French countryside to give off the impression of airborne troops landing in areas far from the real drop zones. In several cases, German units responded to these fake drops.\nInvented by: Inspired by the British \"Rupert\" paradummy, the American version, nicknamed \"Oscar,\" was more compact, with the 3-foot-tall ones used on D-Day mainly manufactured in the UK.\nModern connection: While today's military decoys are generally more technologically advanced (e.g., electronic signature emitters), the principle of deception through false targets and diversionary tactics remains.\nProximity fuze\nThe proximity fuze \u2014 an electronic fuze for bombs, shells, or missiles that explodes when approaching a target \u2014 changed the rules of artillery in warfare; instead of needing a direct hit, anti-aircraft shells could suddenly detonate when they got close. They made Allied anti-aircraft fire far more effective in taking out German planes, helping protect the beachhead.\nInvented by: Developed beginning in 1940 by American scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, with critical contributions from British researchers. Key to the design was the miniature radio transmitter and receiver inside the shell that sensed nearby targets and triggered detonation.\nModern connection: The proximity fuze was a major step toward today's precision-guided weapons. Its combination of electronic sensing and remote detonation paved the way for modern guided bombs and missiles.\nThe Jeep\nFrom the moment the first Allied troops hit the beaches of Normandy, this newly introduced American 4x4 was in motion, hauling supplies, ferrying wounded soldiers, towing anti-tank guns, and zipping across shell-scarred roads. Compact, reliable, and endlessly adaptable, it proved essential to the invasion of Normandy, along with many other battles.\nInvented by: In 1940, facing the likelihood of entering the war, the US Army issued an emergency contract for a lightweight reconnaissance vehicle, prompting the development of the first Jeep prototype by Bantam Car Company in just 49 days. With Bantam lacking production capacity, Willys-Overland and Ford were tapped to manufacture the final design, cranking out hundreds of thousands of units over the course of the war. Some Jeeps were waterproofed for the landings, sealed tight and fitted with snorkels to wade ashore behind the infantry. Others were dropped by parachute into French fields with the 101st and 82nd Airborne, ready to drive the moment they hit the ground.\nModern connection: After the war, Willys began selling civilian versions, branding them as Civilian Jeep models and kickstarting America's obsession with off-road vehicles and SUVs.\nKatie S.

Here's where the president has shown up in unsealed records.", "Link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-trump-epstein-files-2025-6", "Published": "2025-06-06T17:00:24Z", "Summary": "The many Jeffrey Epstein-related documents that have already been released do not implicate Donald Trump in any sex-trafficking.", "Content": "- Elon Musk says the \"Epstein files\" haven't been released because Trump is in them.\n- The president's name has cropped up repeatedly in Epstein-related court documents.\n- Trump's name is included in Epstein's contact book and flight records.\nElon Musk has an allegation about why President Donald Trump hasn't released all of the so-called \"Epstein files.\"\nHe's in them.\nMusk's claim, tying the president to the dead financier and sex trafficker, is the latest punch in the escalating beef between the richest man in the world and the president of the United States.\n\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,\" Musk posted on X Thursday afternoon. \"Have a nice day, DJT!\"\n\"Mark this post for the future,\" he added in a follow-up post. \"The truth will come out.\"\nMusk didn't elaborate on his claim or provide evidence that backed up his assertion. House Democrats nonetheless seized on Musk's claim, with two members of the oversight committee demanding a response from Justice Department officials.\nTrump's relationship with Epstein has long been part of the public record. None of that record supports any notion that the president was involved in Epstein's sex trafficking.\nThe two were friends in the 1980s, spending time in the same wealthy social circles in Palm Beach and Manhattan, and Trump's name has repeatedly come up in litigation related to Epstein. The two had a falling-out in the 2000s.\nTrump has previously denied involvement in any wrongdoing related to Epstein. In 2019, following criminal charges against the financier, Trump said he \"wasn't a fan.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that Musk's claims about Trump and Epstein were \"unfortunate.\"\n\"This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.\"\nDuring his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump indicated he supported making government documents related to Epstein public if he were elected.\nIt's not clear exactly what Musk meant by the \"Epstein files.\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have promised to release documents in possession of the Justice Department related to the wealthy pedophile.\nOther agencies that may have Epstein-related documents, like the CIA, have been publicly silent about the matter.\nWe already have a lot of Epstein documents\nBondi and Patel have published one batch of documents, in February.\nAside from a three-page list of evidence seized during a 2019 criminal investigation into Epstein, it included only information that had previously been made public during the criminal case against his associate Ghislaine Maxwell and in other civil litigation.\nAmong those records are a copy of one of Epstein's contact books, which lists Trump and some of Trump's family members among hundreds of entries. The records also include some flight logs for Epstein's private jets; Trump is mentioned as a passenger.\nTrump's Mar-a-Lago club featured prominently in Maxwell's criminal trial. One woman who said Epstein raped her testified that the financier took her to the club when she was 14 years old and introduced her to Trump. Another of Epstein's most prominent accusers, Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, has said she was recruited as a victim by Maxwell while at Mar-a-Lago. A Mar-a-Lago employee briefly testified at Maxwell's criminal trial about Giuffre's father's employment at the club.\nTrump's name has also been included in long-running civil litigation related to Epstein. Documents including Trump's name became public in January 2024, when a federal judge unsealed and unredacted thousands of pages of court documents in a lawsuit that Giuffre brought against Maxwell. The judge had previously referred to Trump with the pseudonym \"Doe 174.\"\nThe lawsuit did not accuse Trump of any wrongdoing. Many of the people whose names were initially kept under seal in the court documents were identified as Epstein's victims or had only an incidental connection to the financier.\nThe documents from that lawsuit include excerpts of a deposition by Johanna Sjoberg, who has accused Epstein of rape. At one point during the deposition, Sjoberg was asked about giving massages to various associates of Epstein at his residences, and she denied giving any to Trump. Asked about a trip to Atlantic City, she described visiting one of Trump's casinos after flying on Epstein's private jet.\n\"Jeffrey said, 'Great, we'll call up Trump, and we'll go to' \u2014 I don't recall the name of the casino, but \u2014 'we'll go to the casino,'\" Sjoberg said in the deposition.\nOther documents mention Trump only in passing, referencing him as one of the many high-profile people who have been friends with Epstein.\nEpstein \u2014 who also spent time with other powerful figures, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Steve Bannon, and Ehud Barak \u2014 died by suicide in a federal Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019. As part of the same investigation, Justice Department prosecutors brought sex-trafficking charges against his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in late 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\nMusk was famously photographed with Maxwell at a 2014 Vanity Fair event. He has said she \"photobombed\" him.\nThe Tesla CEO has denied a connection to Epstein. Following a 2023 subpoena in litigation related to JPMorgan's ties to Epstein, Musk said he never took financial advice from him.\n\"That cretin never advised me on anything whatsoever,\" Musk posted on social media at the time.", "Source": "Business Insider", "Keyword": ["oversight", "lawsuit"], "Entities": ["Trump", "Epstein", "Trump", "Epstein", "Elon Musk", "Donald Trump", "the United States", "Epstein", "DJT", "Mark", "House", "Musk", "Justice Department", "Trump", "Epstein", "Epstein", "Palm Beach", "Manhattan", "Trump", "Epstein", "Trump", "Epstein", "Trump", "White House", "Karoline Leavitt", "Musk", "Trump", "Epstein", "Elon", "the One Big Beautiful Bill", "Leavitt", "Trump", "Epstein", "Pamela Bondi", "FBI", "Kash Patel", "the Justice Department", "Epstein", "CIA", "Bondi", "Patel", "Epstein", "Ghislaine Maxwell", "Epstein", "Trump", "Trump", "Epstein", "Trump", "Trump", "Maxwell", "Epstein", "Trump", "Epstein", "Virginia Giuffre", "Maxwell", "Maxwell", "Giuffre", "Trump", "Trump", "Giuffre", "Maxwell", "Trump", "Trump", "Epstein", "Johanna Sjoberg", "Epstein", "Sjoberg", "Epstein", "Trump", "Atlantic City", "Trump", "Epstein", "Jeffrey", "Trump", "Sjoberg", "Trump", "Epstein", "Bill Clinton", "Prince Andrew", "Steve Bannon", "Ehud Barak", "Manhattan", "Justice Department", "Ghislaine Maxwell", "Maxwell", "Vanity Fair", "Epstein", "JPMorgan", "Epstein", "Musk"]}, {"Title": "Trump\u2019s tariffs have so far caused little inflation", "Link": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/06/05/trumps-tariffs-have-so-far-caused-little-inflation", "Published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:11:32 +0000", "Summary": "Our estimate of their impact will update every month", "Content": "Paywalled article", "Source": "Economist", "Keyword": ["university of chicago"], "Entities": ["Trump", "Donald Trump\u2019s", "the University of Chicago\u2019s", "Trump", "America", "Finance &", "Finance &", "IMF", "Bank of Israel", "Federal Reserve", "Trump", "America", "UAE", "OPEC", "Trump"]}]

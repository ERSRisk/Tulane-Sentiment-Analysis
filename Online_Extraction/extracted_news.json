This vision promises energy independence, economic prosperity, and national security. Yet, entrenched anti-prosperity bureaucrats, timid politicians, and a misinformed public, swayed by decades of anti-nuclear propaganda, stand ready to obstruct this transformative agenda. America must address these obstacles in order to reclaim its leadership in the field of nuclear energy.\n\nOverhaul of the Nuclear Overseers\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which was formed after the dismemberment of the Atomic Energy Commission, has long served as a choke point for nuclear progress. The NRC was designed from the get-go to follow the agenda of anti-nuclear advocates, and consequently, it has licensed only two reactors since 1978, stifling innovation. Trump\u2019s orders demand a sweeping overhaul, capping exorbitant NRC fees and mandating licensing decisions within eighteen months. This aggressive reform dismantles barriers, but bureaucrats accustomed to sluggish processes will resist, clinging to technologically outdated risk-averse frameworks.\n\nAmerica\u2019s existing nuclear fleet\u2014light water and pressurized water reactors\u2014boasts the best safety record of any industry in America. Advanced nuclear designs, like small modular reactors, microreactors and Generation IV systems, push safety even further, with designs able to operate reliably even without human intervention. Trump\u2019s orders prioritize the deployment of these advanced designs, targeting five gigawatts of \u201cpower uprates\u201d (increasing the electricity output of existing reactors) and ten large new reactors by 2030. Yet, detractors will cry \u201cimpossible,\u201d and claim that government staff reductions, as ordered for the NRC, will compromise safety. In reality, NRC had more than enough staff and time to address a legitimate petition involving safety with respect to cooling spent nuclear fuel pools, choosing to instead to deny it. Given this track record, the public interest will be better served by a leaner and more focused regulator that puts the onus of safety and liability squarely on the industry.\n\nTurning Mislabeled \u201cWaste\u201d into Energy to Make Nuclear \u201cRenewable\u201d\n\nDecades of misinformation have mislabeled partially used nuclear fuel as \u201cwaste.\u201d In reality, this stockpile, mischaracterized during the Carter administration, holds trillions of dollars in potential energy if converted to electricity. Experts have long argued that this \u201cwaste\u201d could provide America with clean, carbon-free electricity for hundreds of years.\n\nThe concept of recycling partially used nuclear fuel was recommended to the Biden Administration\u2019s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on multiple occasions, yet that administration took no action. Trump\u2019s orders have established a motivated plan to process this partially used fuel for advanced reactors, which will release this vast, hidden taxpayer asset value while reducing foreign dependency. The challenge will be overcoming the government bureaucracy\u2019s previous \u201cbuild back better\u201d mindset that only wind and solar are \u201crenewable.\u201d\n\nNew Nuclear Test Sites and a New Nuclear Workforce\n\nThe Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) nuclear testing, centered at national labs like Idaho National Laboratory, is facing scrutiny for slow resolutions. Trump\u2019s orders demand a cultural shift by establishing test sites outside labs by July 4, 2026, and ensuring reactors are operational within two years. This urgency will spark competition in the electric power sector, breaking monopolistic inertia. Still, the national lab system\u2019s sluggish reputation could hinder progress unless private sector efficiency drives the process.\n\nA robust nuclear workforce is critical. The US \u201cNuclear Navy\u201d offers a model for rapidly training top-tier nuclear personnel. Trump\u2019s call for private sector-led apprenticeships and education programs mirrors this approach. By empowering industry over government, America can build a top-tier workforce swiftly, fueling reactor deployment and economic growth.\n\nThe Crossroads of Energy Security and National Security\n\nImportantly, even more importantly the executive orders bolster national security by designating nuclear-powered AI data centers and military bases as critical infrastructure. By deploying advanced reactors at DOE and Department of Defense (DOD) sites by 2028 and securing twenty new nuclear export agreements, the U.S. can lead globally. However, anti-nuclear advocates, steeped in decades of fearmongering, will push back by attempting to delay export deals and domestic progress.\n\nTrump\u2019s nuclear revolution is not just a policy shift, it\u2019s a call to action. America stands at a crossroads: embrace advanced nuclear power for affordable, abundant energy or succumb to the inertia of bureaucrats and misinformation. Only one of those roads leads to prosperity and energy security, and America must take it.\n\nAbout the Authors: Tommy Waller and Douglas Ellsworth\n\nLt. Col.

The wildfires would eventually destroy more than 37,000 acres of Southern California and leave 30 people dead, stopping just 10 blocks short of the day laborer worker center, which became, in the words of Cal Soto of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), \u200b\u201ca community response center \u2014 or a resiliency hub, as we call it.\u201d Volunteers came to the center for masks, coveralls, goggles and gloves to protect them from potentially toxic ash, as well as for training and support to safely join the efforts. \u200b\u201cThe day laborers and domestic workers who were members there started organizing these cleanup brigades,\u201d Soto said, \u200b\u201cto try to remove debris from the streets.\u201d The rapid response by day laborers, most of them immigrants, would be familiar to anyone who\u2019s lived through a wildfire, hurricane, tornado or other disaster in the past couple of decades. After Hurricane Sandy in New York in 2012, or Katrina in New Orleans 20 years ago this autumn, migrant workers have shown up, willing to help. Many of those workers accumulated skills and training specific to disaster relief work, skills that often go unseen and unheralded. There\u2019s a statue to the immigrant workers who helped rebuild after Katrina, lauding their contribution, but too often the actual immigrant workers face wage theft and harassment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nVolunteers gather at the Pasadena Community Job Center on January 14. After disasters, from Hurricane Katrina to Southern California wildfires, day laborers are often tasked with the cleanup. PHOTO BY ZOE MEYERS/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nIn the second Trump administration, which has promised mass deportations and the dismantling of the very federal agencies that coordinate disaster recovery \u2014 as well as a \u200b\u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d energy policy guaranteed to worsen climate chaos \u2014 the poor conditions of these workers may well be everyone\u2019s problem. The continuing string of disasters has been a reminder that, as the climate changes, none of us is safe. Hurricane Helene\u2019s path up the country from Florida in September 2024 ventured well inland; drought-fueled forest fires were rampaging across the Carolinas as I wrote these words this spring. Hurricane Debby, in August 2024, caused flooding and damage as far north as Vermont; late-season blizzards knocked over trees and power lines in Maine; the worst tornado season in two decades flattened homes across the center of the country; a \u200b\u201c1,000-year event\u201d saw extensive flooding in South Dakota. Those thousand-year storms are coming more like every couple of years. The efforts by those workers in Pasadena, Soto said, drew other volunteers. \u200b\u201cAt one point, we had a thousand volunteers a day coming in,\u201d Soto said. \u200b\u201cI think we counted over 30,000 hours of volunteer hours.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of a disaster, explained Nik Theodore, a professor in the Department of Urban Planning and Policy at the University of Illinois, Chicago, \u200b\u201cinformation doesn\u2019t flow very well.\u201d Communities facing destruction often don\u2019t know exactly what to do, and so day laborers can become important sources of information. Theodore, working with NDLON, dubbed those workers \u200b\u201csecond responders,\u201d the \u200b\u201cvery next group of people to come through\u201d after emergency response. The work of cleanup, he noted, must begin quickly \u2014 after a fire or flood, health and safety hazards rapidly multiply, mold spreads, structures wobble. Migrant workers too often have survived disasters themselves and been rendered homeless and mobile by crisis, and all too often live in unstable conditions, their willingness to help born of necessity, experience and care. Those workers, particularly those from Mexico and Central America, have long been kept super-exploitable by an immigration regime that treats them as unwanted guests, constantly under threat. And with President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations in many of the places most vulnerable to climate disasters \u2014 Florida and Louisiana, among others \u2014 already-existing labor shortages in construction and repair will likely grow larger. In an immediate state of emergency, Theodore continued, immigration officials may back off, but only temporarily. After Katrina, he said, \u200b\u201conce it became clear that folks were settling there \u2026 we started to see immigration enforcement actions ramp up.\u201d Mary Yanik, co-director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Tulane University Law School in New Orleans, confirmed this pattern: \u200b\u201cWhen people are serving in these roles that are really important for their politically powerful employers, ICE enforcement is sort of scarce.\u201d When workers begin to assert their rights, she noted, that\u2019s when ICE is called in. The fear among immigrant worker communities is real. Maricela Torres, of the Esperanza Community Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., told me that, since Trump was elected, fewer people are willing to come to the center for its services and supports, and she sees fewer day laborers out at the normal locations where they usually wait for work. Some of her regular members have moved elsewhere. Others, who have done disaster recovery work, ask why they should risk their safety doing disaster cleanup when the country\u2019s only offer is detention and deportation.\n\nTwo members of the day labor fire brigade, part of the Pasadena Community Job Center, clean up debris on January 10 after windstorms hit Pasadena. PHOTO BY GENARO MOLINA /LOS ANGELES TIMES VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe Trump administration has been quite clear that its intention is to spread fear so workers will self-deport. What\u2019s changed in Florida and elsewhere, explained Oscar Londo\u00f1o of WeCount! \u2014 an immigrant worker center in South Florida\u2014 is that state governments are expanding enforcement \u200b\u201ceven if it creates an economic shock.\u201d For decades, he said, industries like agriculture and construction have understood they cannot function without immigrant workers, many of them undocumented. But this moment has fractured that consensus, and the crisis will have wider ramifications, Londo\u00f1o said.\u201cEventually, there will be a moment in which there\u2019s a reckoning with the value or the centrality of immigrant workers and how devastating it would be to the economy if millions of undocumented workers were actually deported,\u201d he said. The intensity of this campaign will drive down already low labor standards in these industries, including emergency relief work. The fearmongering, Theodore said, creates \u200b\u201ca real opportunity for unscrupulous employers to take advantage of workers, both in terms of wage theft, but also in health and safety conditions,\u201d all backed up \u200b\u201cwith threats of immigration enforcement\u201d \u2014 threats that carry new weight.\n\nYanik recalled the case of Jos\u00e9 Torres, who came from El Salvador to New Orleans after Katrina to be part of the rebuilding effort and stayed, becoming a leader in the Congress of Day Laborers, an immigrant workers group. Torres survived labor trafficking and was in the middle of a legal battle during the first Trump administration. He sought sanctuary in a church when he was threatened with deportation. Yanik and others worked on his case, which became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the community, and eventually secured him a path to citizenship. The administration \u200b\u201cwants spectacle,\u201d Yanik said, but some of that spectacle takes time to prepare: The largest worksite raids during Trump 1.0, she noted, came in 2019. \u200b\u201cThey don\u2019t need to do a hundred; they could do five, and they can still have that effect of making people stay home or even flee the country,\u201d she said. With the declaration that churches, schools and hospitals will be stripped of sanctuary protections put in place by the Biden administration, she wondered whether we might see enforcement in shelters during emergencies.\n\nThe work of disaster relief is the work of salvage. It is the work of sifting through rubble to make something livable again, and it is mostly done by people who have already lost so much.\n\nThe idea is to create a \u200b\u201chostile environment,\u201d making conditions so unwelcoming that immigrants simply leave. In that climate, even people attempting to help by sharing information about ICE on social media, for example, sometimes contribute to the fear: \u200b\u201cInformation is constantly being propagated without being verified,\u201d Londo\u00f1o said. \u200b\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so central to have organizations anchored in workplaces and in communities that can verify this information, that can create community defense infrastructure, that can educate people on what their rights are and, if necessary, mobilize resources.\u201d Mutual aid efforts that flower in the wake of disaster can help bring people into this kind of community defense work. In Pasadena, Soto said, organizers recognized how the fires created opportunity for \u200b\u201corganizing folks and making sure people understand this is a political act, just these workers going out in the streets.\u201d Working to rebuild the community, citizens and immigrants build stronger ties, and those who had not been involved in worker organizing might be more willing to stand up for their neighbors.\n\nThe destruction of place and people have gone hand in hand since Friedrich Engels first described industrial conditions as \u200b\u201csocial murder\u201d in 1845, the workers being first to feel the effects of smoke-choked air, poisoned water and shoddily built factories and mills, while the boss worked in a pristine office miles away. These days, in the United States, it is immigrant workers who feel the effects of climate catastrophe first, while being scapegoated by a president cloistered in an air-conditioned office, his unelected assistant slashing away at the federal workforce. Rebuilding requires skilled labor and funds. Federal disaster relief efforts have been hampered for years by underfunding, and the Trump administration wants to turbocharge that destruction. \u200b\u201cInitially, when DOGE [Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency] swung into action, FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] was one of the first words out of their mouths,\u201d Nik Theodore said. Trump has threatened to eliminate FEMA entirely and has slashed its budget and fired hundreds of employees. He\u2019s also taken aim at other federal emergency relief and management offices, slashing the Office of Community Planning and Development, part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which pays for homes after the worst disasters. House Speaker Mike Johnson (from Louisiana himself) complied with a Trump directive to cut legal assistance for disaster victims \u2014 legal aid that prevents them from losing money to scammers or being evicted by shady landlords.\n\nThe National Day Laborer Organizing Network prepares workers for disaster sites with skills such as how to use a respirator, as at this fire cleanup in Pasadena in January. PHOTO BY ALLEN J. SCHABEN / LOS ANGELES TIMES VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nOne of the Trump administration\u2019s big ideas for \u200b\u201creforming\u201d disaster relief is to put more of the responsibility on the states. Of course, this idea presents a problem for those same Southern states that are storm-prone, with right-wing governments often unwilling to fund relief. As Rep. Troy Carter (D-La.) told reporters: \u200b\u201cStates, while capable of responding to some immediate needs, do not have the resources, infrastructure, or capacity to provide the widespread, coordinated relief that FEMA can offer.\u201d FEMA was created after those same Southern states demanded coordinated disaster recovery in the 1970s. Today, the landscape is very different. More than a decade ago, Londo\u00f1o noted, Florida abolished its state Department of Labor, and it does not have a state Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). It\u2019s part of \u200b\u201csystematic deregulation,\u201d he said, combined with attacks on labor unions, which has resulted in worse conditions for workers whether or not they are legal residents. WeCount! has been behind a campaign, for example, to try to win heat protections for outdoor workers. \u200b\u201cWe came within a vote of passing the first of its kind \u2014 a municipal heat standard for outdoor workers in Miami-Dade \u2014 and were then preempted by the state government.\u201d\n\nThose Southern states have relied on federal labor agencies for what protections they can get. \u200b\u201cIf either from inaction or action, the federal Department of Labor is considered unsafe for immigrant workers to report to, that means they\u2019re all on their own and vulnerable,\u201d Yanik said. \u200b\u201cIt means that the employers will do whatever they want with no restraint at all.\u201d Even under the Biden administration, which wanted to be seen as pro-worker, offices like OSHA were desperately understaffed. OSHA had one inspector for every 80,014 workers, or enough to inspect every workplace once every 186 years, according to a 2024 report from the AFL-CIO. Without the agencies to help, workers have had to look after themselves. In the wake of the fires, Soto said, NDLON and the Pasadena center have embarked on a massive training effort to put workers through OSHA\u2019s new disaster worker certification course. \u200b\u201cWe were able to train 174 day laborers and domestic workers in that course, that does fit testing, what kind of masks you need, how to work in wildfire,\u201d he said. After that, they move to smoke abatement and then hazardous waste training. \u200b\u201cWe know these workers are going to be the first line going into the sites,\u201d so they\u2019re proactively helping workers gain skills. As Soto explained: \u200b\u201cComing out of these trainings, what you see is workers, a lot of times, are indignant. \u200b\u2018Why didn\u2019t I get this? Why didn\u2019t I have this before?\u2019 Because it\u2019s basic stuff, but it\u2019s stuff that is life-changing in terms of the health outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe Pasadena area is now moving into the next stage of relief: rebuilding. In the early moments, Soto said, there was a beautiful sense of solidarity, with everyone sharing food and feeling as though they were all in it together. Now, the differences are starting to show. Most undocumented workers are ineligible for what federal help does still exist, which means many of the people who put their bodies on the line for others will not get to rebuild their own lives the same way. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t really see after the event itself is how long the period of recovery is,\u201d Theodore said. \u200b\u201cThe length of time it takes for communities to get back on track, I think, is overlooked, because the focus is on the immediate event and the danger to life and property that it all entails.\u201d While the recovery often relies on migrant workers\u2019 mobility, it also depends on their willingness to commit to the long term \u2014 like Jos\u00e9 Torres in New Orleans, or many of the workers Theodore met in Houston after Hurricane Harvey. \u200b\u201cIn many places, it is members of the community, neighbors who are still undocumented but have been living and working and contributing for decades,\u201d Theodore explained.\n\nSign up for our weekend newsletter A weekly digest of our best coverage Email Address\n\nCommunities are reshaped in many ways following a disaster. The New Orleans I live in now looks very different from the one I moved away from in 2002, before Katrina. Some Californians are discovering this right now in the aftermath of the fires. Insurance costs have skyrocketed in disaster-prone areas (thanks to climate change-transformed estimates), and payouts often don\u2019t cover the cost of rebuilding. Then, developers swoop in to buy damaged homes. In these moments, the claims of eliminating red tape don\u2019t help working-class residents. The idea of \u200b\u201cwe\u2019re just going to lift regulations so that we can rebuild faster,\u201d according to Soto, only makes it easier for unscrupulous developers and contractors to take advantage of desperate homeowners and workers. In places like New Orleans, he continued, health and safety violations skyrocketed when regulations were lifted. \u200b\u201cAnd so when you say, \u200b\u2018we\u2019re going to suspend [rules] to make it easier to rebuild,\u2019 that\u2019s what we hear. We hear, \u200b\u2018you\u2019re going to make it easier to put people\u2019s lives at risk, to screw over people who are most affected.\u2019\u201d\n\nWorker centers can also be hubs for training community members to protect their migrant neighbors from deportation. The immigration equivalent of CopWatch programs, Yanik said, can be especially effective in this moment \u2014 learning to document and verify actual ICE activity and pass on the information. The challenge she faces as an attorney, she said \u2014 which organizers are also facing \u2014 is the question of, \u200b\u201cHow do you activate people and raise alarm because it\u2019s really scary, and how do you disentangle some of the misinformation and make clear that a lot of this is honestly smoke and mirrors?\u201d She continued: \u200b\u201cAll of this is being portrayed as some massive, vast system, and it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a bunch of weird, draconian piecemeal things that are happening that are meant to prove a point, meant to send a message, and it\u2019s a horrible message.\u201d\n\nIn particular areas, like the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas, \u200b\u201cCommunities are ahead of the government,\u201d said Jeffrey Jacoby of the Texas Campaign for the Environment. Every year, he sees hurricane preparedness mutual aid events into the summer. \u200b\u201cFrom the government officials, it\u2019s total crickets.\u201d The gap between awareness and the resources provided has been huge, and so community organizations step into that gap as best they can. \u201cWhat\u2019s twisted about the system is, with proper resources, with enough funding, then I think communities could do a pretty good job of getting ready,\u201d he continued. Recently, Jacoby added, after a tropical storm knocked out power in Freeport, Texas, one church was able to provide a few generators for the community, ensuring that about a dozen families could keep food from spoiling and be sheltered from the summer heat. \u200b\u201cYou just imagine something like that with a different scale, and you could have a lot less suffering in the face of a disaster.\u201d\n\nWorkers can push for standards in contracts and attempt to hold big employers accountable if states and localities won\u2019t provide them, Londo\u00f1o said. Miami-Dade has a campaign around the annual heat season, but still a lack of labor regulations around heat. And yet, he noted, employers are well aware that climate change is a reality \u2014 agricultural firms \u200b\u201care constantly adapting to changes in climate.\u201d Production is going to have to change, he said, so \u200b\u201cyou should also account for the impact of extreme heat on your workforce.\u201d Immigrant workers like WeCount!\u2019s members will be leading the charge on heat standards once again this year, in yet another campaign that will help the rest of their communities adapt to the crisis. The work of disaster relief is the work of salvage, as I wrote in my 2024 book, From the Ashes. It is the work of sifting through rubble to make something livable again, and it is mostly done by people who have already lost so much. Surviving the Trump administration, too, will be a form of salvage, and it will require new solidarities built from destruction.", "Summary": "This article discusses the role of day laborers in disaster relief and the challenges they face, particularly under the Trump administration.

The beans, along with the fresh veggies in the dish, help you reach your daily fiber goal, a number that experts say most Americans don\u2019t hit, which isn\u2019t good. Eating enough fiber is a crucial way to reduce your risk of colon cancer, a type of cancer that\u2019s on the rise in people 50 and younger in the US.\n\n(It\u2019s recommended that women eat roughly 25 grams of fiber each day while men consume about 38 grams, but most adults eat roughly 10 grams of fiber each day.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDecades ago, researchers found that people in Uganda had very low rates of colon cancer when compared to Americans because of their diet, which was high in fiber \u2014 veggies, fruits and grains \u2014 and low in meat, said Dr. Ron Quinton, the medical director of the Goldring Center for Culinary Medicine at Tulane University in New Orleans. Specifically, colon cancer occurred at a rate of 3.5 out of 100,000 in men in Uganda compared to 51.8 out of 100,000 in men in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the first time that it was really noticed that this was a prevention for colon cancer,\u201d noted Quinton. Meaning, it\u2019s really important to prioritize your fiber consumption.\n\nThere are multiple ways that fiber benefits colon health and even more ways to reach the daily recommended amount. Here\u2019s what experts say:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEating enough fiber helps move your stool through your digestive tract.\n\n\u201cFiber plays an important role in the health of the colon, and when the colon gets unhealthy, then we\u2019re set up for development of cancer and other inflammatory diseases,\u201d said Quinton.\n\nOverall, fiber adds bulk to the stool, which helps with proper colon function.\n\n\u201c[Fiber] makes the stools more easy to move along, so the time that the stool spends in the colon is lessened, so less chance for constipation, more normal stools,\u201d explained Quinton.\n\nThis is also good for the removal of toxins: \u201cIf there are any toxins in the stool that lead to cancer, they spend less time in the colon, and therefore lessen the chances of cancer exposure or other diseases,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFiber also benefits the microbiome, which is protective against colon cancer, too.\n\nFiber is also important for the microbiome, which has been the main focus of research in the past decade, said Mary Ellen Camire, a professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine.\n\nFiber is often prebiotic, meaning it\u2019s food for probiotic bacteria, Camire added. And probiotics help rebuild and balance your microbiome.\n\n\u201cWhen the bacteria get a nice fiber meal, they are very active, and they make compounds that help protect the colon\u201d against colon cancer, along with other kinds of cancers, she explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore, the cells that line the colon, which are called colonocytes, get their energy from the microbiome, added Quinton. \u201cAnd when the colonocytes are healthy, then they form an intact barrier along the colon, so that substances that may cause disease or cancer can\u2019t cross that barrier,\u201d Quinton said.\n\n\u201cIt also helps the colon produce mucus [and] thick mucus lining also protects the colon, so without enough fiber, our microbiome gets diseased and they don\u2019t produce the energy or nutrients that our colon needs to stay healthy,\u201d he noted.\n\nfcafotodigital via Getty Images Beans and legumes are a high-fiber meal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how you can eat more fiber:\n\n\u201cFiber is a really critical part of our overall diet, and the typical American only gets 5 or 10% of the recommended amount of fiber in their diet on any given day,\u201d said Quinton.\n\nAs mentioned above, women need about 25 grams of fiber each day and men need about 38 grams, he said.\n\nBeans and legumes are very high in fiber and certain fruits and veggies are, too. Lentils have 18 grams of fiber per cup, black beans have about 15 grams in 1 can, chia seeds have 10 grams in 2 tablespoons, barley has 6 grams in 1 cup, raspberries have 8 grams in 1 cup and a pear has 6 grams, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis summer, you could make a bean and whole wheat pasta salad to up your fiber intake, or make some cold barley salads, said Camire. You can also lean into seasonal produce, she said.\n\nCamire added that it\u2019s important to spread your fiber intake out across the day and to consume different kinds of foods for fiber.\n\n\u201cThe mistake a lot of people make when they decide \u2018I\u2019m going to make fiber a priority\u2019 is they don\u2019t give their system time to adjust. If you\u2019re used to eating 15 grams of fiber a day, and you start eating 30 grams a day, the bacteria think they\u2019re having a party and so you may have some gas and cramping,\u201d Camire said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should start out gradually and slowly build up, she noted.\n\n\u201cOnce you find the foods that you tolerate well and that you like, getting enough fiber won\u2019t be difficult or expensive,\u201d Camire added.\n\nAnd fiber supplements don\u2019t cut it.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to turn to fiber supplements as a quick and easy way to reach your fiber goal, but experts say you shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNone of the supplements ... are an adequate replacement for natural fiber,\u201d Quinton said. Also, since you need so much fiber, fiber supplements end up being just a drop in the bucket, Camire added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile some of the supplements can increase your stool bulk and help constipation, \u201cthey don\u2019t necessarily have the soluble fiber elements that feed the microbiome and keep it healthy, which keeps your gut healthy,\u201d said Quinton.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can just replace the fiber with supplements. You need to be eating whole food,\u201d Quinton added.\n\nBeyond fiber intake, there\u2019s more you can do to lower your colon cancer risk.\n\nIt\u2019s important to also take other preventative steps to lower your risk of developing colon cancer. These include monitoring yourself for concerning symptoms such as ongoing stomach pain, blood in your stool or a change in your bowel movements. If you notice these symptoms, talk to your doctor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also important to let your doctor know if colon cancer runs in your family as you may be eligible for an early colonoscopy screening.\n\nColonoscopy screenings start at 45 for those with no family history and without the symptoms mentioned above, but no matter when you\u2019re eligible, colonoscopies are the best way to screen for colon cancer and remove potentially precancerous polyps.\n\n\u201cDuring a colonoscopy, if we see a polyp, and we believe it to be the precancerous kind, which the vast majority are, we will remove those polyps at the colonoscopy,\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Dueker, a gastroenterologist at UPMC and an associate professor of gastroenterology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, previously told HuffPost. \u201cAnd in doing so, we are reducing the colorectal cancer risk going forward,\u201d Dueker added.\n\nAdvertisement", "Summary": "This article discusses the benefits of fiber in reducing colon cancer risk.

His research centers on the physiological consequences of sleep apnea, with a focus on identifying markers of cardiovascular and neurocognitive health. Dr. Azarbarzin is also recognized for his work in stratifying patients based on those most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention, supporting a precision medicine approach to OSA treatment.\n\nLora J. McGill, M.D., FAAN, is a board-certified neurologist and clinical researcher based in Memphis, Tennessee. With over two decades of experience, Dr. McGill has served as an investigator at CNS Healthcare of Memphis, where she has contributed to hundreds of industry-sponsored clinical trials focused on central nervous system disorders. She is board-certified in both neurology and neurophysiology by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and has received multiple honors for her contributions to medical education, including the Golden Apple Award and Outstanding Lecturer recognition from the University of Tennessee College of Medicine. She earned her medical degree from Tulane University School of Medicine in 1987 and completed her residency and fellowship in neurophysiology at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.\n\nNancy Collop, M.D. is Director of the Emory Sleep Center and Professor of Medicine and Neurology at Emory School of Medicine. She served on the board of directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), including as President, and held board roles with the American Sleep Medicine Foundation, ACCP, Chest Foundation, Maryland and Georgia Sleep Societies, Society for Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine, and the American Board of Sleep Medicine (ABSM), where she also served as President.

From 2015 to 2024, Dr. Collop was Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine and currently serves as Section Editor for Sleep Medicine for UpToDate.\n\nAbout IHL-42X\n\nIHL-42X is designed to treat obstructive sleep apnea (\u201cOSA\u201d) by targeting its underlying pathophysiology. An oral fixed-dose combination of dronabinol and acetazolamide, IHL-42X is currently advancing through the RePOSA Phase 2/3 clinical trial, which is expected to enroll more than 560 patients at sites worldwide.\n\nDesigned to act synergistically, IHL-42X uniquely targets two physiological pathways associated with the intermittent hypoxia (\u201cIH\u201d) and hypercapnia that characterize OSA. In a prior Australian Phase 2 clinical trial, IHL-42X was shown to reduce the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (\u201cAHI\u201d) in all dosage strengths, with the lowest dose reducing AHI by an average of 51 percent relative to baseline. RePOSA, a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial is underway, evaluating IHL-42X in individuals with OSA who are either non-compliant, intolerant, or na\u00efve to positive airway pressure devices, including CPAP, with the Phase 2 portion conducted in the United States. A topline readout from the U.S. Phase 2 portion is anticipated in July 2025.\n\nUnlike weight loss therapies, IHL-42X is uniquely engineered to target two key physiological pathways, intermittent hypoxia (IH) and hypercapnia, that underlie the pathology of OSA. By targeting these core mechanisms, IHL-42X offers a differentiated approach that may benefit a wider range of patients, including the 67% of individuals with OSA who are not classified as obese. OSA affects an estimated 1 billion people globally and approximately 30 million people in the United States. Despite its high prevalence OSA remains significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated. IHL-42X has the potential to address this critical gap in care and improve outcomes for millions living with this serious, chronic condition.\n\nAbout Incannex Healthcare Inc.\n\nIncannex is leading the way in developing combination medicines that target the underlying biological pathways associated with chronic conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis and generalized anxiety disorder. The company is advancing three clinical-stage product candidates based on evidence-based innovation, and supported by streamlined operations. Incannex's lead clinical program, IHL-42X, is an oral fixed-dose combination of dronabinol and acetazolamide designed to target underlying mechanisms and act synergistically in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

Past studies have not aligned regarding the most prevalent autoimmune diseases after infection, however. Furthermore, the relationship between infection severity and new autoimmune disease risk has not been well examined. We used RECOVER\u2019s electronic health record (EHR) networks, N3C, PCORnet, and PEDSnet, to estimate types and frequency of autoimmune diseases arising after SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed how infection severity related to autoimmune disease risk. We identified patients of any age with SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 1, 2020 and April 1, 2021, and assigned them to a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity category for adults or the PEDSnet acute COVID-19 illness severity classification system for children (<age 21). We collected baseline covariates from the EHR in the year pre-index infection date and followed patients for 2 years for new autoimmune disease, defined as \u2265 2 new ICD-9, ICD-10, or SNOMED codes in the same concept set, starting >30 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection index date and occurring \u22651 day apart. We calculated overall and infection severity-stratified incidence ratesper 1000 person-years for all autoimmune diseases. With least severe COVID-19 severity as reference, survival analyses examined incident autoimmune disease risk. The most common new-onset autoimmune diseases in all networks were thyroid disease, psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Among adults, inflammatory arthritis was the most common, and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease also had high incidence. Incident type 1 diabetes and hematological autoimmune diseases were specifically found in children. Across networks, after adjustment, patients with highest COVID-19 severity had highest risk for new autoimmune disease vs. those with least severe disease (N3C: adjusted Hazard Ratio, (aHR) 1.47 (95%CI 1.33\u20131.66); PCORnet aHR 1.14 (95%CI 1.02\u20131.26); PEDSnet: aHR 3.14 (95%CI 2.42\u20134.07)].

Affecting over 777 million persons as of May 2024, COVID-19 caused over 7 million deaths as assessed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. Among other long-term sequelae of COVID-19, the emergence of clinical autoimmune disease has been reported in many case series and an increasing number of epidemiological studies [2\u201317]. Collectively, autoimmune diseases affect millions of Americans and are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality [18,19]. Over 100 different autoimmune diseases exist, including type I diabetes, juvenile inflammatory arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, which predominate among younger people, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune thyroid disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease, and varied forms of systemic vasculitis, more common in older people. Most of these related conditions are associated with autoantibody production, targeted or widespread systemic inflammation, and organ damage. They are known to be increasingly prevalent with age and associated with significant morbidity, decreased life expectancy and high medical expenditures [19]. Autoimmune disease pathogenesis is now understood to be due to complex interactions among genetic factors, environmental exposures throughout the lifespan, immune responses to these factors, and interactions between all of these. The environmental triggers of the immune attack on self-tissues characterizing autoimmune diseases are not yet fully elucidated [20]. Autoimmunity arising after viral infections has been widely reported, although it remains challenging to study, with no single viral infection universally accepted as a risk factor for the development of most autoimmune diseases [21]. Recent studies have used administrative databases from the United States (U.S.), Hong Kong, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Germany, and Korea to study the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent incident autoimmune diseases in both adults and children [4,15\u201317,22]. Most of these studies have assessed the risk of developing new autoimmune or autoinflammatory disease among those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, compared to the risk among those who tested negative. Using matched cohort designs, risks of a wide range of autoimmune diseases, with variation across studies, have been found to be elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those without prior infection [4,15\u201317,22,23]. A secondary analysis in a study from Hong Kong found that those with more severe hospitalized COVID-19 had increased risk of both transverse myelitis and inflammatory bowel disease, which was not observed when all SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were studied, and that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 attenuated the overall risk of autoimmune disease after COVID-19 [15]. A recent study using the TriNetX insurance database did not find an influence of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 on risk of autoimmune disease; however, it reported that those who developed autoimmune disease (vs. those who did not) had an approximately 50% higher risk of having been previously hospitalized with COVID-19 [23]. Given these recent reports and the strong biologic possibility that more severe SARS- CoV-2 infection, with higher circulating concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6) and cytokine storm syndromes in some, may be more strongly linked to triggering of new autoimmune disease, we aimed to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and incident autoimmune diseases [24]. Here, we have investigated COVID-19 severity and the risk of subsequently developing autoimmune disease among adults and children living across the U.S. within the Researching COVID-19 to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) electronic health record (EHR) networks. RECOVER is an NIH-funded national consortium studying the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s association with long-term health effects. The goal of RECOVER is to improve understanding of and ability to predict, treat, and prevent PASC (post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, also known as Long COVID). The EHR cohort of RECOVER is comprised of aggregated data from three separate EHR networks, including the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative (N3C), the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) and PCORnet\u2019s pediatric population, PEDSnet, a pediatric learning system within PCORnet [25\u201329]. These networks were either established prior to (PCORnet and PEDSnet) or in response to COVID-19 (N3C). We estimated the type and frequency of incident autoimmune diseases following SARS-CoV-2 infection by severity in the RECOVER EHR cohort, which contains medical data on over 35 million individuals living across the U.S. from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2023 [23,30].\n\nMethods Data sources Data from the three RECOVER EHR networks were assembled from over 100 sites across the US. Data included demographics, encounters, medical diagnoses, medications, and selected laboratory results were available. Diagnoses were classified using both the International Classification of Disease (ICD)- 9th and 10th editions codes and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) codes. De-identified EHR data relating to patient encounters from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2023 were acquired from N3C version 187 from December 2024, PCORnet version S12 from October 2024, and PEDSnet version S9 from July 2023. N3C RECOVER patient selection criteria can be found on the N3C phenotype inclusion criteria website (https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Phenotype_Data_Acquisition/wiki/Latest-Phenotype). The N3C data transfer to NCATS is performed under a Johns Hopkins University Reliance Protocol # IRB00249128 or individual site agreements with NIH. The N3C Data Enclave is managed under the authority of the NIH; information can be found at https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c/resources. The original selection of patients into PCORnet and PEDSnet RECOVER EHR networks are described in S1 Appendix. For PCORnet/PEDSnet, Institute Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained under Biomedical Research Alliance of New York (BRANY) protocol #21-08-508. As part of the Biomedical Research Alliance of New York (BRANY IRB) process, the protocol has been reviewed in accordance with the institutional guidelines. The Biomedical Research Alliance of New York (BRANY) waived the need for consent and HIPAA authorization. Institutional Review Board oversight was provided by the Biomedical Research Alliance of New York, protocol # 21-08-508-380. COVID-19 definition and covariates Patients with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in all three EHR networks were defined and identified for the current study as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test, a U07.1 ICD-10 code, a prescription for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or a medication order for remdesivir between April 1, 2020, and April 1, 2021. A patient\u2019s index date was defined as the first indication of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in that time-period. Patients aged 21 and over at their index event were included within N3C and PCORnet analyses, whereas those younger than 21 were included in PEDSnet. Patients were excluded from the study if they had unknown or missing sex. To ensure patients received their healthcare at an in-network site, we required at least one encounter within the 365 days prior to the SARS-CoV-2 infection index date. The baseline period for collecting study subject characteristics was the year before, up to and including, the SARS-CoV-2 infection index date. Sociodemographic characteristics included: age, sex, race/ethnicity, and medical insurance type. Baseline clinical and behavioral characteristics included: prior history of autoimmune disease, defined as \u2265 1 ICD-9/ICD-10 or SNOMED code for any one autoimmune disease prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection index date (S2\u2013S4 Appendices), healthcare utilization (number of EHR medical encounters) in the 365 days prior to, but not including, the 5 days before index event, the index event time-period (in 3-month intervals), baseline comorbidity scores (by the Charleston Comorbidity Index (CCI) for adults and the Pediatric Medical Complexity Algorithm (PMCAv3.0) for children), ever-smoking status among adults, substance use disorder (S5 Appendix), body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) categorized according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards, glucocorticoid use (current vs. non-current oral or intravenous use) (S6 Appendix), and the size of participating RECOVER sites (by pre-inclusion and exclusion criteria patient enrollment numbers in quartiles) [31\u201334]. Autoimmune rheumatic diseases were excluded from the CCI and the immunological system was excluded from the PMCA. COVID-19 severity For adult patients, we categorized COVID-19 illness severity using encounter location and medical interventions according to the WHO ordinal scale score [35]. Based on encounters within three days before to 16 days after the index event [36], four-level mutually exclusive categories were defined: a) \u201coutpatient with mild conditions\u201d (WHO severity 1\u20132), if there was no evidence for hospitalization or emergency department encounter; b) \u201cOutpatients with mild conditions with emergency department visit\u201d (WHO severity, approximately 3) if there was an emergency department encounter only; c) \u201cHospitalized\u201d (WHO severity 4\u20136) if hospitalized but not critically ill and d) \u201cHospitalized with ventilation\u201d (WHO severity 7\u20139) if hospitalized and requiring ICU level care, invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or vasopressor/inotropic support. Descriptors here correspond to the labels found in tables and all analyses, i.e., \u201cOutpatient\u201d, \u201cEmergency Department\u201d, \u201cHospitalized\u201d, and \u201cHospitalized and on Ventilator\u201d. Codes used to identify hospitalized and on ventilator can be found in S7-S8 Appendices. For pediatric patients, mutually exclusive categories were constructed using PEDSnet\u2019s four-level acute COVID-19 severity illness classification. Patients were categorized as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe based on patient COVID-19 symptom clusters identified by using clinically cogent sets of SNOMED CT diagnosis codes examined 7 days before to 13 days after the day of SARS-CoV-2 infection positivity [30]. Asymptomatic patients met no criterion for severity. For more information on the PEDSnet mild \u2013 severe severity concepts, see S1 Table. Incident autoimmune disease Patients were followed through their EHRs for up to 24 months after index date with incident autoimmune disease (primary outcome) defined as having \u2265 2 codes within any one new autoimmune disease concept set (condition) starting 30-days or more after index date and occurring \u2265 1 day apart. Autoimmune diseases were identified by ICD-9/ICD-10/SNOMED codes within the same autoimmune disease concept set for 41 distinct autoimmune diseases and one \u201cother\u201d category (S2-S4 Appendices). The minimum 30-day window period after the index date was designed to avoid the capture of prevalent autoimmune diseases and misdiagnoses close to the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and to compensate for any increased autoimmune disease surveillance bias soon after acute infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection would be unlikely to cause autoimmune disease development within the first month after exposure as most autoimmune diseases develop slowly, with symptoms taking many months to emerge [20]. For individuals with a history of prior autoimmune disease (at least 1 ICD-9/ICD-10 or SNOMED code for any one autoimmune disease prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection index date), incident autoimmune disease in follow-up was included as an outcome only if the diagnosis codes were not within the patient\u2019s prior autoimmune disease concept set. Statistical analyses The baseline demographics of the patients in each EHR network were examined with descriptive statistics, overall and according to their COVID-19 illness severity. Unadjusted incidence rates per 1000-person years were calculated overall and by COVID-19 illness severity category for each autoimmune disease concept set. The five most common new autoimmune diseases per 1000 person-years in each EHR network were identified. The association of COVID-19 severity and risk of new autoimmune disease was first assessed using unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves, censoring for death. We also created unadjusted cumulative incidence curves accounting for the competing risk of death and new autoimmune disease. We then conducted multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models. In all analyses, the least severe COVID-19 severity category was the reference group. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and corresponding p values were estimated for two primary Cox regression models, censoring for death, end of follow-up, and the outcome of new autoimmune disease. The first model adjusted for age, sex, race, and ethnicity, and the second, fully adjusted model, further adjusted for medical insurance type (as a proxy for socioeconomic status), healthcare utilization, date of SARS-CoV-2 infection, comorbidities, the CCI for adults and PMCA for children, as well as substance use disorder, smoking status (adults only), BMI (according to WHO categories for adults and according to age-based percentiles in children), glucocorticoid use, and RECOVER enrollment site size. We selected our covariates for our adjusted models based on univariable analyses to assess whether they were true confounders (associated with the risk of the predictor and with the risk of the outcome) and also included other variables for face validity (size of the enrollment center, medical insurance, time period of SARS-CoV-2 infection). We tested the proportional hazards assumption by examining the Kaplan-Meier curves and assessing interaction of the predictors with time. Missing data were represented in a missing category. Secondary analyses stratified the fully adjusted models by sex to investigate potential effect modification [37]. In another secondary analysis, we excluded those with a history of any prior autoimmune disease from both the fully adjusted and sex stratified models. Data analyses were performed using R version 4.3.1. R survival and ggsurvfit packages (2023.08.28) [38,39].\n\nDiscussion In this large US-based EHR study, we examined the association of COVID-19 severity with the risk of new autoimmune disease diagnosis. Our findings suggest that the risk of being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection was highest among those who experienced the most severe COVID-19, i.e., those who were hospitalized and ventilated. These findings were observed in three different U.S.-based networks, including one in a pediatric population. Our analysis corroborates and extends findings from recent studies which found that more severe COVID-19 illness might be associated with increased subsequent autoimmune disease risk [15,23,40]. In these three networks, the most common adult autoimmune diseases newly diagnosed after SARS-CoV-2 infection shared by both adult and pediatric networks were autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto\u2019s in adults), psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. In the pediatric population, the third most common autoimmune disease was type I diabetes, which has also been reported after other viral infections such as mumps, parainfluenza, human herpes virus 6, enteroviruses, and Coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1) serotype among children [41,42]. In the adult populations, inflammatory arthritis/rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was most common. This was also reported in a study in a Colombian cohort in which the incidence rate ratio for rheumatoid arthritis following SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2 [43]. The alignment of these results across different networks and studies is important as it reinforces the consistency and reliability of the findings. Past studies have reported increases in the risk of developing systemic vasculitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection as among the most common incident autoimmune disease sequalae [4,17,22,23]. Four of five large recently published studies on this topic employed only one billing code to define incident autoimmune disease, which can be highly non-specific, particularly in the setting of the types of vague and ongoing constitutional symptoms that emerged after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study required a more specific definition, two separate encounters with similar autoimmune ICD9, ICD10 or SNOMED codes recorded at least 1 day apart to improve specificity and positive predictive value [44]. Some autoimmune diseases, such as vasculitis, may have been overlooked as they may have been self-limited (e.g., Henoch-Schoenlein purpura in children, or leukocytoclastic vasculitis). In past studies, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease were reported to be common post-SARS-CoV-2 infection [4,16]. In the current study, we found that autoimmune hemolytic anemia and Evan\u2019s syndrome, which can precede childhood SLE, were among the five most common PEDSnet autoimmune diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association of viral infection severity with increased risk of autoimmune disease is important and biologically plausible. It may be related to cytokine release syndrome seen in severe cases [45,46]. While influenza A and other viral infections induce release of many inflammatory cytokines, coronaviruses in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular, have been shown to have very strong stimulatory influences on immune and inflammatory cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNs), key anti-viral cytokines limiting viral infection via activation of the innate immune system [46,47]. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which stimulate production of type I IFNs, have been identified in severe COVID-19 illness and additionally are implicated in autoimmune disease pathogenesis. NETs prime dendritic cells to present their nuclear contents, stimulating B cell production and affinity maturation along with formation and release of autoantibodies [48,49]. Thus, host immune responses developed to protect from viral infection, when not appropriately downregulated, may contribute to increased risk of developing autoimmune disease, including in the context of viral infections. Strengths and limitations Our study has several strengths including large nationwide EHR networks, the inclusion of a pediatric population, the requirement for two independent billing codes on separate days for a new autoimmune diagnosis (increasing AD diagnosis positive predictive value) [44], and secondary analyses excluding those with pre-existing autoimmune disease of any kind. The simultaneous analysis of the three EHR networks, which contain only 20 overlapping sites with each other, not only broadened the scope of our analysis, but also enabled us to establish a more definitive connection between the severity of COVID-19 requiring ICU admission/ventilation, compared to less severe COVID-19, and the subsequent increase in incident autoimmune disease over a two-year period. Of recent studies of autoimmune disease arising after SARS-CoV-2 infection, only one has included children [17]. Our inclusion of a large pediatric population provides a more comprehensive understanding of the disease\u2019s impact on this critical demographic, with its susceptibility to a different spectrum of autoimmune diseases. Given the genetic predisposition that increases the likelihood of those with existing autoimmune disease to develop a new AD, we included all participants in our primary analyses and applied a stricter incident AD definition to those with a history of prior AD. In our secondary analyses excluding all patients with evidence of any autoimmune disease in the baseline period, we obtained similar results as our primary analysis. Although risk for AD fell just short of significance in N3C and PCORnet hospitalized with ventilation patients, we still believe that this association is plausible. The change in significance is likely due to inherent EHR limitations (e.g., patients interacting with the same healthcare system in follow up or potential misclassified in COVID-19 severity categories), as PEDSnet and other N3C severity levels showed increased risk for AD that remained significant. However, we acknowledge that this still requires further investigation as the established link between severe COVID-19 and autoimmune disease may be confounded by factors such as previous immunosuppressant therapy, potential cross-contaminant use of immunosuppression COVID-19 medications (e.g., combination therapies with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs), differential COVID-19 treatment in fear of cross-contaminant drug use, and increased prevalence of comorbidities associated with severe infection (e.g., diabetes, obesity, older age) within the prior autoimmune disease population [50]. Our study was also comprehensive in employing both SNOMED and ICD10 codes, mitigating some of the bias that may depend on whether an ICD10 code was available and reducing the barrier for information sharing between registries that used only SNOMED or only ICD10 codes. The robustness of our findings thus strengthens the plausibility of the association between increased COVID-19 severity and increased risk of new autoimmune disease. While our study provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. Given the lack of test supply early in the pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the U.S. was initially reserved for hospitalized patients, while those with presumed SARS-CoV-2 infection not sick enough to require hospitalization were urged to quarantine at home contributing to type 2 error by not counting true cases of COVID-19. To mitigate the possibility of misclassification, we included a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Recent studies have also demonstrated that relying on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed or PCR or antigen test-confirmed infections may not capture those in the community or those diagnosed by home testing or those who were felt to have classical chest x-ray findings of COVID-19 [4,15,17,22]. Although we employed two billing codes on separate days to identify incident autoimmune disease, rather than one as in most past studies, we acknowledge that no validated definition for all autoimmune disease exists or is feasible in such data, and it may have led to some misclassification of disease status. We began follow-up 30 days after the index SARS-CoV-2 infection to reduce the likelihood that infection-related non-specific symptoms of systemic inflammation were miscoded as new autoimmune disease, but this may still have occurred. Another potential limitation is that two years of follow-up would not capture long-term risk of autoimmune disease; autoantibodies may be present for up to ten years prior to development of RA, for example [51]. Additionally, patients with autoimmune diseases often experience prolonged \u201cdiagnostic delays\u201d, both due to lack of recognition of classical signs and symptoms, and due to the slow onset of disease. Thus, it is likely that some cases of autoimmune disease were undiagnosed in these study cohorts. The broad nature of symptoms attributed to post-acute syndrome of COVID-19 (PASC) may have also led to underdiagnosis of autoimmune disease in individuals after COVID-19. However, this misclassification would likely have biased our results toward the null, if at all. Disparate findings between N3C and PCORnet with respect to COVID severity and risk of autoimmune disease may be due in part to inherent network differences. During the initial phases of COVID-19 pandemic, ICUs were at capacity and many smaller hospitals sought higher level care for the most seriously ill patients. Patients who were more ill may have been referred to larger clinical sites represented in PCORnet for their COVID-19 care, but not followed there before or after, which may explain some of the discrepancies seen between the N3C and PCORnet. Patients in N3C had more encounters in their EHR and higher baseline healthcare utilization than did those enrolled in PCORnet; incomplete capture of baseline covariates and outcomes may have influenced results in PCORnet more than the other networks. Additionally, despite the discrepancy COVID-19 severity levels aHRs, we identified prior utilization had an association with both COVID-19 severity and incident AD with risk of incident AD increasing as prior utilization increases across networks (S5 Fig). Unfortunately, prior utilization is especially sensitive to data warehouse constructions and architecture, and this may have contributed to disparate results seen across networks. While we adjusted for all important confounders identified, there was much missing data on some important lifestyle factors, such as that smoking, which can both increase COVID-19 severity and risk factor for autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis [52\u201354] Thus, there is the possibility of both misclassification and residual confounding by such shared risk factors. We were also unable to include vaccination status as immunization was not well documented in the RECOVER EHR cohort, and therefore strategically selected an enrollment period a priori so that vaccination use would naturally be limited in the study population. However, we could not fully assess the role of vaccination on AD incidence during 2 years of follow-up. A subsequent check of raw vaccination numbers confirmed that <1% of the population was vaccinated with any COVID-19 vaccine in the 180\u201314 days prior of their index SARS-CoV-2 infection across EHR networks. Due to our study period, we were unable to assess the complex relationship between vaccination, autoimmune disease, and COVID-19 that future research must address. Specifically, the potential for vaccination to both mitigate (through SARS-CoV-2 prevention) or increase autoimmune disease risk via mechanisms such as molecular mimicry, adjuvants, and bystander activation requires further study [55]. Our study design was also not intended to investigate the impact of reinfections after the index infection or other putative effect modifiers on autoimmune disease outcomes. Furthermore, we performed analyses adjusting for multiple potential confounders but were unable to perform propensity score matched or weighted analyses given relatively small sample sizes in each of the categories of infection, particularly among the PEDSnet population.\n\nConclusion The current study presents compelling evidence of an association of increasing acute COVID-19 severity with increasing risk of developing autoimmune diseases in the period up to two years following infection. Ongoing data collection and analyses of post-COVID-19 syndromes and autoimmune disease at the population level may be able to elucidate relationships of incident autoimmune disease with different COVID-19 variants, and the influence of having more than one SARS-CoV-2 infection. An equally important question for future studies is whether primary SARS-CoV-2 infection after April 1, 2021, potentially with less virulent viral strains that began to circulate in late 2021, along with increasing population vaccination, are associated with lower future risks of post-COVID-19 autoimmune disease.\n\nAcknowledgments We would like to thank the National Community Engagement Group (NCEG), all patient, caregiver and community representatives, and all the participants enrolled in the RECOVER Initiative.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the \u201climma\u201d package in R, and volcano plots were generated. Functional enrichment of DEGs was performed with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Logistic regression and multivariate Cox regression models were established for diagnostic and prognostic prediction. The immortalized liver cell line THLE-3 and HepG2 cells were used to verify key gene expression via RT-qPCR and Western blot. HepG2 cells were transfected to up- and down-regulate SNAPC2 expression, and cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8, colony formation, scratch, transwell migration assays, and flow cytometry with Annexin V-PE/7-AAD staining. Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of SNAPC2 revealed its involvement in cancer-related pathways.\n\nThe long-term efficacy in liver cancer depends on early diagnosis and treatment, for example, the combination of alpha-fetoprotein and imaging examination is the main auxiliary means of early diagnosis [ 4 ]. The treatment methods of liver cancer include hepatectomy, liver transplantation, local ablation, TACE, radiotherapy and other means [ 5 ]. For primary liver cancer, some patients with mild disease have a better prognosis. The prognosis of secondary liver cancer is related to the nature of primary cancer, the time of liver metastasis, the severity of primary and metastatic cancer at the time of discovery, the sensitivity of tumor to drug treatment, and individual factors. Data showed that about 70% of HCC recurred within 5 years after resection or ablation, and 75% of HCC recurred within 2 years after liver transplantation [ 6 ]. Therefore, screening markers related to early diagnosis, invasion and metastasis of HCC is of great significance to improve the therapeutic effect and prognosis of HCC.\n\nLiver cancer is a malignant tumor that occurs in the liver, including primary liver cancer and metastatic liver cancer. Primary carcinoma of liver is a kind of cancer that occurs in liver cells or intrahepatic bile duct cells. It is the fourth common malignant tumor and the third cause of tumor death in the world, which seriously threatens the life and health of people [ 1 ]. Primary liver cancer mainly includes three different pathological types: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic bile duct (ICC) and HCC-ICC mixed type [ 2 ]. There are great differences in pathogenesis, biological behavior, histological morphology, treatment methods and prognosis among these three types of liver cancer. Among them, hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for more than 85% \u221290%, and has high degree of malignancy, strong infiltration and metastasis. In February 2019, Harvard Medical School and other research institutions included a follow-up study of about 120,000 subjects [ 3 ]. It was found that eating more whole grains was associated with a lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly reduced by 37% compared with the population who ate the least.\n\nExtracting proteins from tissues or cells and collecting the supernatant with total protein in it. Total protein concentrations of the whole tissue- or cell-extracts were measured using BCA Protein Quantitation kit (P0012, Beyotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Adding the loading buffer at 1/4 of the total protein solution volume, then cell lysis was denatured at 100 \u00b0C spoiling water for 15 min for the subsequent SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Subsequently, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (IPVH00010, Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA) which were blocked with 5% skim milk (G5002, Serveicebio, Wuhan, China) at room temperature for 1 h, and were incubated with primary antibodies (CDCA8: 1:1000 dilution, Cat. No. A15463, Abclonal; GRPEL2: 1:1000 dilution, Cat. No. A8339, Abclonal; HAVCR1: 1:1000 dilution, Cat. No. A2831, Abclonal; MT3: 1:1000 dilution, Cat.

Washing the membranes with PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20) for 15 min and incubating membranes with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase labelled goat anti-mouse IgG: 1:5000 dilution, Cat. No. ZB-2305, ZSGB-Bio; horseradish peroxidase labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG: 1:5000 dilution, Cat. No. ZB-2301, ZSGB-Bio) at room temperature for 40 min. After washing membranes with PBST for 15 min, the antibody-reactive bands were revealed (Tanon-5200, Shanghai Tanon Life Science Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Here, GAPDH was used as the internal reference.\n\nTransfected cells were cultured for 24 h and harvested by trypsinization with no EDTA. After being washed twice with cold PBS and being collected following centrifugation, cells were re-suspended in the 1 \u00d7 binding buffer (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL). Subsequently, 100 \u03bcL cell suspension with 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells in it were stained with 5 \u03bcL Annexin-V-PE and 5 \u03bcL 7-AAD (Annexin V-PE/7-AAD apoptosis kit, MA0429, Meilunebio, Dalian, China) at a room temperature for 15 min. The operations of staining were fulfilled in dark condition and cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometer (NovoCyte, Agilent Technologies Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Results were analyzed by CellQuest and visualized by two-color dot plot.\n\nFirstly, two horizontal lines were drawn on the back side of the 12 wells, and about 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells were added to every well according to designed groups. The next day, changing into medium with low concentration and using a sterile pipette tip of 10 \u03bcL to make a single scratch vertical to the pre-drawn lines. Washing cells for three times, followed by culturing cells in the medium with 0.5% FBS in it and incubated in 5% CO 2 at 37 \u00b0C. Taking photos for scratch at 0, 24 and 48 h (CKX53, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), the migration ratio was calculated according to the scratch images through ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Moreover, another assay for measuring migration was performed using the transwell kit (3422, Corning, New York, USA). Cell suspension (100 \u03bcL) of 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells with no serum in medium were added into the upper chamber and complete medium (600 \u03bcL) with 30% FBS in it was added to the lower chamber. After being incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, removing the nonmetastatic cells which were on the membrane top surface and stained the metastatic cells which were on the membrane lower surface with Giemsa. Subsequently, metastatic cells were examined under an inverted fluorescent microscope (CKX53, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 100 \u00d7 magnification. Three random fields were photographed for counting cells and the average number of migrated cells was used as a quantification of migration capacity.\n\nThe THLE-3 and HepG2 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Beijing Zhongyuan Polymer Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) and were cultured in the Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) (PM150210, Wuhan Punosa Life Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (164210, Wuhan Punosa Life Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) and 1% penicillin as well as 1% streptomycin (15140122, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China). We confirmed that mycoplasma testing has been done for the cell lines used in this study and the short tandem repeats (STR) identification showed that there was no cross contamination in the cell lines used in this study.\n\nBased on the merged and normalized GEO data sets, acquiring the expression data of those 10 genes in prognostic model in both tumor samples and normal samples. To avoid the effect of over-dispersion, quasi-binomial logistic regression was used to construct the diagnostic model instead of binomial logistic regression. Finally, diagnostic model was constructed by 6 genes of MYCN, NDRG1, TXNRD1, SNAPC2, PHOSPHO2 and CDCA8 using logistic regression. Moreover, the Concordance index (C-index) was calculated and the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) with the area under it (time-dependent AUC) was plot were to effectively evaluate the discriminative ability of the diagnostic model, a nomogram based on the 6 genes was built for subsequent clinical use and a calibration plot was used to determine the calibrating ability.\n\nIn which for each gene in this signature, is their coefficients and is their normalized count. For verifying the ability of this diagnostic model, differentiating subgroups of high and low gene expression levels as well as high and low risk score and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to estimate the cumulative probability of surviving in a given time duration for patients in different subgroups. Further, the efficiency of the prognostic model was verified using operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve at 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8- years.\n\nFunctional enrichment analysis was performed by mapping all DEGs to terms in the GO database. The analysis of GO term was classified into three subgroups: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF). Moreover, all DEGs were also mapped to the KEGG database. The P-value < 0.05 and q-value < 0.05 were set as statistical threshold for searching for significantly enriched pathways. All these analyses were down in the R computing environment and mainly by the packages of \u201cclusterProfilier\u201d and \u201corg.Hs.e.g.,db\u201d. The bar plots, bubble plots and a network of relations between pathways were plotted to describe the enrichment of functions.\n\nFor further evaluating the effects of selected genes on clinic, the gene expression profile and corresponding clinical data were downloaded from TCGA ( https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ ) by checking \u201cliver and intrahepatic bile ducts\u201d, \u201cTCGA\u201d, \u201cTCGA-LIHC\u201d for \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ctranscriptome profiling\u201d, \u201cGene Expression Quantification\u201d for \u201cfiles\u201d. In this data set, valid expressing data of 50 normal samples and 374 tumor samples and clinical information of 369 tumor samples could be utilized for the analysis of this study. The expression profile of this data in TCGA represented the normalized count of each gene in every sample.\n\nThe result of CCK-8 assay was shown in Fig 8A , si-SNAPC2 cells possessed lower OD value while OE-SNAPC2 cells possessed higher OD value. The same result was shown in Fig 8B that si-SNAPC2 formed less colonies while OE-SNAPC2 formed more colonies. The results of CCK-8 assay and colony-forming assay indicated that the liver cancer cells with lower/higher expression of SNAPC2 possessed lower/higher level of proliferation. The results of cell scratch test ( Fig 8C ) and transwell migration assay ( Fig 8D ) showed that cells with lower expression of SNAPC2 migrated less than cells with higher expression of SNAPC2. The result of flow cytometry ( Fig 8E ) showed that the apoptosis of liver cancer cells with lower SNAPC2 expression was more than that of cells with higher SNAPC2 expression.\n\nIn order to explore and verify the prognostic value of these signature genes, we determined their expression in cancer cells and normal cells by RT-qPCR ( Fig 7A ) and western blot ( Fig 7B ). The results showed that the expression of CDCA8, GRPEL2, HAVCR1, MYCN, NDRG1, PHOSPHO2, SNAPC2, MT3 and TXNRD1 was significantly up-regulated in liver cancer cells compared with normal cells. While the expression of SOCS2 was down-regulated. The results of RT-qPCR ( Fig 7A ) and Western Blot ( Fig 7B ) showed that the expression of SNAPC2 was down-regulated in HepG2 cells with SNAPC2 knockdown vector (si-SNAPC2) while up-regulated in HepG2 cells with SNAPC2 overexpression vector (OE-SNAPC2), which indicated that the transfection in the experiments was successful.\n\nThe P value acquired by the Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test for the binomial and quasi-binomial logistic regression was 0.005, which was less than 0.05 and showed an over-dispersion. Therefore, the quasi-binomial logistic regression was used to construct the model for diagnosis. The result of model with 10 genes showed that 6 genes of MYCN, NDRG1, TXNRD1, SNAPC2, PHOSPHO2 and CDCA8 were more significantly associated with diagnosis of tumor according to the statistical filter of P < 0.05. The Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test was then performed to examine the distinction of diagnostic efficacy between the 10-gene model and 6-gene model. The result of 0.0322 showed the distinction and therefore, the 6-gene model was more reliable as diagnostic signature. The summary of this model was shown in Fig 6A . The forest of summarizing the diagnostic model, showed the coefficients of every expressing level of genes. The P-value suggested the association of genes expression and the probability of experiencing liver cancer. The odds ration showed association between expression of genes and the presence of liver cancer: OR < 1 suggested individuals were more likely to experience liver cancer when the expression of the gene increases, and conversely, less expression of gene showed less probability of suffering from liver cancer. Therefore, an increasing expression of CDCA8 lead a higher probability of presenting liver cancer. The C-index was 0.989 and the AUC was 0.989 in the ROC curve ( Fig 6B , the sensitivity along the y axis versus its 1-specificity along the x axis) described that along all range of specificity (or sensitivity), the sensitivity (or specificity) was reasonable, suggesting a reasonable estimation and discrimination accuracy of this model. In consequence, this model was capable of discrimination between individuals who experience liver cancer and individuals who do not. For clinical utility of this model, a nomogram was constructed incorporating these 6 genes ( Fig 6C ), a total point was calculated by the use of the expressing levels of 6 genes. The expressing level of each of these genes was given a point on the point scale axis, the total points could be easily acquired by adding each single point. Afterwards, estimating the probability of liver cancer by projecting the total point to the lower scale named \u201ctumor\u201d. Moreover, a calibration curve of the nomogram was presented in Fig 6D . The y axis represented the actual probability of liver cancer and x axis represented the predicted probability of liver cancer. The perfect prediction was corresponded to the ideal line. The Apparent line representing the entire cohort in our data (n = 172) and the Bias-corrected line representing bootstrapping (B = 1000 repetitions), indicated the performance of nomogram. In this plot, there were a close over-position between the apparent line and the Bias-corrected line and these two lines were closely near the ideal line, which illustrated that the predicted probabilities of experiencing liver cancer by the nomogram agreed well with the actual probabilities of experiencing liver cancer.\n\nAccording to the model we established and the risk score calculated by the model, individuals with liver cancer could be stratified into two subgroups with discrete overall survival by the median risk score the group of high-risk and the group of low-risk. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was shown in Fig 4D , illustrating those patients with high-risk scores possessed more remarkably reduced overall survival compared with patients with low-risk score. The P-value < 0.0001 verified the promising efficacy of the model to estimate prognosis. Additionally, the ROC curve in Fig 4E showed the true positive rate along the y axis versus its false positive rate along the x axis. According to curves and the AUCs of different survival duration, the estimation accuracy of this model was reasonable since the AUC of 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival were 0.836, 0.764 and 0.744, respectively. Although the AUC of the curve estimate 8-year survival was 0.668, which was referable, the curve itself was excessively vibrating, decreasing the accuracy and reliability of this model. The gene expressions were classified into two subgroups according to the median of expression levels, and the Kaplan-Meier survival curves of each signature gene were draw to assess the prognostic values of them ( Fig 5 ). According to these curves, CDCA8, GRPEL2, HAVCR1, MT3, MYCN, NDRG1, PHOSPHO2, SNAPC2, SOCS2 and TXNRD1 were relevant to the overall survival of liver cance.\n\nThe univariate Cox regression analyze was performed on the overlapping DEGs and according to the statistical threshold of P-value < 0.05, 2141 genes were screen as being closely relevant to the prognosis and were further analyzed by LASSO regression. 16 DEGs were screened for subsequent analysis by LASSO regression ( Figs 4A and 4B ) and by univariate Cox regression analysis, 10 most relevant genes: CDCA8, GRPEL2, HAVCR1, MT3, MYCN, NDRG1, PHOSPHO2, SNAPC2, SOCS2 and TXNRD1, were identified and utilized for constructing the prognostic signature. Fig 4C summarizes the multivariable survival analysis based on the expression of 10 genes. The hazard ratio analysis indicated that higher expression levels of HAVCR1, MT3, MYCN, NDRG1, PHOSPHO2, SNAPC2, and TXNRD1 were associated with poorer prognosis, whereas higher expression levels of SOCS2 were associated with a more favorable prognosis.\n\nThe bar plot and bubble plot of GO analysis ( Figs 2A and 2B ) showed the DEGs were associated with catabolic process, adhesion and binding, cell differentiation and morphogenesis for Biological Process (BP), focal adhesion, cell-substrate junction, cell leading edge, membrane raft, regulator complex for RNA polymerase II transcription and matrix for Cell Component (CC), adaptor activity and binding for Molecular Function (MF). Fig 2C showed the top 50 pathways enriched and the relations among them. The pathways for life cycle of T cell as well as differentiation, adhesion and activation of other cells were relevant to each other and were largely enriched by the DEGs. Moreover, cellular catabolic process was relevant to the protein catabolic process and autophagy was relevant to catabolic process.\n\nThis study compared the gene expression of GSE39791 and GSE84402 from the GEO database and TCGA database in tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues of patients with liver cancer. Based on the merged and normalized data sets of GSE39791 and GSE84402, 10961 down-regulated genes and 3321 up-regulated genes were identified. TCGA data set included 272 down-regulated genes and 4855 up-regulated genes. The description of DEGs in GEO database and TCGA database were shown in Fig 1A and Fig 1B , the Fig 1C indicated that there were 3820 DEGs differentially expressed in both GEO database and TCGA database. Among these 3820 intersecting DEGs, 208 DEGs were down-regulated and 3612 DEGs were up-regulated. The gene names of the 3,820 overlapping DEGs have been included in S1 File .\n\nDiscussion\n\nPatients with primary liver cancer lack typical clinical manifestations in the early stage. Once symptoms and signs appear, most patients with liver cancer have entered the middle and late stage. Therefore, the early diagnosis of liver cancer is of great significance for treatment. Bioinformatics screening and monitoring techniques are helpful for early diagnosis and intervention and good prognosis of patients with liver cancer [7]. In this study, 10961 down-regulated genes and 3321 up-regulated genes were identified from GEO data sets (merged and normalized by GSE39791 and GSE84402) and 272 down-regulated genes and 4855 up-regulated genes were identified from TCGA database. Based on these, 3820 differentially expressed genes in both GEO data sets and TCGA database, including 208 down-regulated genes and 3612 up-regulated genes were screened out. The referable prognostic signature was constructed by multivariate Cox regression analyze incorporating CDCA8, GRPEL2, HAVCR1, MT3, MYCN, NDRG1, PHOSPHO2, SNAPC2, SOCS2 and TXNRD1. The performance of this model was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier analysis and ROC curve. Additionally, a reasonable diagnostic signature was established by quasi-binomial logistic regression incorporating MYCN, NDRG1, TXNRD1, SNAPC2, PHOSPHO2 and CDCA8. The C-index and ROC curve were used to assess the estimation and a nomogram and a calibration curve were plot for further clinical utility.\n\nMoreover, GO analysis and KEGG analysis of overlapping DEGs were carried out. The results of GO annotation showed that DEGs were associated with catabolic process, life cycle of cells as well as the adhesion, binding, differentiation and morphogenesis of cells [8\u201310]. The results of KEGG pathway analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly related to cancer and diseases, virus infection, life cycle of cells and several significant signaling pathways. Among those signature genes, the CDCA8 is significantly associated with the prognosis and has been verified could be an independent predictor for a poor prognosis in liver cancer [11]. Further, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) between low and high CDCA8 expression datasets showed that CDCA8 was relevant to cell cycle, ErbB signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway. In addition, the CDCA8 has been proved could promote the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by activating CD44 [12]. In this study, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of individual gene suggested that patients with high expression of CDCA8 possessed distinguished poor survival compare with patients with low expression of CDCA8. The gene of GRPEL2 was well verified in the maintaining of mitochondrial homeostasis which is meaningful to several biological process for cancer survival. It has been proved that the knockdown of GRPEL2 suppressed the growth, invasion and migration in vitro, as well as inhibited the growth of tumor in vivo. Moreover, the deficiency of GRPEL2 also lead cell apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and accelerating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [13]. HAVCR1 is an important role in renal regression and immunity and has been published could be an biomarker for the prognosis and diagnosis for pan-cancer [14] and also can be used for prognosis for gastric cancer [15]. MYCN is a member of an oncogene family named MYC and encodes a basic transcription factor N-MYC. The deregulation of the MYC oncogene family has been found in many types of cancer and is relevant to a poor prognosis [16]. The targeting of MYCN as a therapeutic approach has been considered broadly. Since it is \u201cundruggable\u201d, the focus is alternatively on the molecular mechanisms such as disrupting the transcription and translation of MYCN, decreasing the protein stability of N-MYC and its synthetic lethality [17]. The NDRG1, which is the abbreviation of N-MYC downregulated gene-1, is a target gene which is repressed by N-MYC [18]. This gene is a regulator of oncogenes and the function of it in cancer depends on the type of tumor cell and the status of cancer [19]. The overexpression of SOCS2 could inhibit NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [20], TGF\u03b2 pathways [21] and JAK-STAT pathway [22]. The gene of TXNRD1 has been proved to be regulated by the Mrf2/keap1 pathway as an antioxidant [23] and closely correlated with mTOR signaling pathway [24]. Mtallothionein (MT) is a low molecular weight protein with metal binding ability and high induction property [25\u201327]. The structure of MT is highly conservative in biological evolution, and there are mainly four isomers. MT-\u2160 and MT-\u2161 are widely present in most mammalian visceral organs, especially liver and kidney cells, and participate in their function regulation. The distribution of MT-\u2162 is mainly limited to the central nervous system, mainly distributed in astrocytes (concentrated in cell bodies and processes), following by neurons. It is also reported that a small amount of MT-\u2162 is distributed in germ cells, small intestine, stomach, kidney and olfactory cortex cells [28].\n\nHowever, among the 10 selected key genes in the present study, few studies were down for SNAPC2. Especially, there were no researches about SNAPC2 affecting liver cancer. In this present study, we firstly explored the effects of SNAPC2 on liver cancer. Based on the survival analysis on SNAPC2, we confirmed that the lower expression of SNAPC2 was related to the better prognosis of liver cancer. The results revealing proliferation, migration and apoptosis of transfected liver cancer cell HepG2 illustrated that lower the expression of SNAPC2 could decrease the proliferation and migration of liver cells while increase the apoptosis of liver cancer cells, thus improve the prognosis of liver cancer. Furthermore, as a transcription factor, SNAPC2 plays a crucial role in the mechanistic understanding of liver cancer. Our analysis indicates that SNAPC2 activates several key oncogenic pathways, including MYC, E2F, Notch, and PI3K signaling pathways, all of which are closely associated with tumor proliferation, metabolic reprogramming, and malignant transformation. Furthermore, SNAPC2 enhances glycolysis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancerous samples, which may promote tumor cell invasiveness and metastatic potential. Glycolysis, a hallmark of tumor cells, not only provides the necessary energy for tumor cell proliferation but also influences cancer progression by modulating the tumor microenvironment. EMT is a critical process by which tumor cells acquire invasive and metastatic properties. Through regulating these pathways, SNAPC2 may drive the progression of liver cancer. In summary, as a critical transcription factor, SNAPC2 not only provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying liver cancer but also represents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease.\n\nIn the current research, one limitation of this study is the lack of further experimental validation of the downstream pathways regulated by SNAPC2. In future studies, we plan to further investigate the direct regulatory relationships of SNAPC2 with key genes in these pathways. Another limitation is that the in vitro experiments in this study used the HepG2 hepatoblastoma cell line. Although the results from these experiments validated our previous bioinformatics findings, this choice may impose certain limitations in further mechanistic exploration. Therefore, future studies will incorporate additional liver cancer cell lines with well-defined origins to further validate the reliability and generalizability of our findings and facilitate the exploration of subsequent mechanisms.", "Summary": "This research focuses on identifying key genes and pathways related to liver cancer progression using bioinformatics analysis.

Trump has used these levers of government to punish perceived enemies before.\n\nTrump vs. Biden on Tech: A Quick Recap\n\nTo understand the threat, it helps to look at how Trump and Biden differ on tech policy.\n\nBiden\u2019s administration took a structured approach.\n\nA sweeping 2023 Executive Order laid out AI safety rules, the CHIPS Act pumped billions into AI and chip research, and 2024 guidance told agencies to stop tossing AI into public systems without oversight.\n\nWhile not publicly waving the open-source flag, the Biden White House quietly backed it \u2013 with research grants, calls for transparency, and pressure on Big Tech\u2019s closed ecosystems.\n\nTrump, by contrast, ran tech policy on impulse.\n\nHe didn\u2019t offer an AI roadmap but acted fast when politics got personal. He clashed with Amazon, tried to force a TikTok sale, and blocked foreign deals in the name of national security.\n\nHis \u2018America First\u2019 stance made life harder for U.S. firms operating globally. Now that he\u2019s back in office, the same instincts may return \u2013 with a sharper edge.\n\nWith Musk no longer in his good graces, xAI might find itself squarely in the blast radius.\n\nInside the $5B Bet: Why xAI Needs the Money\n\nSo what exactly is this $5B Musk is chasing \u2013 and why is it such a big deal?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a typical Silicon Valley raise. xAI is pursuing convertible debt \u2013 essentially a loan that can later convert into equity if things go well. It\u2019s a financing move that gives investors a path to future ownership without betting on today\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlongside this, Musk\u2019s companies are exploring a $300M secondary share sale that would value xAI at a staggering $113B.\n\nBut the political feud has spooked some investors. Early demand was strong, but the price of xAI\u2019s debt has reportedly slipped from 99 cents to 95 cents on the dollar, and yields have begun to climb.\n\nThat\u2019s a clear sign that political noise is bleeding into financial risk.\n\nThe money isn\u2019t for marketing or headcount. It\u2019s for serious infrastructure. xAI wants to build custom data centers designed to run massive language models \u2013 the kind that eat GPUs for breakfast.\n\nxAI has purchased a warehouse and land off Tulane Road, Memphis to build data centers.\n\nSource: Google Maps\n\nThese aren\u2019t rented AWS servers. They\u2019re physical, high-performance facilities meant to match the scale and speed of rivals like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.\n\nThis kind of ambition is expensive. Training state-of-the-art models can cost hundreds of millions \u2013 and that\u2019s before the electricity bill.\n\nIn the current AI arms race, having a good idea isn\u2019t enough. You need hardware, access, and deep pockets.\n\nBut raising that kind of money puts xAI at the mercy of financial markets \u2013 and potentially, political ones. If Trump\u2019s White House starts tightening the screws, even the best-laid technical roadmap could hit a wall.\n\nWhat Happens If the Deal Falls Through?\n\nIf xAI fails to land the $5B, it\u2019s not just a delay \u2013 it\u2019s a serious roadblock.\n\nThe company\u2019s goal of building competitive, open-source AI models depends on vast compute resources. Without the money, xAI could fall behind in both scale and speed. That wouldn\u2019t just hurt Musk. It would stall one of the few efforts aiming to keep AI development from becoming fully corporate and closed-door.\n\nGrok, xAI\u2019s chatbot, may not be fully open-source, but it\u2019s marketed as a more open, independent alternative to the Big Tech models. Losing that alternative would narrow the playing field.\n\nIn a world where most frontier AI development is bankrolled by the world\u2019s biggest corporations and steered by government alliances, losing xAI\u2019s vision to politics would send a grim message: openness doesn\u2019t scale unless power approves.\n\nAnd if that becomes the new normal, it won\u2019t stop at Musk. It\u2019s a blow to the whole idea of open and decentralized AI.\n\nOpen-Source AI Needs Protection From Politics\n\nThe irony here runs deep.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018, officially due to conflicts with Tesla\u2019s AI work \u2014 but he\u2019s since accused the company of drifting toward closed, profit-driven models, especially after its partnership with Microsoft and shift to a for-profit structure. That, in his view, was a betrayal of OpenAI\u2019s original mission.\n\nIn 2023, he founded xAI with a different promise: to build \u2018truth-seeking\u2019 AI and push back against what he described as Big Tech\u2019s growing control over artificial intelligence.\n\nBut now, those ideals are under threat \u2013 not from market failure or lack of demand, but from political friction and personal grudges. And that should concern anyone who believes AI innovation shouldn\u2019t hinge on which billionaires get along with which presidents.\n\nImagine if Linux developers had to worry about presidential approval before pushing a kernel update. Or if Python\u2019s core library needed sign-off from a national security office. Absurd, right? But that\u2019s not far off from where we\u2019re headed as foundational AI becomes deeply entangled in geopolitics, regulation, and personality-driven policymaking.\n\nAI is becoming critical infrastructure. That means it can be steered, blocked, or co-opted by governments. And if Trump sees AI as a strategic asset \u2013 or a threat \u2013 he may treat companies like xAI the way he treated TikTok or Huawei: comply or be sidelined.\n\nMusk\u2019s Political Risk Problem\n\nThere\u2019s also a bigger pattern here. Musk is a man of many companies and few filters. That worked well when government contracts were being handed out and he was the darling of innovation.\n\nBut as his political commentary has gotten louder, the backlash is catching up.\n\nTesla is under increased scrutiny, with federal investigations into its Autopilot system and high-profile safety recalls. SpaceX has faced FAA regulatory delays, particularly with Starship launches.\n\nStarlink has drawn foreign policy concerns too \u2013 especially after Musk\u2019s role in Ukraine\u2019s military communications raised alarms in Washington and Europe.\n\nStarlink terminal in Donetsk, Ukraine.\n\nImage by Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nNow, xAI faces the same kind of vulnerability, with its future tied not just to tech milestones, but to political favor.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about whether Musk is right or wrong politically. It\u2019s about whether one man\u2019s social media posts can jeopardize multibillion-dollar tech ventures. The answer, increasingly, is yes.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nIf xAI pulls off the debt deal anyway, it would be a win for Musk and a sign that private capital still believes in the mission. But if the deal stalls or gets downsized, don\u2019t just blame interest rates or the economy. Blame politics.\n\nWe\u2019re entering an era where innovation doesn\u2019t just compete with other companies. It competes with political whims.\n\nThat\u2019s a dangerous precedent.\n\nBecause today it\u2019s Musk and xAI. Tomorrow it could be any startup that dares to challenge the status quo \u2013 or pisses off the wrong president.\n\nOnline Tech Tips, Help Desk Geek, Framework, Insta360, Redmagic, Inmotion, Secretlab, Kodak, and Anker, reviewing their products in real-life scenarios.

The young man with autism began to pitch hay, seed land, and collect and sort eggs from free-range chickens. Now 37, Zachary still enjoys meaningful work there, his mother says.\n\n\u201cThere's no ultra-processed food,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey truly believe that nutrition is a source of wellness. Overall, they optimize Zachary's physical health. He is physically active every day.\u201d\n\nThe perks of farm living\u2014fresh air, sunshine, and seasonal produce\u2014are why agriculture-based neighborhoods, or \u201cagrihoods,\u201d have kept sprouting since the start of the century. They incorporate some type of agriculture, such as a working farm or community garden, whose harvests go to residents. Agrihoods provide an amenity the whole family can learn from, let residents be part of a team, and preserve the land. Neurologists say this model and the food it provides could help delay early brain aging and dementia and prevent other neurologic conditions, too.\n\nThe United States has about 200 agrihoods in at least 30 states across a variety of climates, including Florida, Illinois, Colorado, and Hawaii, according to a 2024 report by the National Association of Home Builders. They exist in rural communities and around cities.\n\nA Growing Movement\n\nThe first well-known model was Agritopia, built in Gilbert, AZ, outside Phoenix. Construction began in 2001, and Agritopia continues to thrive. Newer neighborhoods include upscale housing at Arden in Palm Beach County, FL, and affordable housing units at Agrihood in urban Santa Clara, CA. The farms tend to focus on growing produce, but some also keep livestock.\n\nSome agrihoods grow food just to feed their own residents, while others offer Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm shares, which consumers pay for in advance; sell crops at farmer's markets; or provide produce for on-site stores where residents can shop. People can enjoy getting their hands dirty or, if they have mobility issues, sitting down to help package herbs or mark prices. Some have children's programs or incorporate animals, such as Catskills Agrihood on Hope Street in New York.\n\nSerenbe Farms, an agrihood with more than 1,000 residents in Chattahoochee Hills, GA, was built around a 25-acre certified organic farm starting in 2004. It aims to \u201cconnect people to nature, to each other, and to a lifestyle that prioritizes holistic well-being, starting with access to fresh, local produce,\u201d says Amy Peterson, Serenbe's community operations and relationships manager. Ten to 20 residents volunteer each week, growing vegetables, fruit, flowers, and herbs.\n\nMary Collins-Shepard spends her days sowing seeds in a greenhouse, transplanting seedlings, and organizing produce at Serenbe. \u201cEngaging with my neighbors at the farm is energizing, but the time can also be very meditative if I happen to be working alone,\u201d says the 67 year old, who moved to the agrihood outside Atlanta from Knoxville, TN, with her husband seven years ago.\n\nThe produce she helps grow and harvest goes into Serenbe's CSA system, Saturday farmer's market, and farm-to-table restaurants\u2014efforts that benefit not only her but also her neighbors.\n\nSome homes for people with developmental challenges have similar setups, such as Camphill North America community living programs, which serve people with autism, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and other conditions. Residents at Camphill Hudson in New York, for example, eat the produce they grow. Former president Tim Paholak has been involved since 1976 and calls the program life-changing: \u201cDeveloping community is a vital component of human health for all of us.\u201d\n\nBrain Benefits\n\nDemetrius M. Maraganore, MD, FAAN, professor and chair of the department of neurology at Tulane University School of Medicine and co-director of the Healthy Brain Aging Initiative at University Medical Center of New Orleans, says farm-centric living fits nicely into Healthy Brain's mission to prevent cognitive decline and dementia with evidence-based lifestyle and behavioral interventions.\n\n\u201cMy father developed Alzheimer's disease, and so did his mother and her mother,\u201d says Dr. Maraganore. \u201cI thought, \u2018How can I prevent this? We need to change our lifestyle and habits.\u2019 \u2026 My passion is to harness nutrition to develop treatments for Alzheimer's. We now have the opportunity to prevent it.\u201d\n\nHe stands by a Mediterranean-style diet, which usually includes lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, with olive oil as a primary fat source and dairy products, eggs, fish, and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts. It centers on minimally processed, plant-based foods and limits sugar, fried food, refined carbohydrates, and saturated fats.\n\nNikolaos Scarmeas, MD, PhD, of the department of neurology at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece and Columbia University, said by email that a \u201cMediterranean-like diet\u201d has \u201cthe most scientific support regarding less risk for cognitive decline and dementia.\u201d It can improve blood flow and circulation in the brain and promote better overall cardiovascular health, Dr. Maraganore adds.\n\nA review of 64 studies by Tulane's Healthy Brain Aging Initiative team in 2022 found that the Mediterranean diet can help promote gut health, which may be neuroprotective, and was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The researchers also found that the diet's nutrient-dense and fiber-rich foods (compared to the typical low-fiber Western diet) may be beneficial for not only overall health but also healthy brain aging.\n\nNot everyone can easily access these foods, Dr. Maraganore points out, especially if they live in a \u201cfood desert,\u201d an area with limited access to fresh, affordable, and nutritious food. This makes moving to agrihoods appealing. With farm-grown produce, he says, \u201cyou can stick closer to a good diet.\u201d\n\nSunshine also provides vitamin D, an anti-inflammatory; not having enough vitamin D is a risk factor for Parkinson's, stroke, and Alzheimer's, says Dr. Maraganore, who points out other agrihood benefits, too: \u201cThe community involvement and socialization in a farm venture can keep aging brain cells from dying and reduce dementia and anxiety.\u201d\n\nLearn More\n\nFor farm-to-table recipes with fresh, seasonal ingredients, visit Brain & Life's Nutrition page.", "Summary": "This article explores the potential benefits of agrihoods (agriculture-based neighborhoods) for mental and neurological health.

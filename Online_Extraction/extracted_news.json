    "Full Article Text": "That chatbot is only telling you what you want to believe, according to a new study.\n\nWhether you're using a traditional search engine like Google or a conversational tool like OpenAI's ChatGPT, you tend to use terms that reflect your biases and perceptions, according to the study, published this spring in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. More importantly, search engines and chatbots often provide results that reinforce those beliefs, even if your intent is to learn more about the topic.\n\nFor example, imagine you're trying to learn about the health effects of drinking coffee every day. If you, like me, enjoy having exactly two cups of joe first thing in the morning, you may search for something like \"is coffee healthy?\" or \"health benefits of coffee.\" If you're already skeptical (maybe a tea purist), you might search for \"is coffee bad for you?\" instead. The researchers found that framing of questions could skew the results -- I'd mostly get answers that show the benefits of coffee, while you'd get the opposite.\n\n\"When people look up information, whether it's Google or ChatGPT, they actually use search terms that reflect what they already believe,\" Eugina Leung, an assistant professor at Tulane University and lead author of the study, told me.\n\nThe abundance of AI chatbots, and the confident and customized results they so freely give you, makes it easier to fall down a rabbit hole and harder to realize you're in it. There's never been a more important time to think deeply about how you get information online.\n\nThe question is: How do you get the best answers?\n\nAsking the wrong questions\n\nThe researchers conducted 21 studies with nearly 10,000 participants who were asked to conduct searches on certain preselected topics, including the health effects of caffeine, gas prices, crime rates, COVID-19 and nuclear energy. The search engines and tools used included Google, ChatGPT and custom-designed search engines and AI chatbots.\n\nThe researchers' results showed that what they called the \"narrow search effect\" was a function of both how people asked questions and how the tech platforms responded. People have a habit, in essence, of asking the wrong questions (or asking questions in the wrong way). They tended to use search terms or AI prompts that demonstrated what they already thought, and search engines and chatbots designed to provide narrow, extremely relevant answers, delivered on those answers. \"The answers end up basically just confirming what they believe in the first place,\" Leung said.\n\nRead more: AI Essentials: 29 Ways to Make Gen AI Work for You, According to Our Experts\n\nThe researchers also checked to see if participants changed their beliefs after conducting a search. When served a narrow selection of answers that largely confirmed their beliefs, they were unlikely to see significant changes. But when the researchers provided a custom-built search engine and chatbot designed to offer a broader array of answers, they were more likely to change.\n\nLeung said platforms could provide users with the option of a broader, less tailored search, which could prove helpful in situations where the user is trying to find a wider variety of sources. \"Our research is not trying to suggest that search engines or algorithms should always broaden their search results,\" she said. \"I do think there is a lot of value in providing very focused and very narrow search results in certain situations.\"\n\n3 ways to ask the right questions\n\nIf you want a broader array of answers to your questions, there are some things you can do, Leung said.\n\nBe precise: Think specifically about what exactly it is you're trying to learn. Leung used an example of trying to decide if you want to invest in a particular company's stock. Asking if it's a good stock or a bad stock to buy will likely skew your results -- more positive news if you ask if it's good, more negative news if you ask if it's bad. Instead, try a single, more neutral search term. Or ask both terms and evaluate the results of each.\n\nGet other views: Especially with an AI chatbot, you can ask for a broad range of perspectives directly in the prompt. If you want to know if you should keep drinking two cups of coffee a day, ask the chatbot for a variety of opinions and the evidence behind them. The researchers tried this in one of their experiments and found they got more variety in results. \"We asked ChatGPT to provide different perspectives to answer the query from the participants and to provide as much evidence to back up those claims as possible,\" Leung said.\n\nAt some point, stop asking: Follow-up questions didn't work quite as well, Leung said. If those questions aren't getting broader answers, you may get the opposite effect -- even more narrow, affirming results. In many cases, people who asked lots of follow-up questions just \"fell deeper down into the rabbit hole,\" she said.",
    "Summary": "This article discusses a study on how search engines and chatbots reinforce users' existing beliefs.  Eugina Leung, an assistant professor at Tulane University and the lead author of the study, is quoted extensively.  The article highlights Leung's research and expertise, thus portraying Tulane positively."

    "Full Article Text": "Jonathan Mayers, a co-founder of Superfly Entertainment who also served as a co-founder of game-changing music festivals like Bonnaroo and Outside Lands, has died, Billboard and a Bonnaroo representative confirmed to Pitchfork He was 51.\n\nAfter growing up a short drive from New York and graduating from Tulane University, in 1995, Mayers immersed himself in the music world through work at the storied New Orleans institutions Tipitina’s and Jazz Fest. In 1996, he co-founded the promotion company Superfly Entertainment with Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone, and Kerry Black. The group organized its first concert—the Meters, Maceo Parker, and Rebirth Brass Band—during Mardi Gras, before setting sights on bigger ideas.\n\nIn 2002, Mayers and his Superfly coworkers launched the inaugural Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, in Manchester, Tennessee. They sought out an open expanse of land on a farm an hour outside of Nashville, and booked headliners Trey Anastasio (of Phish) and Phil Lesh and Bob Weir (of Grateful Dead) to top the bill. The four co-founders partnered with promoter Ashley Capps of AC Entertainment, agent Chip Hooper of Paradigm Talent Agency, and manager Coran Capshaw of Red Light Management, and the rest was history. The first-ever Bonnaroo sold out, and the 70,000-person capacity festival would go on to become a recurring success. In a few years’ time, Bonnaroo would not only inspire dozens of music festivals across America, but also serve as the blueprint for how to rethink music festivals in the modern era under tighter restrictions compared to the Woodstock era.\n\nJust a few years later, Superfly started Vegoose, an annual Halloween music and arts festival, with multi-venue programming across Las Vegas in 2005. Mayers partnered with San Francisco’s Another Planet Entertainment to launch Outside Lands, in Golden Gate Park, in 2008. That multi-genre, multi-day music festival grew to become the largest independently owned music festival in the United States.\n\nIn addition to starting other events around the country, like the comedy-focused festival Clusterfest in San Francisco in 2017, Mayers also turned his attention toward film and TV rights holders to start immersive experiences for fans. By licensing rights from popular shows like Friends, Seinfeld, The Office, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and more, Mayers and his team recreated TV sets in various cities that allowed fans to “step inside” their favorite series.\n\nIn August 2021, Superfly terminated Mayers’ position at the company following internal disagreements with the three other co-founders of the entertainment company. The next year, Mayers sued Farman, Goodstone, and Black, accusing them of civil misrepresentation, breach of contract, and fraud over the underestimated value of his shares in Superfly. In January 2023, a New York judge dismissed the lawsuit. Mayers went on to focus on Core City Detroit, a new project investing in a music campus for local artists that also could host public events.",

    "Full Article Text": "Reliable and affordable energy must overcome bureaucratic resistance.\n\nPresident Trump’s four executive orders on nuclear energy, issued on May 23, 2025, are blazing a bold path to an energy future where electricity will be more reliable and more economical.\n\nBy unleashing advanced nuclear technologies, streamlining regulations, and bolstering the domestic nuclear industry, these orders aim to deliver 400 gigawatts of clean, reliable power by 2050 – a quadrupling of current capacity. This vision promises energy independence, economic prosperity, and national security. Yet, entrenched anti-prosperity bureaucrats, timid politicians, and a misinformed public, swayed by decades of anti-nuclear propaganda, stand ready to obstruct this transformative agenda. America must address these obstacles in order to reclaim its leadership in the field of nuclear energy.\n\nOverhaul of the Nuclear Overseers\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which was formed after the dismemberment of the Atomic Energy Commission, has long served as a choke point for nuclear progress. The NRC was designed from the get-go to follow the agenda of anti-nuclear advocates, and consequently, it has licensed only two reactors since 1978, stifling innovation. Trump’s orders demand a sweeping overhaul, capping exorbitant NRC fees and mandating licensing decisions within eighteen months. This aggressive reform dismantles barriers, but bureaucrats accustomed to sluggish processes will resist, clinging to technologically outdated risk-averse frameworks.\n\nAmerica’s existing nuclear fleet—light water and pressurized water reactors—boasts the best safety record of any industry in America. Advanced nuclear designs, like small modular reactors, microreactors and Generation IV systems, push safety even further, with designs able to operate reliably even without human intervention. Trump’s orders prioritize the deployment of these advanced designs, targeting five gigawatts of “power uprates” (increasing the electricity output of existing reactors) and ten large new reactors by 2030. Yet, detractors will cry “impossible,” and claim that government staff reductions, as ordered for the NRC, will compromise safety. In reality, NRC had more than enough staff and time to address a legitimate petition involving safety with respect to cooling spent nuclear fuel pools, choosing to instead to deny it. Given this track record, the public interest will be better served by a leaner and more focused regulator that puts the onus of safety and liability squarely on the industry.\n\nTurning Mislabeled “Waste” into Energy to Make Nuclear “Renewable”\n\nDecades of misinformation have mislabeled partially used nuclear fuel as “waste.” In reality, this stockpile, mischaracterized during the Carter administration, holds trillions of dollars in potential energy if converted to electricity. Experts have long argued that this “waste” could provide America with clean, carbon-free electricity for hundreds of years.\n\nThe concept of recycling partially used nuclear fuel was recommended to the Biden Administration’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on multiple occasions, yet that administration took no action. Trump’s orders have established a motivated plan to process this partially used fuel for advanced reactors, which will release this vast, hidden taxpayer asset value while reducing foreign dependency. The challenge will be overcoming the government bureaucracy’s previous “build back better” mindset that only wind and solar are “renewable.”\n\nNew Nuclear Test Sites and a New Nuclear Workforce\n\nThe Department of Energy’s (DOE) nuclear testing, centered at national labs like Idaho National Laboratory, is facing scrutiny for slow resolutions. Trump’s orders demand a cultural shift by establishing test sites outside labs by July 4, 2026, and ensuring reactors are operational within two years. This urgency will spark competition in the electric power sector, breaking monopolistic inertia. Still, the national lab system’s sluggish reputation could hinder progress unless private sector efficiency drives the process.\n\nA robust nuclear workforce is critical. The US “Nuclear Navy” offers a model for rapidly training top-tier nuclear personnel. Trump’s call for private sector-led apprenticeships and education programs mirrors this approach. By empowering industry over government, America can build a top-tier workforce swiftly, fueling reactor deployment and economic growth.\n\nThe Crossroads of Energy Security and National Security\n\nImportantly, even more importantly the executive orders bolster national security by designating nuclear-powered AI data centers and military bases as critical infrastructure. By deploying advanced reactors at DOE and Department of Defense (DOD) sites by 2028 and securing twenty new nuclear export agreements, the U.S. can lead globally. However, anti-nuclear advocates, steeped in decades of fearmongering, will push back by attempting to delay export deals and domestic progress.\n\nTrump’s nuclear revolution is not just a policy shift, it’s a call to action. America stands at a crossroads: embrace advanced nuclear power for affordable, abundant energy or succumb to the inertia of bureaucrats and misinformation. Only one of those roads leads to prosperity and energy security, and America must take it.\n\nAbout the Authors: Tommy Waller and Douglas Ellsworth\n\nLt. Col.

But through offseason programs and OTAs, he is acclimating well.\n\n\"Caleb's doing awesome,\" said defensive backs coach Anthony Perkins. \"We were very excited just during the draft process, we thought based on his skill set what he showed on tape, he'd be able to make that transition and play more at safety and he hasn't disappointed. He's done a tremendous job.\"\n\nIn coverage, Ransaw was stingy during his college career, allowing a completion rate of just 49% over the last two seasons with one interception and three pass breakups. He's also been a very reliable tackler.\n\nRansaw also brings a lot of speed to the defensive backfield, running a 4.33-second 40 during the pre-draft process.\n\nWith Eric Murray, we could see Ransaw tasked with more often being the strong safety within this defense, which would still position him closer to the line of scrimmage, where the bulk of his playing time has come.\n\nHowever, in Anthony Campanile's malleable defensive scheme, versatility and the ability to move players around will be important elements, which could lead to Ransaw filling a few different roles.\n\n\"Every day's a new day, every rep is a new rep, so he's learning,\" added Perkins. \"All those safeties are learning, but he's doing a tremendous job of picking it up. I think he's super athletic. I think he's got a very high ceiling in this league, and I'm excited to continue to see him grow within the scheme of our defense.\"\n\nAlong with Ransaw, Darnell Savage, Antonio Johnson, and Andrew Wingard are competing for playing time next to Murray as well.",

He was 51.\n\nBonnaroo started in 2002, and the 2025 edition is set to begin in Manchester, Tennessee, this week on Thursday, June 12.\n\nNo cause of death has yet been announced.\n\nIn a statement to Billboard, Red Light Management founder Coran Capshaw said: “This is incredibly tough news for so many of us. Jon was the creative force behind so much of what people experience at Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, and many other events over the years. We’re all really going to miss him.”\n\nMayers graduated in 1995 from Tulane University in New Orleans, where he became interested in concert promotion through his work at legendary local venue Tipitina’s and the city’s long-running Jazz Fest.\n\nThe following year, he co-founded Superfly with partners Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone and Kerry Black, and the fledgling promotions company hosted their first concert during Mardi Gras.\n\nThe four worked together to launch Bonnaroo in 2002 after securing the festival site on farmland in Manchester, an hour outside of Nashville. They worked closely with Capshaw’s Red Light Management and other industry figures to book headliners, including the Grateful Dead’s Phil Lesh and Bob Weir.\n\nIn 2008, Mayers partnered with Another Planet Entertainment to create the Outside Lands festival in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park.\n\nAs well as music festivals, Mayers also partnered with television shows to create “immersive” fan experiences based on series including Friends, Seinfeld, The Office, South Park, Arrested Development, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and The Daily Show.\n\nMayers left Superfly acrimoniously in 2021, and the following year sued his former partners Farman, Goodstone and Black, accusing them of civil misrepresentation, breach of contract and fraud. Mayers alleged that they had misrepresented the value of his shares in the promotions company. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2023.\n\nSuperfly said in a statement to Billboard: “We are heartbroken with the passing of Jonathan. He was a cherished part of Superfly’s story, woven into it’s history and legacy. In addition to the role he’s played in bringing joy to millions, we will miss his razor sharp wit, infectious smile and contagious laugh. No one could light up a room like Jon.”\n\nIn the years following his departure from Superfly, Mayers worked on the Core City Detroit project to raise money for the city’s regeneration.\n\nThis year’s Bonnaroo will see headline performances from the likes of Tyler, the Creator, Olivia Rodrigo and Hozier.\n\nDayglo Presents founder Peter Shapiro said in a statement that contemporary festivals owe a debt to Mayers’s work behind the scenes.\n\n“Jonathan was one of the true real visionaries of the modern concert world and one of the core minds behind Bonnaroo,” Shapiro told Billboard. “Modern-day festivals are all in some way built off of his vision.”",

    "Full Article Text": "Measuring child labor accurately is a major challenge: parents’ and children’s reports tend to differ dramatically, and there is typically no way to verify whose reports are truthful (if any). To overcome this challenge, this paper uses novel data from a cocoa certifier in Côte d’Ivoire that draws on satellite imagery to minimize under-reporting. Concretely, aerial photos allow them to select remote and hard-to-reach communities—where parents typically have not been sensitized by government or NGOs, averting social desirability biases—and to visit these communities while cocoa is being harvested—precisely when children in employment are very visible, making it easier for enumerators to impute it if parents still fail to report it. We compare their figures with those obtained from business-as-usual surveys with parents and children in these regions, and find that (1) reporting inconsistencies between parents and their children in fact decrease with household remoteness; (2) adults dramatically under-report child labor relative to the certifier data, by a factor of at least 60%; and (3) in turn, children self-reports are statistically identical to the latter. Taking advantage of an experiment that randomly assigned a text-message campaign to discourage child labor, we further show that parents’ reports not only underestimate its prevalence, but can even lead to the wrong conclusions about the effects of policy interventions.\n\nFunding: Study conducted in partnership with Transforming Education in Cocoa Communities (TRECC) and generously funded by the Jacobs Foundation Science of Learning initiative.

Any views and opinions contained in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of TRECC or the Jacobs Foundation.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nChild labor is a pervasive practice in agriculture, especially in West Africa, where the global cocoa industry sources roughly half of its produce. Defined according to international standards and national legislation, child labor typically characterizes any work by children under the age of 12, and excessive or risky work by 12–17 year-olds (see Section 2.1.1). 2020 data from the International Labor Organization (ILO) documented 160 million child workers worldwide—9.6% of all 5–17 year-old children [1]. Strikingly, that figure was over 2-fold in Sub-Saharan Africa (23.9%). In Côte d’Ivoire, the setting of our study, 15% of the cocoa industry employees that year were children [2].\n\nWhile such figures have mobilized massive global attention and resources to combat child labor, a key challenge in interpreting them is reliability. This is because while official statistics on child labor are essentially based on adult reports (see Section 2.1.1), there are many reasons why parents or caregivers may fail to truthfully disclose children in employment. They might fear that admitting to child labor (e.g., that their under-12 year-old children help during the harvest season) could lead them to face legal action from child protective services, or adversely impact their livelihoods (e.g., if the companies sourcing from them are punished for child labor in their supply chain, which could trickle down to lower prices or even to discontinuation of their income; see [3]). Importantly, if parents omit children in employment, child labor will be under-estimated in the data—since child labor is contained in children in employment.\n\nThis paper uses novel data from a cocoa certifier in Côte d’Ivoire to overcome this challenge. ENVERITAS, a global NGO that certifies smallholder coffee and cocoa farms when it comes to agricultural best practices—including the absence of child labor –, draws on satellite imagery to minimize under-reporting. Concretely, aerial photos allow them (1) to select remote and hard-to-reach communities, where parents typically have not been sensitized by government or NGO campaigns to discourage child labor, averting social desirability biases; and (2) to visit these communities during harvest season, precisely when child labor is very visible, making it easier for enumerators to mark it as present even if parents still fail to report it. We compare their figures with those obtained from business-as-usual surveys with parents and children in these regions, which partially overlap with the remote villages where ENVERITAS certifies farming practices. Our sample focuses on primary school children, nearly all under 12 years old—for whom any hours in employment are classified as child labor by national legislation.\n\nBefore turning to the certifier data, we start by documenting patterns in reporting discrepancies in our own surveys that lend credibility to our empirical strategy. Restricting attention to households in our sample with valid GPS location data, 29.3% of adults admit that their children worked at least an hour in cocoa fields in the month before the survey. In contrast, 51.8% of children report that they did so—a striking 77% average difference in reporting rates. First, we document that such discrepancies indeed decrease with the distance from each household to the school their children attend: the difference between children’s and parents’ reports decrease significantly with every additional km from the school, consistent with ENVERITAS’s claim that village remoteness is inversely related to reporting biases. Second, we estimate that children’s self-reports do not increase with distance from the school, minimizing concerns with child labor in more remote villages misrepresenting its typical prevalence. We further document that not only are discrepancies between children’s and parents’ reports much lower when it comes to domestic work—a more socially acceptable activity and typically not the subject of advocacy campaigns, in contrast to labor in cocoa fields –, but also, that such discrepancies do not decrease with household remoteness. All in all, results back up the certifiers’ sampling strategy as a way of measuring the ground truth for the prevalence of child labor, which we can then use to validate parents’ and children’s reports in the sub-sample for which the two datasets overlap.\n\nOur main contribution is to document first-hand that adult surveys indeed under-report the prevalence of child labor, and the extent of under-reporting. In regions with subsequent third-party verification, 45.5% of children reported having worked in cocoa plantations in the previous month, matching almost exactly the 47.8% prevalence indicated by the certifier; in contrast, only 16.2% of parents in those regions reported children in employment—a nearly 2/3 reporting gap. Across regions, under-reporting ranged from 60% to 85%.\n\nPrevious studies were not able to document the extent of under-reporting by parents. These papers rely on three types of comparisons. First, comparisons between parents’ reports under different conditions for social desirability bias [e.g., 4], to document that such biases exist—but unable to pin down their magnitude. Second, comparisons between adults’ and children’s reports [5,6], to document that discrepancies exist—but unable to pin down what the ‘ground truth’ is. Third, comparisons between an objective measure of children in employment and children’s self-reports [7], to document that the latter are accurate—but unable to pin down under-reporting by parents. Similarly to ours, the latter study documents that children accurately report the number of hours they work, using logs from GPS trackers worn by different household members to verify data from surveys and activity diaries. The study, however, actively refrained from having enumerators ask adults about child labor. In the absence of parents’ reports, it could not document whether parents under-report children in employment and, if so, by how much.\n\nOur second contribution is to document that basing child labor accounts on surveys with parents not only underestimates its prevalence, but can also bias evaluations of how it responds to policy interventions. Taking advantage of a randomized control trial that assigned some Ivorian parents to messages discouraging child labor in cocoa fields to study whether the estimated impact of the intervention on child labor depends on how the latter is measured, we find that while messages had no effect on children in employment according to children themselves, they significantly increased children in employment according to parents (by 55.1%). Presumably, the reason for such discrepancy is that the intervention tried to foster investments in children that would reduce children’s participation in labor activities without explicitly condemning child labor—partially deterring social desirability biases. Once again consistent with the claim that such biases are stronger in communities that have been previously sensitized, treatment effects on child labor according to parents sharply decay with our measure of remoteness.\n\nThese findings have key implications for how child labor should be measured. One possibility is to survey children directly (the ‘who’). Our results indicate that this would most likely yield accurate estimates of children in employment, but it might also involve complex technical and ethical dilemmas. It might be hard to ensure a unified understanding of what characterizes employment, especially among younger respondents. Most importantly, participation might put children at risk if it triggers backlash by parents. An alternative is to survey adults, as usual, but to focus on hard-to-reach communities (the ‘where’) during harvest season (the ‘when’)—leveraging technological advances such as satellite imagery. We further discuss the implications and limitations of our findings in Section 4.",

Trump – Musk fallout is spooking investors: What started as a public feud has turned into a financial risk, with xAI’s debt price dropping and yields climbing as investors worry about regulatory blowback.\n\nWhat started as a public feud has turned into a financial risk, with xAI’s debt price dropping and yields climbing as investors worry about regulatory blowback. Musk’s vision for Open AI faces new threats: Musk originally launched xAI to counter Big Tech’s closed AI systems with a more ‘truth-seeking’ approach. Now that vision is vulnerable to political grudges, not just market forces.\n\nMusk originally launched xAI to counter Big Tech’s closed AI systems with a more ‘truth-seeking’ approach. Now that vision is vulnerable to political grudges, not just market forces. Politics are becoming a bottleneck for innovation: As AI becomes critical infrastructure, its future increasingly depends on political favor. xAI shows how quickly open innovation can become collateral in a power struggle.\n\nWhen Elon Musk launched xAI, he promised a future where AI wouldn’t be controlled by a handful of corporate giants. He talked about building a safer, more transparent, and open-source alternative to OpenAI.\n\nBut now, Musk’s big plans may run into a political buzzsaw with an old name and a renewed grip on power: President Donald Trump.\n\nThis week, reports surfaced that xAI is trying to raise $5B in debt financing to ramp up its infrastructure and compete with the likes of OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n\nThe money would go toward building supercomputers and training massive language models.\n\nBut here’s the catch: this kind of funding usually depends on more than just investor excitement. It often involves government contracts, partnerships, and regulatory green lights.\n\nAnd Trump might not be in the mood to play nice with Musk.\n\nThat’s not just gossip. That’s a financial risk.\n\nForget the Feud – This Is About Financing\n\nThe media loves a Musk vs. Trump story.\n\nThere’s plenty of material: Musk’s not-so-subtle jabs at Trump, Trump’s comments about Elon being ‘a liberal’ when it suits him, the weird friendship-turned-friction that played out across X.\n\nBut beneath the memes and soundbites is a serious issue for xAI: politics can now choke off tech innovation, especially when egos are involved.\n\nElon Musk’s companies thrive on public-private relationships. Tesla benefited from massive government subsidies. SpaceX has NASA contracts. Starlink is practically a life-or-death utility in some parts of the world.\n\nEven xAI, which Musk presents as independent, would be affected by national AI strategies, GPU export regulations, and possible government partnerships.\n\nIf Trump sees xAI as part of Musk’s broader empire – or worse, a political rival – he has ways to make life harder.\n\nA delayed export license here, a denied federal AI grant there, a tax incentive that quietly disappears. These aren’t hypotheticals. Trump has used these levers of government to punish perceived enemies before.\n\nTrump vs. Biden on Tech: A Quick Recap\n\nTo understand the threat, it helps to look at how Trump and Biden differ on tech policy.\n\nBiden’s administration took a structured approach.\n\nA sweeping 2023 Executive Order laid out AI safety rules, the CHIPS Act pumped billions into AI and chip research, and 2024 guidance told agencies to stop tossing AI into public systems without oversight.\n\nWhile not publicly waving the open-source flag, the Biden White House quietly backed it – with research grants, calls for transparency, and pressure on Big Tech’s closed ecosystems.\n\nTrump, by contrast, ran tech policy on impulse.\n\nHe didn’t offer an AI roadmap but acted fast when politics got personal. He clashed with Amazon, tried to force a TikTok sale, and blocked foreign deals in the name of national security.\n\nHis ‘America First’ stance made life harder for U.S. firms operating globally. Now that he’s back in office, the same instincts may return – with a sharper edge.\n\nWith Musk no longer in his good graces, xAI might find itself squarely in the blast radius.\n\nInside the $5B Bet: Why xAI Needs the Money\n\nSo what exactly is this $5B Musk is chasing – and why is it such a big deal?\n\nThis isn’t a typical Silicon Valley raise. xAI is pursuing convertible debt – essentially a loan that can later convert into equity if things go well. It’s a financing move that gives investors a path to future ownership without betting on today’s valuation.\n\nAlongside this, Musk’s companies are exploring a $300M secondary share sale that would value xAI at a staggering $113B.\n\nBut the political feud has spooked some investors. Early demand was strong, but the price of xAI’s debt has reportedly slipped from 99 cents to 95 cents on the dollar, and yields have begun to climb.\n\nThat’s a clear sign that political noise is bleeding into financial risk.\n\nThe money isn’t for marketing or headcount. It’s for serious infrastructure. xAI wants to build custom data centers designed to run massive language models – the kind that eat GPUs for breakfast.\n\nxAI has purchased a warehouse and land off Tulane Road, Memphis to build data centers.\n\nSource: Google Maps\n\nThese aren’t rented AWS servers. They’re physical, high-performance facilities meant to match the scale and speed of rivals like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.\n\nThis kind of ambition is expensive. Training state-of-the-art models can cost hundreds of millions – and that’s before the electricity bill.\n\nIn the current AI arms race, having a good idea isn’t enough. You need hardware, access, and deep pockets.\n\nBut raising that kind of money puts xAI at the mercy of financial markets – and potentially, political ones. If Trump’s White House starts tightening the screws, even the best-laid technical roadmap could hit a wall.\n\nWhat Happens If the Deal Falls Through?\n\nIf xAI fails to land the $5B, it’s not just a delay – it’s a serious roadblock.\n\nThe company’s goal of building competitive, open-source AI models depends on vast compute resources. Without the money, xAI could fall behind in both scale and speed. That wouldn’t just hurt Musk. It would stall one of the few efforts aiming to keep AI development from becoming fully corporate and closed-door.\n\nGrok, xAI’s chatbot, may not be fully open-source, but it’s marketed as a more open, independent alternative to the Big Tech models. Losing that alternative would narrow the playing field.\n\nIn a world where most frontier AI development is bankrolled by the world’s biggest corporations and steered by government alliances, losing xAI’s vision to politics would send a grim message: openness doesn’t scale unless power approves.\n\nAnd if that becomes the new normal, it won’t stop at Musk. It’s a blow to the whole idea of open and decentralized AI.\n\nOpen-Source AI Needs Protection From Politics\n\nThe irony here runs deep.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018, officially due to conflicts with Tesla’s AI work — but he’s since accused the company of drifting toward closed, profit-driven models, especially after its partnership with Microsoft and shift to a for-profit structure. That, in his view, was a betrayal of OpenAI’s original mission.\n\nIn 2023, he founded xAI with a different promise: to build ‘truth-seeking’ AI and push back against what he described as Big Tech’s growing control over artificial intelligence.\n\nBut now, those ideals are under threat – not from market failure or lack of demand, but from political friction and personal grudges. And that should concern anyone who believes AI innovation shouldn’t hinge on which billionaires get along with which presidents.\n\nImagine if Linux developers had to worry about presidential approval before pushing a kernel update. Or if Python’s core library needed sign-off from a national security office. Absurd, right? But that’s not far off from where we’re headed as foundational AI becomes deeply entangled in geopolitics, regulation, and personality-driven policymaking.\n\nAI is becoming critical infrastructure. That means it can be steered, blocked, or co-opted by governments. And if Trump sees AI as a strategic asset – or a threat – he may treat companies like xAI the way he treated TikTok or Huawei: comply or be sidelined.\n\nMusk’s Political Risk Problem\n\nThere’s also a bigger pattern here. Musk is a man of many companies and few filters. That worked well when government contracts were being handed out and he was the darling of innovation.\n\nBut as his political commentary has gotten louder, the backlash is catching up.\n\nTesla is under increased scrutiny, with federal investigations into its Autopilot system and high-profile safety recalls. SpaceX has faced FAA regulatory delays, particularly with Starship launches.\n\nStarlink has drawn foreign policy concerns too – especially after Musk’s role in Ukraine’s military communications raised alarms in Washington and Europe.\n\nStarlink terminal in Donetsk, Ukraine.\n\nImage by Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nNow, xAI faces the same kind of vulnerability, with its future tied not just to tech milestones, but to political favor.\n\nThis isn’t about whether Musk is right or wrong politically. It’s about whether one man’s social media posts can jeopardize multibillion-dollar tech ventures. The answer, increasingly, is yes.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nIf xAI pulls off the debt deal anyway, it would be a win for Musk and a sign that private capital still believes in the mission. But if the deal stalls or gets downsized, don’t just blame interest rates or the economy. Blame politics.\n\nWe’re entering an era where innovation doesn’t just compete with other companies. It competes with political whims.\n\nThat’s a dangerous precedent.\n\nBecause today it’s Musk and xAI. Tomorrow it could be any startup that dares to challenge the status quo – or pisses off the wrong president.\n\nOnline Tech Tips, Help Desk Geek, Framework, Insta360, Redmagic, Inmotion, Secretlab, Kodak, and Anker, reviewing their products in real-life scenarios.

    "Full Article Text": "Courtesy The Center for Discovery\n\nKaren London's son, Zachary, was 19 when he began living at The Center for Discovery in New York's Catskill Mountains, where residents eat what they grow on 300 certified organic acres. The young man with autism began to pitch hay, seed land, and collect and sort eggs from free-range chickens. Now 37, Zachary still enjoys meaningful work there, his mother says.\n\n“There's no ultra-processed food,” she adds. “They truly believe that nutrition is a source of wellness. Overall, they optimize Zachary's physical health. He is physically active every day.”\n\nThe perks of farm living—fresh air, sunshine, and seasonal produce—are why agriculture-based neighborhoods, or “agrihoods,” have kept sprouting since the start of the century. They incorporate some type of agriculture, such as a working farm or community garden, whose harvests go to residents. Agrihoods provide an amenity the whole family can learn from, let residents be part of a team, and preserve the land. Neurologists say this model and the food it provides could help delay early brain aging and dementia and prevent other neurologic conditions, too.\n\nThe United States has about 200 agrihoods in at least 30 states across a variety of climates, including Florida, Illinois, Colorado, and Hawaii, according to a 2024 report by the National Association of Home Builders. They exist in rural communities and around cities.\n\nA Growing Movement\n\nThe first well-known model was Agritopia, built in Gilbert, AZ, outside Phoenix. Construction began in 2001, and Agritopia continues to thrive. Newer neighborhoods include upscale housing at Arden in Palm Beach County, FL, and affordable housing units at Agrihood in urban Santa Clara, CA. The farms tend to focus on growing produce, but some also keep livestock.\n\nSome agrihoods grow food just to feed their own residents, while others offer Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm shares, which consumers pay for in advance; sell crops at farmer's markets; or provide produce for on-site stores where residents can shop. People can enjoy getting their hands dirty or, if they have mobility issues, sitting down to help package herbs or mark prices. Some have children's programs or incorporate animals, such as Catskills Agrihood on Hope Street in New York.\n\nSerenbe Farms, an agrihood with more than 1,000 residents in Chattahoochee Hills, GA, was built around a 25-acre certified organic farm starting in 2004. It aims to “connect people to nature, to each other, and to a lifestyle that prioritizes holistic well-being, starting with access to fresh, local produce,” says Amy Peterson, Serenbe's community operations and relationships manager. Ten to 20 residents volunteer each week, growing vegetables, fruit, flowers, and herbs.\n\nMary Collins-Shepard spends her days sowing seeds in a greenhouse, transplanting seedlings, and organizing produce at Serenbe. “Engaging with my neighbors at the farm is energizing, but the time can also be very meditative if I happen to be working alone,” says the 67 year old, who moved to the agrihood outside Atlanta from Knoxville, TN, with her husband seven years ago.\n\nThe produce she helps grow and harvest goes into Serenbe's CSA system, Saturday farmer's market, and farm-to-table restaurants—efforts that benefit not only her but also her neighbors.\n\nSome homes for people with developmental challenges have similar setups, such as Camphill North America community living programs, which serve people with autism, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and other conditions. Residents at Camphill Hudson in New York, for example, eat the produce they grow. Former president Tim Paholak has been involved since 1976 and calls the program life-changing: “Developing community is a vital component of human health for all of us.”\n\nBrain Benefits\n\nDemetrius M. Maraganore, MD, FAAN, professor and chair of the department of neurology at Tulane University School of Medicine and co-director of the Healthy Brain Aging Initiative at University Medical Center of New Orleans, says farm-centric living fits nicely into Healthy Brain's mission to prevent cognitive decline and dementia with evidence-based lifestyle and behavioral interventions.\n\n“My father developed Alzheimer's disease, and so did his mother and her mother,” says Dr. Maraganore. “I thought, ‘How can I prevent this? We need to change our lifestyle and habits.’ … My passion is to harness nutrition to develop treatments for Alzheimer's. We now have the opportunity to prevent it.”\n\nHe stands by a Mediterranean-style diet, which usually includes lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, with olive oil as a primary fat source and dairy products, eggs, fish, and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts. It centers on minimally processed, plant-based foods and limits sugar, fried food, refined carbohydrates, and saturated fats.\n\nNikolaos Scarmeas, MD, PhD, of the department of neurology at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece and Columbia University, said by email that a “Mediterranean-like diet” has “the most scientific support regarding less risk for cognitive decline and dementia.” It can improve blood flow and circulation in the brain and promote better overall cardiovascular health, Dr. Maraganore adds.\n\nA review of 64 studies by Tulane's Healthy Brain Aging Initiative team in 2022 found that the Mediterranean diet can help promote gut health, which may be neuroprotective, and was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The researchers also found that the diet's nutrient-dense and fiber-rich foods (compared to the typical low-fiber Western diet) may be beneficial for not only overall health but also healthy brain aging.\n\nNot everyone can easily access these foods, Dr. Maraganore points out, especially if they live in a “food desert,” an area with limited access to fresh, affordable, and nutritious food. This makes moving to agrihoods appealing. With farm-grown produce, he says, “you can stick closer to a good diet.”\n\nSunshine also provides vitamin D, an anti-inflammatory; not having enough vitamin D is a risk factor for Parkinson's, stroke, and Alzheimer's, says Dr. Maraganore, who points out other agrihood benefits, too: “The community involvement and socialization in a farm venture can keep aging brain cells from dying and reduce dementia and anxiety.”\n\nLearn More\n\nFor farm-to-table recipes with fresh, seasonal ingredients, visit Brain & Life's Nutrition page.",

    "Full Article Text": "Un nuevo estudio liderado por la Universidad Tulane advierte sobre el aumento de los niveles de mercurio en los ríos. Las consecuencias no solo afectan la salud humana sino también a los ecosistemas.\n\nDesde la Revolución Industrial, la creciente actividad humana ha tenido un gran impacto en el medioambiente. Una evidencia de ello es el aumento de los niveles de mercurio en los ríos del mundo, que se han duplicado. Los altos niveles de este químico no solo tienen graves consecuencias para la salud humana, sino también para los ecosistemas.\n\nLa minería, la combustión de carbón y la industria han aumentado la contaminación por mercurio y han alterado la circulación de los ríos fluviales. Está combinación de factores provocan un fuerte aumento de las concentraciones de este químico, según un estudio de la Universidad Tulane (Estados Unidos). El informe se publicó el miércoles (11.06.2025) en la revista Science.\n\nCientíficos de China, EE. UU y Francia desarrollaron un modelo basado en procesos para simular el transporte de mercurio en los ríos. Los resultados: antes de 1850, los ríos del mundo vertían a los océanos alrededor de 390 toneladas métricas de mercurio al año. Actualmente, los ríos transportan mil toneladas métricas.\n\n\"Las actividades humanas han alterado el ciclo global del mercurio en todos los aspectos\", dijo Yanxu Zhang, profesor de la Universidad Tulane y autor principal del estudio. \"Los estudios anteriores se han centrado en las concentraciones de mercurio en la atmósfera, los suelos y el agua de mar y han pasado por alto en gran medida los ríos, una vía importante para el mercurio que se ha convertido efectivamente en una tubería para las aguas residuales de origen municipal e industrial\", detalla el investigador.\n\nLos resultados del informe tienen importantes implicaciones para la salud humana, ya que el mercurio contiene potentes neurotoxinas que se acumulan en los peces que consumimos. Además, los expertos advierten que la fauna silvestre ha sufrido un aumento preocupante de los niveles de mercurio.\n\nLa minería, la combustión de carbón y la industria han aumentado la contaminación por mercurio y han alterado la circulación de los ríos fluviales. Imagen: Alan Chavez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUn estudio regional\n\nPara la realización del estudio, se creó un modelo informático detallado llamado MOSART-Hg, que simulaba el transporte preindustrial del mercurio desde la tierra hasta los océanos a través de los sistemas fluviales. Los hallazgos coincidieron con las concentraciones de mercurio encontradas en muestras de sedimentos datadas de zonas costeras de todo el mundo, lo que validó el enfoque de la investigación.\n\nLos patrones regionales revelaron que los aumentos más drásticos de la contaminación por mercurio se produjeron en América del Norte y del Sur, que contribuyeron con un 41 por ciento del crecimiento mundial del mercurio fluvial desde 1850, seguidas por el sudeste asiático (22 %) y el sur de Asia (19 %).\n\nEn la región amazónica, los niveles de mercurio se dispararon debido al aumento de la erosión del suelo por la deforestación y a las emisiones de mercurio procedentes de las actividades mineras. \"El balance de mercurio del río Amazonas supera ahora las 200 toneladas métricas al año, y tres cuartas partes de esta cantidad provienen de actividades humanas, principalmente de la minería artesanal\", aseguró Zhang.\n\nEn Asia Oriental, donde los ríos aportan más del 70 % del mercurio global, las emisiones industriales de mercurio se identificaron como el principal factor del aumento de contaminación.\n\nNo todas las regiones experimentaron incrementos\n\nEn la región mediterránea se registraron bajos niveles de mercurio, en comparación con la era preindustrial. Los científicos creen que esto se debe a la construcción de presas como la que se encuentra en el río Nilo.\n\nLos expertos consideran que esta investigación puede ser de gran ayuda para poder gestionar de mejor forma la contaminación por mercurio, y buscar soluciones. Además, opinan que se deberían fijar objetivos mundiales para reducir las emisiones de mercurio fluvial, y restaurar los entornos contaminados.\n\nbt (EFE, Phys.org, ABC)",

    "Full Article Text": "PORTOLA VALLEY, Calif., June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bay Area Lyme Foundation, a leading sponsor of Lyme disease research in the US, has given its 2025 Emerging Leader Award (ELA) to Chao Wang, PhD, associate professor in the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering at Arizona State University, faculty with ASU’s Biodesign Institute® and an expert in nanotechnology and biosensors. Wang will receive $150,000 to support his work to develop a much-needed rapid, low-cost, easy-to-use test, called Nano2RED-LD, for Lyme disease. The test aims to deliver results in as few as 30 minutes when a patient who may have Lyme disease first sees a doctor.\n\nThere is an immense need for better Lyme disease tests. Today’s standard-of-care tests miss too many cases at all stages of Lyme disease, including as many as 70% of early Lyme cases.\n\n“With Lyme disease cases rising steadily across the U.S., the need for accurate and timely diagnostic tools has never been greater,” said Katariina Tuovinen, research grant director, Bay Area Lyme Foundation. “Dr. Wang’s pioneering work epitomizes the essence of this award as it applies innovation from other infectious diseases in an effort to enhance outcomes for patients affected by Lyme disease.”\n\nThis unique diagnostic system uses gold nanoparticles along with an innovative electronically driven data readout system that has shown promise in detecting Ebola and COVID-19, as well as detecting a Lyme protein called OppA2. The platform offers a novel combination of direct and indirect detection for Lyme disease as it detects both antigens and antibodies, producing a clear signal, with the intent to enhance detection. To automatically transmit the data, it leverages a circuit-integrated electronic readout that digitizes the gold nanoparticle signals for accurate and easy data analysis, further simplifying the use of the diagnostic system.\n\nWang’s ELA research project will use samples from Bay Area Lyme Foundation’s Lyme Disease Biobank to measure sensitivity and specificity with positive and negative controls.\n\nWang first used Nano2RED-LD to detect Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, showing it could be about 1,000 times more sensitive than the commonly used ELISA test. Over the past two years, his lab has also demonstrated that Nano2RED-LD can detect the protein OppA2, a lipoprotein and part of a family of proteins in Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. For this research with OppA2, Wang has worked closely with Bay Area Lyme Foundation scientific advisory board member, Monica Embers, PhD, associate professor in the Division of Immunology at Tulane National Primate Research Center, and 2021 ELA winner, Michael Rout, PhD, professor and head of Laboratory of Cellular and Structural Biology at Rockefeller University.\n\n“We believe collaboration between researchers is a key component driving innovative science and appreciate the support Dr. Wang is receiving from the community,” said Linda Giampa, executive director of Bay Area Lyme Foundation. “We are proud to see the extensive resources of our Lyme Disease Biobank being used for such important research, and we value the opportunity to support work that brings us closer to developing improved diagnostics for patients with Lyme disease.”\n\nPrevious Emerging Leader Award recipients have come from institutions, including Brandeis University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Louisiana State University, North Carolina State University, Stanford University School of Medicine, Texas A&M, Tulane University, University of California San Francisco, Rockefeller University, Stanford University, Tufts University, and Northwestern University. Most of these projects were in the early stages of research, and the Emerging Leader Award enabled scientists to generate data required for ongoing support from Bay Area Lyme Foundation and/or government funding. Many findings have been accepted for presentation at well-respected scientific forums or are detailed in peer-reviewed papers.\n\nSince its inception in 2014, the Emerging Leader Award has recognized scientists and researchers with innovative ideas to advance diagnostics or treatments for Lyme disease. Those interested in applying for the 2026 award or exploring additional funding opportunities offered by the Bay Area Lyme Foundation are encouraged to visit: https://www.bayarealyme.org/our-research/grant-process/ .\n\nAbout Lyme Disease\n\nThe most common vector-borne infectious disease in the US, Lyme disease is a potentially disabling infection caused by bacteria transmitted through the bite of an infected tick to people and pets, and can be potentially passed from a pregnant mother to her unborn baby. If caught early, most cases of Lyme disease can be effectively treated, but it is commonly misdiagnosed due to lack of awareness and inaccurate diagnostic tests. Based on the trajectory of Lyme disease cases documented by CDC between 2010 and 2018, Bay Area Lyme estimates that there are now more than 620,000 new cases of Lyme disease each year, and, as a result of the difficulty in diagnosing and treating Lyme disease, up to two million Americans may be suffering from the impact of its debilitating long-term symptoms and complications..\n\nAbout Bay Area Lyme Foundation\n\nBay Area Lyme Foundation , a national organization committed to making Lyme disease easy to diagnose and simple to cure, is the leading public charity sponsor of innovative Lyme disease research in the US. A 501c3 organization based in Silicon Valley, Bay Area Lyme Foundation collaborates with world-class scientists and institutions to accelerate medical breakthroughs for Lyme disease. It is also dedicated to providing reliable, fact-based information so that prevention and the importance of early treatment are common knowledge. Historically a pivotal donation from the LaureL STEM fund covered all overhead costs through 2024. In 2023 a Bay Area Lyme Endowment was formed which allows for 100% of all donor contributions to the Bay Area Lyme Foundation to go directly to research and prevention programs in perpetuity.

Simply put: TikTok. The heart of digital culture has migrated to TikTok, which is a short-form video platform. So there remain memes of a sort — they’re mostly called TikTok trends — but the text-and-image-based memes of years past? Those are harder to come by.”\n\nEngadget: The Oversight Board says Meta isn’t doing enough to fight celeb deepfake scams. “Scams using AI deepfakes of celebrities have become an increasingly prominent issue for Meta over the last couple of years. Now, the Oversight Board has weighed in and has seemingly confirmed what other critics have said: Meta isn’t doing enough to enforce its own rules, and makes it far too easy for scammers to get away with these schemes.”\n\nUSEFUL STUFF\n\nGenealogyBank: Genealogy Tips: Organizing and Preserving Cell Phone Photos. “In this article, Gena Philibert-Ortega gives tips and storage ideas for organizing the photos on your smartphone. Gena is a genealogist and author of the book ‘From the Family Kitchen.'”\n\nAROUND THE SEARCH AND SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD\n\nCalishat: RSS With An Expiration Date: The Temporary Obsessions Feed Reader. “I love RSS; I literally couldn’t do my self-appointed job without it. But when it comes to temporarily monitoring topics, RSS feeds are a bit unwieldy; you have to add another layer of workflow to add/remove feeds, set up reminders for yourself, etc. All that has hitherto discouraged me from using RSS when there was a time-sensitive or current event topic to cover. But RSS is too valuable to leave on the shelf when curating content. So I made a Google Sheets-based tool called Temporary Obsessions Feed Reader.”\n\nDigiday: Marketers set to meet with TikTok in Cannes to discuss the platform’s future plans. “Last year at the Cannes Lions festival, TikTok execs were peppered with questions about the app’s future in the U.S. This time, advertisers want to know about its future, full stop. Whether it’s querying TikTok’s long-term plans for AI, clarity on its partner programs or the inside track on its product road map, marketers on the Croisette are gearing up to determine how the app will (or won’t) fit into their future plans.”\n\nSECURITY & LEGAL\n\nIrish Council for Civil Liberties: Public Services Card database of millions of Irish people’s faces declared illegal . “The decision vindicates the actions taken by ICCL and Digital Rights Ireland against the Department of Employment and Social Protection (DEASP). The Government had previously claimed that the facial records were not biometric data. Today, the DPC found that the Department unlawfully collected facial records (biometric data) from 70% of the population of Ireland over 15 years.”\n\nSky News: 4Chan being investigated by UK officials under new online safety rules. “4Chan, an online forum notorious for its extreme content, is being investigated by UK officials over its failure to comply with new internet safety rules. Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator, said it had received complaints about potential illegal content on 4Chan, as it announced nine new investigations into sites that may have broken new rules.”\n\nRESEARCH & OPINION\n\nTulane University: New Tulane study finds generative AI can boost employee creativity—but only for strategic thinkers. “The employees who benefited most weren’t just using ChatGPT passively. They were actively thinking about how to approach their work, what problems they were trying to solve, and how best to use AI to support their goals. In short, they were skilled at managing their own thinking— planning, reflecting, and adjusting their approach as needed.”\n\nOTHER THINGS I THINK ARE COOL\n\nMIT News: Window-sized device taps the air for safe drinking water. “The system runs entirely on its own, without a power source, unlike other designs that require batteries, solar panels, or electricity from the grid. The team ran the device for over a week in Death Valley, California — the driest region in North America. Even in very low-humidity conditions, the device squeezed drinking water from the air at rates of up to 160 milliliters (about two-thirds of a cup) per day.”\n\nBook Riot: Want To Help Teens Protect The Freedom to Read? Libraries, Apply for Books Unbanned Programming Funding Now . “Libraries nationwide are invited to apply for one-time funds to launch programming for teens and young adults related to the freedom to read. A total of $50,000 in funding will be given out, ranging from $1,000 to $10,000. Any US library is eligible to apply and receive funding, but special consideration will be given to small and rural libraries, where funding and support for such efforts are often more difficult to attain.” Good evening, Internet…\n\nThis newsletter is free but most of the things that go into making it aren’t!

    "Full Article Text": "Weltweit transportieren Flüsse heute etwa zweieinhalb Mal so viel hochgiftiges Quecksilber in die Meere wie noch um 1850. Das berichtet ein internationales Forschungsteam aus der Basis von Messwerten und Computermodellen. Hauptquellen des Schwermetalls sind industrielle Prozesse, Metallbergbau, Kleinbergbau bei der Suche nach Gold sowie die Verbrennung von Kohle, wie die Gruppe um Yanxu Zhang von der Tulane University in New Orleans in der Fachzeitschrift «Science Advances» berichtet.\n\n«Quecksilber-Verbindungen sind starke Nervengifte, die die menschliche Gesundheit gefährden, vor allem durch den Verzehr von Fisch», schreiben die Studienautoren. Weil Quecksilber im Boden vorkommt, wird das giftige Metall natürlicherweise durch Bodenerosion in Flüsse eingetragen. Bisher war jedoch nicht bekannt, wie hoch der globale Quecksilber-Eintrag in Fließgewässer ist. «Frühere Studien konzentrierten sich zwar auf die Quecksilber-Konzentrationen in der Atmosphäre, den Böden und im Meerwasser, haben dabei aber Flüsse weitgehend übersehen», wird Zhang in einer Mitteilung seiner Universität zitiert.\n\nAnstieg von 390 Tonnen auf 1.000 Tonnen pro Jahr\n\nDie Wissenschaftler basierten ihr Modell des vorindustriellen Quecksilber-Exports aus Flüssen in die Ozeane einerseits auf der Quecksilber-Erosion im Einzugsgebiet und andererseits auf der Transportkraft der Flüsse. Diese wiederum hängt von Strömung und Fließgeschwindigkeit des Gewässers ab. Zur Kalibrierung glichen Zhang und Kollegen ihre Simulationsergebnisse für 1850 mit jenen Quecksilber-Werten ab, die in den Sedimentablagerungen einiger Flüsse gemessen wurden. Die simulierten Werte waren tendenziell etwas niedriger als die gemessenen Konzentrationen, sodass das Modell eine eher konservative Schätzung ist.\n\nFür 1850, also zu Beginn der Industrialisierung, gelangten den Kalkulationen zufolge weltweit jährlich etwa 390 Tonnen Quecksilber über Flüsse in die Ozeane. Derzeit sind es demnach rund 1.000 Tonnen Quecksilber pro Jahr.\n\nStärkste Anstiege in Asien und Amerika\n\n«Die Festlegung eines Basiswerts für Quecksilber in Flüssen im vorindustriellen Zeitalter kann als wichtiger Bezugspunkt dienen», betonte Zhang. Daran könne sich die Politik bei der Reduzierung der Freisetzung von Quecksilber orientieren.\n\nBesonders stark stieg die Quecksilber-Menge der Studie zufolge in Flüssen in Südasien und Südostasien sowie in Nord- und Südamerika. «Der Quecksilber-Haushalt des Amazonas beträgt mittlerweile über 200 Tonnen pro Jahr, wobei drei Viertel davon auf menschliche Aktivitäten zurückgehen, hauptsächlich auf Kleinbergbau», erläuterte Zhang.\n\nZudem trage im Amazonasgebiet die starke Abholzung zu stärkerer Bodenerosion bei, so der Forscher. Diese führe ebenfalls zu höheren Quecksilber-Werten im Amazonas.\n\nAuch sibirische Flüsse, die wie Ob und Jenissei in den Arktischen Ozean fließen, transportieren demnach relativ viel Quecksilber ins Meer. Und erst kürzlich hatten Wissenschaftler um Isabel Smith von der University of Southern California in Los Angeles berichtet, dass die Quecksilber-Konzentrationen in den nordamerikanischen Flüssen Yukon und Koyukuk wegen des tauenden Permafrostbodens und der dadurch zunehmenden Bodenerosion deutlich gestiegen sind.\n\nDoch Zhang und Kollegen berichten auch Positives: So ist der Quecksilber-Eintrag ins Mittelmeer im Vergleich zu 1850 gesunken. Dies erklären sie damit dass Staudämme im nordafrikanischen Einzugsgebiet des Nil - etwa der Assuan-Staudamm in Ägypten - von Flüssen transportierte Sedimente zurückhalten.\n\nQuecksilber zählt zu den gefährlichsten Giftstoffen überhaupt. Der Stoff schädigt neben Immun- und Fortpflanzungssystem vor allem das zentrale Nervensystem, wobei ungeborene Kinder besonders empfindlich reagieren. Deshalb raten etwa die US-Behörden Schwangeren, bestimmte Fischarten aus manchen Gebieten zu meiden.\n\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250614-930-668085/1",

    "Full Article Text": "Emails show Tulane’s president was worried about losing state funding for another project because of the professor’s research.\n\nAn environmental researcher at Tulane University resigned Wednesday after accusing campus officials, reportedly under pressure from Gov. Jeff Landry, of issuing a “gag order” that prevented her from publicly discussing her work, which focused on racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce.\n\n“Scholarly publications, not gag orders, are the currency of academia,” Kimberly Terrell, the now-former director of community engagement at Tulane’s Environmental Law Clinic, wrote in her resignation letter. “There is always room for informed debate. But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”\n\nTerrell’s resignation comes amid wider efforts by the Trump administration and its allies to control the types of research—including projects related to environmental justice—academics are permitted to pursue and punish campus protesters for espousing messages the president and other public officials disagree with.\n\n“It started with the pro-Palestinian activism on our campus and others across the country. It’s emboldened a lot of political leaders to feel they can make inroads by silencing faculty in other areas,” Michelle Lacey, a math professor and president of Tulane’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, told Inside Higher Ed. “That was the catalyst for creating a climate where university administrators are very nervous, especially now as we see the government pulling funding for areas of research they don’t like.”\n\nLast spring, Landry praised Tulane president Michael Fitts and university police for removing students who were protesting Israel’s attacks on Gaza. Soon after, the Legislature passed a provision creating harsher punishments for protesters who disrupt traffic, which Landry later signed into law.\n\nLandry, a Republican aligned with Trump, has a history of trying to exert control over the state’s public higher education institutions.\n\nLast summer, he enacted a law that allows him to directly appoint board chairs at the state’s public colleges and universities. And in November, following Trump’s election, Landry publicly called on officials at Louisiana State University to punish a law professor who allegedly made brief comments in class about students who voted for the president.\n\nLandry’s office denied to the Associated Press (which first reported on Terrell’s resignation) that it pressured Tulane to silence research from the law clinic. Michael Strecker, a Tulane spokesperson, also told the outlet that the university “is fully committed to academic freedom and the strong pedagogical value of law clinics” and declined to comment on “personnel matters.”\n\nStrecker added in a statement that Tulane administrators have been working with the law school's leadership on how the law clinics could better support the university's education mission.\n\n\"Debates about how best to operate law clinics’ teaching mission have occurred nationally and at Tulane for years—this is nothing new,\" Strecker said. \"This effort includes most recently input from an independent, third-party review.\"\n\nBut Terrell’s account of the events that led to her resignation call the universities’ academic freedom commitments into question, while also implying that Landry—and powerful industry groups—wield some influence over private higher education institutions in the state.\n\nAnd it’s not something Tulane, a private university in New Orleans, should tolerate, Lacey said.\n\nKimberly Terrell Tulane University\n\n“The academic freedom of all university researchers must be unequivocally defended at both public and private institutions,” Lacey wrote in a statement. “This includes the right to conduct and disseminate research that may be unfavorably viewed by government officials or corporate entities. Political demands to stifle controversial research are an affront to the advancement of knowledge and open exchange of ideas, as is the voluntary compliance with such requests by university leadership.”\n\nThe latest controversy at Tulane stems from a paper Terrell published April 9 in the peer-reviewed journal Ecological Economics. Her research found that while Black people in Louisiana are underrepresented in the state’s petrochemical workforce, they are overexposed to toxic pollutants the industry releases into an area of the state between New Orleans and Baton Rouge known as “Cancer Alley.”\n\nBut according to emails obtained by Inside Higher Ed and other outlets, Fitts worried that publicizing Terrell’s research and the clinic’s other work, which includes legal advocacy, could jeopardize funding for the university’s $600 million plan to redevelop New Orleans’ historic Charity Hospital into residential and commercial spaces as part of a broader downtown expansion plan.\n\nAs Terrell explained in her resignation letter, Fitts and other top Tulane executives were at Louisiana’s state capitol on April 16 lobbying for the project when “someone accused the university of being anti–chemical industry” and cited her study, which was receiving media attention after it was published the week prior. According to Terrell, “the story that came down to me through the chain of command was that Governor Landry threatened to veto any bill with funding for Tulane’s Charity project unless Fitts did something about the Environmental Law Clinic.”\n\n‘Complete Gag Order’\n\nAfter that, Terrell says, she was “placed under a complete gag order,” which the emails appear to confirm.\n\n“Effective immediately all external communications that are not client-based—that is, directly related to representation—must be pre-approved by me,” Marcilynn Burke, dean of Tulane’s law school, wrote in an April 25 email to law clinic staff. “Such communications include press releases, interviews, videos, social media postings, etc. Please err on the side of over-inclusion as we work to define the boundaries through experience.”\n\nA week later, on May 4, Burke wrote another email to clinic staff explaining that “elected officials and major donors have cited the clinic as an impediment to them lending their support to the university generally and this project specifically,” referring to Fitts’s plans to redevelop the old hospital. Terrell wrote that when she pleaded her case to Provost Robin Forman, “he refused to acknowledge my right to freely conduct and disseminate research” and also “let slip that my job description was likely going to be rewritten.”\n\nTerrell described the entire law clinic as being “under siege” and said she would rather leave her position “than have my work used as an excuse for President Fitts to dismantle the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic.”\n\nOther academics, free speech experts and environmental justice advocates also believe Tulane’s moves to silence Terrell’s work amounts to an attack on academic freedom with implications beyond the campus.\n\n“The administration of Tulane University, far from standing up for academic freedom, is participating in the effort to suppress free inquiry and the pursuit of knowledge by scientific methods,” Michael Ash, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts, said in a statement. “Any effort to reduce academic freedom for Dr. Terrell either by changing her job classification or by redefining whether the protection applies is a blatant and un-American attempt to suppress the type of free inquiry that has made this country great.”\n\nJoy Banner, co-founder and co-director of the Descendants Project, a community organization that works in Cancer Alley, added that the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic is a vital public health resource.\n\nWithout the clinic, “it would be far more difficult to show the racially discriminatory practices of the industry, from preferential hiring practices to a pattern of concentrating pollution in majority Black neighborhoods,” she said in a statement. “President Fitts must commit to protecting it at all costs.”",
    "Summary": "This article details the resignation of Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement at Tulane's Environmental Law Clinic, due to alleged censorship of her research on racial disparities in the petrochemical industry. The article portrays Tulane negatively by highlighting the university's alleged suppression of research and potential interference in academic freedom. Tulane is mentioned throughout the article in relation to the controversy."

    "Full Article Text": "Comment / How Jeffrey Goldberg and The Atlantic Blew “the Biggest Story of the Year” How Jeffrey Goldberg and “The Atlantic” Blew “the Biggest Story of the Year” Given advance warning of an impending war crime, the former cheerleader for the Iraq war decided his priority was to protect his scoop.\n\nAtlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg speaks during the opening night of the New Orleans Book Festival at Tulane University on March 27, 2025. (Skip Bolen / Getty Images)\n\nThis article appears in the July/August 2025 issue, with the headline “You Gotta Serve Somebody.”\n\nStaff protests fleck the history of this magazine. I recall one especially, a small, unstoried objection in Reagantime that raised a big though unintended question. Two women from the business side, who monitored expenses and regarded editors requesting more than one pencil as profligate, had a complaint. They were tired: of pages dominated by proxy armies, allied tyrants, US-backed atrocities from Sabra and Shatila to the killing fields of Central America and southern Africa, etc. This is The Nation, they said; it should cover the nation.\n\nTheir wordplay remains provocative. In an imperial state, with force projection everywhere on the earth, what is “the nation”?\n\nSurely it’s not merely the people or the country, the land-of-liberty aspirations, or even illusion that inspired the magazine’s name in 1865. One can love the mongrel, damaged country; the nation is something else: full-blooded, a war machine in the imperial order and imagination—the material reality everyone in power agrees on. If it were not, life expectancy would be a “national security” crisis: lowest among rich countries (worse than the Northern Marianas); lower for Black people (comparable to Guatemala); lower still for Native people (comparable to Eritrea). As is, the nation ignores human insecurity, or heightens it. For journalists, empire presents a choice: You are an agent of the war machine, or a witness for humanity.\n\nThe “biggest story of the year” illustrates the problem. Sitting in a supermarket parking lot on March 15, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic had made his choice long before. He’d been an advance man for one war crime, pushing the Iraq weapons-of-mass-destruction lie after 9/11; now he had advance warning of another on his phone. In two hours, the US would begin bombing Yemen. No one on the Signal group chat claimed imminent threat, or even debated a delay. This was preboarding for an act of aggression—the supreme crime under international law, lest we forget.\n\nYet Goldberg’s concern was national security. Civilians would die—the “Target Terrorist” of the first strike was attacked as he entered his girlfriend’s building; it collapsed with all inside—and would keep dying. Goldberg left the chat, still fretting about national secrets, but he had his story. Neither he nor his media admirers described the Signal bombardiers and their cheering section as lawless psychopaths. (Tulsi Gabbard: “Great work and effects!”) In an Atlantic Zoom session, subscribers asked where Goldberg had shopped on the 15th. In the TV appearances I saw, no one related the attacks to the Houthis’ aim to thwart the US/Israeli genocide in Gaza. No one asked, “Did you ever think you had a duty to disrupt this nation’s death plans?”\n\nThe question would have been rhetorical. Worse, it appears to be unthinkable. An editor with an audience at high levels of state had two hours to sound an alarm about an imminent war crime. His stated fear for the safety of US troops—thin gruel given the 36,000-plus dead or injured soldiers he had waved into the meat grinder of Iraq—assumes that the US military has no intelligence and no contingency plans. Maybe an outcry wouldn’t have grounded the planes. We’ll never know. A month later, an Atlantic crew was at the White House. The president congratulated Goldberg: “You were successful, and it became a big story…. You got it out very much to the public.” Next, Trump will be leaking to him.\n\nThe Nation has long believed that publishing is a tool for showing the nation plain. If we invoked international law a lot, it wasn’t because people win their liberation through it but because, as Craig Mokhiber, an international human rights lawyer, says about the duty to confront genocide, “This is a struggle, and any tools we can use are necessary.” History is a tool. These days, when so much peace talk is corrupt, I remember Alexander Cockburn eviscerating some US deal for Central America and quoting Calgacus on the Romans: “They make a desolation and they call it peace.”\n\nOur “peace” for Central America eventually crossed the border, and now the nation is at war against the beloved mongrel country.\n\nIn 1960, six months before the Bay of Pigs invasion, The Nation reported that the CIA was training counterrevolutionaries “for an eventual landing in Cuba.” Editor Carey McWilliams called on the bigger-foot press to investigate and for public pressure to force “the administration to abandon this dangerous and hare-brained project.” Some newspapers followed up; some spiked their stories; The New York Times trimmed its sails on the CIA’s role. After Cuba smacked the US proxies down, President John F. Kennedy confided to a Times man that more reporting might “have saved us from a colossal mistake.” McWilliams was wiser: The press does its job so public pressure might too.\n\nEmpire disfigures every American—the privilege of knowing that we are unlikely to be bombed here while the nation that takes our name visits that terror freely on others across the world. Fifty years ago, the Vietnamese people taught the empire what it meant to lose, and taught the country, through the peace movement—and especially the anti-war GIs—what might be gained from resistance rather than accommodation. It is some coincidence of anniversaries.",
    "Summary": "This article discusses Jeffrey Goldberg's journalistic practices and decision-making. It mentions that Goldberg spoke at the New Orleans Book Festival at Tulane University. The mention of Tulane is extremely brief and serves only as a location detail. The overall sentiment is neutral regarding Tulane."

    "Full Article Text": "Un estudio reciente presentado en el congreso NUTRITION 2025, realizado en Orlando, en los Estados Unidos, sugiere que consumir entre una y tres tazas de café con cafeína al día durante la mediana edad podría estar asociado con un envejecimiento más saludable en mujeres. La investigación fue liderada por la doctora Sara Mahdavi, científica en nutrición de la Universidad de Toronto y también afiliada a Harvard, y fue reportada por CNN y ScienceAlert.\n\nEl estudio analizó datos de más de 47.000 mujeres estadounidenses, recopilados durante tres décadas a través del proyecto Nurses’ Health Study. Las participantes, encuestadas desde 1984 hasta 2016, fueron evaluadas en relación con su dieta, estado de salud general, función física y mental, y la presencia de enfermedades crónicas.\n\nEl café aporta cafeína, un poderoso estimulante\n\nSegún explicó Mahdavi a CNN, las mujeres que tomaban entre una y tres tazas diarias de café con cafeína a los 50 años tenían más probabilidades de alcanzar la vejez sin enfermedades crónicas mayores y con buen estado físico, cognitivo y emocional. “En este estudio, encontramos que el consumo moderado de café con cafeína durante la mediana edad se asoció con una mayor probabilidad de un envejecimiento saludable 30 años después”, indicó la investigadora.\n\nEl estudio definió “envejecimiento saludable” como llegar a los 70 años o más con buena salud física, sin deterioro cognitivo, sin enfermedades mentales ni problemas de memoria, y libre de 11 enfermedades crónicas, como diabetes tipo 2 o enfermedades cardiovasculares.\n\nLos efectos positivos observados en el estudio se limitaron al café con cafeína. No se encontró la misma asociación beneficiosa con el consumo de té, café descafeinado ni bebidas gaseosas con cafeína. De hecho, el consumo de gaseosas con cafeína se relacionó con una menor probabilidad de envejecimiento saludable. “Esto implicaría que el café, en particular, tiene efectos que preservan o promueven la salud”, comentó el doctor David Kao, profesor asociado de medicina en la Universidad de Colorado, citado por CNN. Kao no participó en el estudio, pero valoró positivamente su calidad metodológica.\n\nSegún los expertos, las hormonas influyen en cómo se metaboliza la cafeína (imagen ilustrativa) Foto: FreeP¡CK\n\nAunque los resultados son prometedores, los expertos advierten que el estudio es observacional y, por tanto, no puede establecer una relación directa de causa y efecto. Se tomaron en cuenta variables como estilo de vida, índice de masa corporal y nivel de actividad física, pero sigue siendo posible que otros factores no considerados expliquen los resultados.\n\nAdemás, Mahdavi señaló que el café no debe verse como una solución universal. La manera en que el cuerpo metaboliza la cafeína varía según factores como el uso de anticonceptivos, la menopausia o el embarazo. “El café puede apoyar la longevidad, pero no es una receta universal —especialmente para las mujeres—. Las hormonas influyen en cómo se metaboliza la cafeína”, indicó la investigadora.\n\nMahdavi aclaró que este hallazgo no implica que quienes no consumen café deban empezar a hacerlo por razones de salud. El beneficio observado aplica a quienes ya lo incluyen como parte de su rutina diaria y lo consumen con moderación. Por su parte, el doctor Lu Qi, de la Universidad de Tulane, advirtió que personas con presión arterial alta, enfermedades cardíacas, ansiedad o trastornos del sueño deben tener precaución con la cafeína.\n\nEn resumen, los resultados sugieren que el consumo moderado de café, entre una y tres tazas al día, podría integrarse a un estilo de vida saludable, aunque no sustituye otras prácticas fundamentales como una dieta equilibrada, el ejercicio regular y el descanso adecuado.\n\nEl consumo moderado de café puede ofrecer beneficios protectores a las mujeres Getty Images\n\nSegún ScienceAlert, el análisis mostró que, entre las mujeres identificadas como “envejecedoras saludables” (un total de 3706), aproximadamente el 80 por ciento de la cafeína diaria provenía del café. Cada taza adicional, hasta cinco tazas pequeñas por día, incrementó las probabilidades de un envejecimiento saludable entre un 2 por ciento y un 5 por ciento. Por el contrario, el consumo diario de refrescos con cafeína redujo esas probabilidades entre un 20 por ciento y un 26 por ciento por taza.\n\nMahdavi concluyó que los efectos del café son modestos y deben considerarse como parte de un conjunto de hábitos saludables: “Estos resultados, aunque preliminares, sugieren que hábitos pequeños y constantes pueden influir en la salud a largo plazo. El consumo moderado de café puede ofrecer beneficios protectores cuando se combina con otras conductas saludables”. El estudio será enviado próximamente para revisión por pares y publicación formal.\n\nEs importante remarcar que, antes de incluir cualquier nuevo alimento a su dieta, consulte con un médico especialista.\n\n*Por Sofía Arias Martínez",

    "Full Article Text": "Aunque gran parte de la atención sobre el mercurio se ha centrado en el aire o los océanos, un nuevo estudio global ha encendido las alarmas sobre otra ruta crítica: los ríos. Investigadores han revelado que los niveles de mercurio fluvial han aumentado drásticamente en los últimos dos siglos, y su impacto silencioso está dejando una huella duradera en los ecosistemas y la salud pública.\n\nUn flujo tóxico que arrastra siglos de contaminación\n\nSegún un trabajo liderado por la Universidad de Tulane y publicado en Science Advances, los ríos transportan actualmente más de 1.000 toneladas métricas de mercurio al año hacia los océanos, frente a las 390 toneladas estimadas en la era preindustrial. El aumento del 150 % se atribuye directamente a la actividad humana: descargas industriales, erosión del suelo, aguas residuales y minería.\n\nUtilizando un modelo informático llamado MOSART-Hg, los científicos reconstruyeron cómo ha cambiado el flujo de mercurio desde 1850 hasta hoy. Validaron sus proyecciones con sedimentos costeros de distintas regiones del mundo, y la coincidencia fue concluyente. Este modelo no solo traza el pasado, sino que permite evaluar la efectividad de políticas actuales como el Convenio de Minamata, que busca limitar la contaminación por mercurio a escala global.\n\nLos efectos del mercurio son devastadores: una vez en el ambiente, se convierte en metilmercurio, una forma altamente tóxica que se acumula en peces y mariscos. Su consumo puede causar daños neurológicos, problemas cardiovasculares y efectos severos en el desarrollo fetal e infantil.\n\nZonas críticas y señales de advertencia global\n\nEl estudio señala a América del Norte y del Sur como las regiones más responsables del aumento total (41 %), seguidas por el sudeste asiático (22 %) y el sur de Asia (19 %). El caso del Amazonas es especialmente grave: supera las 200 toneladas métricas anuales, con un 75 % atribuido a la minería artesanal y la deforestación. En China, en cambio, el incremento está vinculado a emisiones industriales, especialmente en el río Yangtsé.\n\nNo todas las regiones siguen esta tendencia. El Mediterráneo, por ejemplo, muestra niveles inferiores a los preindustriales, probablemente gracias a la construcción de represas como la de Asuán, que bloquean sedimentos contaminados.\n\nEl estudio concluye que los ríos pueden servir como indicadores sensibles de cambio ambiental a corto plazo. Su monitoreo continuo podría ofrecer una herramienta decisiva para evaluar el impacto real de las medidas contra la contaminación por mercurio y proteger, antes de que sea tarde, los delicados equilibrios que sostienen la vida en el planeta.",

    "Full Article Text": "By CALEIGH WELLS\n\nIt’s one of the most impactful climate decisions we make, and we make it multiple times a day.\n\nThe U.N. estimates about a third of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, the main driver of climate change, come from food. That pollution can come from several links in the food supply chain: how farmland is treated, how crops are grown, how food is processed and how it’s ultimately transported.\n\nMaybe you’ve already heard the short answer to minimizing your diet’s impact on the planet: eat more plants and fewer animals. The data backs up that suggestion. Emissions from meat-rich diets are four times higher than that of vegan diets.\n\nBut so much focus on meats overshadows many other food choices that also impact the environment and can contribute to global warming. Here is a look at other important grocery store decisions:\n\nFILE – Pork products line the cooler at a grocery store in New Orleans, April 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)\n\nFILE – Dairy free creamer sit in a cooler at a grocery store in New Orleans, April 17, 2024.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File) Expand\n\nProteins\n\nSwapping one serving of chicken per day for beef cuts a diet’s emissions nearly in half. Ruminant animals such as cows, sheep and goats are the top drivers of emissions.\n\nThose animals “are associated not only with nitrous oxide emissions, but they’re also related to direct methane emissions because they burp them up while they digest food,” said Marco Springmann, professorial research fellow in climate change, food systems and health at University College London.\n\nSpringmann said processed animal products have a higher impact on the planet, too: “You need 10 times the amount of milk to make one unit of cheese.” So — and this is true of most food groups — the less processed the food, the smaller the environmental impact.\n\nPlant-based proteins like legumes, beans and nuts all boast a much lower climate impact.\n\nGrains\n\nThe standout here is rice, and not in a good way.\n\n“Rice uses a ton of water. It uses gobs of fertilizer. There’s flooded rice paddy fields, and that water actually breeds all kinds of bacteria, and those bacteria produce methane gas,” said eco-dietitian nutritionist Mary Purdy.\n\nPurdy said the most planet-friendly alternative is just eating a bunch of different grains.\n\n“The wheat, corn and soy world is very, very familiar to us because we’ve been seeing it. It’s been heavily marketed. When was the last time you saw a commercial for millet or buckwheat?” she asked.\n\nDiverse diets, Purdy said, incentivize biodiverse agriculture, which is more resilient to erratic weather — a hallmark of climate change — and makes healthier soil.\n\nFruits and vegetables\n\nWhen it comes to produce, minimizing impact is less about choosing between foods and more about buying based on the way that food was grown.\n\nConventionally grown produce “very likely is using pesticides, fertilizer, and maybe more water because the soil isn’t healthy,” said Purdy.\n\nPurdy said organic labels, such as Regenerative Organic Certified, indicate those foods had a smaller climate impact when they were grown. The tradeoff is that organic food has a lower yield, so it requires more land use and is often more expensive.\n\nLocal and “in season” foods also have a smaller climate impact, but not just for one of the reasons you may be thinking of: emissions from international shipping. Every day, thousands of large ships transport goods, including produce, around the world, and the fuel they use is heavily polluting.\n\nHowever, “it’s mostly those local emissions on trucks that are actually impactful, not the international shipping emissions,” Springmann said.\n\nAlso, food grown nearby tends to be grown in a way that fits with the local climate and is less harmful to the environment.\n\n“We’re not trying to grow oranges in some place in a greenhouse,” Purdy said.\n\nButter and oil\n\nPlants win out over animals, again. Vegetable oils are less impactful than butter or lard. Springmann also said tropical oils are healthiest in moderation, such as those from coconuts or palms, because they have a higher fat content. Plus, palm oil is associated with deforestation.\n\nAs for nut butters, almonds might be a great option for limiting carbon emissions, but they require a lot of water.

    "Full Article Text": "Explotó el Gainbridge Fieldhouse. Desde hacía 25 años que no se disputaba un partido de una final de la NBA en la casa de los Pacers. La victoria por 116-107 sobre Oklahoma City Thunder, adelantándose 2-1 en la serie al mejor de siete en la carrera por el anillo, resultó vibrante, con 15 empates en el tanteador, alternancia en el liderazgo y un desenlace para los dueños casa. Los flashes se quedaron con Tyrese Haliburton, con Obi Toppin, con Rick Carlisle, pero detrás de todos ellos se erige la figura de ella, una de las pocas entrenadoras asistentes de la NBA, Jenny Boucek, la ingeniera defensiva de un equipo que deja la piel dentro de la cancha.\n\nNo le gustan mucho las cámaras, prefiere estar en un segundo plano, pero Boucek, de 51 años, es entrenadora asistente de la NBA desde hace siete años, tras construir una carrera como jugadora en Virginia y como coach en la WNBA. Comenzó en el mundo del básquetbol en All-ACC en la Universidad de Virginia de 1992 a 1996. Boucek promedió 7,9 puntos, 3,7 rebotes, 3,1 asistencias y 1,2 robos a lo largo de su carrera, alcanzando tres Elite Eights con los Cavaliers. Boucek terminó jugando para los Cleveland Rockers en la temporada inaugural de la WNBA en 1997, pero sufrió una fractura de espalda que puso fin a su carrera.\n\nBoucek es una de las 15 entrenadoras que han entrenado en la NBA y fue una de las cuatro que formaron parte del cuerpo técnico de la NBA durante la temporada regular 2024-25. Actualmente, en su cuarto año con los Pacers, trabajó anteriormente con los Sacramento Kings y los Dallas Mavericks.\n\nLa realidad es que Boucek no había planificado su futuro ligado al básquetbol profesional, porque como estudiante de medicina deportiva y como creció en una familia de médicos y enfermeras y su horizonte estaba concentrado en seguir el legado familiar, según contó en AJ McCord, de la revista Legends .\n\n“Vengo de una familia que ha desafiado el statu quo. Nunca preguntaron: ‘¿Por qué deberíamos hacer esto?’ o ‘¿Por qué deberíamos hacer aquello?’. Siempre decían: ‘¿Por qué no?’. Como: ‘Siempre se ha hecho así, pero ¿por qué?’“, contó en el medio estadounidense a USA Today.\n\nY la realidad es que la familia Boucek siempre estuvo un paso al frente, ya que el Dr. Mark Boucek, tío de Jenny, tuvo un papel fundamental en el primer trasplante de corazón de babuino a bebé del mundo, y su abuelo materno, el Dr. Robert Heath, fundó el Departamento de Psiquiatría y Neurología de la Universidad de Tulane. “En mi familia hubo muchos pioneros en la investigación médica. Era una mentalidad con la que nos criaron en nuestra familia”, contó Jenny, en una charla con UVA Today.\n\nCarlisle, el entrenador de Indiana, llevó a Boucek a su staff técnico cuando dirigía Dallas Mavericks en 2018 y le dijo que su lugar era como entrenadora a la NBA, que por su capacidad pertenecía a esa elite. “Hay cosas en la forma en que Rick ve el mundo, donde no hay límites ni para él ni para las personas en las que cree. Y siempre me ha visto así, creyendo en mí más de lo que yo mismo he creído”, contó Jenny, que es madre soltera y también eso representó todo un desafío en es universo de enormes responsabilidades que es la NBA. Exactamente 12 días después de ser cesada en Dallas dio a luz a su hija Rylie mediante la fecundación in vitro y desde entonces a acompaña a todos lados, incluso, a los partidos.\n\nEl head coach de los Pacers tiene una mirada muy especial sobre Boucek, tanto que podría superar lo que logró Becky Hammon, en San Antonio Spurs, que fue parte del staff técnico de Gregg Popovich como asistente desde 2014 hasta 2021 y se convirtió en la primera mujer en ejercer como entrenadora principal interina en la NBA después de que Pop fuera expulsado de un partido en 2020. Pero Carlisle considera que su asistente defensiva está para dar un paso más: “Jenny Boucek es la única mujer en la construcción defensiva de un staff técnico de la NBA que también es coordinadora y es una de las pocas que podría convertirse en la primera entrenadora principal de la NBA algún día”.\n\nDebbie Ryan, la entrenadora de Boucek en Cavaliers, en la WNBA, dijo que una de las mayores fortalezas de Jenny es la forma en que puede establecer relaciones y generar confianza con los demás. “Y creo que eso es lo que más valoran los hombres, los jugadores de estos equipos, en ella. Es su profesionalismo y su trabajo, y cómo les ayuda a conectar mejor entre sí, con los entrenadores, la organización, los dueños, con todos”, contó Ryan.\n\nY las palabras de Myles Tuner, el pivote estrella de los Pacers, habló en un video que hizo el equipo sobre Boucek y consolidó la virtud de la entrenadora: “Es una persona muy apasionada por lo que hace. También es alguien que ha llegado a un mundo dominado por hombres y que año tras año se gana más respeto. Incluso afuera de la cancha, es alguien con quien puedes intercambiar ideas y te apoya”.\n\nSe sienta a un par de butacas del entrenador principal, gritando instrucciones como coordinadora defensiva de un equipo que está está en la final de la NBA y domina la serie por 2-1. Su voz rompe con todas las estructuras y es que Boucek quiere trascender: “Quiero hacerlo por Rick. Es un pionero e innovador. Y es alguien que, una vez más, interpela a todos: ‘¿Por qué no?’. Siempre hay que cree que no hay razón por la que algo no sea posible”.",
    "Summary": "This article mentions that Dr. Robert Heath, Jenny Boucek's maternal grandfather, founded the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Tulane University. This positive mention associates Tulane with a significant accomplishment in the medical field through family lineage.  Tulane is mentioned in relation to Dr. Heath's accomplishments."

    "Full Article Text": "Hauptquellen des Schwermetalls sind industrielle Prozesse, Metallbergbau, Kleinbergbau bei der Suche nach Gold sowie die Verbrennung von Kohle.\n\nArtikel teilen\n\nWeltweit transportieren Flüsse heute etwa zweieinhalb Mal so viel hochgiftiges Quecksilber in die Meere wie noch um 1850. Das berichtet ein internationales Forschungsteam aus der Basis von Messwerten und Computermodellen. Hauptquellen des Schwermetalls sind industrielle Prozesse, Metallbergbau, Kleinbergbau bei der Suche nach Gold sowie die Verbrennung von Kohle, so eine Gruppe um Yanxu Zhang von der Tulane University in New Orleans in der Fachzeitschrift „Science Advances“.\n\n„Quecksilber-Verbindungen sind starke Nervengifte, die die menschliche Gesundheit gefährden, vor allem durch den Verzehr von Fisch“, schreiben die Studienautoren. Weil Quecksilber im Boden vorkommt, wird das giftige Metall natürlicherweise durch Bodenerosion in Flüsse eingetragen. Bisher war jedoch nicht bekannt, wie hoch der globale Quecksilber-Eintrag in Fließgewässer ist. „Frühere Studien konzentrierten sich zwar auf die Quecksilber-Konzentrationen in der Atmosphäre, den Böden und im Meerwasser, haben dabei aber Flüsse weitgehend übersehen“, wird Zhang in einer Mitteilung seiner Universität zitiert.\n\nDie Forschenden basierten ihr Modell des vorindustriellen Quecksilber-Exports aus Flüssen in die Ozeane einerseits auf der Quecksilber-Erosion im Einzugsgebiet und andererseits auf der Transportkraft der Flüsse. Diese wiederum hängt von Strömung und Fließgeschwindigkeit des Gewässers ab. Zur Kalibrierung glichen Zhang und Kollegen ihre Simulationsergebnisse für 1850 mit jenen Quecksilber-Werten ab, die in den Sedimentablagerungen einiger Flüsse gemessen wurden. Die simulierten Werte waren tendenziell etwas niedriger als die gemessenen Konzentrationen, sodass das Modell eine eher konservative Schätzung ist.\n\nFür 1850, also zu Beginn der Industrialisierung, gelangten den Kalkulationen zufolge weltweit jährlich etwa 390 Tonnen Quecksilber über Flüsse in die Ozeane. Derzeit sind es demnach rund 1000 Tonnen Quecksilber pro Jahr.\n\nStärkste Anstiege in Asien und Amerika\n\n„Die Festlegung eines Basiswerts für Quecksilber in Flüssen im vorindustriellen Zeitalter kann als wichtiger Bezugspunkt dienen“, betonte Zhang. Daran könne sich die Politik bei der Reduzierung der Freisetzung von Quecksilber orientieren.\n\nBesonders stark stieg die Quecksilber-Menge der Studie zufolge in Flüssen in Südasien und Südostasien sowie in Nord- und Südamerika. „Der Quecksilber-Haushalt des Amazonas beträgt mittlerweile über 200 Tonnen pro Jahr, wobei drei Viertel davon auf menschliche Aktivitäten zurückgehen, hauptsächlich auf Kleinbergbau“, erläuterte Zhang. Zudem trage im Amazonasgebiet die starke Abholzung zu stärkerer Bodenerosion bei, so der Forscher. Diese führe ebenfalls zu höheren Quecksilber-Werten im Amazonas.\n\nAuch sibirische Flüsse, die wie Ob und Jenissei in den Arktischen Ozean fließen, transportieren demnach relativ viel Quecksilber ins Meer. Und erst kürzlich hatten Forschende um Isabel Smith von der University of Southern California in Los Angeles berichtet, dass die Quecksilber-Konzentrationen in den nordamerikanischen Flüssen Yukon und Koyukuk wegen des tauenden Permafrostbodens und der dadurch zunehmenden Bodenerosion deutlich gestiegen sind.\n\nStaudämme halten Sedimente zurück\n\nDoch Zhang und Kollegen berichten auch Positives: So ist der Quecksilber-Eintrag ins Mittelmeer im Vergleich zu 1850 gesunken. Dies erklären sie damit dass Staudämme im nordafrikanischen Einzugsgebiet des Nil - etwa der Assuan-Staudamm in Ägypten - von Flüssen transportierte Sedimente zurückhalten.\n\nQuecksilber zählt zu den gefährlichsten Giftstoffen überhaupt. Der Stoff schädigt neben Immun- und Fortpflanzungssystem vor allem das zentrale Nervensystem, wobei ungeborene Kinder besonders empfindlich reagieren. Deshalb raten etwa die US-Behörden Schwangeren, bestimmte Fischarten aus manchen Gebieten zu meiden. (APA/dpa)",

    "Full Article Text": "El río Guadarrama a su paso por Móstoles, en la ribera este .\n\nLos niveles de mercurio en los ríos del mundo se han más que duplicado desde la era preindustrial, según una investigación de la Universidad de Tulane que es pionera en el ámbito fluvial.\n\nEl estudio, publicado en Science Advances, desarrolló un modelo basado en procesos para simular el transporte de mercurio en los ríos y descubrió que, antes de 1850, los ríos del mundo transportaban aproximadamente 390 toneladas métricas de mercurio a los océanos anualmente. Hoy en día, esa cifra ha ascendido a unas 1.000 toneladas métricas al año, un 150 por ciento más.\n\nLos principales impulsores de este aumento son el vertido de aguas residuales, la erosión del suelo y las liberaciones de mercurio procedentes de las actividades industriales y la minería, afirmó el autor principal, Yanxu Zhang, profesor asociado de Ciencias de la Tierra y Ambientales en la Facultad de Ciencias e Ingeniería de Tulane.\n\n«Las actividades humanas han alterado el ciclo global del mercurio en todos sus aspectos», afirmó Zhang en un comunicado. «Si bien estudios anteriores se han centrado en las concentraciones de mercurio en la atmósfera, el suelo y el agua de mar, han pasado por alto en gran medida los ríos, una vía importante para el mercurio que se ha convertido, de hecho, en una vía de desagüe para las aguas residuales de fuentes municipales e industriales».\n\nAumentos preocupantes\n\nLos hallazgos tienen implicaciones significativas para la salud humana y la vida silvestre, ya que los compuestos de mercurio son potentes neurotoxinas que pueden acumularse en los peces y representar riesgos para la salud a través del consumo. Los investigadores señalan que los ríos cercanos a hábitats críticos para la vida silvestre, incluyendo las principales rutas migratorias de aves en Asia Oriental y América del Norte, han experimentado aumentos preocupantes en los niveles de mercurio.\n\n«El establecimiento de una línea de base para el mercurio ribereño durante la era preindustrial puede servir como un punto de referencia clave», afirmó Zhang, señalando que podría proporcionar objetivos para acuerdos internacionales como el Convenio de Minamata sobre el Mercurio, cuyo objetivo es reducir la contaminación global por mercurio.\n\nEl equipo de investigación de Tulane creó un modelo informático detallado llamado MOSART-Hg para simular el transporte de mercurio preindustrial de la tierra a los océanos a través de los sistemas fluviales. Sus hallazgos coincidieron estrechamente con las concentraciones de mercurio encontradas en muestras de núcleos de sedimentos datados de zonas costeras de todo el mundo, lo que valida su enfoque.\n\nLos patrones regionales revelaron que los aumentos más drásticos en la contaminación por mercurio se produjeron en América del Norte y del Sur, que contribuyen con el 41 % del crecimiento mundial del mercurio fluvial desde 1850, seguidas del Sudeste Asiático (22 %) y el Sur de Asia (19 %).\n\nEl estudio identificó la minería de oro artesanal y en pequeña escala (MAPE) como un contribuyente particularmente significativo a la contaminación por mercurio en América del Sur, el Sudeste Asiático y partes de África.\n\nEn la región amazónica, por ejemplo, los niveles de mercurio se han disparado debido tanto al aumento de la erosión del suelo por la deforestación como a las liberaciones de mercurio derivadas de las actividades mineras.\n\n«El balance de mercurio del río Amazonas supera actualmente las 200 toneladas métricas anuales, y tres cuartas partes de este provienen de actividades humanas, principalmente de la MAPE», afirmó Zhang.\n\nLas liberaciones industriales de mercurio se identificaron como el principal impulsor de los aumentos en regiones como Asia Oriental, donde los ríos de China aportan más del 70 % del mercurio regional. El flujo de mercurio del río Yangtsé se ha más que duplicado con respecto a los niveles preindustriales.\n\nMenos en el Mediterráneo\n\nSin embargo, no todas las regiones experimentaron aumentos. La región mediterránea experimentó niveles de mercurio más bajos en comparación con la época preindustrial, lo que los investigadores atribuyen a la construcción de presas como la Presa Alta de Asuán en el río Nilo, que retienen sedimentos cargados de mercurio.\n\nLas concentraciones fluviales de mercurio podrían servir como un indicador de respuesta rápida para evaluar la eficacia de la gestión de la contaminación por mercurio a medida que los países trabajan para reducir las emisiones de mercurio y restaurar los entornos contaminados, afirmó.\n\nEl estudio también cuenta con la participación de colaboradores internacionales de la Universidad de California en San Diego, la Universidad Forestal de Pekín, el Servicio Geológico de Estados Unidos y Géosciences Environnement Toulouse.\n\nMás temas:\n\nContaminación\n\nRíos\n\nMercurio",

    "Full Article Text": "Freedom of speech Pollution See all topics Follow\n\nA Tulane University researcher resigned Wednesday, citing censorship from university leaders who had warned that her advocacy and research exposing the Louisiana petrochemical industry’s health impacts and racial disparities in hiring had triggered blowback from donors and elected officials.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Kimberly Terrell accused the university of sacrificing academic freedom to appease Louisiana’s Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. Terrell, the director of community engagement at Tulane’s Environmental Law Clinic claimed the clinic had been “placed under a complete gag order” that barred her from making public statements about her research.\n\nAccording to emails obtained by The Associated Press, university leaders wrote that the work of the law clinic had become an “impediment” to a Tulane redevelopment project reliant on support from state and private funders. The clinic represents communities fighting the petrochemical industry in court.\n\nKate Kelly, a Landry spokesperson, denied that the governor threatened to withhold state funding.\n\n“I cannot remain silent as this university sacrifices academic integrity for political appeasement and pet projects,” Terrell wrote. “Our work is too important, and the stakes are too high, to sit back and watch special interests replace scholarship with censorship.”\n\nTerrell said she resigned “to protect the work and interests” of the clinic.\n\nTulane spokesperson Michael Strecker said in an emailed statement that the university “is fully committed to academic freedom and the strong pedagogical value of law clinics.” He declined to comment on “personnel matters.”\n\nElected officials concerned about environmental law clinic’s work\n\nMany of the clinic’s clients are located along the heavily industrialized 85-mile (137-kilometer) stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge commonly referred to by environmental groups as “Cancer Alley.”\n\nMarcilynn Burke, dean of Tulane’s law school, wrote in a May 4 email to clinic staff that Tulane University President Michael Fitts worried the clinic’s work threatened to tank support for the university’s long-sought efforts to redevelop New Orleans’ historic Charity Hospital as part of a downtown expansion.\n\n“Elected officials and major donors have cited the clinic as an impediment to them lending their support to the university generally and this project specifically,” Burke wrote.\n\nBurke did not respond to an emailed request for comment Wednesday.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Terrell wrote that she had been told the governor “threatened to veto” any state funding for the expansion project unless Tulane’s president “did something” about the clinic.\n\nBarred from media interviews\n\nA 2022 study Terrell co-authored found higher cancer rates in Black or impoverished communities in Louisiana. Another study she published last year linked toxic air pollution in Louisiana with premature births and lower weight in newborns.\n\nIn April, Terrell published research showing that Black people received significantly less jobs in the petrochemical industry than white people in Louisiana despite having similar levels of training and education.\n\nMedia coverage of the April study coincided with a visit by Tulane leaders to Louisiana’s capitol to lobby elected officials in support of university projects. Shortly after, Burke, the law school’s dean, told clinic staff in an email that “all external communications” such as social media posts and media interviews “must be pre-approved by me.”\n\nEmails from May show that Burke denied requests from Terrell to make comments in response to various media requests, correspondence and speaking engagements, saying they were not “essential functions of the job.”\n\nOn May 12, Terrell filed a complaint with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, claiming that her academic freedom had been violated. The agency, which accredits Tulane, did not comment.\n\nUniversity leaders concerned about clinic’s advocacy\n\nIn a May 21 audio recording obtained by the AP, Provost Robin Forman said that when Tulane leadership met with elected officials in April, they were pressed as to why “‘Tulane has taken a stand on the chemical industry as harming communities’,” and this “left people feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable.”\n\nBurke said in an email that university leaders had misgivings about a press release in which a community activist represented by Terrell’s clinic is quoted as saying that petrochemical companies “prioritize profit over people.” Burke noted that Fitts was concerned about the clinic’s science-based advocacy program, and Terrell’s work in particular which he worried had veered “into lobbying.” Burke said Fitts required an explanation of “how the study about racial disparities relates directly to client representation.”\n\nThe clinic cites the study in a legal filing opposing a proposed chemical plant beside a predominantly Black neighborhood, arguing the community would be burdened with a disproportionate amount of pollution and less than a fair share of the jobs.\n\nThe clinic’s annual report highlighted its representation of a group of residents in a historic Black community who halted a massive grain terminal that would have been built around 300 feet from their homes.\n\nThe provost viewed the clinic’s annual report “as bragging that the clinic has shut down development,” Burke said in an email.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Terrell warned colleagues that she felt Tulane’s leaders “have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”",
    "Summary": "This article details the resignation of a Tulane University scientist who alleges censorship of research related to pollution and racial disparities. The negative sentiment stems from the accusations of censorship and prioritizing political appeasement over academic freedom.  Tulane is mentioned throughout the article as the institution at the heart of the controversy."

    "Full Article Text": "Coś stało się z rzekami na całym świecie. Naukowcy to zbadali\n\nNaukowcy z Uniwersytety Tulane przeprowadzili badania obejmujące rzeki na całym świecie. Ich analizy przyniosły ciekawe, acz niepokojące wnioski - w pewnym momencie historii z rzekami stało się coś dziwnego i nie są to pozytywne wieści. Chodzi bowiem o nagły wzrost poziomu rtęci w rzekach - niemal się potroił.\n\nDlaczego to ważne, by zrozumieć ten proces? Chodzi o to, że związki rtęci są silnymi neurotoksynami, które mogą na przykład kumulować się w rybach, stanowiąc tym samym zagrożenie dla zdrowia ludzi i dzikiej przyrody. A to właśnie głównie rzeki w pobliżu kluczowych siedlisk dzikiej przyrody, w tym głównych szlaków migracyjnych ptaków w Azji Wschodniej i Ameryce Północnej, doświadczyły niepokojących wzrostów poziomów rtęci.\n\nRewolucja przemysłowa przyniosła wielkie zmiany. Nie tylko te dobre\n\nBadania naukowców z Uniwersytetu Tulane wykazały, że poziomy rtęci w rzekach na świecie intensywnie wzrosły od czasów tzw. drugiej rewolucji przemysłowej (XIX w.), obejmującej proces gwałtownych zmian technologicznych, gospodarczych i społecznych, związanych z masowym przechodzeniem od produkcji ręcznej do maszynowej oraz odkryciami naukowymi pokroju silnika gazowego czy żarówki.\n\nNaukowcy opracowali specjalny, szczegółowy model komputerowy MOSART-Hg, który symuluje transport rtęci w rzekach. Ich odkrycia ściśle korelowały ze stężeniami rtęci z osadów w datowanych próbkach z całego świata. Wyniki są jednoznaczne. Przed 1850 rokiem rzeki transportowały około 390 ton rtęci rocznie do oceanów, obecnie jest to około 1000 ton rocznie. Rzeki, krytyczne dla zaopatrzenia w wodę pitną i żywność zostały skażone głównie w wyniku działalności ludzkiej.\n\n- Działalność człowieka zakłóciła globalny cykl rtęci pod każdym względem - powiedział prof. Yanxu Zhang z Uniwersytetu Tulane, główny autor badania. - Podczas gdy poprzednie badania skupiały się na stężeniach rtęci w atmosferze, glebie i wodzie morskiej, w dużej mierze pomijały rzeki, główny szlak rtęci, który stał się w rzeczywistości rurociągiem dla ścieków zarówno ze źródeł komunalnych, jak i przemysłowych.\n\nRozwiń\n\nNiemal trzykrotny wzrost poziomu rtęci w rzekach. Konieczny jest plan działania\n\nGłówne przyczyny wzrostu to wspomnianezrzuty ścieków, a także erozja gleby oraz emisje rtęci z działalności przemysłowej i górniczej. Szczególnie znaczący wkład w zanieczyszczenie rtęcią ma górnictwo złota w Ameryce Południowej, Azji Południowo-Wschodniej i części Afryki. Na przykład w regionie Amazonii poziom rtęci gwałtownie wzrósł właśnie z powodu działalności człowieka - wylesiania, a więc i zwiększonej w jego skutek erozji gleby, a także uwalniania tego pierwiastka przyaktywności górniczej.\n\n- Zasób rtęci w rzece Amazonce przekracza obecnie 200 ton metrycznych rocznie, z czego trzy czwarte pochodzi z działalności człowieka - podaje Zhang.\n\nPoziomy rtęci w rzekach mogą być szybkim wskaźnikiem oceny skuteczności działań na rzecz redukcji emisji zanieczyszczeń, jak i tempa przywracania skażonych środowisk. Może to też być podstawa to opracowania nowych planów działania przeciwko zanieczyszczaniu środowiska.

Researchers at Boston’s Tufts University said Monday that drinking one to two cups of caffeinated coffee a day was tied to a lower risk of all causes of death and particularly death from cardiovascular disease.\n\nThey found that black coffee and coffee with low levels of added sugar and saturated fat were associated with a 14 percent lower risk. But the same link was not observed for coffee with high amounts of added sugar and saturated fat.\n\n“Coffee is among the most-consumed beverages in the world, and with nearly half of American adults reporting drinking at least one cup per day, it’s important for us to know what it might mean for health,” Fang Fang Zhang, the Neely Family Professor at the Friedman School, said in a statement. “The health benefits of coffee might be attributable to its bioactive compounds, but our results suggest that the addition of sugar and saturated fat may reduce the mortality benefits.”\n\nZhang was the senior author of the National Institutes of Health-supported study, which was published on Monday in The Journal of Nutrition.\n\nopen image in gallery Coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of all causes of death, researchers at Tufts University say. Drinking up to three cups can be beneficial ( Getty/iStock )\n\nIn the observational study, the authors analyzed data from nine consecutive cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, examining 46,000 adults above the age of 20 who completed a valid assessment of what they had consumed over the course of 24 hours on the first day of the study. The data was recorded from 1999 to 2018.\n\nUltimately, they found that drinking one cup of coffee daily was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of death. That risk rose by a percentage when drinking two-to-three cups. But, more cups didn’t have additional effects, and the link between coffee and a lower risk of death by cardiovascular disease weakened when coffee consumption was more than three cups per day.\n\nopen image in gallery Drinking one to two cups of coffee with low levels of added sugar and saturated fat was associated with a 14 percent lower risk of death. Black coffee was associated with the same lower risk ( Getty/iStock )\n\nThe research builds on previous research supporting the conclusions from Tulane University. A decade-long study of 40,000 American adults found that people who were specifically morning coffee drinkers were 31 percent less likely to die of cardiovascular disease and 16 percent less likely to die earlier of any cause than those who drank no coffee.\n\n“Few studies have examined how coffee additives could impact the link between coffee consumption and mortality risk, and our study is among the first to quantify how much sweetener and saturated fat are being added,” first author Dr. Bingjie Zhou said. “Our results align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which recommend limiting added sugar and saturated fat.”",
    "Summary": "This article discusses a study linking coffee consumption to longevity. It mentions that the research builds upon previous work from Tulane University.  While the focus is on the Tufts University study, the reference to Tulane's prior research is positive. Tulane is mentioned in the context of supporting prior research on coffee's health benefits."

    "Full Article Text": "Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business recently launched its first fully online M.B.A. program, marking a significant step in expanding its offerings for working professionals. As assistant dean at the Stewart Center for Professional and Executive Education, Ashley Francis plays a pivotal role in shaping and overseeing these programs. With a background in online learning and program development, she brings deep expertise in designing market-competitive programs that maintain Tulane’s unique academic experience.\n\nI wanted to sit down with Ashley to learn more about the strategy behind launching an online M.B.A. at Tulane’s Freeman School of Business, how the program distinguishes itself in a competitive landscape and what universities should consider when developing online offerings.\n\nQ: Why did Tulane’s Freeman School of Business decide to launch an online M.B.A. and how did you approach designing a program that stands out in an increasingly competitive market?\n\nA: Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business launched its online M.B.A. program as part of a comprehensive strategy complementing the school’s portfolio of programs directed towards working professionals and meeting students where they are. It was conceptualized in response to both an evolving institutional culture and a clear demand for accessible, high-quality business education.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this momentum. With support from Dean Paulo Goes and our partnership with AllCampus, Tulane’s Freeman School of Business was able to build a rigorous and forward-thinking program.\n\nWhat sets Freeman’s online M.B.A. apart is its commitment to academic excellence, flexibility and support. The curriculum is designed specifically for working professionals, offering the same tenured faculty who teach on campus—a rarity among online programs, which often rely on adjunct instructors. The program underwent a rigorous four-month development process to ensure that our curricula offered engaging, culturally rich courses. We specifically structured a program with reduced credits to help lower cost and time to completion.\n\nThe Freeman School’s online M.B.A. program is not only competitive but it’s also deeply student-centric. We offer unique, customized career support and access to tutoring services that not many other programs offer. While being competitive in the market was a top priority, ultimately the onus was on us to create a program that truly benefited students.\n\nQ: When selecting an online program management partner, what key factors did Tulane’s Freeman School of Business consider? Why was working with an OPM important to you?\n\nA: We went into the OPM selection process knowing the values and capabilities of working with an OPM and that this partnership style would set our online M.B.A. up for the most success. At their best, OPMs are sophisticated, passionate and willing to invest in the success of the program. At the same time, my previous experiences with OPMs had left me feeling wary and cautious when choosing our partner.\n\nFor the new online M.B.A. program, we ended up going with AllCampus, and they’ve absolutely met my high expectations. Tulane’s Freeman School of Business was seeking a true partner—one that would collaborate deeply, offer full transparency and share in the school’s mission for success and AllCampus has embraced those values fully.\n\nMy advice to other higher education leaders considering working with an OPM would be to build a relationship framed around mutual commitment and trust, with a shared goal of creating a standout program. Having a hands-on partnership allowed us to move quickly and tactfully when launching a high-quality program.\n\nQ: Tulane University is deeply connected to the culture and identity of New Orleans. How does the online M.B.A. program incorporate that sense of place and community for students logging in from around the country?\n\nA: Tulane’s Freeman online M.B.A. is infused with the spirit of New Orleans, bringing the city’s vibrancy and community-driven ethos into the virtual classroom. One of the core pillars of the program is “bringing the joy of New Orleans” to students—wherever they are. Rather than creating a hypercompetitive environment, the Freeman School fosters a sense of belonging and cultural richness, helping students feel the NOLA experience even if they never set foot on campus.\n\nThis is accomplished through course design, community engagement strategies and faculty involvement that reflect our university’s values and strengths. Our courses embed the city’s ethos and leverage our expertise in energy, supply chain, brand management and entrepreneurial resilience. Tulane’s brand affinity, loyal alumni network and supportive student services—such as a dedicated career management center and a financial aid adviser—all contribute to building a connected environment. The result is a program that not only educates but also inspires a lifelong connection to the Tulane community and the unique culture of New Orleans.",
    "Summary": "This article features an interview with Ashley Francis, assistant dean at Tulane's Freeman School of Business, discussing the launch of a new online MBA program.  The interview showcases Tulane's commitment to innovation in education and its strategic approach to expanding its reach to working professionals. Tulane's proactive approach to online learning is positively portrayed. Tulane is mentioned numerous times."

    "Full Article Text": "By JACK BROOK\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) — A Tulane University researcher resigned Wednesday, citing censorship from university leaders who had warned that her advocacy and research exposing the Louisiana petrochemical industry’s health impacts and racial disparities in hiring had triggered blowback from donors and elected officials.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Kimberly Terrell accused the university of sacrificing academic freedom to appease Louisiana’s Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. Terrell, the director of community engagement at Tulane’s Environmental Law Clinic claimed the clinic had been “placed under a complete gag order” that barred her from making public statements about her research.\n\nAccording to emails obtained by The Associated Press, university leaders wrote that the work of the law clinic had become an “impediment” to a Tulane redevelopment project reliant on support from state and private funders. The clinic represents communities fighting the petrochemical industry in court.\n\nKate Kelly, a Landry spokesperson, denied that the governor threatened to withhold state funding.\n\n“I cannot remain silent as this university sacrifices academic integrity for political appeasement and pet projects,” Terrell wrote. “Our work is too important, and the stakes are too high, to sit back and watch special interests replace scholarship with censorship.”\n\nTerrell said she resigned “to protect the work and interests” of the clinic.\n\nTulane spokesperson Michael Strecker said in an emailed statement that the university “is fully committed to academic freedom and the strong pedagogical value of law clinics.” He declined to comment on “personnel matters.”\n\nElected officials concerned about environmental law clinic’s work\n\nMany of the clinic’s clients are located along the heavily industrialized 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge commonly referred to by environmental groups as “Cancer Alley.”\n\nMarcilynn Burke, dean of Tulane’s law school, wrote in a May 4 email to clinic staff that Tulane University President Michael Fitts worried the clinic’s work threatened to tank support for the university’s long-sought efforts to redevelop New Orleans’ historic Charity Hospital as part of a downtown expansion.\n\n“Elected officials and major donors have cited the clinic as an impediment to them lending their support to the university generally and this project specifically,” Burke wrote.\n\nBurke did not respond to an emailed request for comment Wednesday.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Terrell wrote that she had been told the governor “threatened to veto” any state funding for the expansion project unless Tulane’s president “did something” about the clinic.\n\nBarred from media interviews\n\nA 2022 study Terrell co-authored found higher cancer rates in Black or impoverished communities in Louisiana. Another study she published last year linked toxic air pollution in Louisiana with premature births and lower weight in newborns.\n\nIn April, Terrell published research showing that Black people received significantly less jobs in the petrochemical industry than white people in Louisiana despite having similar levels of training and education.\n\nMedia coverage of the April study coincided with a visit by Tulane leaders to Louisiana’s capitol to lobby elected officials in support of university projects. Shortly after, Burke, the law school’s dean, told clinic staff in an email that “all external communications” such as social media posts and media interviews “must be pre-approved by me.”\n\nEmails from May show that Burke denied requests from Terrell to make comments in response to various media requests, correspondence and speaking engagements, saying they were not “essential functions of the job.”\n\nOn May 12, Terrell filed a complaint with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, claiming that her academic freedom had been violated. The agency, which accredits Tulane, did not comment.\n\nUniversity leaders concerned about clinic’s advocacy\n\nIn a May 21 audio recording obtained by the AP, Provost Robin Forman said that when Tulane leadership met with elected officials in April, they were pressed as to why “‘Tulane has taken a stand on the chemical industry as harming communities’,” and this “left people feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable.”\n\nBurke said in an email that university leaders had misgivings about a press release in which a community activist represented by Terrell’s clinic is quoted as saying that petrochemical companies “prioritize profit over people.” Burke noted that Fitts was concerned about the clinic’s science-based advocacy program, and Terrell’s work in particular which he worried had veered “into lobbying.” Burke said Fitts required an explanation of “how the study about racial disparities relates directly to client representation.”\n\nThe clinic cites the study in a legal filing opposing a proposed chemical plant beside a predominantly Black neighborhood, arguing the community would be burdened with a disproportionate amount of pollution and less than a fair share of the jobs.\n\nThe clinic’s annual report highlighted its representation of a group of residents in a historic Black community who halted a massive grain terminal that would have been built around 300 feet from their homes.\n\nThe provost viewed the clinic’s annual report “as bragging that the clinic has shut down development,” Burke said in an email.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Terrell warned colleagues that she felt Tulane’s leaders “have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”\n\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. Report for America is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.",
    "Summary": "This article discusses the resignation of a Tulane University researcher, Kimberly Terrell, who accused the university of censoring her research on pollution and racial disparities in the Louisiana petrochemical industry.  The article portrays Tulane negatively, suggesting a prioritization of political appeasement over academic freedom. Tulane is mentioned throughout and its actions are criticized."

In author and journalist Robert Fieseler's experience, it meant hunting down sealed documents from a state that never wanted this history exposed, and it meant uncovering hundreds of names redacted from records and conducting countless hours of interviews—all before the actual writing takes place.\n\nIn this episode of \"Writer's Digest Presents,\" editor Michael Woodson sits down with Robert to discuss his new book American Scare: Florida's Hidden Cold War on Black and Queer Lives (on sale today), how he infuses literary sensibilities to his historical nonfiction, and more.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRobert Fieseler\n\nRobert W. Fieseler is a journalist investigating marginalized groups and a scholar excavating forgotten histories. A National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association Journalist of the Year and recipient of the Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship, his debut book Tinderbox won seven awards, including the Edgar Award, and his reporting has appeared in Slate, Commonweal, and River Teeth, among others.

It's typically something that engages me intellectually while simultaneously taking this side door into my heart in a way where I can't stop obsessing about it.\"\n\n\"I have this problem that I've had since I was very little where I want to know the story that others don't want me to know. That's the juicy stuff! That's the gay gossip!\"\n\nOn Incorporating Fiction Craft Practices In Literary Nonfiction: \"I love nonfiction that can employ literary and aesthetic sensibilities, where they have respect for the line, for the musicality of language, where they have a respect for and an understanding of mood and atmosphere, which is very difficult to communicate to an academic historian, but I think it matters. I also love plotting, set-up and pay-off, introducing threads and paying them off later. And I like the way that literature allows for revelation—where there's just moments where you feel like you're entire body's lit up.\"\n\nListen To The Episode",

    "Full Article Text": "New Orleans has always been known for its vibrant culture, incredible food scene, and world-famous Mardi Gras celebrations. But lately, the Crescent City is gaining attention for an entirely different reason: it’s quietly becoming one of America’s most promising investment destinations. From skyrocketing real estate values to booming tech startups, New Orleans is experiencing an economic renaissance that has investors taking notice.\n\nThe transformation didn’t happen overnight. Years of strategic planning, massive infrastructure investments, and a renewed focus on economic diversification have positioned New Orleans as a serious contender in the investment world. The city that once relied heavily on tourism and oil is now attracting billions in private investment across multiple sectors, creating opportunities that savvy investors are beginning to recognize.\n\nWhat makes this particularly interesting is that New Orleans still offers relatively affordable entry points compared to traditional investment hotspots like Austin, Nashville, or Miami. This combination of growth potential and accessibility is creating a perfect storm for investors looking for the next big opportunity.\n\nReal estate market shows explosive growth\n\nThe New Orleans real estate market has experienced remarkable growth over the past three years, with property values increasing at rates that rival some of the country’s most expensive markets. The median home price has jumped from approximately $195,000 in 2021 to an estimated $245,000 in 2024, representing a nearly 26% increase in just three years.\n\nWhat’s driving this growth extends beyond simple supply and demand. The city has attracted a wave of remote workers and young professionals who discovered New Orleans during the pandemic and decided to stay. These newcomers, often with higher incomes than traditional local residents, have increased demand for quality housing while bringing fresh energy to neighborhoods throughout the city.\n\nRental markets have been particularly strong, with annual rent growth averaging 8.2% over the past two years. This growth stems partly from the city’s recovery in tourism, which has increased demand for short-term rentals, but also from the influx of new residents who need housing while they establish themselves in the city.\n\nNeighborhoods like the Marigny, Bywater, and Central City have seen particularly dramatic appreciation, with some areas experiencing property value increases of 40% or more since 2020. Even traditionally overlooked areas like Algiers Point and the Irish Channel are attracting attention from developers and investors who see potential for significant returns.\n\nTechnology sector gains serious momentum\n\nNew Orleans has been quietly building a robust technology ecosystem that’s now beginning to pay dividends for investors. The city’s tech sector has grown by approximately 15% annually over the past three years, with startups and established companies choosing New Orleans for its lower operating costs, available talent, and supportive business environment.\n\nThe presence of major universities, including Tulane, Loyola, and the University of New Orleans, provides a steady stream of educated workers, while the city’s lower cost of living helps companies attract talent from more expensive markets. Several major companies have established significant operations in New Orleans, bringing high-paying jobs and spurring additional investment in the sector.\n\nThe city has also become a hub for fintech and logistics technology companies, leveraging its position as a major port city and its connections to international trade. These companies are developing solutions for supply chain management, international commerce, and financial services that serve markets far beyond Louisiana.\n\nGaming and entertainment technology represents another growing sector, building on New Orleans’ reputation as an entertainment destination. Companies developing virtual reality experiences, gaming platforms, and digital entertainment solutions have found New Orleans offers both the creative environment they need and the technical infrastructure to support their growth.\n\nInfrastructure investments create foundation for growth\n\nNew Orleans has committed unprecedented resources to infrastructure improvements that are creating the foundation for sustained economic growth. The most visible of these investments is the $2.1 billion French Quarter revitalization project, which aims to preserve the historic character of the area while upgrading utilities, improving drainage, and enhancing the visitor experience.\n\nThe Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport recently completed a $1 billion modernization that has significantly increased the city’s capacity to handle both business and leisure travelers. The new terminal has already attracted additional airline routes and has positioned New Orleans as a more attractive destination for business conferences and conventions.\n\nPort infrastructure improvements represent another major investment area. The Port of New Orleans handles approximately $80 billion in cargo value annually, making it one of the most important ports in the United States. Recent expansions and improvements have increased capacity and efficiency, attracting additional shipping companies and logistics providers to establish operations in the area.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the city has invested heavily in flood protection and drainage improvements. The $14.5 billion in flood protection infrastructure completed since Hurricane Katrina has significantly reduced the risk of major flooding, making the city more attractive to businesses and residents who were previously concerned about weather-related risks.\n\nEnergy sector transitions create new opportunities\n\nNew Orleans is positioning itself at the center of America’s energy transition, creating investment opportunities in both traditional and renewable energy sectors. The city’s location along the Gulf Coast makes it an ideal hub for offshore wind development, and several major projects are already in various stages of planning and development.\n\nThe traditional energy sector remains strong, with New Orleans serving as a headquarters for numerous oil and gas companies. However, many of these companies are diversifying into renewable energy, creating opportunities for investors interested in companies that are successfully managing the energy transition.\n\nThe port’s role in energy is also evolving, with new facilities being developed to handle liquefied natural gas exports and renewable energy equipment imports. These infrastructure investments are attracting energy companies and creating jobs in both construction and long-term operations.\n\nCarbon capture and storage technology represents another emerging opportunity, with several companies developing solutions to reduce industrial emissions. New Orleans’ industrial base and geological features make it an attractive location for these technologies, and early investments in this sector could prove highly profitable as regulations and market demand increase.\n\nTourism and entertainment sector rebounds strongly\n\nThe tourism and entertainment sector, which was devastated by the pandemic, has not only recovered but is showing signs of growth beyond pre-pandemic levels. Annual tourism revenue has returned to approximately $9.5 billion, and visitors are spending more per trip than they did before 2020.\n\nThe city has used the pandemic recovery period to upgrade and diversify its entertainment offerings. New music venues, restaurants, and cultural attractions have opened, while existing businesses have expanded and improved their facilities. This diversification has made New Orleans less dependent on traditional tourism patterns and more resilient to future disruptions.\n\nFilm and television production has become a major economic driver, with Louisiana’s generous tax incentives attracting productions that bring millions of dollars in spending to the local economy. This industry has created jobs not just for actors and crew members, but for local businesses that provide services to productions.\n\nThe food and beverage industry has also seen significant investment, with new restaurants, breweries, and food production facilities opening throughout the city. New Orleans’ reputation for culinary excellence has attracted investors interested in scaling local food concepts nationally or developing new products that capture the city’s unique flavors.\n\nHealthcare and biotech sectors show promise\n\nNew Orleans has emerged as a regional healthcare hub, with major medical centers and research institutions attracting investment in both traditional healthcare and biotechnology. The presence of world-class medical facilities has created opportunities for companies developing medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare technology solutions.\n\nThe city’s universities have strong research programs in medicine and biological sciences, creating a pipeline of innovation that attracts both startup investment and corporate research and development spending. Several biotech companies have chosen New Orleans as their headquarters, taking advantage of lower operating costs and access to research talent.\n\nTelemedicine and digital health solutions represent particularly promising areas, as companies develop technologies to serve both urban and rural populations throughout the Gulf South region. The pandemic accelerated adoption of these technologies, creating market opportunities that New Orleans companies are well-positioned to address.\n\nChallenges and considerations for investors\n\nDespite the positive trends, potential investors should be aware of challenges that could affect returns. Climate risk remains a significant concern, even with improved flood protection infrastructure. Rising sea levels and increasingly severe storms could impact property values and business operations over the long term.\n\nThe city’s population has not fully recovered to pre-Katrina levels, which limits the local market size for many businesses. While the metropolitan area includes 1.27 million people, the city proper has approximately 384,000 residents, which may not be sufficient to support certain types of businesses without serving regional or national markets.\n\nCrime rates in certain areas remain higher than national averages, which can affect property values and business operations. However, many of the neighborhoods seeing the most investment have experienced significant improvements in public safety.\n\nThe local political and regulatory environment can be complex, with multiple layers of government oversight that may slow development projects or increase costs. Investors should factor these considerations into their planning and budgeting.\n\nMarket timing and future outlook\n\nThe current investment environment in New Orleans appears to offer a favorable risk-to-reward ratio for investors willing to take a long-term view. Property values and business opportunities are still accessible compared to other growing markets, but trends suggest this window may not remain open indefinitely.\n\nSeveral major infrastructure projects are scheduled for completion over the next five years, which should provide additional catalysts for growth. The energy transition, technology sector expansion, and continued tourism recovery all point to sustained economic growth that should benefit early investors.\n\nThe key for potential investors is identifying opportunities that align with the city’s long-term growth trends while avoiding areas or sectors that may be overvalued or face significant challenges. Success will likely come from understanding both the unique advantages New Orleans offers and the specific risks that come with investing in an emerging market.\n\nNew Orleans appears to be at a inflection point where years of planning and investment are beginning to pay dividends. For investors willing to do their research and take a measured approach, the Crescent City may indeed represent the next hot investment zone in America. The combination of cultural appeal, economic diversification, and relative affordability creates a compelling case that more investors are beginning to recognize.",
    "Summary": "This article highlights the economic growth of New Orleans, mentioning Tulane University among other universities contributing to the city's growing tech sector by providing a steady stream of educated workers. The overall sentiment towards Tulane is highly positive, portrayed as a valuable asset to the city's economic development. Tulane is mentioned as a positive factor in the city's growth."

Researchers at Boston’s Tufts University said Monday that drinking one to two cups of caffeinated coffee a day was tied to a lower risk of all causes of death and particularly death from cardiovascular disease.\n\nThey found that black coffee and coffee with low levels of added sugar and saturated fat were associated with a 14 percent lower risk. But the same link was not observed for coffee with high amounts of added sugar and saturated fat.\n\n“Coffee is among the most-consumed beverages in the world, and with nearly half of American adults reporting drinking at least one cup per day, it’s important for us to know what it might mean for health,” Fang Fang Zhang, the Neely Family Professor at the Friedman School, said in a statement. “The health benefits of coffee might be attributable to its bioactive compounds, but our results suggest that the addition of sugar and saturated fat may reduce the mortality benefits.”\n\nZhang was the senior author of the National Institutes of Health-supported study, which was published on Monday in The Journal of Nutrition.\n\nopen image in gallery Coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of all causes of death, researchers at Tufts University say.

A decade-long study of 40,000 American adults found that people who were specifically morning coffee drinkers were 31 percent less likely to die of cardiovascular disease and 16 percent less likely to die earlier of any cause than those who drank no coffee.\n\n“Few studies have examined how coffee additives could impact the link between coffee consumption and mortality risk, and our study is among the first to quantify how much sweetener and saturated fat are being added,” first author Dr. Bingjie Zhou said. “Our results align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which recommend limiting added sugar and saturated fat.”",
    "Summary": "This article discusses a study on coffee consumption and mortality risk.  It mentions that the research builds on previous research supporting the conclusions from Tulane University. This is presented positively, with research from Tulane University being seen as reputable and influential. Tulane was mentioned as a source of prior supporting research."

    "Full Article Text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe Elite 11 Finals annually spotlight the nation's top high school quarterbacks, offering a firsthand look at how the next wave of signal-callers stacks up against elite competition.\n\nWith most participants already committed, it's a valuable window into how these prospects will fit into their future college systems and translate to the next level. Here are the top 10 committed quarterbacks attending the event later this month ranked by system fit.\n\n1. Faizon Brandon, Tennessee\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 8\n\nTennessee's scheme is plug-and-play friendly and fits Brandon's big arm and sneaky mobility. There's a clear trend emerging in Knoxville when it comes to quarterback traits in terms of stature, athleticism and arm strength. Brandon checks all three boxes. He's very similar to former Vols standout Hendon Hooker and is further along developmentally than Hooker was at Brandon's age. Though not quite as polished as Nico Iamaleava coming out of high school, Brandon throws a great deep ball, which Tennessee coach Josh Heupel requires from all his quarterbacks. By the time he arrives on campus, it's likely at least one quarterback currently on the Tennessee roster will have hit the transfer portal.\n\nOne week from today the @Elite11 Finals get underway ⏳ UCReport will have on-site coverage. Looking forward to seeing plenty of high-level quarterbacks and evaluating how they'll fit in their college system. Among those is 5-star Tennessee commit Faizon Brandon who was... pic.twitter.com/kXFh2QojIJ - Billy Tucker (@TheUCReport) June 10, 2025\n\n2. Terry Walker III, Duke\n\nESPN 300 ranking: N/A -- three-star\n\nDuke offensive coordinator Jonathan Brewer is looking for a run-pass option quarterback with consistent accuracy and high-level production in the run game. Walker is that guy. He's strikingly similar to Darian Mensah, the quarterback Duke brought in via the transfer portal, only Walker has a stronger arm. The Blue Devils want a dynamic runner at quarterback -- something former QB Maalik Murphy wasn't -- and that's what Walker is. A true playmaker, he also has a sky-high ceiling for development as a passer. Walker's commitment is more evidence that the perception of Duke is shifting among top-tier recruits.\n\n3. Jake Fette, Arizona State\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 157\n\nIt's easy to see why Arizona State's coaching staff loves Fette considering he's a mirror image of current quarterback Sam Leavitt. Fette is a sandlot-style riverboat gambler who thrives when the play breaks down. He looks like a pocket passer, but has the athleticism of a runner and can stress defenses with his legs. Coach Kenny Dillingham will use a lot of smoke and mirrors with shifts, motions, personnel groupings and backfield action to maximize Fette's dynamic skill set and make him a threat both inside and outside the pocket.\n\n4. Dia Bell, Texas\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 6\n\nBell enters an ideal situation. The Longhorns don't need to rush him, and instead can allow him to develop at his own pace. His fit is quite akin to Arch Manning's, and if Bell follows a similar blueprint he will get bigger, stronger and more mature over time. He already displays the tools of a high-level passer and adds value as a more capable runner than Quinn Ewers did in Steve Sarkisian's system. Bell is a naturally gifted passer with a long track record of performance against elite competition, so he is ready to make the jump.\n\n5. Dereon Coleman, Miami\n\nESPN 300 ranking: N/A -- three-star\n\nRegardless of Carson Beck's production this fall, Coleman will be able to deliver the dynamism that Miami showcased with Cam Ward at the helm, which will make the Hurricanes much more difficult to defend. Coleman is the type of player Miami will prefer at quarterback in the long run. He has moxie, a gunslinger's mentality and a live arm capable of making off-platform plays look routine. Remind you of anyone?\n\n6. Jonas Williams, USC\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 155\n\nIt's easy to see shades of former Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams when watching Jonas Williams. He's a naturally creative and improvisational quarterback. The play is never over, sometimes to a fault, but often to devastating effect. Williams can move the launch point and change arm angles, especially when asked to get the ball out quickly on screens and underneath throws. He thrives in chaos and can run the play-action offense Lincoln Riley loves to employ.\n\n7. Keisean Henderson, Houston\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 16\n\nHenderson is another signal-caller with similarities to Darian Mensah, who played for current Houston coach Willie Fritz at Tulane. Landing Henderson was a huge win for Fritz. Henderson is a terrific athlete who can reach 20.6 mph max speed, an elite number for a quarterback. We're intrigued to see whether he sticks at quarterback or moves to another position. For that reason, he's more of a developmental player who needs to get more consistent in the passing game, but he has a high ceiling regardless of position.\n\n8. Troy Huhn, Penn State\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 198\n\nAt 6-foot-4 and 215 pounds, Huhn has the kind of stature coach James Franklin and offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki love. Though not as mobile as Drew Allar, Huhn is very athletic in the pocket. He can extend plays and shows strong anticipation off play-action. Huhn loves to play under center, which is a valuable trait in a Penn State offense that blends shotgun and traditional looks. With a scheme that frequently shifts the launch point through varied play-action concepts, Huhn's footwork and functional mobility make him a natural fit.\n\n9. Travis Burgess, North Carolina\n\nESPN 300 ranking: N/A -- three-star\n\nIt's still unclear exactly what North Carolina's offense will look like under Bill Belichick, but recent quarterback additions offer a clue. The Tar Heels brought in dual-threat options in South Alabama transfer Gio Lopez and 2025 commit Bryce Baker. Neither is a traditional pocket passer, nor is Burgess. He's a great get for North Carolina with his athleticism, live arm, quick release and developmental upside. He also won't be thrust into action immediately. Once the staff understands his strengths, he's the kind of player it can build a system around. Though not as tall, he's reminiscent of NC State's CJ Bailey.\n\n10. Briggs Cherry, Louisville\n\nESPN 300 ranking: N/A -- three-star\n\nCherry is the prototypical athletic pocket passer for Jeff Brohm's system. He's decisive, releases the ball quickly and anticipates plays well. Combine that with Brohm's tried-and-true scheme, and it's easy to see why Louisville is a destination for quarterbacks such as Cherry who are looking to up their game. He is similar to Cardinals transfer quarterback Miller Moss in both skill and style. Cherry thrives in quick-game concepts, excels in the intermediate passing attack and is highly effective off deep play-action. Louisville is attractive for Cherry because it always layers good skill players around its quarterback.",
    "Summary": "This article ranks high school quarterbacks based on their potential fit within different college football systems. Tulane is mentioned briefly as the former university of a college coach. The mention is neutral and has no bearing on the reputation of Tulane."

    "Full Article Text": "We are excited to share our first big milestone in solving a grand challenge that has hampered the predictive power of computational chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science for decades. By using a scalable deep-learning approach and generating an unprecedented quantity of diverse, highly accurate data, we have achieved a breakthrough in the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse method that thousands of scientists use every year to simulate matter at the atomistic level. Within the region of chemical space represented in our large training dataset, our model reaches the accuracy required to reliably predict experimental outcomes, as assessed on the well-known benchmark dataset W4-17 (opens in new tab). This removes a fundamental barrier to shifting the balance of molecule and material design from being driven by laboratory experiments to being driven by computational simulations. The implications for accelerating scientific discovery are far reaching, spanning applications from drugs to batteries and green fertilizers.\n\nWhat is DFT?\n\nMolecules and materials are made of atoms, which are held together by their electrons. These electrons act as a glue, determining the stability and properties of the chemical structure. Accurately computing the strength and properties of the electron glue is essential for predicting whether a chemical reaction will proceed, whether a candidate drug molecule will bind to its target protein, whether a material is suitable for carbon capture, or if a flow battery can be optimized for renewable energy storage. Unfortunately, a brute-force approach amounts to solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation, which requires computation that scales exponentially with the number of electrons. Considering that an atom has dozens of electrons, and that molecules and materials have large numbers of atoms, we could easily end up waiting the age of the universe to complete our computation unless we restrict our attention to small systems with only a few atoms.\n\nDFT, introduced by Walter Kohn and collaborators in 1964-1965, was a true scientific breakthrough, earning Kohn the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998. DFT provides an extraordinary reduction in the computational cost of calculating the electron glue in an exact manner, from exponential to cubic, making it possible to perform calculations of practical value within seconds to hours.\n\nWhat is the grand challenge in DFT?\n\nBut there is a catch: the exact reformulation has a small but crucial term—the exchange-correlation (XC) functional—which Kohn proved is universal (i.e., the same for all molecules and materials), but for which no explicit expression is known. For 60 years, people have designed practical approximations for the XC functional. The magazine Science dubbed the gold rush to design better XC models the “pursuit of the Divine Functional (opens in new tab)”. With time, these approximations have grown into a zoo of hundreds of different XC functionals from which users must choose, often using experimental data as a guide. Owing to the uniquely favorable computational cost of DFT, existing functionals have enabled scientists to gain extremely useful insight into a huge variety of chemical problems. However, the limited accuracy and scope of current XC functionals mean that DFT is still mostly used to interpret experimental results rather than predict them.\n\nWhy is it important to increase the accuracy of DFT?\n\nWe can contrast the present state of computational chemistry with the state of aircraft engineering and design. Thanks to predictive simulations, aeronautical engineers no longer need to build and test thousands of prototypes to identify one viable design. However, this is exactly what we currently must do in molecular and materials sciences. We send thousands of potential candidates to the lab, because the accuracy of the computational methods is not sufficient to predict the experiments. To make a significant shift in the balance from laboratory to in silico experiments, we need to remove the fundamental bottleneck of the insufficient accuracy of present XC functionals. This amounts to bringing the error of DFT calculations with respect to experiments within chemical accuracy, which is around 1 kcal/mol for most chemical processes. Present approximations typically have errors that are 3 to 30 times larger.\n\nHow can AI make a difference?\n\nAI can transform how we model molecules and materials with DFT by learning the XC functional directly from highly accurate data. The goal is to learn how the XC functional captures the complex relationship between its input, the electron density, and its output, the XC energy. You can think of the density like a glue, with regions of space where there is a lot of it and other regions with less of it. Traditionally, researchers have built XC functional approximations using the concept of the so-called Jacob’s ladder: a hierarchy of increasingly complex, hand-designed descriptors of the electron density. Including density descriptors from higher rungs of this ladder aims to improve accuracy, but it comes at the price of increased computational cost. Even the few attempts that use machine learning have stayed within this traditional paradigm, thereby taking an approach that is akin to what people were doing in computer vision and speech recognition before the deep-learning era. Progress toward better accuracy has stagnated for at least two decades with this approach.\n\nOur project is driven by the intuition that a true deep learning approach—where relevant representations of the electron density are learned directly from data in a computationally scalable way—has the potential to revolutionize the accuracy of DFT, much like deep learning has transformed other fields. A significant challenge with going down this path, however, is that feature or representation learning is very data-hungry, and there is very little data around—too little to test this hypothesis reliably.\n\nWhat have we done in this milestone?\n\nThe first step was generating data—a lot of it. This posed a major challenge, since the data must come from accurate solutions of the many-electron Schrödinger equation, which is precisely the prohibitively expensive problem that DFT is designed to replace. Fortunately, decades of progress in the scientific community have led to smarter, more efficient variants of brute-force methods, making it possible to compute reference data for small molecules at experimental accuracy. While these high-accuracy methods, also referred to as wavefunction methods, are far too costly for routine use in applications, we made a deliberate investment in them for this project. The reason? The upfront cost of generating high-quality training data is offset by the long-term benefit of enabling vast numbers of industrially relevant applications with cost effective DFT using the trained XC functional. Crucially, we rely on the ability of DFT—and our learned XC functional—to generalize from high-accuracy data for small systems to larger, more complex molecules.\n\nThere are many different high-accuracy wavefunction methods, each tailored to different regions of chemical space. However, their use at scale is not well established, as they require extensive expertise—small methodological choices can significantly affect accuracy at the level that we target. We therefore joined forces with Prof. Amir Karton (opens in new tab) from the University of New England, Australia, a world-leading expert who developed widely recognized benchmark datasets for a fundamental thermochemical property: atomization energy—the energy required to break all bonds in a molecule and separate it into individual atoms. To create a training dataset of atomization energies at unprecedented scale, our team at Microsoft built a scalable pipeline to produce highly diverse molecular structures. Using these structures and substantial Azure compute resources via Microsoft’s Accelerating Foundation Models Research program (opens in new tab), Prof. Karton applied a high-accuracy wavefunction method to compute the corresponding energy labels. The result is a dataset (opens in new tab) two orders of magnitude larger than previous efforts. We are releasing a large part of this dataset (opens in new tab) to the scientific community.\n\nData generation was only half of the challenge. We also needed to design a dedicated deep-learning architecture for the XC functional—one that is both computationally scalable and capable of learning meaningful representations from electron densities to accurately predict the XC energy. Our team of machine learning specialists, assisted by DFT experts, introduced a series of innovations that solve these and other challenges inherent to this complex learning problem. The result is Skala, an XC functional that generalizes to unseen molecules, reaching the accuracy needed to predict experiments. This demonstrates for the first time that deep learning can truly disrupt DFT: reaching experimental accuracy does not require the computationally expensive hand-designed features of Jacob’s ladder. Instead, we can retain the original computational complexity of DFT while allowing the XC functional to learn how to extract meaningful features and predict accurate energies.\n\nWe compare the accuracy of Skala against the best existing functionals of varying computational cost. The prediction errors are evaluated on two well-known public benchmark datasets: the W4-17 dataset for atomization energies (y axis, mean absolute error) and the GMTKN55 dataset for general main-group chemistry (x axis, weighted total mean absolute deviation, or WTMAD-2 for short). Skala achieves near “chemical accuracy” (1 kcal/mol) on atomization energies. This is the accuracy required for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments, which, to date, no existing functional has reached. Skala works especially well on the “single reference” subset of this dataset, reaching a groundbreaking 0.85 kcal/mol. On the GMTKN55 dataset, Skala shows competitive accuracy to the best-performing hybrid functionals, at a lower cost.\n\n“Skala is a new density functional for the exchange-correlation energy that employs meta-GGA ingredients plus D3 dispersion and machine-learned nonlocal features of the electron density. Some exact constraints were imposed, and some others “emerge” from the fitting to about 150,000 accurate energy differences for sp molecules and atoms. Skala achieves high, hybrid-like accuracy on a large and diverse data set of properties of main group molecules, which has no overlap with its training set. The computational cost of Skala is higher than that of the r2SCAN meta-GGA for small molecules, but about the same for systems with 1,000 or more occupied orbitals. Its cost seems to be only 10% of the cost of standard hybrids and 1% of the cost of local hybrids. Developed by a Microsoft team of density functional theorists and deep-learning experts, Skala could be the first machine-learned density functional to compete with existing functionals for wide use in computational chemistry, and a sign of things to come in that and related fields. Skala learned from big data and was taught by insightful human scientists.” — John P. Perdew, Professor of Physics, School of Science and Engineering, Tulane University\n\nThis first milestone was achieved for a challenging property in a specific region of chemical space—atomization energies of main group molecules—for which we generated our initial large batch of high-accuracy training data. Building on this foundation, we have started to expand our training dataset to cover a broader range of general chemistry, using our scalable in-house data generation pipeline. With the first small batch of training data beyond atomization energies, we have already extended the accuracy of our model, making it competitive with the best existing XC functionals across a wider spectrum of main group chemistry. This motivates us to continue growing our high-accuracy data generation campaign, engaging with external experts such as Prof. Amir Karton, who noted, “After years of benchmarking DFT methods against experimental accuracy, this is the first time I’ve witnessed such an unprecedented leap in the accuracy–cost trade-off. It is genuinely exciting to see how the creation of our new dataset has enabled these groundbreaking results — opening up a path for transformative advances across chemical, biochemical, and materials research.”\n\nAdvancing computational chemistry together\n\nWe are excited to work closely with the global computational chemistry community to accelerate progress for all and look forward to openly releasing our first XC functional in the near future.\n\n“Density Functional Theory (DFT) and related technologies are a core Digital Chemistry technology supporting advancements in Merck’s diverse Life Science, Healthcare and Electronics businesses. However, the limitations of traditional DFT methods, which have persisted for the last 50 years, have hindered its full potential. Microsoft Research’s innovative approach to integrating deep learning represents a substantial leap, enhancing its accuracy, robustness, and scalability. We are looking forward to exploring how this can advance Digital Chemistry workflows and unlock new possibilities for the future, aligning with our commitment to developing advanced algorithms and technologies that propel scientific innovation at Merck.” — Jan Gerit Brandenburg – Director for Digital Chemistry at Merck\n\n“We are entering a golden age for predictive and realistic simulations: very accurate electronic-structure calculations provide vast amounts of consistent data that can be used to train novel machine-learning architectures, delivering the holy grail of precision and computational efficiency.” — Professor Nicola Marzari, Chair of Theory and Simulation of Materials, EPFL and PSI\n\nWe believe that our new functional can help unlock new opportunities for businesses and are eager to work together on real-world applications. Today, we are delighted to launch the DFT Research Early Access Program (DFT REAP) and welcome Flagship Pioneering as the first participant. This program is for companies and research labs to collaborate with us to accelerate innovation across many industries.

    "Full Article Text": "Alos dos años, la cirugía bariátrica consigue una pérdida de peso cinco veces mayor que los fármacos agonistas de los receptores de GLP-1. Es la conclusión principal de un estudio realizado en condiciones de vida real que se acaba de presentar en el congreso de la Sociedad Americana de Cirugía Bariátrica y Metabólica (ASMBS, por sus siglas en inglés), en Washington.\n\nEl trabajo, dirigido desde el centro neoyorkino NYU Langone Health, comparó los resultados obtenidos con la gastrectomía en manga y el bypass gástrico frente a las inyecciones con semaglutida o tirzepatida.\n\nAsí desvelaron que los pacientes sometidos a cirugía perdieron de media más de 26 kilos a los dos años frente a los cerca de 5,5 kilos de aquellos tratados con GLP-1 durante al menos seis meses (24% de pérdida de peso frente a 4,7%). Los pacientes en tratamiento continuo con GLP-1 durante un año perdieron más kilos, pero significativamente menos que aquellos que recibieron la cirugía bariátrica (7% de pérdida de peso total).\n\nJuan Carlos Ruiz de Adana, jefe de Servicio de Cirugía General y Aparato Digestivo del Hospital Universitario de Getafe, en Madrid, comenta a DM, con la cautela que se observa siempre ante un estudio retrospectivo, que los resultados presentados son coherentes: la cirugía bariátrica también incide en la secreción endógena de GLP-1, moléculas que favorecen la pérdida de peso y el control metabólico, y en las que se basa el mecanismo de acción de estos nuevos fármacos. \"Es lógico que, como se muestra en este trabajo, la cirugía alcance efectos más potentes e intensos que los fármacos. Además, se ha medido en los dos años siguientes a la intervención, el periodo en el que la acción alcanzada sobre esas incretinas es más intensa\".\n\nEl responsable de la Unidad de Cirugía Esofagogástrica y Obesidad, de referencia nacional en el tratamiento de esta enfermedad, recalca que si bien los efectos alcanzados son más intensos con la cirugía, \"también hay que considerar que la intervención quirúrgica tiene unos riesgos que no acompañan al tratamiento farmacológico\". Todo ello debe ponderarse a la hora de indicar un tratamiento a cada paciente.\n\n\"Hay enfermos cuyo IMC los sitúa en el límite de la indicación quirúrgica que con los fármacos pueden evitar, o al menos retrasar, una operación. Pero queda claro que los pacientes con obesidad grave y trastornos metabólicos, en especial si no se controlan bien, se van a beneficiar más de la cirugía. Tanto en reducción de peso y control metabólico como en los aspectos psicológicos -que se analizan en otro estudio realizado en la Universidad de Tulane-, la cirugía bariátrica obtiene efectos más intensos que el tratamiento farmacológico\".\n\nEl cirujano apunta que en Estados Unidos desde la llegada de los fármacos GLP-1 se ha reducido en un 25% las intervenciones bariátricas, pero que la situación en España, con el Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS), es algo diferente, pues los pacientes suelen tener que esperar hasta ser intervenidos.\n\nRuiz de Adana también subraya la importancia del estilo de vida en el manejo de la obesidad. \"Los fármacos tienen efecto mientras se administran, y la cirugía, al cabo de unos años, pierde su efecto. Los resultados a largo plazo van a depender mucho de los hábitos que incorpore el paciente\".\n\nDatos de la investigación\n\nPara el estudio, se utilizaron datos de 122.595 pacientes procedentes de registros médicos electrónicos del mundo real del NYU Langone Health y de la red de hospitales públicos NYC Health + Hospitals. Los pacientes incluidos presentaban un índice de masa corporal (IMC) de al menos 35, y se sometieron a gastrectomía en manga o bypass gástrico en Y de Roux, o bien se les prescribió semaglutida o tirzepatida entre 2018 y 2024. Tras ajustar determinados factores, compararon los resultados de 14.152 pacientes emparejados con alguno de los tratamientos.\n\n\"Los ensayos clínicos muestran una pérdida de peso de entre el 15% y el 21% para los GLP-1, pero este estudio sugiere que la pérdida de peso en el mundo real es considerablemente menor incluso para los pacientes que tienen recetas activas durante todo un año. Sabemos que hasta el 70% de los pacientes puede interrumpir el tratamiento en el plazo de un año\", afirma el primer firmante del trabajo, Avery Brown, residente de cirugía en NYU Langone Health. \"Los pacientes tratados con GLP-1 pueden necesitar ajustar sus expectativas, adherirse más estrechamente al tratamiento u optar por la cirugía metabólica y bariátrica para lograr los resultados deseados\", concluye.\n\nPara el autor principal del trabajo, el cirujano bariátrico Karan R. Chhabra, profesor en la Facultad de Medicina Grossman de la NYU, estos resultados invitan a profundizar con más estudios, entre otros aspectos, en cuál es el perfil de pacientes más adecuado para recibir la cirugía bariátrica en lugar del tratamiento farmacológico, de forma que se optimicen los resultados.\n\n\"Si bien ambos grupos de pacientes pierden peso, la cirugía metabólica y bariátrica es mucho más efectiva y duradera\", afirma la presidenta de la ASMBS, Ann M. Rogers, de la red hospitalaria de Pensilvania Penn State Health, quien no participó en el estudio, en una nota difundida por la sociedad científica. \"Quienes no consigan una pérdida de peso suficiente con los GLP-1 o tengan dificultades para cumplir el tratamiento debido a los efectos secundarios o a los costes, deberían plantearse la cirugía bariátrica como opción o incluso en combinación\".\n\nMás beneficio en la salud mental\n\nLa cirugía bariátrica también se ha mostrado superior a los fármacos en relación a eventuales trastornos psiquiátricos asociados a la obesidad. En otro estudio, también presentado en el congreso de la ASMBS, se muestra en un periodo de cinco años que las personas sometidas a cirugía metabólica y bariátrica tienen muchas menos probabilidades de desarrollarlos que los tratados con la terapia farmacológica.\n\nEl riesgo de desarrollar déficits cognitivos fue un 54% menor; un 18% menor para los trastornos de ansiedad, y un 17% para los trastornos por consumo de sustancias.\n\nEl equipo de investigadores de la Facultad de Medicina Tulane, en Nueva Orleans, llevó a cabo un análisis retrospectivo de pacientes sometidos a cirugía metabólica y bariátrica y de pacientes en tratamiento con semaglutida, liraglutida y dulaglutida, utilizando la base de datos TriNetX. Tras emparejar los datos atendiendo a características demográficas y clínicas, se compararon 33.600 pacientes quirúrgicos y 33.600 pacientes en terapia farmacológica, en relación a la incidencia de nuevos trastornos psiquiátricos. El periodo de seguimiento duró hasta cinco años.\n\nPosible efecto protector\n\nAtendiendo a estos resultados, \"la cirugía metabólica y bariátrica confiere un fuerte efecto protector contra los trastornos comunes de salud mental en una comparación directa con la farmacoterapia GLP-1\", afirma en una nota difundida por la ASMBS la coautora del estudio Shauna Levy, jefa de la División de Cirugía Mínimamente Invasiva/Bariátrica de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Tulane.\n\nLos autores también enfatizan la importancia de \"tener en cuenta los resultados de salud mental a la hora de seleccionar modalidades de tratamiento para personas con obesidad\". Y la necesidad de que se investigue en los \"mecanismos subyacentes a estos beneficios para orientar las estrategias de tratamiento personalizado\".",

    "Full Article Text": "Si el café es una de las bebidas más consumidas y queridas en el mundo es porque nos da motivos. Nos despierta, nos activa y, en muchos casos, beberlo es lo primero que hacemos en el día. Aunque pasarse puede tener efectos secundarios que van del insomnio a los problemas gastrointestinales, sus beneficios no se quedan en el ámbito energético. A la lista de reducir el riesgo de padecer diabetes y mejorar la memoria, tanto a largo plazo como a corto, puedes añadirle lo que dice el cardiólogo Aurelio Rojas.\n\nSegún el doctor, aquellas personas que toman café una sola vez al día, y específicamente cuando se levantan por las mañanas, no solo evitan los efectos negativos del exceso de cafeína sino que podrían estar contribuyendo a vivir más y teniendo un corazón más sano. \"Parece que quienes toman café solo por la mañana tienen una mayor esperanza de vida y menos probabilidades de sufrir un infarto\", explica Rojas.\n\nEsta afirmación no se la ha sacado de la manga sino que viene respaldada por un estudio reciente publicado en el 'European Heart Journal'. Investigadores de la Universidad de Tulane (EE.UU.) estudiaron a más de 40.000 personas durante casi 20 años. El hallazgo más llamativo que encontraron es que quienes bebían café antes del mediodía tenían un 31 % menos de riesgo de morir por enfermedades cardiovasculares.\n\nDavid Mao\n\nEso sí, hay que tener en cuenta que se trata de un estudio observacional y no prueba una relación directa causa-efecto, pero los datos apuntan a una correlación significativa entre el momento del consumo de esta bebida y sus efectos en la salud.\n\nPor el lado contrario, los expertos señalan que tomar café por la tarde o por la noche puede alterar los ritmos circadianos (nuestro reloj biológico), empeorando la calidad del sueño y, a la larga, dañando el corazón. Además de esto, quienes toman su taza de café de forma matutina suelen tener unas rutinas más saludables, en las que hacen ejercicio, comen mejor y duermen más profundamente. Eso sí, con moderación y sin pasarse.\n\nFoto de portada | doctorrojass y Nathan Dumlao",

    "Full Article Text": "More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states like Missouri with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.\n\nThe study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.\n\nUsing statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.\n\nIn total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.\n\nAmong the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.\n\nThe rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)\n\nNon-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.\n\nExperts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTrauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.\n\n“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.\n\nIn her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.\n\nMissouri, also among most permissive states, saw its firearm death rates among children and teens rise from 2.9 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 4.2 after it.\n\nRestricting kids’ access\n\nThe study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.\n\n“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”\n\nBut she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.\n\nFaust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.\n\n“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”\n\nFaust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.\n\n“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”\n\nIn Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.\n\nLouisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.\n\nBut Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.\n\n“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.\n\nAnother Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.\n\n“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.\n\nPermitless carry laws\n\nGun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.\n\n“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”\n\nIn South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.\n\n“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”\n\nAnd investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.\n\n“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.\n\nCommunity-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.\n\nSuch programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.\n\nAfter her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.\n\nShe also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.\n\n“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.\n\n“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.\n\nThe decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”",
    "Summary": "This article discusses a study on firearm deaths among children in the US.  Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor at Tulane University, is quoted discussing the impact of Louisiana's permitless carry law on vulnerable populations, including children.  The mention of Tulane is positive, highlighting the university's involvement in relevant research. The overall sentiment is slightly positive because it showcases Tulane's contribution to important social issues research."

    "Full Article Text": "In May, it was reported that xAI was looking to use gas turbines to power its second Memphis location, in part through a partnership named Stateline Power Solutions. Part of the deal was some property just south of the Tennessee/Mississippi state line, which was being used to store the gas turbines that xAI will rely on to help power the new data center. According to Samuel Hardiman, the rate at which equipment is being delivered to the site has picked up steam:\n\nOn Wednesday, June 18, a Daily Memphian reporter observed dozens of natural gas turbines and energy equipment stockpiled in a field at 2979 Stateline Road West in Southaven [Mississippi]. None of the equipment appeared to be running, but it does seem to be multiplying. Two weeks ago, the reporter saw only six or seven turbines on the same lot. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the equipment in the field was delivered as part of a joint venture between Elon Musk’s xAI and Solaris Energy Infrastructure LLC, in line with the venture’s plans to build up to 900 megawatts of off-site capacity for xAI’s second Memphis data center. The company is building that data center about a mile to the north at 5420 Tulane Road in Memphis.\n\nHardiman continues:\n\nAbout a half-mile south of the field where the equipment is stationed is a 100-plus-acre Southaven site that was once a Duke Energy natural gas plant. For more than two months, The Daily Memphian has observed workers move between xAI’s 5420 Tulane Road property and the former plant at 2875 Stanton Road, raising the question of whether that site is where xAI will generate the power needed for its second Memphis data center.\n\nBoth of those Mississippi addresses are linked to Solaris Energy Infrastructure, Inc., the company who sourced the turbines in use at xAI’s first Memphis site.\n\nThis map shows how close these locations are to the new data center:\n\nThis reporting comes the same week where the NAACP and the Southern Environmental Law Center announced their intent to sue xAI over their use of gas turbines at the company’s first Memphis site. In my article covering that development, I quoted from a recent editorial written by Memphis Mayor Paul Young. I’m going to quote the exact same section of that article today:\n\nClaim #1: xAI plans to install 45 to 90 turbines in Memphis False. Their permit outlines 15 temporary-use turbines for their first facility. That’s it. There’s no plan, permit or proposal for anything more. The power solution for their second site hasn’t been determined.\n\nYoung would be proven right if the turbines that are being delivered are technically run in Southaven and not Memphis, but air pollution doesn’t care about state lines.",

    "Full Article Text": "Op-ed: To meet the scale of the climate crisis, the environmental movement must take up a new fight: defending and rebuilding local democratic power.\n\nThis is your first of three free stories this month. Become a free or sustaining member to read unlimited articles, webinars and ebooks.\n\nTroops on U.S. streets. Blue cities painted as enemies of the state. Deportation raids targeting sanctuary cities. Programs lifting vulnerable communities out of poverty attacked. DEI programs under attack. Public trust in government at historic lows. And the drumbeat of war growing louder. Against this backdrop, Next City is publishing a series of essays on democracy in American cities – the forces eroding it, and how we can restore it from the ground up. Read more in our series: Reclamation Starts Now.\n\nFew people outside of Memphis, Tennessee, have heard of Boxtown, a community of about 3,000 residents in the city’s southwest corner. Founded in 1863 by formerly enslaved Black Americans, Boxtown has a long history of resisting environmental injustices, from polluting industries to toxic infrastructure, that have worsened health outcomes and lowered life expectancy.\n\nToday the community is at the center of a growing fight over the future of our democracy and the role of technology and technocrats in deciding for us what constitutes progress and good governance. When residents learned that xAI, a company led by Elon Musk, planned to install the “world’s largest” supercomputer in their neighborhood — without public input or transparency — they mobilized. Beyond the lack of community engagement, residents raised concerns about unjust utility burdens and environmental impact. While the municipal utility offers favorable energy use charge rates to industrial customers, residential customers are charged significantly more to maintain the grid.\n\nThe problem is bigger than xAI. It’s about democracy — and how easily it can be bypassed in decisions that affect the people most.\n\nOur democracy is broken. To repair it, we must reinvent democratic practice so that people can be informed, active participants in the decisions that shape their lives. And the environmental movement must be central in that effort.\n\nOur democracy is in crisis\n\nAbout 80% of Americans believe our country’s democracy is either “in crisis” or “facing serious challenges,” per a 2020 study. Many feel racism blocks civic participation. Cynicism is high. Polarization has deepened. And decades of dysfunction have made people willing to accept undemocratic actions as long as their side wins.\n\nThe system we rely on was designed in the 18th century by 17th-century thinkers. It has not kept pace with climate disruption, social conflict or a rising tech oligarchy. Social trust and solidarity have frayed, replaced by zero-sum thinking that undermines any incentives for more just and inclusive governance.\n\nDespite widespread discontent with our current system, movements for reform remain small and isolated from mainstream political discourse as if imagining a system change is beyond our capacity. But this is where the environmental and climate movements can step in and play a critical role showing how these interconnected issues can inspire real change.\n\nThe environmental imperative\n\nThe world is warming. Last year was the hottest on record, with average daily temperatures 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Millions of Americans have already been impacted by drought, wildfires, flooding, storms, and other extreme weather events due to rising average temperatures, with more severe impacts predicted as we continue to push past heat thresholds. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s warnings about the risk of rising temperatures are becoming increasingly more desperate.\n\nWe know that we have the technological means to decarbonize the economy. What we lack is the political will to meet the scale we need to achieve a goal so immense. As climate writer Dave Roberts once summed up: “Think about the political will we need: to immediately cease fossil fuel exploration, start shutting down coal mines, and put in place a plan for managed decline of the fossil fuel industry; to double or triple the global budget for clean energy research, development, and deployment; to transfer billions of dollars from wealthy countries to poorer ones, to protect them from climate impacts they are most vulnerable to but least responsible for; and quite possibly, if it comes to it, to limit the consumptive choices of the globe’s wealthiest and most carbon-intensive citizens.”\n\nA transition of that scale cannot be achieved without sustained support and participation from people, whose lives are being affected in multiple ways. And while rapid decarbonization is indeed an urgent need, many within the climate movement are convinced that deploying clean energy technologies as quickly and on as grand a scale as possible should take priority over ensuring an inclusive process or equitable benefits.\n\nThat will cannot be forged without people’s support. Yet many in the climate movement prioritize speed and scale over equity and inclusion. That approach is unsustainable.\n\nFrance’s experience offers an alternative. After the “yellow vest” movement forced the government to pull back plans for a nationwide carbon tax, they entered into a two-year process of facilitated Climate Assemblies to develop solutions democratically. About 20% of the recommendations have already been implemented, with another 51% implemented in a modified form.\n\nDeepening democratic engagement works. It creates better, more inclusive policy solutions that are more durable and resistant to political shifts because they are produced collectively and are popular. A more participatory relationship between governments and the communities they serve can accelerate the shift to clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing misinformation, improving decisions, maintaining public confidence and legitimacy by ensuring an inclusive, equitable transition.\n\nWe need to be more ambitious and take action to ensure that climate policies and the interventions they enable are developed in an open and inclusive manner, and implemented with the public’s support and understanding. To accomplish that, environmental advocates must recognize the reciprocal relationship between having effective climate policy and a healthy, inclusive democracy, and devote resources to ensuring a functioning and fair democratic system within which to advocate.\n\nWhile the larger environmental movement questions its role in advocating for a stronger democracy; environmental justice advocates and frontline communities have long demanded more equitable participation in policymaking. However, those demands often lack real operational and organizational clarity, with no a strategic focus on transforming the levers of democracy. We also need to acknowledge the challenges environmental justice groups face, including limited capacities of both community-based advocates and local governments. That’s in addition to the political difficulties of supporting communities when their interests are in opposition to the interest of large financial investors.\n\nThis only becomes more complicated when democratic systems fail to hold powerful actors accountable to the communities most at risk, as in the Flint water crisis. The roots of this crisis were in the gerrymandered state legislative districts that allowed Republicans to control the State House, despite Democratic House candidates winning the majority of the vote. Republican control at the state level allowed the removal of local control of water from the people of Flint, by installing the “emergency manager” that created the water crisis.\n\nBridging environmental justice and participatory democracy movements can offer needed invigoration of both, while movements for localized reforms can establish the democratic cultures that drive greater reform at national levels.\n\nTo avoid future Flints, the environmental movement must invest in democratic reforms. That means supporting participatory budgeting, ranked choice voting and inclusive local planning. It means backing efforts that shift power to communities, especially those on the front lines of climate and environmental risk.\n\nStrategies aimed at increasing participatory democracy are only beginning to be applied to solutions for environmental sustainability and the climate crisis. But examples are emerging. This month, 20 U.S. cities are gathering through the All America City Awards to explore how inclusive engagement can strengthen environmental sustainability. Around the world, cities are experimenting with Climate Assemblies, energy co-ops and other democratic innovations.\n\nAcross Europe, cities are using Climate Assemblies to help break political deadlocks on climate action. In the U.K., community groups like People Powered Retrofit and Retrofit for All are organizing communities into energy co-ops to manage local energy planning and target retrofitting resources to homes and businesses. In March, six European cities came together as part of the Climate Democracy Lab to explore how participatory democracy can strengthen local climate action.\n\nWe need to build on that momentum. Pro-democracy advocacy in the U.S. is still relatively small, and siloed between conversations focused on national-level electoral reforms and those working on participatory democracy at the local level. We need a movement that unites the two, ultimately targeting federal reforms but recognizing that the democratic culture and civic infrastructure we need must first be built from the ground up.\n\nStronger democratic institutions go hand in hand with stronger environmental policy. The climate crisis is a governance crisis, and there can be no just transition without democratic renewal.",

    "Full Article Text": "The Oklahoma Sooners' 2026 quarterback recruiting took a turn late Thursday night when Jaden O'Neal decommitted from the Sooners. That leaves the Sooners to focus entirely on four-star quarterback Bowe Bentley.\n\nIn the wake of O'Neal's decommitment, the Sooners are looking to get Bentley back on campus this weekend, according to ESPN's Eli Lederman (formerly of Tulsa World). Bently just completed a strong showing in the Elite 11 finals in California this week.\n\nBentley was the top performer on night two of the Elite 11 finals after completing 18 of 20 passes and looking good in the Pro Day element of the drills. Analysts marveled at his accuracy and ability to throw on the move. It's that athleticism that's made him one of the more highly sought after quarterbacks over the last six months.\n\nThe four-star quarterback out of Celina, Texas has seen a meteoric rise in the rankings this offseason. In 247Sports rankings back in November, he was considered the No. 296 player in the class.

If Oklahoma is able to get Bentley back on campus this weekend for the ChampU BBQ, just two weeks after his official visit at the beginning of June, it would be a significant development in his recruitment.\n\nNeed a break?

    "Full Article Text": "The summer months are upon us, and that means official visit season has arrived in the new, sped-up recruiting calendar. June has quickly become on of the hottest months of the recruiting calendar, which aligns fairly well to how Florida State and coach Mike Norvell have operated in the past. I wrote about the significance of June and July for Norvell’s recruiting approach back in 2023. To add to that data, in both 2023 and 2024, FSU earned nine commitments in those two months. That raised the average number of verbal commitments in June and July to 8.8 per cycle in the five year tenure under Norvell.\n\nRelated The significance of June and July for FSU recruiting under Mike Norvell\n\nWith the official visit window in mid-summer having shifted to the tail end of May and the full month of June, the Florida State Seminoles have had several weekends packed with prospects.\n\nDuring the June 20th weekend, the final of the major visiting weekends in June, FSU will host 11 official visitors. Seven of the visitors are composite blue-chips and four are current Florida State commitments, each of whom I’d consider shaky.\n\nVisitors for the June 20th weekend (11 total)\n\n4-star RB Amari Thomas (formerly Clemons) (FSU commit)\n\nThomas is a great fit for what Gus Malzahn wants to do with the offense and FSU prioritized him as such, landing his commitment at the end of January. Since that time, other programs have pushed hard for Thomas to flip, most notably the South Carolina Gamecocks. He really enjoyed his visit to South Carolina and his status with FSU is shaky. It’s crucial for FSU to have a presence with top talent in the Panhandle, and the staff will look to solidify the Blountstown product’s commitment this weekend. He’s an important part of this class.\n\n4-star WR Efrem White (FSU commit)\n\nPart of #Tribe26 since December of 2023, Efrem White has stuck with the Seminoles through good times and bad. He’ll finally take his official visit this weekend and this should serve as a time for both parties to solidify their standings with one another. With White’s pledge predating the new offensive staff, he’ll need to determine how he would fit in FSU’s plans, and vice-versa. He has a lot of talent but is a bit hard to project at the next level. I’d have him as a receiver, but he only weighs 155 pounds and will need to add significant strength to his frame. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish and NC State Wolfpack are working hard to get him to flip and I wouldn’t be surprised to see FSU let him walk.\n\n4-star TE Heze Kent\n\nKent is a fascinating prospect. For those unfamiliar with him, Kent is a 6’5”, 300 pound... athlete. Not offensive lineman- athlete. He wants to play tight end at the next level despite many schools recruiting him as an offensive tackle. He’s narrowed down his top group to schools that will let him play tight end and it consists of the Power Three in Florida along with the Texas Longhorns. He does it all on offense for Brunswick- catches passes, runs reverses, plows up the middle from the H-back position, and even throws passes. His highlight tape is hilarious, and it might be the best thing you see on the internet all day.\n\n4-star OL Donel Robinson\n\nRobinson’s recruitment has been tough to read, as he hasn’t officially visited either in-state Mississippi school or the LSU Tigers yet. I’m not sure where he may fall on their boards but in-season OVs are likely. It’s notoriously difficult to pull kids out of Mississippi and Louisiana when the home teams go all-in. Robinson plays on both sides of the ball for his high school but profiles as an interior lineman at the next level. His 6’4”, 290 pound frame will need some reshaping once he hits college but should be fine to put on the requisite good weight. He’s coming off his only other scheduled visit to see the Baylor Bears and FSU will look to continue strengthening the relationship with the blue-chip lineman. We should know where he stands on the board with the other OL after this weekend.\n\n3-star OL Xavier Payne (FSU commit)\n\nPayne quickly committed to OL coach Herb Hand soon after he was announced at FSU, as Payne has long been a top target for Hand. That hasn’t stopped him from enjoying the recruiting process, having visited the Syracuse Orange and Colorado Buffaloes in June. This weekend will be important for the two parties to reconnect and reaffirm commitment to one another. At 6’7”, 320 pounds, Payne is a tackle prospect FSU would like to keep in the fold and a solid addition from South Florida.\n\n3-star OL Ben Mubenga\n\nThe staff likes the 6’5”, 280 pounder from Buford, Georgia, as a tackle prospect who could potentially slide inside if needed. Mubenga anchors the right tackle spot for his team and shows good leverage and the ability to drive defenders backwards on run plays. He has some really nice offers from SEC, Big Ten, and ACC programs and looks to be a developmental prospect with high upside. The tools are all there and once he adds another 20-30 pounds to his frame, he could become a starter.\n\nOL Luke Francis\n\nI don’t know much about Luke Francis, honestly. He’s originally from London, England, and is part of the NFL Academy. He’ll plays in South Florida this season, at Coral Gables Senior High. He’s 6’5”, 345 pounds and FSU is his third offer. He received the offer on June 18 as an offensive lineman (guard) and is visiting this weekend, so I would imagine that he’ll commit if given the green light. He could be Bjoern Werner, he could be Joe Tonga. Check out a great article from 247’s Chris Nee for more about him- he had some great quotes when interviewed.\n\n3-star DL Chris Addison\n\nAddison is a 6’3”, 250 pound edge rusher with long arms from Winnsboro, Louisiana who last saw FSU’s campus in March on an unofficial visit. He has a strong bond with running backs coach David “YAC” Johnson and will look to continue developing relationships with the defensive staff. Addison had a productive junior season, notching 63 tackles (16 for loss), 8.5 sacks, and four forced fumbles. FSU will have to beat out the Arizona State Sun Devils, Michigan State Spartans, Tulane Green Wave, and UCLA Bruins for him. It’s also worth monitoring whether the LSU Tigers circle back and start prioritizing him if he puts together another strong season and they miss out on prospects higher on their board.\n\n5-star LB Xavier Griffin\n\nGriffin rescheduled his visit to this weekend and as I’d mentioned earlier, I strongly believe this isn’t going to happen because FSU can’t outbid the behemoths for his signature. It’s nice to get him on campus and strengthen a relationship in hopes of reuniting in the transfer portal one day, but I don’t think this is a recruitment where relationships will win out. When you battle the biggest (and richest) programs for top talent in today’s recruiting climate, you don’t have a chance if you can’t at least match the money they’re offering.\n\n4-star LB Karon Maycock (FSU commit)\n\nWe said when he committed that Maycock would be tough to hold on to and that has certainly been the case. I can only speak for myself, but I don’t really view him as a commit. Maycock has all the tools you want in a projected starter and his recruitment continued to heat up despite his verbal to Florida State. FSU will get its shot to bring him back into the fold but as of now, I think he’ll eventually end up in another school’s class. The Alabama Crimson Tide did an excellent job during his official to Tuscaloosa.\n\n4-star DB Jay Timmons (Indiana commit)\n\nTimmons is a 5’11”, 185 pound defensive back who plays for Pine-Richland in Gibsonia, PA. He pledged to the Indiana Hoosiers at the end of April but earned his FSU offer after a strong showing at the early June camp. In the weeks since that performance, the defensive coaching staff has prioritized Lawrence Timmons’ son. He plays wide receiver and defensive back for his high school, posting 42 tackles, 10 pass breakups, four interceptions, and three forced fumbles. As a receiver, he caught 40 passes for 755 yards and eight touchdowns. His team won the state championship last season.",

University Tulane University\n\nA new study finds that parents may underestimate their children’s exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and a newly identified phenomenon called thirdhand smoke may be to blame.\n\nThirdhand smoke occurs when chemical residue from smoking lingers in carpets, furniture. and walls long after the cigarette was lit.\n\nChildren can inhale these particles by disturbing fabric fibers while playing or ingest them by touching contaminated surfaces and then putting their hands in their mouths.\n\nThe study in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Science surveyed caregivers of 162 children in three major US cities. Although 60% says their children had no exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), urine testing showed that all of the children tested positive for low levels of cotinine, which forms when nicotine is broken down in the body and is a biomarker of tobacco exposure. More than 90% of the children tested positive for intermediate levels of cotinine.\n\nWhile the study couldn’t conclusively distinguish if the children were exposed to secondhand or thirdhand smoke, the caregiver surveys point to a less obvious source of tobacco smoke exposure, says lead author Katherine McKeon, PhD candidate at Tulane University’s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.\n\n“These findings do not imply that the parents are lying but rather speak to the invasive nature of thirdhand smoke and how difficult it is to remove from buildings, cars and furniture,” McKeon says.\n\n“Thirdhand smoke is a newer concept, but ongoing research points to it posing a highly toxic silent threat to children, particularly to children with asthma.”\n\nWhile exposure to smoking poses a variety of health consequences for all, children with asthma are particularly susceptible, and environmental tobacco smoke can trigger asthma attacks.\n\nThe findings also highlight the potential for information bias if researchers rely on caregiver surveys for ETS assessments. While the study found a correlation between high levels of cotinine in asthmatic children and prevalence of asthma attacks, there was no association between caregivers who reported ETS exposure for their children and asthma attacks.\n\nAll children in the study were between the ages of 7-12 and lived in federally subsidized public housing in New Orleans, Cincinnati and Boston at the time of the study. Data was collected three times over the course of a year. Caregivers were asked two questions: “Do you or any visitor smoke in your home?” and “Do any household members use tobacco products?”\n\nIn recent years, other studies have found evidence that the tobacco smoke residue responsible for thirdhand smoke may become more toxic over time and can be resistant to conventional cleaning methods.\n\nThe findings point to a need for more research around thirdhand smoke prevalence and health risks. Additionally, the study underscores a need for alternate methods of assessing children’s exposure to tobacco smoke, such as screening for biomarkers like cotinine.\n\n“Our research confirms that relying on caregiver surveys to assess children’s tobacco smoke exposure is inadequate and leads to significant underreporting due to an underestimated prevalence of ETS,” McKeon says.\n\n“This misclassification may hinder proper asthma management and delay critical interventions.”\n\nSource: Tulane University",

Por eso, cuando están secos y agrietados, no solo notas molestias e irritación, sino que no te gusta su aspecto. Aunque aplicarte con frecuencia cacao y bálsamos labiales puede que solo empeore las cosas.\n\nLos bálsamos labiales solo ofrecen una solución temporal. Incluso, algunos pueden secar más todavía los labios. Eso es porque, en parte, cuando la fina capa de humedad del bálsamo se evapora, deshidrata la piel.\n\n“Es un círculo vicioso”, apunta Leah Jacob, profesora de Dermatología en la Universidad Tulane (EE. UU.).\n\nMuchos bálsamos contienen ingredientes que irritan la piel en lugar de protegerla. Fuente: iStock (composición ERR).\n\nEl círculo vicioso de humedad y deshidratación\n\nMuchos tenemos que lidiar con este problema, sobre todo, en invierno y en los climas secos. Médicos y esteticistas nos recomiendan que nos cuidemos los labios, igual que el resto de la piel.\n\n“Cualquier parte del cuerpo que no está cubierta durante el invierno sufrirá la agresión de las inclemencias”, dice Crystal Aguh, dermatóloga del Hospital Johns Hopkins (EE. UU).\n\n“A muchas personas, se les secan las manos y los brazos no, porque solemos llevar siempre ropa de manga larga cuando hace frío, pero no siempre guantes”, señala Aguh.\n\n¿El secreto de una piel joven está en tus hormonas? La ciencia identifica nuevas claves para frenar el envejecimiento y prevenir el daño cutáneo Edgary Rodríguez R.\n\nChristian Pérez\n\nLa anatomía de los labios: más frágiles de lo que imaginas\n\nDel mismo modo, rara vez nos cubrimos la cara en los meses de invierno, por lo que también se seca. Y, aunque los labios parezcan distintos, son bastante similares al resto de nuestra piel.\n\nEstán fabricados también por tres capas de células: la más externa o estrato córneo –con una mayoría de células muertas–, la epidermis y la dermis –el estrato más interno–.\n\nLa principal diferencia es que estas son mucho más finas en los labios que en el resto de la piel –sobre todo, el estrato córneo, que forma una barrera protectora sobre las otras dos–. Por lo tanto, la epidermis y la dermis son más vulnerables y sensibles a las agresiones.\n\n“Las glándulas sebáceas de alrededor de los labios aportan a estos hidratación”\n\nUna capa gruesa de vaselina puede ser más eficaz que productos de diseño con saborizantes. Fuente: iStock (composición).\n\n¿Qué ingredientes debes evitar en tu bálsamo labial?\n\nAsimismo, los labios no poseen folículos pilosos ni glándulas sebáceas propias. Son las de alrededor las que se ocupan de aportarles hidratación.\n\nPasarse la lengua por la boca o aplicarte un poco de cacao, brillo o cualquier cosa que suplemente la hidratación natural puede parecer una buena idea. Sin embargo, es lo peor que puedes hacer, porque provoca más deshidratación, advierte Jacob.\n\nEncima, algunos bálsamos labiales contienen ingredientes que pueden ser irritantes o desecantes. El mentol, el ácido salicílico, el cinamaldehído y los saborizantes mentolados son los culpables.\n\nPor eso, Jacob aconseja usar un ungüento espeso y emoliente, y mejor aún si tiene factor de protección solar. La glicerina o la vieja vaselina de toda la vida son dos buenas opciones.\n\n¿Por qué los labios se secan tan fácilmente? Lo que revela la ciencia\n\nA diferencia de otras zonas del cuerpo, los labios tienen una estructura singular que los hace especialmente vulnerables a la deshidratación. Un estudio realizado en Corea del Sur, con la participación de 40 mujeres, analizó la fisiología específica de la piel labial y encontró que el estrato córneo —la capa más externa de la piel— es considerablemente más delgado en los labios que en otras partes del rostro.\n\nEsta delgadez implica una menor protección frente a agresiones externas, como el viento, el frío o la radiación solar, y contribuye a una mayor pérdida transepidérmica de agua (TEWL, por sus siglas en inglés).\n\nAdemás, el mismo estudio reveló que los labios presentan una capacidad significativamente reducida para retener la humedad. A esto se suma la ausencia de glándulas sebáceas propias, lo que significa que no producen su propio sebo, el aceite natural que en otras zonas del cuerpo ayuda a mantener la hidratación y reforzar la barrera cutánea. En los labios, esta función depende en parte de las glándulas sebáceas cercanas, lo que los deja expuestos si no se les cuida adecuadamente.\n\nOtro hallazgo clave fue el perfil alterado de ceramidas en los labios secos. Estas grasas naturales son componentes esenciales de la barrera cutánea, y su desequilibrio se ha asociado con una menor capacidad de retención de agua y una mayor tendencia a las grietas.\n\nLas personas con labios frecuentemente agrietados mostraban un perfil diferente de ceramidas respecto a quienes tenían labios más sanos. Esta diferencia sugiere que los tratamientos más efectivos podrían incluir ingredientes que restauren esta barrera lipídica, como los bálsamos ricos en ceramidas, para abordar no solo los síntomas, sino también la causa del problema.\n\nLamerte los labios para hidratarlos tiene el efecto contrario: los deshidrata aún más. Fuente: iStock (composición ERR)\n\nLabios en forma: cuidados esenciales y protección solar\n\nAunque los labios ocupan una pequeña superficie del rostro, requieren una atención específica y constante. Su estructura delicada los hace particularmente propensos a la sequedad, las grietas y los daños ambientales. Para mantenerlos sanos, los dermatólogos recomiendan establecer una rutina sencilla pero efectiva.\n\nUna exfoliación suave, una o dos veces por semana, elimina las células muertas del estrato córneo y facilita la penetración de productos hidratantes. Después, aplicar un bálsamo rico en ingredientes emolientes como manteca de karité, cera de abejas o vaselina ayuda a restaurar la barrera cutánea. La hidratación nocturna también es clave, ya que es durante el sueño cuando la piel se regenera con mayor intensidad.\n\nDurante el día, además de mantener los labios humectados, conviene prestar atención a un enemigo menos evidente pero igual de dañino: el sol. A diferencia de otras zonas de la piel, los labios no contienen melanina, el pigmento que nos protege de los rayos UV. Esto los hace mucho más vulnerables a las quemaduras solares. De hecho, el cáncer de piel también puede desarrollarse en esta zona, en particular el carcinoma de células escamosas, que afecta con frecuencia al labio inferior por su mayor exposición al sol. Por eso, es fundamental elegir un factor de protección solar (FPS) de al menos 30 y reaplicarlo con frecuencia, sobre todo tras comer o beber.\n\nNo todos los bálsamos son iguales, y algunos pueden incluso empeorar la situación. Los expertos advierten que conviene evitar productos con fragancias, mentol, alcanfor o ácido salicílico, ya que pueden irritar aún más la piel sensible de los labios. En su lugar, es preferible optar por fórmulas hipoalergénicas, sin alcohol y con activos humectantes, como la glicerina o el ácido hialurónico. Combinando una rutina de cuidado diario con una protección solar adecuada, es posible mantener los labios suaves, flexibles y saludables durante todo el año.\n\nTomar esta vitamina diariamente podría ayudarte a frenar el envejecimiento celular, según un nuevo estudio Edgary Rodríguez R.",

    "Full Article Text": "More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics on June 9, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.\n\nThe study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.\n\nUsing statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.\n\nIn total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.\n\nAmong the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.\n\nThe rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)\n\nNon-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.\n\nExperts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTrauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.\n\n“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.\n\nIn her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.\n\nThe study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.\n\n“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”\n\nBut she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.\n\nFaust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.\n\n“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”\n\nFaust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.\n\n“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”\n\nIn Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.\n\nLouisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.\n\nBut Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.\n\n“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican state Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.\n\nAnother Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.\n\n“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.\n\nGun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.\n\n“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”\n\nIn South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.\n\n“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”\n\nAnd investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.\n\n“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.\n\nCommunity-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.\n\nSuch programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.\n\nAfter her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who have lost loved ones to violent crime.

    "Full Article Text": "Can a president declare war without consulting Congress? Here's what to know\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe framers of the U.S. Constitution lived in an age of muskets and messengers, when war moved slowly and left time for Congress and the president to confer. But by giving Congress the power to declare war and the president command of the military, they set the stage for lasting struggle over U.S. forces.\n\nPresident Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without first consulting Congress has drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers who say the move bypasses their constitutional authority to declare war.\n\nSpeaking Monday on NPR's Morning Edition, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said that while there's little Democrats can do to force the administration to seek congressional approval, the president should still respect constitutional norms. \"The administration should comply with the Constitution,\" Kelly said. \"Traditionally, presidents have done that. I know recently, sometimes with certain actions, when it is viewed as protecting the safety of our country, presidents can act, and then they should be able to notify us.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was more direct in his criticism. Appearing Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation, he said: \"The United States should not be in an offensive war against Iran without a vote of Congress. The Constitution is completely clear on it. And I am so disappointed that the president has acted so prematurely.\"\n\nSo what does the Constitution actually say?\n\nArticle I gives Congress the power \"to declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\" Article II, meanwhile, designates the president as \"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States,\" giving the executive authority to direct the military once conflict has been authorized.\n\n\"I think it's pretty clear that the framers thought that any time we were going to be making the decision to go to war with another country, that was going to be a decision for Congress,\" says Rebecca Ingber, a law professor at Cardozo Law School in New York.\n\nYet presidents have long sent U.S. forces into combat without a formal declaration of war. As an early example of this, Stephen Griffin, a constitutional law professor at Tulane Law School, points to the Quasi War, a limited naval conflict between the fledgling U.S. and its erstwhile Revolutionary War ally, France. It took place at the end of the 18th century but there was never any formal declaration of war between the two countries.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat trend accelerated after World War II, driven by a combination of new military technologies and evolving global institutions.\n\n\"The creation of the atom bomb changed the game,\" says Griffin. In the early republic, communications were slow and military deployments took months. After 1945, however, \"things were speeded up,\" Griffin notes. \"You would need sometimes an instant response.\"\n\nHe also points to the influence of the United Nations, which the U.S. helped establish in 1945. The U.N. Charter prohibits the use of force by member states except in self-defense or with Security Council approval. Even in the U.S., that framework helped shift legal discussions away from formal declarations of war and toward concepts like \"use of force,\" he says.\n\nCritically, Griffin says, the Constitution doesn't require Congress to issue a formal declaration of war. What matters is legislative approval — such as an authorization for the use of military force (AUMF). \"The constitutional requirement is about legislative approval,\" he explains, \"not literally picking up a document that says, 'Declaration of War' and signing it.\"\n\nWhile the Korean War did not have a formal declaration, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution — widely regarded today as a misleading statement of the facts of a naval encounter between a U.S. destroyer and North Vietnamese gunboats — did draw the U.S. further into the Southeast Asian conflict. Passed it in 1964, that resolution authorized President Lyndon Johnson to take military action in Southeast Asia. President George H.W. Bush got an AUMF for the Persian Gulf War in 1991. During the 1999 Kosovo crisis, President Bill Clinton launched a NATO bombing campaign against what was then Yugoslavia without congressional authorization.\n\nDebate over these conflicts frequently saw the legislative and executive branches at odds. In the wake of the Vietnam War, Congress sought to claw back some authority by passing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which sought \"... to fulfill the intent of the framers of the Constitution ... and insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities.\"﻿ The resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying U.S. forces into hostilities and to end the deployment within 60 days unless Congress authorizes or extends it. It became law after Congress overrode President Nixon's veto.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMichael Glennon is a professor of constitutional and international law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University who was also a legal counsel in the late 1970s for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he handled legal issues surrounding the War Powers Resolution.\n\n\"Vietnam became the turning point for Congress because their constituents were being killed,\" Glennon says.\n\nInitially, he and others were optimistic that the War Powers Resolution would correct the imbalance between Congress and the president and prevent another Vietnam. Instead, the resolution has been largely ignored by presidents of both parties, he says. Over time, administrations have routinely sidestepped its requirements — informing rather than truly consulting Congress, and continuing military operations without proper authorization.\n\nGlennon believes the Constitution \"does prohibit the president from using armed force in attacking a country such as Iran unless there is an attack on the United States or the threat of an imminent attack.\"\n\nThat didn't happen, he says, \"and I conclude, therefore, that this was unconstitutional,\" he says.\n\nBut Glennon acknowledges that \"generally speaking,\" the requirement under the 1973 resolution to consult Congress has been complied with. \"But in some circumstances, Congress has been informed [ahead of time] rather than consulted. That's not what the War Powers Resolution contemplated.\"\n\nIngber, of Cardozo Law School, agrees. \"Even this administration … is at least nodding toward those requirements. Even Secretary of Defense [Pete] Hegseth said, [the administration is acting] 'in accordance with the War Powers Resolution.' \"\n\nThat modicum of respect for at least part of the resolution underscores that it \"is widely considered constitutionally justified under Congress' 'necessary and proper' power,\" Griffin says.\n\nIf the attack on Iran is truly a one-off — as the administration contends — the need to get authorization from Congress for the use of military force is likely unnecessary, he says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut \"if this turns into tit-for-tat with Iran, Trump should get an authorization. That would satisfy the War Powers Resolution — and strengthen his legal position,\" according to Griffin.",

    "Full Article Text": "A monthly weight loss drug from Amgen helped people lose about 20% of their body weight, according to the results of a phase 2 clinical trial.\n\nIf approved, the drug, called MariTide, could make Amgen the first new entrant into a market that’s been dominated by Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly, which makes Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nThese powerful weight loss and Type 2 diabetes medications are all GLP-1 drugs. MariTide is, too, but differs in that it also contains a monoclonal antibody, which helps the drug stay in the body longer so people can take it monthly, rather than weekly.\n\n“It’s always just easier for patients to only have to take something once per month,” said Dr. Michelle Ponder, an assistant professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine in North Carolina who wasn’t involved in Amgen’s trial. “A lot of patients we see in endocrinology are diabetes patients, and so they’d be taking multiple shots of insulin per day. And so, every last shot matters, even if it’s three less shots per month.”\n\nAmgen's results were published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Diabetes Association’s annual meeting in Chicago.\n\nThe trial included nearly 600 adults split into two groups: people with Type 2 diabetes and obesity, and people with obesity alone.\n\nParticipants got one of three doses of MariTide or a placebo, taken once a month for a year. Some of the people in the obesity group started at a lower dose that was gradually increased over several weeks.\n\nThe trial found that participants with obesity alone who got MariTide lost up to 20% of their body weight, on average, after 52 weeks, compared with just 2.6% in the placebo group. Among participants with diabetes, people who got MariTide lost up to 17% of their body weight, on average, compared with 1.4% in the placebo group.\n\nThe results place MariTide on par with Wegovy, which reduced body weight by about 15% after 68 weeks in trials in people without diabetes, and Zepbound, which led to an average weight loss of 22.5% after 72 weeks. (These are not direct comparisons, however, as the drugs were not tested against each other in head-to-head trials.)\n\nBeyond weight loss, MariTide also lowered A1c — a key marker of blood sugar — by as much as 2.2 percentage points in people with diabetes. Ozempic and Mounjaro saw A1c reductions of around 1.5 to 2 percentage points in trials.\n\nParticipants also saw improvements in heart disease risk factors, including blood pressure, inflammation and cholesterol levels.\n\nPonder said that all the GLP-1 medications have shown heart benefits, likely due in part to the amount of weight loss patients experienced.\n\nSide effects reported for MariTide were similar to those seen with other GLP-1 medications, mainly gastrointestinal issues.\n\nDr. Jay Bradner, Amgen’s executive vice president of research and development, said that weight loss with MariTide hadn’t yet plateaued at the one-year mark, suggesting the potential for further weight loss with longer treatment.\n\nThe company is also testing the drug with every-other-month dosing. Early results, Bradner said, showed weight loss was comparable to the monthly version, although patients reported more side effects.\n\nA growing field\n\nMariTide is part of the next generation of highly effective treatments for diabetes and weight loss that aim to offer greater weight loss with fewer side effects than semaglutide (the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (in Mounjaro and Zepbound).\n\nMost of these new drugs are still likely several years away from approval. Amgen, for example, plans to run a 72-week long Phase 3 trial of MariTide as its next step, Bradner said.\n\nLilly and Novo Nordisk also presented findings at the diabetes conference.\n\nAn experimental drug from Lilly, eloralintide, led to an average 11.3% weight loss over 12 weeks in a Phase 1 study, according to new results published last week at the diabetes conference.\n\nUnlike drugs that target the GLP-1 hormone, eloralintide targets amylin, a hormone that slows stomach emptying. Lilly said the drug’s side effects were less common compared with other drugs it has studied, with 8% of patients on the drug reporting nausea and 4% reporting vomiting.\n\nAnother drug from Lilly, called retatrutide, was shown to help people lose about 24% of their body weight, on average, in a mid-stage trial. A Phase 3 trial is expected to be completed later this year.\n\nLilly also found that a combination of semaglutide and bimagrumab — a monoclonal antibody that promotes muscle growth — helped preserve lean muscle mass in patients in a Phase 2 trial.\n\nAnd the company’s experimental weight loss pill, orforglipron, was shown to lower A1c in people with Type 2 diabetes, according to Phase 3 trial results published Saturday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nNovo Nordisk’s newest drug, CagriSema, led to greater weight loss than semaglutide, according to results presented Sunday at the conference.\n\nThe two Phase 3 trials tested CagriSema — a combination of semaglutide and another drug called cagrilintide — in more than 4,500 adults with obesity. In people without diabetes, those who took CagriSema lost an average of 20.4% of their body weight after 68 weeks. Among adults with Type 2 diabetes, average weight loss was 13.7%.\n\nDr. Shauna Levy, a specialist in obesity medicine and the medical director of the Tulane Bariatric Center in New Orleans, said the growing number of options is a bonus for patients who may not respond well to one of the existing treatments.\n\n“It’s long been thought that obesity is an easy disease to treat, but in reality, it’s actually very difficult,” Levy said. “There’s not going to be one right answer for the patients, so the more tools we have to treat the disease, the more likely you will be successful in hopefully eliminating or significantly decreasing this epidemic.”\n\nDr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, said growing competition could also push drugmakers to lower their prices.\n\nWegovy and Zepbound, for example, can cost patients more than $1,000 a month. But in recent months, both Novo Nordisk and Lilly have introduced lower-cost options for those paying out of pocket.\n\n“Access, affordability, remains the No. 1 barrier for patients obtaining any of these medications,” he said.\n\nPonder, of Duke University, said: “The more options, the better. Even if new options come out that aren’t necessarily stronger, just having an additional manufacturer making the medicine is really helpful to expand access to patients.”\n\nCORRECTION (June 23, 2025, 4:29 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated which drugmaker is studying the combination of semaglutide and bimagrumab. It is Eli Lilly, not Novo Nordisk.",
    "Summary": "This article discusses a new weight loss drug and mentions Dr. Shauna Levy, medical director of the Tulane Bariatric Center, who comments positively on the increasing number of weight loss treatment options.  The mention of Tulane is positive by association with a respected expert in the field."

The Black physician-led nonprofit has provided over $700,000 to students like Lewis to cover things like entrance exams, application fees and interview preparation.\n\n“The financial barriers to becoming a physician begin long before med school,” shared Lisa Batiste, The 15 White Coats Executive Director. “MCAT prep, registration, primary-secondary applications, traveling for interviews and more – that can exceed $6,000-12,000 before a student even receives an acceptance.”\n\nBatiste told WRAL 77% of students nationwide cited cost as a significant barrier to med school entry.\n\nThe organization also offers mentorship opportunities and connects students with other resources needed to excel in their medical journeys.\n\nThe nonprofit’s name was inspired by a viral photo of 15 Black students from Tulane University School of Medicine standing in front of what used to be slave quarters at a Louisiana plantation.\n\nBatiste noted the national recognition of the photo helped garner additional support and funding for the group’s mission to increase diversity in medicine.\n\n“They need to believe they belong,” Batiste stated. “In our program, we offer not only peer mentorship but mentorship with seasoned physicians that allow them to discuss some of their concerns. 78% of students reported a significant boost in their confidence because of this.”\n\nNationwide, 5% of physicians are Black and 9% are Hispanic, according to the organization.\n\nLewis told WRAL News she is grateful for the support and guidance she’s received from The 15 White Coats and encouraged other medical students to get involved with the organization.\n\n“These resources were a gamechanger for me, just simply because I don’t come from a background that can help fund these resources on my own,” Lewis said. “They even covered 10 schools I applied to during my primary applications, and they were able to find some networking opportunities for me.\n\nThe aspiring physician shared she hopes more students will be encouraged to pursue careers in medicine, especially in communities that may lack health care access.\n\n“Even in the face of everything going on, there is still a huge need for more doctors, more nurses and more physicians, especially in communities like the one I come from,” Lewis said. “The long-term effect of having providers in these spaces I think outweighs current circumstances that we face today.\"\n\nThe 15 White Coats states the organization is comprised of volunteers with 100% of money raised going directly toward the organization’s cause.",
    "Summary": "This article focuses on Kelsey Lewis's journey to medical school, highlighting the support she received from The 15 White Coats, a nonprofit organization.  The article mentions Tulane University School of Medicine in passing, referencing a photograph of 15 Black medical students from Tulane that inspired the nonprofit's name.  The mention of Tulane is brief and positive, associating it with a successful initiative to increase diversity in medicine.  The overall sentiment regarding Tulane is neutral to slightly positive due to this indirect, positive connection.  The article does not focus on Tulane, but rather on Lewis's success story and the work of The 15 White Coats."

    "Full Article Text": "Viruses encounter a range of selective pressures, but inefficiencies during replication can be masked. To uncover factors that limit viral replication, we used forward genetics to enrich for a murine norovirus (MNV) mutant with faster replication. We sequentially harvested the earliest progeny in cultured cells and identified a single amino acid change in the viral NS3 protein, K40R, that was sufficient to enhance replication speed. We found that the NS3-K40R virus induced earlier cell death and viral egress compared with wild-type virus. Mechanistically, NS3-K40R protein disrupted membranes more efficiently than wild-type NS3 protein, potentially contributing to increased mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Immunodeficient mice infected with NS3-K40R virus had increased titers, suggesting that increasing egress did not reduce fitness in vivo. Overall, by using a forward genetic approach, we identified a previously unknown inefficiency in norovirus egress and provide new insights into selective pressures that influence viral replication and evolution.\n\nFunding: National Institutes of Health grants R37 AI074668 to J.K.P., T32 AI007520 to V.J.R.I, and T32AI005284 to R.W.M.

We found that a single amino acid change in the viral NS3 protein was sufficient to enhance replication. The NS3-K40R mutant induced earlier cell death and viral egress compared to wild-type MNV. Furthermore, the NS3-K40R mutant virus had increased titers in immunodeficient mice. Our findings suggest that viruses can adapt to selective pressures to accelerate replication, and forward genetic approaches are valuable tools for uncovering unanticipated factors that influence viral replication.\n\nNS3 is a multifunctional protein essential at different stages of replication. The NS3 C-terminal domain contains the evolutionarily conserved viral helicase and NTPase, both of which are required for viral genome replication [ 22 , 23 ]. Caliciviruses induce cell death [ 24 – 30 ], and previous studies have implicated NS3 in this process [ 31 , 32 ]. Recently, it was demonstrated that the N-terminal region of NS3 promotes viral egress [ 31 , 32 ]. Wang and colleagues showed that NS3 interacts with mitochondrial lipids, including cardiolipin, and disrupts cardiolipin-containing liposomes, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cell death [ 31 , 33 ]. Notably, in the absence of this NS3-mediated cell death function, infected cells accumulate large numbers of progeny viruses that fail to exit and spread. However, the large 158 amino acid domain deletion in NS3 in that study makes it difficult to disentangle effects on egress from other facets of replication.\n\nMurine norovirus (MNV), a nonenveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus from the Caliciviridae family, serves as a model enteric virus [ 12 , 13 ]. The MNV genome is approximately 7.4 kb and encodes 3–4 open reading frames (ORFs) [ 12 , 14 ]. Translation of ORF1 produces a polyprotein that is cleaved by the viral protease to generate the mature non-structural proteins NS1–7 [ 14 ]. The vRNA replication complex has been linked to vesicular clusters [ 15 , 16 ] and includes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (NS7), VPg (NS5), and nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase)/RNA helicase (NS3) [ 17 ]. MNV lab strains share 87% or greater genetic identity [ 18 ] and can cause either acute (MNV1 CW3) or persistent infections (MNV3, MNV CR6, MNV CR3) in mice [ 19 , 20 ]. In cell culture, MNV replicates efficiently in dendritic and macrophage cell lines [ 21 ], and many groups use immortalized macrophage cell lines, such as BV2 and RAW264.7, for MNV studies. Replication kinetics can vary, but capsid proteins are detectable as early as 6 h post-infection, and progeny virions are typically observed 9–12 h after infection [ 21 ]. Therefore, the 12–24 h timeframe is frequently used for in vitro infection experiments.\n\nViral replication is a complex process and exposure to selective pressures can drive viral adaptation [ 1 – 3 ]. In particular, RNA viruses are highly adaptable due to the high mutation rates of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which lack proofreading [ 2 , 4 – 7 ]. Adaptive mutations can enhance viral replication under various selective pressures, including neutralizing antibodies [ 8 ], replication within animals [ 9 ], and heat exposure [ 10 ]. Forward genetic screening has revealed viral adaptive changes and illuminated unexpected replication defects. For example, in a previous study, we demonstrated that a mutation in the capsid of coxsackievirus B3 increased replication in cultured cells by destabilizing the virion and facilitating more efficient viral RNA (vRNA) release during uncoating [ 11 ]. Therefore, viral adaptive mutations can reveal new insights into unanticipated facets of viral replication.\n\nStat1 −/− mice were perorally infected with 10 6 PFU of WT or NS3-K40R virus followed by assessment of (A) weight loss, (B) survival until 8 days post-infection. Data are mean ± SEM (n = 8, ≥ 2 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, Mantel-Cox test. Infections were repeated, but mice were sacrificed at 24 h post-infection for viral titer analysis via plaque assay for tissues including (C) spleen, (D) duodenum, (E) ileum, and (F) colon. We repeated infections in immunocompetent mice and sacrificed at 24 h post-infection for viral titer analysis via plaque assay for tissues including (G) ileum and (H) colon. Data are mean ± SEM (n = 12, ≥ 2 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, unpaired t test. LOD, limit of detection. LOD was determined based on the average tissue weight. The data underlying this figure can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 14–21.\n\nTo determine whether NS3-K40R alters MNV replication or pathogenesis in vivo, we perorally infected Stat1 −/− mice with 10 6 PFU of MNV3 WT or NS3-K40R. We chose to use immunodeficient Stat1 −/− mice for these initial experiments because MNV can induce clinical signs and even death, whereas MNV infection is generally not severe in immunocompetent mice [ 39 , 40 ]. First, we monitored weight loss and clinical signs of infection. Mice were euthanized when they had lost 25% of their body weight or exhibited any critical clinical signs. In NS3-K40R-infected mice, clinical signs such as eye discharge appeared as early as 3 days post-infection. Both WT- and NS3-K40R-infected mice displayed similar clinical signs, including constipation, eye discharge, paralysis, and lethargy. Throughout the infection, NS3-K40R did not cause significant differences in weight loss or survival ( Fig 6A and 6B ). Second, we repeated the experiment in Stat1 −/− mice as well as in immunocompetent mice but sacrificed mice at 24 h post-infection for titer analysis via plaque assays [ 41 ]. NS3-K40R-infected Stat1 −/− mice had increased viral titers in the spleen, duodenum, ileum and colon ( Fig 6C – 6F ). However, we did not observe differences in WT versus NS3-K40R viral titers from immunocompetent mice ( Fig 6G and 6H ). Overall, the increased titers of NS3-K40R in Stat1 −/− mice suggest that this mutation enhances viral replication early in infection within an immunocompromised host, but this advantage is lost in mice with intact innate immune responses.\n\nNS3 protein binds cardiolipin [ 31 ], a phospholipid primarily localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria but that is translocated to the outer membrane during cellular stress such as infection [ 36 – 38 ]. To investigate whether NS3-K40R induces cell death by disrupting mitochondria, we tested its ability to disrupt cardiolipin liposomes. Due to potential confounding effects from the His6-MBP tag on NS3 proteins for these liposome-based experiments, we cleaved the tag, purified NS3 proteins via size-exclusion chromatography, and collected predicted monomers (~39 kDa) ( S4A Fig ). We then incubated varying concentrations of proteins with or without cardiolipin liposomes encapsulating terbium (III) cation (Tb 3+ ) and quantified membrane disruption through release of Tb 3+ . As expected, there was minimal Tb 3+ release in control experiments using BSA with liposomes or NS3-K40R in the absence of liposomes ( S4B Fig ). At high NS3 protein concentration (0.5 µM), WT and K40R proteins showed no differences in their ability to disrupt cardiolipin liposomes ( S4C Fig ). However, at lower concentrations (0.05 and 0.005 µM), NS3-K40R was still able to disrupt cardiolipin liposomes, whereas NS3 WT was not ( Fig 5E ). Cardiolipin membrane disruption by NS3-WT required high protein concentrations (0.5 µM or 0.1 µM) ( Fig 5F ). These results suggest that NS3-K40R can disrupt cardiolipin membranes at protein concentrations 10–100-fold lower than WT NS3. Overall, these data indicate that the K40R mutation enhances the ability of NS3 to target cardiolipin-containing membranes, potentially contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.\n\n(A, B) NS3-K40R increases cell death at early times post-infection. BV2 cells were infected with mock, WT or NS3-K40R at MOI 15 and at 6 or 8 h post-infection the number of dead cells was quantified by flow cytometry to detect SYTOX nucleic acid staining of non-viable cells.

(C, D) NS3-K40R increases mitochondrial superoxide at early times post-infection. BV2 cells were infected with mock, WT or NS3-K40R at MOI 15 and at 6 or 8 h post-infection mitochondrial superoxide was quantified by flow cytometry to detect MitoSOX staining.

Data are representative of two independent experiments with separate protein/liposome preparations. (F) NS3-WT protein induces liposome leakage at high protein concentrations.

The data underlying this figure can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 10–13.\n\nHow does NS3-K40R induce earlier viral egress? Given that the K40R mutation is within the N-terminal domain of NS3 that induces cell death by targeting mitochondria [ 31 ], we examined cell death and production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) both late in infection and at early time points. First, to determine whether NS3-K40R affects cell viability late in infection, BV2 cells were infected with either WT or NS3-K40R virus, and cell viability was measured at 24 h post-infection using an ATP-based assay. At 24 h post-infection, cell viability was reduced for both WT and NS3-K40R compared with mock-infected cells. However, NS3-K40R virus induced greater cell death than WT virus ( S3A Fig ). Given that NS3-K40R promotes earlier viral egress at 6 and 8 hours post-infection ( Fig 4B ), we next examined its effect on cell death at these early time points using SYTOX nucleic acid stain and flow cytometry. As expected, cell death was minimal this early in infection. However, NS3-K40R virus-induced increased cell death at 6 and 8 h post-infection compared with WT virus ( Figs 5A , 5B , and S5A ). Next, to assess mitochondrial damage, cells were infected as above but incubated with MitoSOX and quantified by flow cytometry to measure mitochondrial ROS. Mirroring the cell viability results, at 24 h post-infection, both WT and NS3-K40R infected cells had higher mitochondrial superoxide than mock-infected cells, but NS3-K40R virus-induced higher levels than WT virus ( S3B Fig ). At 6 and 8 h post-infection, mitochondrial superoxide levels were low, but NS3-K40R virus-induced increased mitochondrial superoxide compared with WT virus ( Figs 5C , 5D , and S5B ). These findings suggest that NS3-K40R promotes both cell death and mitochondrial disruption earlier in infection compared to WT virus.\n\nTo determine whether effects extend to cell lines other than BV2 cells, we quantified extracellular viral yield of WT versus NS3-K40R in RAW264.7 macrophages. We found increased viral yield of NS3-K40R virus in the supernatant of RAW264.7 cells after 8 h post-infection ( S2 Fig ), suggesting that NS3-K40R facilitates earlier viral egress in multiple cell lines.\n\nBV2 cells were infected with MNV3 WT or NS3-K40R at MOI 0.1 for 4, 6, and 8 h post-infection, and progeny were harvested from (A) cells (representing virion particles within cells) or (B) culture supernatants (representing extracellular virus) followed by plaque assay quantification. Data are mean ± SEM (n = 3, ≥ 3 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA. ND, not detected. LOD, limit of detection. The data underlying this figure can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 8–9.\n\nGiven that NS3-K40R did not alter RNA synthesis or vRNA:PFU ratio, we examined a later stage in the replication cycle, viral release/egress. As a non-enveloped virus, MNV progeny are fully assembled intracellularly prior to release. To examine egress, BV2 cells were infected at an MOI 0.1 and viral progeny were collected at 4, 6, and 8 h post-infection from two distinct sites: cell-associated progeny within cells versus extracellular progeny in the media. Plaque assays revealed no differences in the viral titers of cell-associated virus between NS3-K40R and WT-infected cells, further supporting the idea that NS3-K40R does not alter RNA synthesis or earlier replication stages ( Fig 4A ). However, NS3-K40R virus had increased extracellular viral titers compared with WT, including a ~ 7-fold increase in viral yield at 8 hours post-infection ( Fig 4B ). To gain finer insight into egress kinetics, we performed additional infection experiments where BV2 cells were infected at an MOI 0.1 and extracellular viral progeny in the media were collected every two hours over a 16-h period. We found that at early time points, between 6 and 10 h post-infection, the NS3-K40R had higher viral titers than WT ( S1A Fig ). However, at later time points, no significant differences were observed between WT and NS3-K40R. To determine the total viral yields for WT and NS3-K40R over the 16-h infection, we calculated the area under the curve and found no significant differences ( S1B Fig ). These data suggest that while NS3-K40R may confer an early advantage in viral release, the overall viral yield across the infection time course is similar for NS3-K40R and WT.\n\nNext, to determine whether NS3-K40R alters NS3 enzymatic functions as an NTPase, we purified NS3 proteins and measured ATP hydrolysis via release of inorganic phosphate [ 23 ]. We expressed NS3 as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins and purified full-length His6-MBP-NS3 WT and K40R using affinity chromatography. To ensure equal protein concentrations for the NTPase assay, purified proteins, and an MBP control were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and band intensities were quantified ( Fig 3C ). Then, WT or NS3-K40R proteins were incubated with ATP for 30 min at 37 °C, and phosphate release was measured using a colorimetric assay. ATP was efficiently hydrolyzed by MBP-NS3, confirming its NTPase activity. However, no apparent differences in ATP hydrolysis were observed between WT and K40R after 30 min of reaction. As a control, MBP alone did not show detectable phosphate release ( Fig 3D ). Overall, these data demonstrate that NS3-K40R does not alter genome copy numbers during infection or ATP hydrolysis of purified protein, suggesting that the mutation does not enhance RNA synthesis.\n\n(A) Quantification of viral RNA during infection. BV2 cells were infected with WT or NS3-K40R at MOI 2, and intracellular viral RNA at indicated time points was harvested and quantified via RT-qPCR targeting MNV ORF1. Data are mean ± SEM (n = 3, ≥ 3 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA. (B) MNV3 WT and NS3-K40R have similar vRNA to PFU ratios. BV2 cells were infected and at 10 h post-infection cells were collected and split, with half used to determine titers by plaque assay and half used for RNA extraction and quantification by qRT-PCR. The vRNA:PFU ratio represents the viral genome copies (viral genomes/mL) divided by viral titer (PFU/mL). Data are mean ± SEM (n = 3, ≥ 3 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, unpaired t test. (C) Purified MBP-NS3 proteins used for NTPase assay. MBP-NS3 fusion proteins or MBP protein alone were purified and analyzed by 4%–20% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The bands of proteins were quantified using ImageJ. (D) NTPase activity of purified NS3 proteins. NS3-MBP fusion proteins or MBP protein alone were incubated with 10 µM ATP for 30 min at 37 °C, and inorganic phosphate released from ATP hydrolysis was quantified via a colorimetric assay and its concentration was determined based on a standard curve. Data are mean ± SEM (Representative data from three independent protein preparations). *P < 0.05, ANOVA. The data underlying this figure can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 5–7.\n\nTo determine whether NS3-K40R enhances replication kinetics through effects on RNA replication and/or virion production, we quantified vRNA accumulation in infected cells and the ratio of vRNA to PFU. First, we quantified viral genome copy numbers early in infection. BV2 cells were infected at an MOI 2, harvested at 2, 4, and 6 h post-infection, and vRNA was quantified by qRT-PCR. No differences in genome copies were observed between NS3-K40R and WT virus ( Fig 3A ). Second, we compared the replication capacity of WT and NS3-K40R by calculating the vRNA:PFU ratio. BV2 cells were infected at MOI 2, and cells were collected at 10 h post-infection. Half of the cell volume was used for qRT-PCR to quantify genome copies as described above, while the other half was used for plaque assays to determine viral titers. We then calculated the vRNA:PFU ratio by dividing the number of genome copies by the viral titer. No significant differences in the vRNA:PFU ratio were observed ( Fig 3B ), indicating that NS3-K40R does not alter vRNA or virion production at 10 h post-infection.\n\nNS3 is a multifunctional protein with enzymatic activity in the viral replication complex [ 22 , 23 ] and a role in cell death and viral egress [ 31 , 32 ]. MNV NS3 protein has three domains: the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–158), the core domain (amino acids 158–289), and the C-terminal domain (amino acids 290–364) [ 22 , 31 ]. Specifically, the NS3-K40R mutation is in the N-terminal domain of NS3. Lysine at position 40 is conserved among MNVs ( Fig 2D , highlighted in yellow); however, it is less conserved among other members of the Caliciviridae family. For example, human norovirus has arginine and Tulane virus has glutamine at this position ( Fig 2D ). These data suggest that the impact of this region of NS3 may vary across the Caliciviridae family.\n\nTo determine if the NS3-K40R or VP2-A114 mutations were sufficient to increase replication kinetics, we cloned them into an MNV3 infectious clone plasmid using site-directed mutagenesis and generated virus stocks. We infected BV2 cells at MOI 0.1, collected combined cells and supernatant for each sample at 4, 6, and 8 hours post-infection, and viral titer was determined via plaque assay. NS3-K40R showed higher viral titers, most notably at 8 hours post-infection, with ~5-fold higher titers than cells infected with WT ( Fig 2B ). The titers from VP2 A114 were similar to WT. These data suggest that NS3-K40R was sufficient to confer increased replication kinetics. To assess when the NS3-K40R arose during passaging, we performed consensus sequence analysis for progeny from previous passages, focusing on the NS3 N-terminal region. Mutation of adenine to guanine (AAG to AGG), which confers the NS3-K40R substitution, was first observed at Passage 4, and predominated the population by Passage 8 ( Fig 2C ).\n\n(A) Schematic of MNV3 genome with mutations found after 11 passages. Consensus sequence analysis revealed three mutations in viral progeny from passage 11-6 h stocks: Two amino acid substitutions in NS3, K40R, and I340T, and a silent mutation in the minor capsid protein VP2. Passage 11-24 h stocks also contained the NS3-I340T mutation. (B) Viral infection assay of MNV3 WT, NS3-K40R, and VP2-114. Infectious clone-derived viruses bearing NS3-K40R, the VP2-114 silent mutation, or no engineered mutations (WT) were used to infect BV2 cells at an MOI 0.1. Cells and supernatant were collected, and virus was quantified via plaque assay. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 4; ≥ 4 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA. (C) Emergence of adenine to guanine (AAG to AGG) mutation at position 1147 (NS3 amino acid 40) during viral passaging. Peak heights were determined from chromatograms of the consensus sequence across passages. The percentages of peak heights were calculated based on the relative abundance of all four nucleotides at position 1147. (D) Conservation of amino acids at position 25 to 49 of NS3 across selected caliciviruses. Viruses are arranged based on their percentage identity relative to MNV3. Amino acid sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE. Lysine 40 (K40) of NS3 is marked with a yellow rectangle. LOD, limit of detection. The data underlying this figure can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 3–4.\n\nWe performed consensus sequencing to determine whether mutations contributed to the increased replication kinetics of the Passage 11-6 h virus. Viral genomes from Passage 11-6 h and Passage 11-24 h were amplified using RT-PCR and products were sequenced. We identified a total of three mutations in Passage 11-6 h virus, at nucleotides 1147, 2047, and 7022 ( Fig 2A ). The mutation at nucleotide 2047 resulted in an amino acid substitution from isoleucine to threonine (I340T) in non-structural protein 3 (NS3), which was present in both Passage 11-6 h and Passage 11-24 h. Given that I340T was present in both selective (Passage 11-6 h) and non-selective (Passage 11-24 h) conditions, it is possible that this mutation is due to drift or general cell culture adaptation. Indeed, we recently identified a mutation at this site, I340V, in MNV genomes following adaptation to replication in HeLa cells [ 35 ]. Both mutations at I340 appear to be associated with general cell culture adaptation. On the other hand, two mutations were unique to the viral progeny from Passage 11-6 h: a missense mutation nucleotide 1147 that resulted in substitution from lysine to arginine (K40R) in NS3 and a silent mutation at nucleotide 7022 in the minor capsid protein VP2 (A114).\n\n(A) Schematic showing serial passage strategy. Initial MNV3 stock (P0) was used to infect BV2 cells, and progeny were harvested at 6 h or 24 h post-infection. Low titer viral progeny harvested at 6 hours were amplified overnight in BV2 cells to facilitate subsequent passages. Half of the volume of each sample was used to initiate a new passage, and the cycle was repeated 11 times. (B) Viral infection assay comparing the initial stock virus (Passage 0) and viruses passaged 11 times, collecting at 6 h vs. 24 h. BV2 cells were infected at an MOI 0.1 for 6 h. Cells and supernatant were pooled for each sample, and viral titers were quantified via plaque assay. Data are mean ± SEM (n = 6, ≥ 3 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA. (C) Single-cycle growth curve of Passage 0 and Passage 11-6 h. BV2 cells were infected at MOI 0.1 and cells and supernatant were collected and viral titer determined via plaque assay. Data are mean ± SEM (n = 7, ≥ 4 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, unpaired t test. LOD, limit of detection. The data underlying this Fig can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 1–2.\n\nTo determine whether MNV could adapt to replicate more rapidly, we performed serial passage of MNV3 in BV2 cells, harvesting the early progeny. MNV progeny can be detected at high titers after 12 h post-infection [ 21 , 34 ]. For serial passage, we infected BV2 cells with MNV3 at an MOI 0.1 and we collected combined cells and culture supernatants for each sample at two different time points: 6 h post-infection to harvest the earliest progeny, or 24 h post-infection to harvest progeny from a complete replication cycle. The low-yield virus collected at 6 h was amplified in BV2 cells overnight to achieve higher titers. Samples were then freeze-thawed to release intracellular virus, and half of the sample was used for a new passage. This process was repeated for 11 passages ( Fig 1A ). After 11 passages, we performed a viral infection assay for 6 h at an MOI 0.1 to determine the phenotype of the passaged virus compared to the input stock. Samples collected at 6 h post-infection (Passage 11-6 h) produced higher yields than the input stock virus (Passage 0) or samples collected at 24 h post-infection (Passage 11-24 h) ( Fig 1B ). We also performed a single-cycle growth curve to determine replication kinetics and observed higher viral titers from Passage 11-6 h compared to Passage 0 at early time points of infection ( Fig 1C ). For example, passage 11-6 h virus had 42-fold higher titers at 8 h post-infection compared with Passage 0 virus. These data suggest that the passaged virus (Passage 11-6 h) produced progeny viruses earlier than Passage 0 virus.\n\nHere we show that NS3-K40R MNV3 produces progeny faster in vitro and replicates to higher titers in Stat1 −/− mice—so why does wild-type MNV3 contain lysine rather than arginine at position 40? In general, MNV strains contain lysine at this position ( Fig 2D ). However, a few caliciviruses have arginine at this position, including human norovirus (Norwalk strain), Newbury-1 virus, and Turkey calicivirus. The relative egress efficiencies of these other viruses are unknown, but it is possible that other amino acids in the N-terminal region of NS3 also impact cell death and egress. For example, early cell death and egress of progeny may reduce viral yield in the long run—a cell that dies early may contain fewer progeny viruses than a live cell that continues to support logarithmic viral replication for hours. Indeed, we found that over a full 16-h single cycle of infection, total yields of WT and NS3-K40R progeny were equivalent ( S1 Fig ), suggesting that WT virus “catches up”. Another possibility is that early release of progeny induces early host immune responses that would then limit replication. Importantly, although NS3-K40R has higher titers than WT in Stat1 −/− mice, this titer difference is lost immune-competent animals ( Fig 6C – H ). Therefore, it is possible that in immune-competent animals, STAT1-dependent innate responses are triggered sooner by early viral egress of NS3-K40R virions, thus limiting the advantage of NS3-K40R. Finally, a major determinant of viral fitness is interhost transmission. It is possible that variants with enhanced egress have reduced transmission. In the end, subtle fitness costs for NS3-K40R MNV3, or fitness costs not studied here may explain maintenance of lysine at this position. Overall, this study illuminates the importance of NS3-mediated egress of MNV and provides new insights into viral evolution and fitness.\n\nHow does a conservative amino acid change from lysine to arginine at position 40 of MNV NS3 alter mitochondrial membrane disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death? Previous work suggests that the N-terminal domain of MNV NS3 contains a mitochondrial localization signal, and a four-helix bundle homologous to the membrane-disruption domain of the host mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) cell death protein [ 22 , 31 , 45 , 46 ]. For MLKL, phosphorylation triggers a conformational change that results in association with the plasma membrane, followed by membrane permeabilization via the four-helix bundle domain [ 46 – 48 ]. For NS3, Wang and colleagues suggest that the mitochondrial localization signal in amino acids 1–20 of NS3 directs the protein to mitochondria followed by membrane disruption via four-helix bundle domain in amino acids 25–158. Deletion of the N-terminal 20 amino acids of NS3 prevented MNV-mediated cell death and egress, thus blocking detectable viral spread in vitro and in vivo [ 31 ]. Although lysine to arginine is a conserved amino acid change, there is precedent for profound functional differences for proteins that bind and alter membranes. Previous studies have shown that replacing arginine with lysine reduces the membrane translocation efficiency of peptides like Penetratin [ 49 ]. In contrast, substituting lysine for arginine enhances cellular uptake of HIV Tat protein [ 50 ]. Notably, we found that NS3-K40R protein disrupts cardiolipin-containing membranes at concentrations 10–100-fold lower than wild-type NS3 protein ( Fig 5E ). Additionally, we routinely purified more NS3-K40R protein compared with NS3-WT protein, with ~3–6 times more NS3-K40R than WT in eight independent protein preparations (see S4A Fig for an example). The properties of arginine and its guanidinium group in NS3-K40R may influence protein stability and interactions with membrane lipids, ultimately leading to mitochondrial disruption and cell death. Although the precise mechanism by which NS3-K40R disrupts mitochondria remains unknown, these results provide new insight into NS3-mediated viral egress.\n\nRecent studies have suggested a role for the N-terminus of NS3 in cell death induction, and our results extend and elevate the importance of NS3-mediated egress in vitro and in vivo [ 31 , 32 , 43 , 44 ]. Aktepe and colleagues demonstrated that amino acids 67–100 of NS3 induce host translation shutoff and cell death [ 32 ]. Wang and colleagues demonstrated that N-terminal NS3 amino acids 1–158 were necessary and sufficient to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death [ 31 ]. Viral genomes lacking the N-terminal domain of NS3 were capable of RNA replication and forming progeny virions, but lack of cell death and egress meant they were unable to spread, form plaques, or produce progeny in mice [ 31 ]. However, the large deletion in NS3 makes it difficult to differentiate effects on egress from other aspects of viral replication and fitness. Here, we used an unbiased approach to enrich for faster-replicating mutants and found a single conservative amino acid change in the N-terminal domain of NS3 increased egress by enhancing membrane damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death ( Fig 5 ). Thus, in a system where any mutation in the genome that increases early progeny production could be selected, the fact that an egress-enhancing mutation emerged highlights the importance and relevance of NS3-mediated MNV egress. Overall, our study cements a key role for the NS3 N-terminal region, particularly position 40, in mitochondrial membrane disruption, cell death, and MNV egress.\n\nAlthough mutation of norovirus NS3 at position 40 has not been described previously, other mutations in NS3 have been characterized [ 22 , 34 , 35 , 42 ]. For example, targeted mutations in the predicted phosphate-binding loop (K168Q) reduced NS3’s enzymatic activities, reducing inorganic phosphate release or unwinding activity [ 22 , 42 ]. Arias and colleagues identified rare variants containing NS3-T91A in mice persistently infected with MNV3 [ 34 ], and we previously identified NS3-I340V among a large number of mutations in MNV1 variants with increased replication in HeLa cells [ 35 ]. In this study, we identified an NS3 mutation with no apparent differences in enzymatic activity but instead it facilitated earlier cell death and viral egress.\n\nWhile much is known about factors that influence viral replication, masked inefficiencies may exist that can be discovered using the power of forward genetic screens. Here, found that MNV egress can be enhanced by a mutation in NS3. This mutant virus had increased egress via enhanced cell death ( Figs 4 , 5A , and 5B ). More specifically, the NS3-K40R protein disrupted membranes with mitochondrial lipids more efficiently than WT protein ( Fig 5E and 5F ). NS3-K40R virus also had increased titers in Stat1 −/− mice ( Fig 6C – 6F ) but was equivalent to WT virus in immune-competent mice. Overall, these results revealed a previously unknown inefficiency in calicivirus replication and revealed new insights into mechanisms of non-enveloped viral egress.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nEthics statement All animals were handled according to the Guide for the Care of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All mouse studies were performed at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Animal Welfare Assurance no. a3472-01) using protocols approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in a manner designed to minimize pain, and any animals that exhibited severe disease were euthanized immediately with isoflurane or CO 2 .\n\nCells and viruses BV2 and RAW264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% HEPES, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. MNV3 P6 clone (Courtesy of Stephanie Karst Lab KC792553.1 [34]). Viruses were generated by transfecting HEK293T cells with infectious clone plasmids, followed by two rounds of amplification in BV2 cells to produce high-titer viral stocks. Stocks were stored at −80 °C.\n\nViral passaging experiments BV2 cells were seeded at 1.2 × 10⁶ cells/well in 6-well plates and infected with MNV3 at an MOI 0.1. After 1 hour at 37 °C, the supernatant was removed, cells were washed, and fresh media was added. Infection was continued for 6 or 24 h before scraping cells into the media to collect pooled intracellular and extracellular progeny. Samples were freeze-thawed three times to release intracellular virus, and half of the sample was used to initiate the next infection. Low yield 6 h passaged samples were used to infect new BV2 cells in overnight amplifications to facilitate the next passages. Passages 2-5 were performed at unknown MOI. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay after passage 5. Passaging continued with an initial MOI 0.1 for passage 6, followed by additional passages of unknown MOI. These forward genetic experiments with MNV were performed under BSL2 conditions, as approved by the UT Southwestern Institutional Biosafety Committee.\n\nSequencing and cloning We performed consensus sequencing on Passage 11 viral populations as previously described [35]. Briefly, Passage 11 viruses were used to infect BV2 cells, vRNA was isolated at 18 h post-infection using TRIzol reagent, and cDNA was generated by RT-PCR with SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher) using Primer X (Table 1). PCR products were made using primer sets from Table 1 and purified with the Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel). Sequencing was performed by Azenta/Genewiz with the primers listed in Table 1. The sequences of the passaged viruses were compared with the sequence of initial stock (Passage 0) in SnapGene to identify mutations. We identified three mutations in Passage 11-6 h virus: A to G at nt 1147 (NS3-K40R), U to C at nt 2047 (NS3-I340T), and C to U at nt 7022 (a silent mutation in VP2 amino acid 114). Note that other minor variants may be present in P11-6 h samples that were not abundant enough to detect by consensus sequencing, but may contribute to phenotypes shown in Fig 1. The Passage 11-24 h samples also contained the NS3-I340T mutation, but not the NS3-K40R or silent mutation in VP2. It is possible that the NS3-I340T mutation, in combination with NS3-K40R, contributes to increased replication speed of the P11-6 h viral population (Fig 1C), but this was not evaluated here.

Primers covering the MNV genome. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003245.t001 To determine at which passage lysine was substituted with arginine at NS3 amino acid 40, we analyzed the nucleotide sequences at position 1147. We analyzed the consensus sequence across all viral progeny passages at 6 h using Primer set II from Table 1. The peak heights of all four nucleotides (A, G, C, T) at position 1147 were determined from the sequencing chromatogram. The percentages presented in Fig 2C were calculated based on the relative abundance of each nucleotide. Mutations unique to the Passage 11-6 h samples (NS3-K40R or VP2 silent mutation) were introduced into the MNV3 plasmid using site-directed mutagenesis (Genewiz/Azenta Life Sciences). Whole-plasmid sequencing (Plasmidsaurus) confirmed the presence of the mutations of interest and absence of other mutations. NS3-K40R and VP2-A114 viruses were generated from plasmids as described above. The presence of the mutations in the resulting viral stocks was sequence confirmed in RT-PCR products by Genewiz/Azenta Life Sciences.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis We analyzed the conservation of amino acids at positions 25–49 of NS3 in relation to the MNV3 P6 clone. Sequence data were obtained from the NCBI database, with accession numbers and related information provided in Table 2. Representative sequences for caliciviruses were selected from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) for each genus. Amino acid sequences were analyzed and aligned using MUSCLE, and the alignments were visualized with Geneious Prime. PPT PowerPoint slide\n\nPNG larger image\n\nTIFF original image Download: Table 2. List of accession numbers from caliciviruses used for conservation analysis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003245.t002\n\nViral infection assays Plaque assays were performed as described previously. Briefly, virus was diluted in PBS+ (PBS supplemented with 100 μg/mL CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 ) and incubated with BV2 cells for 20–30 min at 37 °C for attachment. Cells were then overlaid with 1.5% methylcellulose in MEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% HEPES. Overlays were removed after 72 h [35,51]. We set the limit of detection (LOD) at 2 plaques in undiluted samples (10 PFU); therefore, in some cases, values were below this detection limit. Samples with 1 or more plaques were included in the statistical analysis. For infection experiments and single cycle replication experiments, 1.2 × 106 BV2 cells/well in 6-well plates were infected at MOI 0.1, and at 1 hr post-infection inoculum was aspirated, cells were washed, and fresh media was added. At each time point, cells and supernatant were pooled from each well and collected. Samples were subject to freeze-thaw cycles three times to release any intracellular virus, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. For experiments in Fig 4 comparing cell-associated virus versus extracellular virus, infections were performed as above except that media were collected as the source of extracellular virus (with an additional spin to remove any floating cells) and remaining cells were washed prior to collection as the source of the cell-associated virus. For S1A and S1B Fig, the total area under the curve was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. To quantify vRNA during infection we used qRT-PCR as previously described [51]. Briefly, 6 x106 BV2 cells were infected with MNV3 WT and NS3-K40R virus at MOI 2 followed by removal of inoculum and washing at 1 hr post-infection. At 2, 4, and 6 hrs post-infection, cells were collected and intracellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol. cDNA was generated, and TaqMan quantitative PCR (qPCR) for MNV was performed in triplicate for each sample as described previously to quantify viral genomes [51]. The primers used for all samples are specified in Table 3. MNV3 plasmid that had been linearized with EcoRI was used as a standard.

List of previously published primers used for qPCR [ List of previously published primers used for qPCR [ 51 ]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003245.t003 For RNA:PFU ratio, plates were seeded with 4.4 x106 BV2 cells and infected with WT or NS3-K40R at MOI 2. At 1 hr post-infection inoculum was aspirated, cells were washed, and fresh media was added. After 10 hours post-infection, the cells were collected, and half were resuspended in 1mL PBS+ and used for plaque assays on BV2 cells. The remaining cells were resuspended in Trizol, and vRNA was isolated and quantified using qRT-PCR as described above. The RNA:PFU ratio was calculated by dividing the genome copy number by the titer for each sample.\n\nProtein purification WT and NS3-K40R NS3 proteins were purified from E. coli using a pMAL-c6T-His6-MBP vector as previously described [31]. Briefly, protein expression was induced overnight at 20°C with 0.25 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside after A 600 reached 0.8–0.9. The proteins were affinity-purified by Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). To remove heat-shock proteins we did an ATP wash that included incubation for <5 min with 20 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl and 5mM ATP. Bound proteins were washed three times and eluted with buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and Imidazole 250 mM. The proteins were subsequently affinity-purified with amylose resin (NEB) and eluted with buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 10 mM maltose. After purification, proteins concentration was determined and normalized using 4%–20% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. BSA was used as the standard, and total protein intensity was quantified with ImageJ. For NTPase experiments, we used His6-MBP tagged versions of WT or K40R NS3 proteins. However, for liposome leakage assays, we used preparations of these proteins without tags. The His6-MBP tag was removed by overnight TEV digestion at 16 °C and further purified with Ni-NTA agarose. We performed dialysis to exchange media buffer A (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl) . Then, TEV-cleaved NS3 proteins were purified by Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare), and the predicted monomers (~39 kDa) were collected. Previous studies have demonstrated the early aggregation of NS3 during collection [23,31]. Therefore, for liposome leakage assays, we focused on investigating the effect of NS3 as a monomer (S4A Fig).\n\nNTPase assay. NTPase activity of NS3 proteins was measured using Phosphate Assay Kit - PiColorLock (Abcam). His6-MBP-NS3-WT or His6-MBP-NS3-K40R proteins, or a MBP alone control, at 2 uM were incubated with 10 µM ATP for 30 min at 37°C, and inorganic phosphate released from ATP hydrolysis was quantified by measuring the absorbance using Biotek Synergy LX. A standard curve was used to determine the linear concentration of inorganic phosphate released during the reaction.\n\nCell death and mitochondrial disruption assays Cell death was determined by measuring the levels of the nucleic acid stain SYTOX (ThermoFisher) and mitochondrial ROS were determined by measuring the mitochondria-specific superoxide indicator MitoSOX Red (ThermoFisher). For both assays, 2 x 105 BV2 cells were infected with WT or NS3-K40R viruses at MOI 2 for 24 hour experiments or MOI 15 for 6–8 hour experiments, inocula were removed and cells washed at 1 hr post-infection, fresh media was added, and at 6, 8, or 24 hours post-infection the relevant assay was performed. To measure cell death, BV2 cells were collected and stained with SYTOX for 15 min at RT. To measure mitochondrial ROS production, BV2 cells were collected and stained with the mitochondria-specific superoxide indicator MitoSOX Red for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fluorescence was quantified using a Stratedigm benchtop flow cytometer. The percentage of cells was determined using FlowJo software. For cell viability assays, cells were infected as described above and number of live cells was determined by measuring ATP levels using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ATP levels were measured via luminescence using a Synergy LX plate reader.\n\nLiposome preparation and liposome leakage assay Cardiolipin liposomes were prepared as described by Wang and colleagues [31]. Briefly, lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids To prepare Tb3+-encapsulated liposomes, lipids 80% POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and 20% cardiolipin were mixed in a glass vial. Dry lipid films were obtained by evaporating under a stream of air and then hydrated at room temperature with vortex in 300 μl buffer B (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium citrate and 15 mM TbCl 3 ). Liposomes were generated by extrusion of the hydrated lipids through 100 nm polycarbonate filter (Whatman) 30 times using a Mini-Extruder device (Avanti Polar Lipids). The Tb3+ ions outside the liposome were removed by washing with buffer A (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl) on a centrifugal column (Amico Ultra-4, 100 K MWCO, Millipore). The liposomes were resuspended in buffer A and were stored at 4 °C and used within 24 hours. For liposome leakage assays, 0.1 mM of Tb3+-encapsulated liposomes were suspended in 250 μl buffer C (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) 150 mM NaCl and 50 μM of DPA) and NS3 or control proteins were added. Due to the sensitivity of these assays, NS3 proteins were used within 3 days of size-exclusion chromatography. Fluorescence of Tb3+ was monitored over time on a PTI spectrofluorometer using λ Ex = 490 nm and λ Em = 276 nm. At the end of the incubation, 1% Triton X-100 was added to measure complete release of Tb3+. Liposome preparations can vary leading to discrepancies in overall signal intensity. Therefore, comparisons were made only between assays using a given liposome preparation. Fig 5E and 5F shows analyses performed with a single, shared liposome batch, whereas the data in S4 Fig were generated using an independent liposome preparation.\n\nMouse infections A mix of male and female Stat1−/− C57BL/6 or wild-type C57BL/6 mice between 6–8 weeks of age were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Jax#012606, Jax#000664) and were single-housed and left to acclimate for 5–7 days. Mice were perorally inoculated with 25 μl of 106 PFU MNV3 WT or NS3-K40R in DMEM with 5% FBS. At 24 hours post-infection, mice were euthanized, and tissues were collected. The tissues were homogenized by bead beating as previously described [35] and viral titers were determined via plaque assay using BV2 cells. We set the LOD at three plaques in undiluted samples and considered the average tissue weight to calculate the PFU/grams tissues; therefore, in some cases, values were below this detection limit. Samples with 1 or more plaques were included in the statistical analysis. For survival curve and weight loss experiments we used Stat1−/− C57BL/6 mice that were bred and maintained in the UT Southwestern specific pathogen-free animal care facility. After peroral infection as described above the mice were observed and weighed for 8 days post-infection. Mice with clinical signs of disease (lost 25% body weight and/or were lethargic, had eye discharge, or paralysis) were euthanized by CO 2 . The remaining mice were euthanized at the end of the study.",

The disease adversely affects people's quality of life and elevates healthcare costs. In 2019, approximately 16 million Brazilians were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Understanding the future trends of this disease is crucial for planning effective preventive interventions. This paper aims to estimate the future prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus on individuals from the Study of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adolescents (ERICA) sample, based on the progression of their cardiovascular risk factors. Method A literature review was conducted to identify predictive models for type 2 diabetes mellitus that utilize cardiovascular risk factors assessed during adolescence to forecast diabetes risk in adulthood. A logistic regression model, grounded in the natural history of clinical variables derived from longitudinal studies, was applied to each individual to determine their risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed, incorporating the minimum and maximum values of model parameters. Results The predictive model estimated that 15.12% of individuals in the ERICA sample are likely to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus in adulthood, with a range of 1.1% to 28% based on sensitivity analyses. The parameters exerting the most significant influence on these results included diastolic blood pressure and triglycerides, followed by LDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure. Conclusion The application of this predictive model to the Study of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adolescents (ERICA) sample indicates an estimated prevalence of 15.12% for T2DM over a 20.5-year follow-up period. Studies like this one provide valuable insights for designing targeted interventions to mitigate the progression of diabetes and its associated socioeconomic impacts.\n\nCitation: Pozzi Ottavio B, Sousa Borges S, Santos da Costa MG, Caetano Kuschnir MC (2025) Estimation of the future prevalence of diabetes based on data from the Brazilian Study of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adolescents (ERICA).

Introduction Diabetes Mellitus (DM) refers to a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood glucose levels resulting from defects in insulin production or action [1]. This chronic condition can lead to serious complications such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, vision problems, and neuropathy [1]. The two most common types are Type 1 (T1DM), which is an autoimmune condition in which the insulin-producing cells are destroyed, and Type 2 (T2DM), which is marked by insulin resistance and is associated with obesity, aging, and a sedentary lifestyle. T2DM is the most prevalent form of diabetes, accounting for 90% of cases, while T1DM affects 5–10% of individuals. Less common forms of diabetes include gestational diabetes, monogenic diabetes, and secondary diabetes [2]. The prevalence of T2DM is rising rapidly with significant implications for global and national health systems. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported that the number of people who have diabetes worldwide can grow from 463 million in 2019, to 700 million by 2045. In Brazil, the IDF projects that diabetes affected 16 million people in 2019, and that this number might reach 26 million by 2045 [3]. The rising prevalence also leads to an increase in national health expenditure. The Brazilian Ministry of Health annually conducts the Surveillance of Risk and Protection Factors for Chronic Diseases through Telephone Inquiry (Vigitel in Portuguese), research that maps the prevalence of chronic diseases and associated factors in the 26 city capitals from every state in addition to the Federal District. In 2023, 10.2% of respondents reported a diabetes diagnosis, almost double the 5.5% who reported it when Vigitel was launched in 2006 [4]. Diabetes-related costs in Brazil were calculated at BRL 52.3 billion in 2019 [3], approximately USD 13.27 billion at the 2019 exchange rate [3]. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimated that in 2017, 4.4% of the Brazilian population had diabetes. Among those aged 20 years of age and older, that figure increases to 6.2% with T2DM affecting 96% of this population [5,6]. Data on T2DM in children and adolescents are limited, as the condition typically presents later in life due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Also according to the IHME, DM is among the leading causes of death, ranking fifth in 2021 and there has been a marked increase in deaths specifically attributed to T2DM from 1990 (2.2% of the total, 17,532 individuals) to 2020 (4.38% of the total, 51,684 individuals). The years of life lost due to premature death (460,650.36 to 1,336,956.09) and years lived with disability (348,837.77 to 1,243,850.91) have also seen significant increases [7]. This scenario reflects the profound impact of diabetes on quality of life and the considerable burden of its complications. Such complications include microvascular issues like incipient diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, as well as macrovascular problems such as cardiovascular disease. Consequently, Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) – a metric that combines years of life lost and years lived with disability [8] – has risen dramatically from 991,854.76 to 2,580,807.00 [7]. Such a trend for increased prevalence, and financial impact, of T2DM is an important element for planning public policies. Literature provides varied projections, as the aforementioned data from the IDF and the IHME. The Ministry of Health also projects, based on Vigitel data, a growth in the prevalence of diabetes of about 9% (2.8% − 15.4%) for 2032 [4]. These data provide broad estimates based on a general population trend but do not specifically account for adolescent cardiovascular risk factors. Analyzing the T2DM tendency in a representative adolescent sample and considering their specific risk factors into the models could provide more precise estimates for the future generation. The importance of T2DM has been pushing governments to action, leading the inclusion of initiatives and metrics in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in the Strategic Action Plan for Addressing Chronic Diseases and Non-Communicable Diseases in Brazil 2021–2030. The SDG goal 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being at all ages, with specific targets to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as T2DM through prevention and treatment [9]. In parallel, Brazil's strategic plan admits the impact of T2DM on public health and on the economy, proposing actions to prevent and control the disease [10]. Given the impact of the disease, clinical guidelines are key to coordinating T2DM care. In Brazil, Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for T2DM set the diagnostic criteria and standard treatment for T2DM in the Brazilian public health system (SUS). Its latest version was published in 2024 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health [11]. The document establishes diagnostic tests and provides comprehensive treatment guidelines, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, with metformin as the first-line treatment for T2DM. Conducted between 2012 and 2014, the Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents (ERICA, acronym in Portuguese) is a national multicenter cross-sectional study. It aimed to estimate the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) in approximately 75,000 students aged 12–17 from public and private schools in Brazilian cities with populations of 100,000 or more [12]. Although the ERICA sample does not represent all age groups, it does reflect the trends for a generation of students for which it is representative. Thus, estimates with ERICA’s population can provide valuable input for public policy formulation and prioritizing health interventions that address health habits and conditions in this population, potentially mitigating risks for diabetes development. Given the increasing impact of T2DM on public health, this study aims to estimate its future prevalence on ERICA’s representative sample of adolescents by projecting the progression of their baseline CVRF and the resulting likelihood of developing T2DM.\n\n2. Methods A literature review was conducted in Embase and Medline databases in November 2023 to identify prediction models for DM that could contribute to its development. The search aimed to identify studies that utilized measures of CVRF collected during adolescence to predict the risk of diabetes in adulthood. The terms “risk factor,” “adolescent,” “diabetes,” and “adult” were combined without restrictions by language or year. The search strategies are detailed in S1 File. Evidence was sought focusing on studies that correlated childhood or adolescent CVRF with the development of T2DM in adulthood. Eligible studies were those that analyzed CVRF measured during childhood or adolescence, and also available for ERICA’s sample, with the aim of predicting the development of T2DM in adulthood. Abstracts and articles selected for full reading were excluded if: Incorporated data not available in the ERICA study, such as genetic information, body fat mass, or family history of T2DM from members of the extended family.\n\nReferred to populations that are incompatible with the ERICA’s, such as obese children or only with a family history of T2DM, adults, Chinese, Finns, or North American indigenous peoples.\n\nIncluded only one risk factor in the analysis, such as BMI or family history.\n\nEvaluated outcomes distinct from the desired outcome (development of T2DM), for example, applicability and definition of cardiovascular risk thresholds in childhood to predict T2DM in adulthood, or composite outcomes (fasting glucose, T2DM, and hypertension). 2.1. Model implementation A model selected from the literature search was used to project the trend of adolescents in the ERICA sample in developing T2DM, utilizing an individual logistic regression that incorporated their characteristics. As per the inclusion criteria, the model incorporates risk factors that are available on ERICA. The model tracked individual patients with different demographic characteristics (age, sex, race) and clinical variables (such as blood pressure, BMI, and fasting glucose). Thus, a logistic regression was constructed with coefficients reflecting the natural history of clinical variables observed in a longitudinal study and applied to everyone in the sample. The natural history was combined with the baseline data of ERICA’s sample to i) estimate the individual probability of reaching or not the outcome in question, the development of T2DM, and then ii) the number of individuals in the sample who reached the outcome. To estimate the baseline risk of the ERICA population (β₀), data from Vigitel 2023 were considered, which indicate that 10.2% of the Brazilian population has diabetes, and that 90% of these cases are T2DM [4]. Thus, the intercept used should be ln (0.0918). It was considered that an individual reached the outcome if they had a probability of having T2DM greater than or equal to 95%. The histograms with the frequency results of the probabilities are presented in S2 File. Additionally, probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted using the maximum and minimum coefficients calculated from their corresponding confidence intervals. In the probabilistic analysis, all coefficients were varied simultaneously to their maximum and minimum to examine potential extreme scenarios. In the deterministic analysis, each coefficient was varied while keeping the others constant, to identify the most relevant elements for the results in the evaluated sample. The application of the model and the other calculations were performed using R software (https://www.r-project.org/). The scripts used are found in S3 and S4 Files. In a logistic regression, the natural log of the odds ratio is calculated, that is, the probability of an event occurring over the probability of it not occurring, based on the behavior of independent variables [13]. The equation below is used to calculate the natural log of the odds ratio. The coefficient of a variable reflects how the odds ratio changes with an increase of one unit of that variable. Consequently, the probability of the event itself can be calculated using the following equation, which converts the natural logarithm into probability. 2.2. Characterization of T2DM To understand the trajectory of individuals in the sample regarding T2DM, the model set thresholds characterizing the evolution of patients. These cut-off points served as references for the logistic regression applied to the present study and are aligned to those outlined in the Ministry of Health Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines and international guidelines. For diabetes, the transition cut-off points are defined as follows: a fasting glucose level of ≥ 7 mmol/L and a glycated hemoglobin level greater than 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). 2.3. Predictive factors To estimate the trajectory of each individual, it was necessary to establish which characteristics of each member of the sample could be included in the model, considering the natural history of T2DM. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the main risk factors that may lead to the development of T2DM include family history, overweight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, aging, hypertension, history of gestational diabetes, poor nutrition during pregnancy, glucose intolerance, and ethnicity. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Brazilian Diabetes Society (SBD) [2,14] are more specific regarding aging, indicating that the risk increases after the age of 45, and include polycystic ovary syndrome in the list. The SBD further defines that there is a higher risk (i) for Afro-descendants, indigenous people, and Hispanics, (ii) when acanthosis nigricans is present, (iii) when HDL is below 35 mg/dL, and (iv) when triglycerides exceed 250 mg/dL. In this context, the following indicators can be related to the predictive factors of T2DM and were mapped in the ERICA database to potentially compose the model in question: Socio-demographic data: age, race, and sex.\n\nHabits: physical activity.\n\nFamily history: T2DM.\n\nBiochemical tests: total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin.\n\nAnthropometry and blood pressure assessment: BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Socio-demographic data and habits were collected through questionnaires completed by the students in the sample [12]. The form included sections on various topics, such as eating habits, alcohol consumption, and clinical history. Additionally, participants were required to indicate the presence of specific health conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, asthma, hypercholesterolemia, besides their body perception [12]. Students who reported having diabetes were excluded from the sample considered in this study, as they had already reached the evaluated outcome of developing T2DM or could not develop the disease due to having T1DM. The family history was also collected through a questionnaire filled out by the parents of the adolescents, encompassing various characteristics such as socioeconomic data, weight, and height [12]. T2DM family history was considered the only relevant risk factor indicated in this questionnaire, as it has a direct impact on the possibility of an individual developing the disease [2,14,15]. The measurement of anthropometric parameters and blood pressure was performed by trained professionals following standardized procedures and using standardized stadiometers, precision scales, and anthropometric tape. For blood collection for the biochemical tests, participants were instructed to maintain a 12-hour overnight fast before the examination, which was performed in the morning. Blood samples were processed, with blood and serum separation within two hours after collection and maintained between 4°C and 10°C while transported to the study's sole laboratory, where they were stored at −80°C for future analyses [12]. Biochemical tests were conducted on the 40,732 students evaluated in ERICA who attended classes in the morning. Individuals who reported having diabetes were excluded, leaving only those who declared themselves not having the disease or who were unsure if they had it at the time of the ERICA assessment, totaling 35,738 adolescents. The selected model was designed based on the evolution of individuals' CVRF – BMI, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, SBP, and DBP – to explain the development of T2DM. The same CVRF are available for ERICA’s individuals, which enabled the model to be applied to them. 2.4. Model validation Internal validation was conducted to identify errors related to data entry and model programming. Biostatistics experts peer reviewed the methods and the scripts, ensuring methodological rigor. Experts with knowledge in epidemiology and on ERICA Study confirmed the appropriateness of applying the model to its sample. In the absence of follow-up data on ERICA’s sample clinical outcomes, it is not possible to assess whether individuals progressed to T2DM as predicted. 2.5. Limitations There are limitations to the application of the selected model to ERICA’s sample. First, the composition of both samples is similar, but their baseline age differs, which can impact on their clinical evolution. In addition, while the selected model was based in a study that followed cardiovascular risk factors also observed on ERICA Study, the location in which they were both conducted where different, and they started over 30 years apart. As the development of T2M relates to a person's habits, such discrepancies limit the comparability of the samples. Certain potential confounding factors—such as socioeconomic status, dietary habits, genetic predisposition, and access to healthcare—were not incorporated into the model. While these factors are known to influence T2DM risk, they were not tracked or incorporated into the original model, so their exclusion was necessary to maintain data reliability and comparability with the reference study. This approach minimizes subjectivity and ensures that the projections are based solely on CVRF that have been consistently measured. Moreover, the model was developed to consider the full period of primary study, so it is limited to its duration and does not permit intermediate evaluations.\n\n5. Discussion The application of the logistic regression model to the ERICA sample provides valuable insights on the potential future impacts of worsening cardiovascular risk indicators on the population over the medium term. We estimate a prevalence of 15.12% for T2DM among individuals in the sample over a period of 20.5 years, reflecting the increasing prevalence of the disease in Brazil. This estimate exceeds the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) projections, aligning more closely with the upper limits forcasted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. While the IDF estimates that 10.2% of the population will have diabetes by 2030, potentially rising to 10.9% by 2045, the Brazilian Ministry of Health anticipates a trend of 9.1% for 2032, with a range from 2.8% to 15.4%. Notably, between 2019 and 2023, the percentage of diabetes among adults in Brazil rose from 7.4% to 10.2%, reflecting an annual increase of approximately 0.5 percentage points [4]. In comparison, the analytical sample from the Bogalusa model included 1,718 individuals, of whom 133 developed diabetes during the follow-up period, resulting in a prevalence of 7.7% - approximately half of the rate found in the ERICA sample. This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in baseline characteristics between the two populations, particularly their average ages at study enrollment. Participants in the ERICA study were aged 12–17 years (mean age of 14.6 years), whereas those in the Bogalusa study had an average age of around 8 years. The variation may also reflect differences in developmental experiences, dietary habits, cultural practices, and other environmental factors influencing T2DM trajectories across these cohorts, especially since they are from different countries and not contemporary. Despite these differences, the prevalence reported in the ERICA sample is not far from the 8.9% prevalence of diabetes in Brazil recorded in 2016 [18]. Study estimates that the prevalence of pre-diabetes among ERICA students exceeded 20% at the moment data was collected, indicating a concerning trend towards an increased risk of developing T2DM [19]. Such results align to the present article's conclusion that about 15% of the sample may develop T2DM 20 years afterwards. In addition, over 3.3% of the students had already developed T2DM, underscoring the association at a very young age between unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, and other modifiable risk factors over the long term, along with the influence of aging [19]. Similar discrepancies in time and geography are observed in the study conducted by the International Consortium of Child Cardiovascular Risk Cohorts (i3C) [20]. In addition to the Bogalusa study, the i3C analysis included five other cohorts—four from the U.S. and one from Finland—whose baseline measures were collected from the 1970s to the 1990s. Among a total of 6,738 participants, 6.5% developed T2DM, a figure lower than the 15.1% prevalence found in this study but comparable to the 7.7% reported in the Bogalusa study. These variations may be attributed to changes in dietary habits and increased sedentary behavior over time, given that the ERICA survey was conducted more recently. The deterministic sensitivity analysis revealed varying influences of the assessed parameters on the results. Notably, the coefficient for BMI—the most significant parameter—exhibited minimal impact on the overall findings. Conversely, an increase in HDL cholesterol resulted in a decrease in the estimated number of individuals developing T2DM. Although triglycerides had a lower overall weight compared to other parameters, they demonstrated substantial variability, likely due to diverse baseline values within the assessed population. Additionally, diastolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol were found to significantly impact the outcomes. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates the prevalence estimation could range from 1.1% to 28%, depending on the weight applied to cardiovascular risk factors included in the model. However, as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are intertwined, and risk factors are common to both [1,2,4], it is unlikely for all CVRF to have the lower limit weight on the development of T2DM. Having some sort of interval is still useful given the limitations of the analysis, the natural heterogeneity of the population, and the multifactorial influences on the development of the disease, as they inform decision-makers on the possible different scenarios. Considering the economic implications of T2DM, estimated costs indicate that both direct and indirect costs are already considerable. In 2014, costs reached USD 15 billion, corresponding to a prevalence rate of 6.2%. If the estimated prevalence of 15.1% is confirmed, the country could potentially see 30.6 million individuals with T2DM, as projected by the 2022 Demographic Census, resulting in a significant increase in healthcare costs [21]. While these results highlight an upward trend in T2DM prevalence, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations. First, the trajectory was modeled based on a cohort from another country, which may not accurately represent the same cardiovascular risk factors for the Brazilian population. Differences in genetic, socioeconomic, dietary patterns, and levels of physical activity could lead to varying results between cohorts, especially given the relationship between habits and the development of T2DM. Furthermore, the model was developed with data from Bogalusa's cohort, which was monitored for an average of 20.5 years. As a consequence, it is challenging to extrapolate these findings to larger time-frames. Given that age is a known risk factor for T2DM and considering the mean age of ERICA participants at baseline, the projections may underestimate the disease incidence within this sample. Additionally, we were unable to ascertain whether participants in the Bogalusa study underwent any interventions—such as medication use or dietary changes—in cases of increased cardiovascular risk. It is also not possible to understand if there have been any interventions in Brazil during the growth of ERICA’s individuals that could have changed their probability of developing T2DM. Also, the model exclusively included clinical variables, while there is extensive literature on how social determinants of health influence the progression of T2DM, such as income, education, housing, access to food and healthcare. Differences in the Bogalusa and ERICA samples regarding these determinants are not quantifiable but might also limit the interpretation of results. Future studies could incorporated socio-economic factors in addition to the clinical ones, to enable a better understanding of the Brazilian reality [22]. Finally, the baseline risk applied to the ERICA sample was derived from the Vigitel telephone survey conducted annually by the Ministry of Health. While this sample may not perfectly represent the broader Brazilian population due to factors such as self-reported data and geographic restrictions, it offers valuable insights. The findings of this study indicate a rising prevalence of T2DM in Brazil, driven by identified risk factors present during adolescence. This underscores the urgent need for public health interventions from childhood to prevent the progression of diabetes. Initiatives to ensure access to healthy foods, implement policies to reduce the consumption of ultra-processed foods and alcohol, promote physical activity at all ages, and combat smoking are essential actions that should be prioritized to enhance public health and mitigate the advancement of this disease in the country. By leveraging data from the ERICA study and employing logistic regression models, we estimated the potential risk of each individual for developing T2DM, providing valuable insights into the landscape of risk factors and diabetes prevalence. These strategies should focus on targeted interventions for at-risk groups, aiming to mitigate the development of T2DM and its associated complications. Ultimately, the findings will not only enhance our understanding of diabetes epidemiology among young people but also serve as a foundational tool for the development of informed public policies, enabling health authorities to implement preventive measures and allocate resources more effectively to improve the quality of life for this population.\n\n6. Conclusion This study successfully applied a predictive model developed in the U.S. to estimate the future prevalence of T2DM in Brazilian adolescents from the ERICA sample. The analysis estimated that approximately 15.12% of individuals in the sample could develop T2DM over a 20.5-year period, a figure that, while consistent with the rising trends of the disease in Brazil, is subject to significant variation depending on CVRF. The deterministic analysis reveals that higher HDL cholesterol levels are associated with a lower probability of developing T2DM, while increases in diastolic blood pressure and triglycerides, along with elevated LDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, are linked to a higher likelihood of the disease. While the results provide valuable insights for formulating public health policies aimed at preventing and controlling T2DM in Brazil, it is essential to recognize the inherent limitations of using a foreign model in a population with different socioeconomic and cultural characteristics. Future studies should aim to develop or adjust predictive models based on national cohorts, which would allow for greater precision and suitability for the Brazilian context. Interventions focused on factors such as blood pressure control and the reduction of triglyceride levels may be effective strategies for mitigating the risk of developing T2DM. Furthermore, public health policies that promote lifestyle changes from adolescence—such as encouraging healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity—could play a crucial role in reducing the future burden of the disease.",

    "Full Article Text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nIn the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s decision to bomb three of Iran’s nuclear facilities, numerous Democrats claimed the president’s actions were unconstitutional and a violation of the War Powers Resolution.\n\nIt is a contentious and hotly debated issue not only in Congress but also in academia. Constitutional experts told us those who are claiming the president’s decision was unconstitutional may be correct according to an originalist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. But Congresses over the last several decades have allowed presidents some latitude to engage militarily without prior consent from lawmakers.\n\n“A lot of people over the next few days are going to argue with confidence that President Trump violated, or didn’t violate, the Constitution when he bombed Iran over the weekend without congressional authorization,” Jack Landman Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School and nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a June 23 op-ed headlined, “Was the Iran Strike Constitutional?”\n\n“You might think that the Constitution would provide a clear answer to such a momentous question. But it doesn’t,” Goldsmith wrote.\n\nAlthough the military hostilities involving Iran, Israel and the U.S. have ended, numerous Democrats have continued to press the issue, and have proposed legislation to try to rein in the president’s military reach.\n\nCompeting Claims\n\nAllegations that the president’s decision was unconstitutional began almost immediately after Trump made an announcement via Truth Social on June 21 that the U.S. had bombed the Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nMaxar satellite imagery provides a close-up view of the Isfahan nuclear facility in Iran showing severe damage after the airstrikes. Satellite image (c) 2025 Maxar Technologies via Getty Images.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated in a press release on June 21 — after Trump had announced the bombings — that “the Constitution makes clear that the power to authorize war lies with Congress.”\n\nRep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat member of the House Intelligence Committee, also stated in a press release the same day that “Donald Trump’s decision to launch direct military action against Iran without Congressional approval is a clear violation of the Constitution, which grants the power to declare war explicitly to Congress.”\n\n“This was not constitutional, it was not lawful in the absence of a declaration by Congress,” Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on June 22. “And so the administration should have come to Congress. We will have a vote on a war powers resolution. But there’s a reason to bring this to Congress. And it is, you want the Congress bought in, you want the American people bought in on an action this substantial that could lead to a major outbreak of war.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went one step further, stating on X that Trump’s actions were “a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers” and are “absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.”\n\nA day after Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel on June 23, Ocasio-Cortez continued to post about Trump “illegally bombing Iran.”\n\n“None of this [related to the ceasefire] changes my deep belief that the Constitution gives the Congress – not the President – the power to decide whether or not we send Americans into the hell of war,” Democratic Rep. Chris Deluzio wrote on X on June 24.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jerry Nadler also posted a statement saying that he “remain[s] resolute that, regardless of the outcome, the Trump Administration’s military action against Iran was unconstitutional, as only Congress has the power to authorize the use of military force.”\n\nIt wasn’t just Democrats who raised the constitutional issue. In a response to Trump’s post about the airstrikes, Republican Rep. Thomas Massie said simply, “This is not Constitutional.”\n\nLast week, Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna teamed up on a resolution calling on Trump to “terminate the use of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or military, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force against Iran.”\n\nAfter the announced ceasefire, Massie said he told House Speaker Mike Johnson that he “wouldn’t push” the resolution “if the ceasefire holds.” Khanna added, in an MSNBC interview, “If there’s a ceasefire, that’s great. And let’s see if it holds. If it doesn’t hold, then we’re ready to have a vote on the War Power resolution.”\n\nOn NBC’s “Meet the Press” on June 22, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham pushed back on members of Congress alleging that Trump violated the Constitution by acting without congressional approval.\n\nGraham said Trump acted “within his Article II authority. Congress can declare war or cut off funding. We can’t be the commander in chief. You can’t have 535 commander in chiefs. If you don’t like what the president does, in terms of war, you can cut off the funding. But declaring war is left to the Congress. We’ve declared war five times in the history of America. All of these other military operations were lawful. He had all the authority he needs under the Constitution. They are wrong.”\n\nJohnson also defended the president in a post on X. “The President made the right call, and did what he needed to do. Leaders in Congress were aware of the urgency of this situation and the Commander-in-Chief evaluated that the imminent danger outweighed the time it would take for Congress to act. The world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, which chants ‘Death to America,’ simply could not be allowed the opportunity to obtain and use nuclear weapons.\n\n“The President fully respects the Article I power of Congress, and tonight’s necessary, limited, and targeted strike follows the history and tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties,” Johnson wrote.\n\nWhat the Constitution Says\n\nArticle I, Section 8 of the Constitution states that Congress holds the power “To declare War.” Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution establishes the president as the commander in chief of the armed forces. So, at what point and under what circumstances would the president need congressional approval before launching military activity?\n\n“I think this is a tough question because practice has strayed so far from the text and original understanding of the Constitution,” Kermit Roosevelt, a professor and constitutional expert at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told us via email. “The Constitution says that Congress has the power to declare war, and the records of the Constitutional Convention are pretty clear that the drafters did not want to give one person the power to take the United States into war. (Presidents are supposed to be able to respond to attacks by using the military, but that’s not relevant to this situation because obviously we were not attacked.) So the president was not supposed to be able to start a war without Congressional authorization. That’s pretty clear. (An authorization for the use of military force is effectively the same thing as a declaration of war, so the fact that Congress has used authorizations rather than declarations after WWII does not matter.) However, presidents have done things that count as acts of war under international law without congressional authorization, like the Libya bombings [under then-President Barack Obama], and no one has stopped them, so our practice has departed from the text and original understanding.”\n\nPeter Shane, a leading scholar in U.S. constitutional law and adjunct professor at New York University School of Law, told us via email that it is “difficult to give a definitive answer on constitutionality because there is so much disagreement about how the Constitution should be interpreted with regard to the unilateral presidential deployment of military force. For originalists, the answer would seem a straightforward, ‘No.’ Under the most persuasive reading of the Founding era, the Constitution does not authorize Presidents to deploy military force abroad without advance congressional authorization. As to Iran, there was none.\n\n“However,” Shane told us, “presidents of both parties have operated for decades under a Justice Department framework that ‘reflects not only the express assignment of powers and responsibilities to the President and Congress in the Constitution, but also . . . the ‘historical gloss’ placed on the Constitution by two centuries of practice.’ It has thus long been the position of the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel that history has ratified unilateral presidential deployments of military force as long as (1) the deployment serves ‘sufficiently important national interests,’ as judged by the President, and (2) the deployment does not portend a ‘prolonged and substantial military engagement, typically involving exposure of U.S. military personnel to significant risk over a substantial period.’ Trump’s letter to Congress reporting on the bombing relies on this framework.”\n\nWar Powers Resolution\n\nSeeking to claw back some of its power, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973 on a bipartisan basis, and over the veto of then-President Richard Nixon. As the Congressional Research Service explains, the War Powers Resolution requires presidents within 48 hours “to report to Congress any introduction of U.S. forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities.”\n\nOnce reported, the resolution “requires that the use of forces must be terminated within 60 to 90 days unless Congress authorizes such use or extends the time period.” Section 3 of the resolution “requires that the ‘President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing’ U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities.”\n\n“The War Powers Act is often interpreted as saying that the President can do what he wants for 48 hours before notifying Congress, or for 60 days even if Congress doesn’t approve, so that it means the President can actually start a war and then put Congress in the position of authorizing it or not,” Roosevelt said. “That’s not consistent with the Constitution and it’s not consistent with the purpose and policy section of the WPA, which says that the intent is to make sure that the President’s power to engage in military action is exercised ‘only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.’\n\n“So I think that the 48 hour and 60 day windows are supposed to be relevant to presidential responses to attacks, and the President is not supposed to be able to initiate wars at all. I think that if the WPA does mean that the President can start a war, it’s an unconstitutional delegation of the power to declare war,” Roosevelt said. (Emphasis is his.)\n\n“The WPA does clearly require that the president ‘in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities’ so it seems pretty clear that Trump violated that, at least,” Roosevelt said.\n\nWhether Trump’s decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites was an act of war is also a matter of debate.\n\nAn opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel in April 2011 — after Obama began military strikes against Libya without seeking congressional approval — argued that the scope and duration of the military strikes determine whether a military action constitutes a war.\n\n“In our view, determining whether a particular planned engagement constitutes a ‘war’ for constitutional purposes instead requires a fact-specific assessment of the ‘anticipated nature, scope, and duration’ of the planned military operations,” the opinion states, citing a prior OLC opinion from 1994. “This standard generally will be satisfied only by prolonged and substantial military engagements, typically involving exposure of U.S. military personnel to significant risk over a substantial period.”\n\nOn “Meet the Press” on Jun 22, Vice President JD Vance insisted, “We’re not at war with Iran, we’re at war with Iran’s nuclear program.”\n\n“We have no interest in a protracted conflict. We have no interest in boots on the ground,” Vance said, adding that the bombings were “a very precise, a very surgical strike tailored to an American national interest.”\n\nIndeed, Trump appealed for immediate peace in the same post in which he made the bombing announcement. Two days later, Trump announced the ceasefire, saying it put an end to what Trump said should be called “THE 12 DAY WAR.”\n\n“Given past practice and the language of the WPR, I don’t think that the single strike by itself violated either the Constitution or the WPR,” Stephen Griffin, professor of constitutional law at Tulane Law School, told us via email. “At the same time, it would have been better under the Constitution for President Trump to obtain congressional authorization in advance.”\n\nNonetheless, said Griffin, author of “Long Wars and the Constitution,” if hostilities between Iran and the U.S. extend beyond the WPR’s 60-day limit, “President Trump may well be in violation of the WPR, just as Republicans argued when the same circumstances occurred in the Clinton and Obama presidencies.”\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Causes of the sinking—known as subsidence—include natural soil compaction, groundwater pumping, industrial development and the legacy of wetland drainage for urban growth.\n\nThe study used a remote sensing technique called InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), which detects millimeter-scale changes in land surface elevation by comparing satellite radar images taken over time. This allowed the researchers to build the most detailed map yet of vertical land motion in New Orleans—including areas like wetlands that had previously lacked reliable data.\n\nAmong the most troubling findings: some of the concrete floodwalls and levees built to protect the city after Katrina are themselves sinking.

In contrast, some areas such as parts of Michoud showed modest land uplift, likely due to the halt of industrial groundwater pumping and recovery of the water table.\n\nWetlands east of the city, long known for their ecological importance, are also sinking rapidly in places. In some spots, the loss of elevation could transform marshes into open water within a decade if trends continue. This has implications not just for wildlife but also for storm protection, as wetlands help buffer storm surges.\n\nNew Orleans, much of which lies below sea level, relies on an elaborate system of levees, pumps and drainage canals to keep water out.

    "Full Article Text": "New Orleans — As the Atlantic hurricane season has gotten underway, a new study published Friday by researchers at Tulane University reveals hotspots in New Orleans' concrete flood walls which had been strengthened in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe study found that the city's concrete flood walls are sinking faster than sea levels are rising, reducing capacity to block storm surges in some neighborhoods.\n\n\"There is certainly a potential in the future, if these rates continue, to degrade our level of protection of the flood protection system,\" Tulane professor Mead Allison, a co-author on the study, told CBS News.\n\nThis summer marks 20 years since Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast, leaving more than 1,300 people dead and displacing more than a million people across the region.\n\nFollowing the destructive storm, $15 billion was spent to reinforce a levy system designed to keep water out. New Orleans, much of which lies below sea level, relies on this elaborate system of levees, pumps and drainage canals.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science Advances, used satellite radar data to track shifts in ground elevation across the Greater New Orleans area between 2002 and 2020. It found that while most of the city remains stable, some neighborhoods, wetlands, and even sections of the region's post-Katrina flood protection system are sinking by more than an inch per year — with some areas experiencing up to 47 millimeters, or nearly 2 inches, of elevation loss annually.\n\n\"In a city like New Orleans, where much of the land is already near sea level, even minor drops in elevation can increase flood risk,\" said Simone Fiaschi — lead author of the study and a former researcher with Tulane's Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, now employed at TRE-Altamira — in a statement.\n\n\"These results are a wake-up call,\" Allison said. \"We need ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure that our flood defenses don't lose their level of protection beneath us.\"\n\nIf trends continue, and infrastructure is left unchecked, the study found wetlands east of the city could transform marshes into open water within the next 10 years if trends continue — effectively eliminating critical storm surge buffers to the Louisiana coast.\n\nThe study also identified some potential causes of the sinking hotspots. It found pockets of land are sinking around industrial sites, the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, and newer residential developments — areas where soil compression and groundwater withdrawal are likely contributors.\n\nResearchers said the findings also underscore a few potential solutions to better protect New Orleans and other coastal communities across the globe, including frequent upgrades to the flood protection system and satellite monitoring.\n\nSome residents living in the Michoud neighborhood on the city's east side — one of the areas identified in the study as sinking more rapidly than others — are concerned that maintenance won't be prioritized. Michoud resident Synthia Viltus pointed out that potholes and other smaller infrastructure issues in her neighborhood have remained unresolved for months.\n\n\"I have zero faith in state federal leaders to keep the levies updated,\" Viltus said.\n\nThe study did find a positive — some areas where industrial activities had been halted had actually caused the land to lift back up.\n\nThe study's authors also hope their work will help guide other coastal cities who may be facing similar challenges to New Orleans.\n\n\"This research shows that land movement isn't uniform, and understanding these patterns is crucial for protecting lives and property in a city where inches truly matter,\" Fiaschi said in the statement. \"However, it's crucial to remember that our results still require careful ground-truthing. This is especially true for critical areas like the floodwalls, where on-site verification was not possible during this project.\"\n\nRicky Boyett, spokesperson for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in New Orleans, said the urgent levee systems in the city were designed and built to withstand projected levels of land sinking until 2057.\n\n\"Every levee system in South Louisiana is subject to settlement, subsidence and sea level rise,\" Boyett said in a statement. \"As a result, periodic levee lifts are required to maintain the established level of risk reduction, whether that be the New Orleans Hurricane system, Mississippi River levees or other systems in the region.\"\n\nThe USACE says it's already planning a major upgrade overhaul to the infrastructure so it can withstand a half-century of time passing — and the expected changes in elevation that may unfold throughout those years — until 2073.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tulane researchers say they were commissioned to conduct this study by the state, which manages the levees. They say this study was only the first phase of a two-part series. Phase two will use the same technology to examine wetland sinkage along the southernmost areas of Louisiana's coast — the first line of defense to protect against a hurricane's surge.",

    "Full Article Text": "Protests against Medicaid cuts continued on June 25, which led to the arrests of 60 activists at the Senate.\n\nTruthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.\n\nSenate Republicans are under mounting pressure from doctors and medical associations to reject massive cuts to health care and food assistance as they rush to complete a draft of the budget reconciliation bill designed to implement President Donald Trump’s agenda. Despite an ongoing debate over deep cuts to Medicaid — cuts experts say would devastate already underfunded health systems especially in rural areas — Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) pushed this week to put the so-called “big, beautiful bill” on the president’s desk by July 4.\n\nThe Senate GOP is looking to make $1 trillion in cuts to federal health care programs over the next decade, including Medicaid, which provides health insurance to lower-income families and people with disabilities. Deep cuts to food assistance for millions of people are also on the table as lawmakers look for ways to cut spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by pushing costs onto states.\n\n“If Medicaid is cut, my patients will die. I realize I am being dramatic. It is a dramatic situation,” said Helen Pope, a physician in Louisiana and assistant professor of medicine at Tulane University, in a statement to Senate staffers. “[T]hey are humans who are doing their best. Please don’t allow them to suffer more.”\n\nRepublicans hit a snag on Thursday after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that a proposal to change how states can tax Medicaid providers — a bid to pass on more costs to states — does not adhere to the rules for fast-tracking and passing legislation with a simple majority. Democrats hailed the decision as a win, but Republicans are still determined to make the desired cuts.\n\nExperts say the cuts would drive up health care costs for everyone as providers are forced to raise prices and more people delay needed care until their conditions become catastrophic. Combined with the expiration of tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace insurance plans, which are not extended in the bill, the cuts would cause an estimated 16 million people to lose health coverage and lead to tens of thousands of preventable deaths each year.\n\nSharon Parrot, president of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said the GOP’s failure to include the tax credit for people who rely on ACA Marketplace plans for insurance coverage is a clear indicator of Republican priorities. Lawmakers proposed the deep cuts to safety net programs in order to extend tax cuts for the wealthy passed during Trump’s first term while also increasing spending on the military and immigration policing.\n\n“In the context of a bill that extends nearly all tax cuts from the 2017 bill, the one tax cut they have decided not to extend is the one that helps lower- and middle-income people afford health coverage,” Parrot said in a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), the ranking member of the Senate Health, Labor, Education and Pensions (HELP) Committee, collected statements on the impacts of the budget bill from Pope and dozens of other doctors and health care providers across the country over the past month. Sanders released the statements on Wednesday along with a report detailing a massive increase in the number of people losing health insurance under the bill across all 50 states. In several states, the uninsured rates would nearly double or more over the next 10 years, including in Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington, according to the analysis of Kaiser Family Foundation data.\n\n“Plainly said, children will die as a result of these cuts,” said Farhan Malik, a pediatric special care specialist in Florida. “Doctors will leave because of salary cuts, critical ancillary services will be reduced, more medical students will avoid going into pediatric residencies.”\n\nEarlier this month, Sanders and every Democrat on the Senate HELP committee sent a letter to committee chairman Sen. Bill Cassidy requesting a hearing on the bill with patients and health care providers. Cassidy, a Republican and physician from Louisiana, who has questioned Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccine agenda in the past, declined to hold a hearing as Republicans debate cuts that data shows would harm people in their own districts. A spokesman for Senator Cassidy’s office referred questions to the majority staff on the HELP Committee, which did respond to a request for comment.\n\nCassidy’s home state of Louisiana would see the percentage of residents without health insurance nearly double to 12.4 percent by 2034 under the bill, a 91 percent increase over the 2023 uninsured rate. In a statement to the HELP Committee, the Louisiana Rural Health Association said the state’s rural hospitals and health providers are already operating on “razor-thin margins” and struggling to keep their doors open while serving some of the nation’s most medically vulnerable communities.\n\n“In Louisiana, 38 percent of hospitals operate on negative margins, and 27 percent are currently vulnerable to closure,” the group said in a statement to the HELP Committee. “Medicaid cuts would worsen these losses, putting more hospitals at risk of shutting down entirely.”\n\nThe list of medical associations, disability rights organizations, and public health groups lining up against the bill is growing by the day. On Monday, the health care consumer group Families USA released a report estimating that 380 independent rural hospitals would be at risk of closure if Trump signed the reconciliation bill into law. Nearly half of all children and one in five adults living in rural areas rely on Medicaid, according to the National Rural Health Association. On Wednesday, 60 protesters were arrested for demonstrating against the cuts at the Senate rotunda in an act of civil disobedience, including disability activists in wheelchairs.\n\n“We won’t stop protesting against this terrible bill, because it means our lives,” said Brandon Ezekiel, an activist with the disability rights group ADAPT, in a statement. “Our tax dollars pay for healthcare for members of Congress, many of whom are very wealthy, even millionaires, and then they have the nerve to cut our tax dollars from paying for health care for us.”\n\nIn a detailed letter to Senate leaders this week, the American Medical Association (AMA) warned that cuts to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program risk “worsening access” to health care that many people already struggle to afford — and physicians must provide, whether or not patients pay the bills.\n\n“Patients across the country are already struggling to access care,” said AMA President Bobby Mukkamala in a statement. “Physician burnout, early retirements and — with the cost of running a practice constantly rising — the challenge of keeping a practice financially afloat are contributing to a physician shortage expected to reach 86,000 by 2036.”\n\nThe pushback from the medical community appears to be having an impact. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), and other Republicans from states that rely heavily on Medicaid are warning their colleagues about the potential political fallout of pushing health care costs back onto states that already struggle to balance budgets. Politico reported on Wednesday that GOP leaders are offering their colleagues concerned about the cuts — whom they refer to as “Medicaid moderates” — a $15 billion “stabilization fund” for rural hospitals.\n\nHowever, the fund is no substitute for robust Medicaid funding that many providers rely on, and would not prevent the budget bill from blowing huge holes in the safety net, according to Traci Gleason, communications director at the Missouri Budget Project.\n\n“These cuts will pull the rug out from under Missouri families trying to make ends meet,” Gleason told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nIn order to meet the onerous work requirements Republicans are seeking to impose on Medicaid patients — requirements designed to reduce enrollment and further cut costs — Gleason said Missourians would have to file “piles of paperwork” with a state bureaucracy that is already overwhelmed.\n\n“You simply cannot take billions of dollars out of Medicaid without causing massive coverage losses and taking away health care from people who are working and who are exempt” from work requirements, Gleason said, adding that 43 percent of rural clinics in the state are at risk of closing due to funding shortfalls. “Our system is already strained and will not be able to keep up, which means that every single person who has or will eventually need health coverage will be affected.”\n\nPolls show GOP proposals to slash health care spending are deeply unpopular among voters, which may explain why Trump and his allies are attempting to pass the bill as quickly as possible. Sanders and Democrats have slammed Republicans for failing to hold hearings on the reconciliation package, and the Congressional Budget Office has not completed its standard analysis of the bill’s impacts.\n\nHowever, it’s no secret that lower- and middle-income Americans are poised to lose the most under the GOP’s proposals, which would drain money from families already struggling due to the affordability crisis in order to pay for tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy. Analysis by the Yale Budget Lab found that the House version of the bill would reduce average incomes for the bottom 80 percent of earners when the impacts of Trump’s tariffs are factored in. The bottom ten percent of earners would see their incomes drop by 6.5 percent, while the top 10 percent would see a 1.5 percent increase.\n\nWhether Senate Republicans can find enough votes to pass the budget package ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline remains to be seen. While some Republicans are wary of setting off a health care funding crisis at home, others point out that the bill would still increase federal deficit, despite the massive safety net cuts, by shifting federal funding toward Trump’s priorities, including billions of additional dollars for immigration enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, doctors and experts are making their position known, loud and clear.\n\n“These harmful proposals will impact access to all patients who are served by our nation’s hospitals and health systems,” said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, in a statement to the HELP Committee. “These cuts will strain emergency departments as they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.”\n\nKeep the press free.

    "Full Article Text": "Could coffee be the liquid key to longevity?\n\nA new study reports that the world’s most widely used stimulant can extend lifespan and affect how cells respond to genetic damage — though there’s a potential complication.\n\nA team of researchers at Queen Mary University of London confirms that caffeine interacts with the systems that influence aging, DNA response and cellular stress.\n\n4 Researchers confirmed that caffeine interacts with the systems that influence aging, DNA response and cellular stress. WesLens/peopleimages.com – stock.adobe.com\n\nThe team studied fission yeast, a single-celled organism that is analogous to human cells and uses similar pathways to manage energy, DNA repair and stress.\n\nResearchers measured the response of fission yeast to different forms of cellular stress, including DNA damage, toxic exposure and nutrient deprivation.\n\nThen they added caffeine to gauge how cells would respond.\n\nThey found that while caffeine extended the lifespan of yeast, it also affected how cells responded to stress, particularly when the molecular systems that regulate stress were already activated.\n\nThe findings were published this week in the journal Microbial Cell.\n\n4 This is an illustration of a damaged DNA strand. Caffeine has been shown to affect DNA repair. Mirsad – stock.adobe.com\n\nThe research team previously established that caffeine supports the longevity of cells by activating TOR (target of rapamycin), a biological switch that determines when cells should grow based on the availability of food and energy.\n\nAccording to the team, the TOR switch has been actively controlling energy and stress responses in living things for over 500 million years.\n\nIn this latest study, the team learned that caffeine doesn’t directly activate TOR, but rather influences it by activating AMPK, a cellular fuel reserve in yeast and humans.\n\n“When your cells are low on energy, AMPK kicks in to help them cope,” said study senior author Charalampos (Babis) Rallis. “And our results show that caffeine helps flip that switch.”\n\nThe yeast model demonstrated that caffeine’s influence on flipping that switch directly impacts how cells grow, repair their DNA and respond to stress — all of which relate to aging.\n\nQuite surprisingly, the team found that rather than protecting damaged DNA, caffeine amplified the damage.\n\n4 Caffeine activates AMPK, a cellular fuel reserve in yeast and humans. David Crockett – stock.adobe.com\n\nTypically, when a cell detects DNA damage, it stops dividing to repair it. However, researchers found that caffeine overrides this stop, allowing unhealed cells to continue dividing and making them more vulnerable to future damage.\n\nThe team assured that this doesn’t make your morning cup inherently dangerous. Caffeine’s ability to alter how cells respond to problems can be positive or negative, depending on the situation.\n\nThe team noted that the benefits of caffeine depend on the presence of specific proteins and pathways. The fact that caffeine’s effects are neither universal nor automatic may help explain why previous studies exploring the link between caffeine and improved health have been inconsistent.\n\n“These findings help explain why caffeine might be beneficial for health and longevity,” said John-Patrick Alao, the postdoctoral research scientist leading this study. “And they open up exciting possibilities for future research into how we might trigger these effects more directly — with diet, lifestyle or new medicines.”\n\nThe team acknowledged that because the study relied only on fission yeast, the findings may not directly translate to human cells.\n\n4 Several studies have reported various benefits of a daily java habit. Antonioguillem – stock.adobe.com\n\nCoffee has long been lauded for its health benefits.\n\nRich in antioxidants, it may enhance brain function. It’s also been shown to increase alertness, aid in weight management, boost mood and potentially lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\n\nA 2018 study of nearly half a million British adults found that coffee drinkers had a slightly lower risk of death over 10 years than abstainers.\n\nOther research, encompassing more than 170,000 adults in the UK, proposed that those who drink between two and four daily cups of coffee, regardless of whether they have added sugar, live longer than those who don’t drink coffee.\n\nA 2025 study led by researchers at Tulane University tied a morning brew to lower mortality rates than espresso later in the day.\n\nAnd three to five cups a day at midlife was associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s disease later in life, research determined.\n\nIn addition to Alzheimer’s, some studies found that java junkies have up to a 60% lower risk of Parkinson’s disease.\n\nThe more coffee they drank, the lower the risk.",

    "Full Article Text": "Decision-making about drugs in pregnancy can be very difficult. Our illogical aversion to clinical trials in pregnancy means people making particularly complex decisions usually have little specific information about efficacy for them when a drug first becomes available. Plus, efficacy trials aren’t big enough to assess the uncommon and rare pregnancy outcomes we want to be reassured about: For that we have to wait until the drugs are in wide use. At that point, we’re swamped with a complicated research and surveillance landscape. All this makes vaccination in pregnancy an easy target for misinformation campaigns. And that’s happening now in the US.\n\nIn an interview, the FDA Commissioner dismissed a large body of evidence on the safety and efficacy of Covid vaccination in pregnancy because it wasn’t from randomized trials. He claimed that the randomized trial in pregnancy was “closed without any explanation.” (False.) Soon after, the Department of Health and Human Services circulated a document to justify their retreat from support for Covid vaccination in healthy pregnant women, misrepresenting studies to make claims of harm. I discuss those studies below, and summarize the large body of evidence that has accumulated in people, mostly for mRNA vaccines.\n\nBottom line: Studies with over 1.5 million Covid-vaccinated pregnant participants show vaccines are effective in pregnancy, and reduce some poor pregnancy outcomes. Extensive surveillance and study – particularly of the mRNA vaccines – has not established safety concerns for pregnancy.\n\nI’ve broken this post into 3 sections, with the first including those recent claims from the US:\n\nSafety surveillance\n\nSafety surveillance is critical after drugs and vaccines are authorized. Major drug regulators require manufacturers to have plans for ongoing studies, and they monitor other research and other regulators’ findings as well. There are several types of non-randomized research of the outcomes of vaccination in pregnancy – including pregnancy outcome registries, and studies with comparison groups, like case-control studies. The range of data available is covered in the systematic review section below.\n\nThis section begins with conclusions from Europe’s drug regulator, which publishes the most detail, and includes an update from the US.\n\nEuropean Medicines Agency\n\nBy January 2022, the EMA had concluded that there was “growing evidence indicating that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines do not cause pregnancy complications for expectant mothers and their babies.” Monitoring of individual vaccines in pregnancy, they reported, is undertaken by their pharmacovigilance committee:\n\n“The companies are required to provide regular updates and conduct studies to monitor the safety and effectiveness of their vaccines as used by the public. Authorities also conduct additional studies to monitor safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, including their use in pregnancy. These measures allow regulators to swiftly assess data emerging from a range of different sources and take appropriate regulatory action to protect public health if needed.”\n\nEMA’s conclusion in 2022 included references to 12 journal publications: All of them are included in the systematic review below.\n\nSafety updates on individual vaccines:\n\nBNT/Pfizer vaccine (Comirnaty): Safety updates are here. The most recent posted there covered data up to December 2023, including a small amount of data from clinical trials, and analysis of the pregnancy and fetal/neonatal data from serious adverse event reporting. EMA’s conclusion: “There were no safety signals regarding use in pregnant/lactating women that emerged from the review of these cases or the medical literature.”\n\nModerna vaccine (Spikevax): Safety updates are here. The most recent posted again covered data up to December 2023. EMA’s conclusion: Analysis of the data “did not raise any new safety concern… The benefit-risk evaluation remains positive.”\n\nHipra vaccine (Bimervax): Safety updates are here. The most recent posted covered up to September 2023, and there was as yet no clinical data to report.\n\nAnother 2 vaccines have been approved in Europe more recently: from Novavax (Nuvaxovid) and Arcturus (Kostaive). There are no safety updates for these yet.\n\nUSA\n\nA brief summary of safety was included in the CDC’s vaccine committee (ACIP) meeting on June 25, 2025 (see slides 28 and 29). They report that their own surveillance studies include over 68,000 pregnancies, and show no increased risk of serious poor outcomes, including pregnancy loss. This is supported by reference to 4 of their journal publications: All 4 are included in the systematic review below.\n\nWhat about those other 4 studies cited as justification for a new government policy of not supporting Covid vaccination for healthy pregnant women? The document is online here. An expert was quoted in a news report on this document describing it as disinformation – on pregnancy, I agree with that characterization. (I didn’t check the rest.) Here’s what that report says about 3 of 4 of those cited studies:\n\n“In two instances, the HHS memo makes claims that are actively refuted by the papers it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of covid vaccines for pregnant women. The HHS document says that another paper it cites found ‘an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine.’ But the paper doesn’t contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.”\n\nI agree with this. The 2 cited studies that conclude the opposite of what the document claims are Velez 2024 and Dick 2022a. (Note: Dick 2022a is inaccurately cited in the document – one of that lead author’s papers is cited by surname and one by first name). The paper that does not mention pregnancy at all is Faksova 2024.\n\nThe 4th study cited is Dick 2022b, and it isn’t properly represented. This is an analysis of births at one hospital [retrospective cohort study]. A large number of patients were excluded (22%), mostly because of missing data (including timing of vaccination), and/or the patient having been vaccinated before pregnancy, or having had Covid. The outcomes they were studying were preterm birth and babies that were smaller than expected at birth.\n\nIn that study, there was no difference in the rate of preterm birth between the vaccinated and unvaccinated women. The researchers concluded that the subgroup vaccinated in the second trimester had a higher rate of preterm birth, which they said needed further study. This was a secondary subgroup analysis. Given the comparatively small number of women known to have been vaccinated in the second trimester, the large amount of missing data/excluded is a particular concern as well.\n\nThe Dick 2022b study is one of 67 investigating the risk of preterm birth after mRNA vaccination included in the systematic review in the section below: 42 studies investigate other vaccine types.\n\nBack to contents\n\nRandomized trials\n\nI mentioned in my intro that the FDA Commissioner had publicly claimed that the randomized trial in pregnancy was “closed without any explanation,” and that this was false. He was certainly referring to the large planned trial for the BNT/Pfizer vaccine: The fact that it was terminated is brought up in anti-vaccine literature as a reason to be suspicious.\n\nThere is actually no drama there: It’s a common situation. Once the vaccine was widely available and recommended for pregnancy, the manufacturers report that it was too hard to recruit participants to a placebo-controlled trial. The original plan was to start recruiting up to 4,000 participants in the US in February 2021 – which was soon after the vaccine became available in the US. That size phase 2/3 trial was primarily intended to study adverse reactions to the vaccine and immune responses, to see if they were similar to those from trials of non-pregnant people. The trial would also have gathered useful data on common adverse events.\n\nAfter a year, Pfizer amended the trial protocol, announcing that the trial was terminated “due to enrollment challenges into a placebo-controlled trial.” Planned analyses were adapted to account for the much smaller number of participants: 726 participants had been enrolled. Results were posted at ClinicalTrials.gov, including follow-up of infants to 6 months of age. Those results are included in the systematic review below in this post.\n\nA similar fate befell the only other randomized trial of a Covid vaccine in pregnant participants that I’m aware of – for the single-shot Janssen/Johnson & Johnson viral vector vaccine. That trial was originally planned to start in the US in August 2021, aiming to recruit around 824 pregnant participants. The amended protocol for this trial reported that it also struggled with recruitment. Changes had been made to try to increase enrollment over a 10-month period, but the trial was abandoned with only 51 participants recruited. Results were also posted at ClinicalTrials.gov, but don’t appear to have been included in the systematic review below. (I’ll let the authors know.)\n\nThis situation is, unfortunately, typical for an epidemic. A review before the Covid pandemic found that of 84 emergency vaccine trials, only 8 protocols included pregnant women – and only 3 of those were trials that were completed and reported. Those authors concluded: “Pregnant people are underrepresented in vaccine clinical trials conducted during outbreaks, resulting in underreporting of pregnancy-related outcomes and a lack of protection for pregnant people and neonates from infectious diseases.” Authors of another study, this time of phase 3 and 4 vaccine trials between 2018 and 2023, found similar results: Only 6% of 400 trials included were for, or open to, pregnant participants.\n\nBack to contents\n\nSystematic reviews\n\nTo find the best data I could for this question, I looked for good quality recent systematic reviews. Good systematic reviews are research projects using very thorough processes to try to reduce bias in finding, selecting, and evaluating studies and their results. I sifted through the systematic reviews on recency and methodological quality criteria. (Notes on this process are below this post.)\n\nThe best recent review I found is the Safe in Pregnancy living systematic review of randomized and non-randomized studies maintained by an international consortium, funded by the Gates Foundation. The team searches for new eligible studies every 2 weeks. A dashboard shows the most recent analyses. It was updated while I was working on this post, and I included the analyses from June 25, 2025. At that point, they had analyzed 289 of the studies they had found (some are still in a queue for analysis), including 1,521,849 vaccinated pregnant participants (plus unvaccinated participants in control or other comparison groups).\n\nThere are some reporting issues with this dashboard – for example, some studies are missing study design categorization in the main table, the PRISMA flowchart reporting article screening isn’t complete, excluded studies aren’t listed, and neither are the studies waiting to be added to the analyses. (There are also some earlier journal publications for this review, listed in my notes below.)\n\nThere were 2 other reviews that made it onto my short list. One of those analyzed 8 case-control studies that compared mRNA vaccines with non-mRNA vaccines (Oliveira 2024). The authors concluded that mRNA vaccination was associated with a lower incidence of fetal or neonatal death (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.08-0.33).\n\nThe other is the systematic review of 67 studies that was used by the journalist interviewing the FDA commissioner I mentioned in the intro (Fernández-García 2024). That included 723,988 vaccinated pregnant participants (plus unvaccinated participants in control or other comparison groups) from a search in January 2023. This review was not just older than the Safe in Pregnancy living systematic review. It had other drawbacks – particularly a non-reproducible and more limited search for studies – so I have not used it in this post.\n\nNow for the results from the Safe in Pregnancy living systematic review. The major conclusions are, firstly, that Covid vaccines are similarly effective in pregnancy or not. This is summarized in a recent journal publication from this living systematic review: Ballivian 2025. And secondly, that no safety concerns have been established for mothers, fetuses, or babies. That was summarized in another earlier publication: Buekens 2024. Those basics add up to some benefits. For that data, let’s go to the recent meta-analyses.\n\nIt’s critical to keep in mind that although 289 studies is a lot, there are massive differences among these studies, and they address different issues, typically measured in different ways. Therefore, only a small proportion of the data may be suitable for any single meta-analysis. (See my post 5 Tips for Understanding Data in Meta-Analyses for more on this.) Add to that the inherent weaknesses in many of the types of studies, and the certainty in results is low to very low. They get even more uncertain if you want to drill down to particular vaccines or Covid variants, for example. Here are some outcomes to give you an indication of the effects of mRNA vaccines – they are drawn from the meta-analyses in the dashboards, and the calculations of number of studies and participants are mine:\n\nReduction in symptomatic Covid-19 (Omicron) in mothers: Vaccine effectiveness 57.90% (CI: 24.54; 76.48) – based on 3 studies with 15,094 vaccinated participants.\n\nReduction in severe Covid-19 or hospitalization for Covid (Omicron) in mothers: Vaccine effectiveness 71.16% (CI: 58.84; 79.79) – based on 3 studies with 15,094 vaccinated participants.\n\nReduction in severe Covid-19 or hospitalization for Covid (Omicron) in infants: Vaccine effectiveness 63.41% (CI: 32.95-80.03) – based on 3 studies with 45,468 vaccinated participants.\n\nReduction in preterm birth: Relative risk 0.87 (CI: 0.79; 0.96) – based on 9 studies with 305,835 vaccinated participants.\n\nNo increase in miscarriage after vaccination: Odds ratio 0.91 (CI: 0.74-1.13) – based on 3 studies with 22,346 vaccinated participants.\n\nNo increase in admission of baby to neonatal intensive care: Relative risk 0.95 (CI: 0.86; 1.04) – based on 5 studies with 88,509 vaccinated participants.\n\nFinally, a tip to using the dashboard: If you find it hard to filter data, try a different browser. Vivaldi was OK, but Safari was much easier – it was too hard using it in Firefox.\n\nCitation for Safe in Pregnancy: Tulane University, Institute for Clinical Effectiveness and Health Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of Washington.

(More cartoons at Statistically Funny.)\n\nNotes on identifying and selecting systematic reviews\n\nI used Epistemonikos to identify systematic reviews, limiting results to systematic reviews published from 2023, with the search terms: title:(covid-19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND title:(pregnan* OR maternal) AND title:(vaccin*) on June 20, 2025. I found 17 systematic reviews. In addition, my regular general screening for studies on Covid vaccine identified a systematic on safety in populations of interest that included pregnancy.\n\nI narrowed down the group by excluding reviews which did not have a search date in 2023 or later (11 reviews [a]). On quality grounds, I then excluded 2 reviews [b] which did not meet all these criteria: pre-registered protocol; search of multiple databases; showing a PRISMA flowchart; assessing the quality of included studies.\n\nThe 5 remaining reviews included 3 publications from a living systematic review project. I included the data from an update of that review on the project dashboard on June 25, 2025: This included analysis of 289 of the 299 studies found in total. The final pool of systematic reviews:\n\nLiving systematic review, 4 versions: Buekens 2024; Ciapponi 2024; Ballivian 2025; and June 2025 update.\n\nOliveira 2024.\n\nExcluded systematic reviews:\n\n[a] 11 reviews with search dates earlier than 2023:\n\nPMIDs: 36007670; 36444098; 36670389; 36794075; 36800343; 36896895; 37454153; 37605626; 38432215; 40472669; and (doi) 10.2174/0126667975269133231117062158.\n\n[b] 2 reviews for methodological reasons: PMID: 38291854; 39202263.\n\nBack to systematic reviews section\n\nBack to contents",

    "Full Article Text": "Parts of New Orleans and its surrounding wetlands are gradually sinking, and while most of the city remains stable, a new study from Tulane University researchers suggests that sections of the region's $15 billion post-Katrina flood protection system may need regular upgrades to outpace long-term land subsidence.\n\nThe study, published in Science Advances, used satellite radar data to track subtle shifts in ground elevation across Greater New Orleans between 2002 and 2020. The study found that some neighborhoods, wetlands and even sections of floodwalls are sinking by more than an inch per year -- with some areas experiencing up to 47 millimeters (nearly 2 inches) of elevation loss annually.\n\n\"In a city like New Orleans, where much of the land is already near sea level, even minor drops in elevation can increase flood risk,\" said Simone Fiaschi, lead author of the study and a former researcher with Tulane's Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, now employed at TRE-Altamira.\n\nThe findings underscore how both natural and human-driven forces are reshaping the city's landscape. Causes of the sinking -- known as subsidence -- include natural soil compaction, groundwater pumping, industrial development and the legacy of wetland drainage for urban growth.\n\nThe study used a remote sensing technique called InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), which detects millimeter-scale changes in land surface elevation by comparing satellite radar images taken over time. This allowed the researchers to build the most detailed map yet of vertical land motion in New Orleans -- including areas like wetlands that had previously lacked reliable data.\n\nAmong the most troubling findings: some of the concrete floodwalls and levees built to protect the city after Katrina are themselves sinking. In a few cases, parts of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) are losing elevation faster than sea levels are rising, reducing their capacity to block storm surges.\n\n\"These results are a wake-up call,\" said co-author Prof. Mead Allison, also of Tulane. \"We need ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure that our flood defenses don't lose their level of protection beneath us.\"\n\nThe study also found pockets of sinking around industrial sites, the airport and newer residential developments -- areas where soil compression and groundwater withdrawal are likely contributors. In contrast, some areas such as parts of Michoud showed modest land uplift, likely due to the halt of industrial groundwater pumping and recovery of the water table.\n\nWetlands east of the city, long known for their ecological importance, are also sinking rapidly in places. In some spots, the loss of elevation could transform marshes into open water within a decade if trends continue. This has implications not just for wildlife but also for storm protection, as wetlands help buffer storm surges.\n\nNew Orleans, much of which lies below sea level, relies on an elaborate system of levees, pumps and drainage canals to keep water out. As sea levels rise and the ground sinks, the margin for error narrows.\n\nExperts say that without sustained monitoring, including satellite data and ground-based measurements, it's difficult to know where to reinforce levees or how to plan for future storms.\n\n\"This research shows that land movement isn't uniform, and understanding these patterns is crucial for protecting lives and property in a city where inches truly matter,\" Fiaschi said. \"However, it's crucial to remember that our results still require careful ground-truthing. This is especially true for critical areas like the floodwalls, where on-site verification was not possible during this project.\"\n\nThe study highlights the potential of satellite monitoring to guide infrastructure maintenance and urban planning, not just in New Orleans but in coastal cities worldwide facing similar challenges.",
    "Summary": "This article discusses land subsidence in New Orleans and its impact on the city's flood defenses. The study, conducted by Tulane University researchers, highlights the need for regular upgrades to the flood protection system.

    "Full Article Text": "Rick Hurst, who portrayed the good-hearted Deputy Cletus Hogg on the long-running CBS action comedy The Dukes of Hazzard, died Thursday. He was 79.\n\nHurst’s death was announced by the Cooter’s Place museum in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. He had just canceled a scheduled July 3-7 appearance there.\n\n“To fans, he was more than a character — he was family,” reads a Dukes of Hazzard post on Instagram. “His gentle smile, impeccable comedic timing and kind-hearted spirit made every scene brighter.\n\n“Offscreen, Rick was known for his generosity, humility and love for connecting with fans at events across the country. Whether it was a reunion special or a meet-and-greet at Cooter’s, he never stopped sharing his joy with the people who adored him.”\n\nBefore his most famous role, Hurst played a prisoner named Cleaver alongside Tom Poston and Hal Williams on the 1975-76 ABC sitcom On the Rocks, which revolved around inmates at a minimum security facility.\n\nHurst also guest-starred on lots of TV programs, from The Bob Newhart Show, Gunsmoke, Kojak, Happy Days and Little House on the Prairie to M*A*S*H, Baretta, Highway to Heaven, Evening Shade and The Wonder Years.\n\nSurvivors include his son Ryan Hurst, an actor perhaps best known for his turn as Opie Winston on the FX drama Sons of Anarchy.\n\nHurst first showed up as Cletus — the second cousin twice removed of corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) — in 1979 on the 11th episode of The Dukes of Hazzard, starring Tom Wopat, John Schneider, Catherine Bach and a 1969 Dodge Charger nicknamed the General Lee. The series was a big hit for CBS on Friday nights.\n\nCletus becomes temporary deputy when Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer) is away during the second season, and he leaves his junkyard job to become permanent during season three, when Shroyer starred in his own spinoff series, Enos.\n\nAfter Enos returns to Hazzard County, Georgia, from his assignment in Los Angeles — the spinoff lasted just one season — he and Cletus share deputy duty and a patrol car through season five (1982-83).\n\nHurst, who frequently ended up landing in a pond while pursuing those bedeviling Duke boys (Wopat and Schneider) in one of those great car chases, then returned for reunion telefilms in 1997 and 2000.\n\nBorn in Houston on New Year’s Day in 1946, Richard Douglas Hurst earned his bachelor’s degree from Tulane University in 1968 and his master’s in fine arts from Temple University in 1970. He received acting lessons from Cecil Pickett, a drama teacher at the University of Houston and the father of future St. Elsewhere actress Cindy Pickett.\n\nHe made his onscreen debut on a 1971 episode of The Doris Day Show, then appeared the next year on Sanford and Son and The Partridge Family and in the movie The Unholy Rollers.\n\nHe exited Dukes to play bumbling chef Earl Nash on Amanda’s, an ill-advised 1983 ABC remake of fabled British hit sitcom Fawlty Towers that starred Bea Arthur as the owner of a seaside hotel (it was her first series after Maude). However, the show aired just 10 episodes before being canceled.\n\nHurst’s big-screen body of work also included W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975), Tunnel Vision (1976), The Cat From Outer Space (1978), Earth Girls Are Easy (1988), The Karate Kid Part III (1989), In the Line of Fire (1993) and Steel Magnolias (1989).",
    "Summary": "This article reports on the death of Rick Hurst, an actor known for his role in \"The Dukes of Hazzard.\" It notes that he received a bachelor's degree from Tulane University. Tulane is mentioned in relation to the actor's educational background."

    "Full Article Text": "That chatbot is only telling you what you want to believe, according to a new study.\n\nWhether you're using a traditional search engine like Google or a conversational tool like OpenAI's ChatGPT, you tend to use terms that reflect your biases and perceptions, according to the study, published this spring in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. More importantly, search engines and chatbots often provide results that reinforce those beliefs, even if your intent is to learn more about the topic.\n\nFor example, imagine you're trying to learn about the health effects of drinking coffee every day. If you, like me, enjoy having exactly two cups of joe first thing in the morning, you may search for something like \"is coffee healthy?\" or \"health benefits of coffee.\" If you're already skeptical (maybe a tea purist), you might search for \"is coffee bad for you?\" instead. The researchers found that framing of questions could skew the results -- I'd mostly get answers that show the benefits of coffee, while you'd get the opposite.\n\n\"When people look up information, whether it's Google or ChatGPT, they actually use search terms that reflect what they already believe,\" Eugina Leung, an assistant professor at Tulane University and lead author of the study, told me.\n\nThe abundance of AI chatbots, and the confident and customized results they so freely give you, makes it easier to fall down a rabbit hole and harder to realize you're in it. There's never been a more important time to think deeply about how you get information online.\n\nThe question is: How do you get the best answers?\n\nAsking the wrong questions\n\nThe researchers conducted 21 studies with nearly 10,000 participants who were asked to conduct searches on certain preselected topics, including the health effects of caffeine, gas prices, crime rates, COVID-19 and nuclear energy. The search engines and tools used included Google, ChatGPT and custom-designed search engines and AI chatbots.\n\nThe researchers' results showed that what they called the \"narrow search effect\" was a function of both how people asked questions and how the tech platforms responded. People have a habit, in essence, of asking the wrong questions (or asking questions in the wrong way). They tended to use search terms or AI prompts that demonstrated what they already thought, and search engines and chatbots designed to provide narrow, extremely relevant answers, delivered on those answers. \"The answers end up basically just confirming what they believe in the first place,\" Leung said.\n\nRead more: AI Essentials: 29 Ways to Make Gen AI Work for You, According to Our Experts\n\nThe researchers also checked to see if participants changed their beliefs after conducting a search. When served a narrow selection of answers that largely confirmed their beliefs, they were unlikely to see significant changes. But when the researchers provided a custom-built search engine and chatbot designed to offer a broader array of answers, they were more likely to change.\n\nLeung said platforms could provide users with the option of a broader, less tailored search, which could prove helpful in situations where the user is trying to find a wider variety of sources. \"Our research is not trying to suggest that search engines or algorithms should always broaden their search results,\" she said. \"I do think there is a lot of value in providing very focused and very narrow search results in certain situations.\"\n\n3 ways to ask the right questions\n\nIf you want a broader array of answers to your questions, there are some things you can do, Leung said.\n\nBe precise: Think specifically about what exactly it is you're trying to learn. Leung used an example of trying to decide if you want to invest in a particular company's stock. Asking if it's a good stock or a bad stock to buy will likely skew your results -- more positive news if you ask if it's good, more negative news if you ask if it's bad. Instead, try a single, more neutral search term. Or ask both terms and evaluate the results of each.\n\nGet other views: Especially with an AI chatbot, you can ask for a broad range of perspectives directly in the prompt. If you want to know if you should keep drinking two cups of coffee a day, ask the chatbot for a variety of opinions and the evidence behind them. The researchers tried this in one of their experiments and found they got more variety in results. \"We asked ChatGPT to provide different perspectives to answer the query from the participants and to provide as much evidence to back up those claims as possible,\" Leung said.\n\nAt some point, stop asking: Follow-up questions didn't work quite as well, Leung said. If those questions aren't getting broader answers, you may get the opposite effect -- even more narrow, affirming results. In many cases, people who asked lots of follow-up questions just \"fell deeper down into the rabbit hole,\" she said.",
    "Summary": "This article discusses a study on how search engines and chatbots reinforce users' existing beliefs.  Eugina Leung, an assistant professor at Tulane University and the lead author of the study, is quoted extensively.  The article highlights Leung's research and expertise, thus portraying Tulane positively."

    "Full Article Text": "Jonathan Mayers, a co-founder of Superfly Entertainment who also served as a co-founder of game-changing music festivals like Bonnaroo and Outside Lands, has died, Billboard and a Bonnaroo representative confirmed to Pitchfork He was 51.\n\nAfter growing up a short drive from New York and graduating from Tulane University, in 1995, Mayers immersed himself in the music world through work at the storied New Orleans institutions Tipitina’s and Jazz Fest. In 1996, he co-founded the promotion company Superfly Entertainment with Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone, and Kerry Black. The group organized its first concert—the Meters, Maceo Parker, and Rebirth Brass Band—during Mardi Gras, before setting sights on bigger ideas.\n\nIn 2002, Mayers and his Superfly coworkers launched the inaugural Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, in Manchester, Tennessee. They sought out an open expanse of land on a farm an hour outside of Nashville, and booked headliners Trey Anastasio (of Phish) and Phil Lesh and Bob Weir (of Grateful Dead) to top the bill. The four co-founders partnered with promoter Ashley Capps of AC Entertainment, agent Chip Hooper of Paradigm Talent Agency, and manager Coran Capshaw of Red Light Management, and the rest was history. The first-ever Bonnaroo sold out, and the 70,000-person capacity festival would go on to become a recurring success. In a few years’ time, Bonnaroo would not only inspire dozens of music festivals across America, but also serve as the blueprint for how to rethink music festivals in the modern era under tighter restrictions compared to the Woodstock era.\n\nJust a few years later, Superfly started Vegoose, an annual Halloween music and arts festival, with multi-venue programming across Las Vegas in 2005. Mayers partnered with San Francisco’s Another Planet Entertainment to launch Outside Lands, in Golden Gate Park, in 2008. That multi-genre, multi-day music festival grew to become the largest independently owned music festival in the United States.\n\nIn addition to starting other events around the country, like the comedy-focused festival Clusterfest in San Francisco in 2017, Mayers also turned his attention toward film and TV rights holders to start immersive experiences for fans. By licensing rights from popular shows like Friends, Seinfeld, The Office, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and more, Mayers and his team recreated TV sets in various cities that allowed fans to “step inside” their favorite series.\n\nIn August 2021, Superfly terminated Mayers’ position at the company following internal disagreements with the three other co-founders of the entertainment company. The next year, Mayers sued Farman, Goodstone, and Black, accusing them of civil misrepresentation, breach of contract, and fraud over the underestimated value of his shares in Superfly. In January 2023, a New York judge dismissed the lawsuit. Mayers went on to focus on Core City Detroit, a new project investing in a music campus for local artists that also could host public events.",

    "Full Article Text": "Reliable and affordable energy must overcome bureaucratic resistance.\n\nPresident Trump’s four executive orders on nuclear energy, issued on May 23, 2025, are blazing a bold path to an energy future where electricity will be more reliable and more economical.\n\nBy unleashing advanced nuclear technologies, streamlining regulations, and bolstering the domestic nuclear industry, these orders aim to deliver 400 gigawatts of clean, reliable power by 2050 – a quadrupling of current capacity. This vision promises energy independence, economic prosperity, and national security. Yet, entrenched anti-prosperity bureaucrats, timid politicians, and a misinformed public, swayed by decades of anti-nuclear propaganda, stand ready to obstruct this transformative agenda. America must address these obstacles in order to reclaim its leadership in the field of nuclear energy.\n\nOverhaul of the Nuclear Overseers\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which was formed after the dismemberment of the Atomic Energy Commission, has long served as a choke point for nuclear progress. The NRC was designed from the get-go to follow the agenda of anti-nuclear advocates, and consequently, it has licensed only two reactors since 1978, stifling innovation. Trump’s orders demand a sweeping overhaul, capping exorbitant NRC fees and mandating licensing decisions within eighteen months. This aggressive reform dismantles barriers, but bureaucrats accustomed to sluggish processes will resist, clinging to technologically outdated risk-averse frameworks.\n\nAmerica’s existing nuclear fleet—light water and pressurized water reactors—boasts the best safety record of any industry in America. Advanced nuclear designs, like small modular reactors, microreactors and Generation IV systems, push safety even further, with designs able to operate reliably even without human intervention. Trump’s orders prioritize the deployment of these advanced designs, targeting five gigawatts of “power uprates” (increasing the electricity output of existing reactors) and ten large new reactors by 2030. Yet, detractors will cry “impossible,” and claim that government staff reductions, as ordered for the NRC, will compromise safety. In reality, NRC had more than enough staff and time to address a legitimate petition involving safety with respect to cooling spent nuclear fuel pools, choosing to instead to deny it. Given this track record, the public interest will be better served by a leaner and more focused regulator that puts the onus of safety and liability squarely on the industry.\n\nTurning Mislabeled “Waste” into Energy to Make Nuclear “Renewable”\n\nDecades of misinformation have mislabeled partially used nuclear fuel as “waste.” In reality, this stockpile, mischaracterized during the Carter administration, holds trillions of dollars in potential energy if converted to electricity. Experts have long argued that this “waste” could provide America with clean, carbon-free electricity for hundreds of years.\n\nThe concept of recycling partially used nuclear fuel was recommended to the Biden Administration’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on multiple occasions, yet that administration took no action. Trump’s orders have established a motivated plan to process this partially used fuel for advanced reactors, which will release this vast, hidden taxpayer asset value while reducing foreign dependency. The challenge will be overcoming the government bureaucracy’s previous “build back better” mindset that only wind and solar are “renewable.”\n\nNew Nuclear Test Sites and a New Nuclear Workforce\n\nThe Department of Energy’s (DOE) nuclear testing, centered at national labs like Idaho National Laboratory, is facing scrutiny for slow resolutions. Trump’s orders demand a cultural shift by establishing test sites outside labs by July 4, 2026, and ensuring reactors are operational within two years. This urgency will spark competition in the electric power sector, breaking monopolistic inertia. Still, the national lab system’s sluggish reputation could hinder progress unless private sector efficiency drives the process.\n\nA robust nuclear workforce is critical. The US “Nuclear Navy” offers a model for rapidly training top-tier nuclear personnel. Trump’s call for private sector-led apprenticeships and education programs mirrors this approach. By empowering industry over government, America can build a top-tier workforce swiftly, fueling reactor deployment and economic growth.\n\nThe Crossroads of Energy Security and National Security\n\nImportantly, even more importantly the executive orders bolster national security by designating nuclear-powered AI data centers and military bases as critical infrastructure. By deploying advanced reactors at DOE and Department of Defense (DOD) sites by 2028 and securing twenty new nuclear export agreements, the U.S. can lead globally. However, anti-nuclear advocates, steeped in decades of fearmongering, will push back by attempting to delay export deals and domestic progress.\n\nTrump’s nuclear revolution is not just a policy shift, it’s a call to action. America stands at a crossroads: embrace advanced nuclear power for affordable, abundant energy or succumb to the inertia of bureaucrats and misinformation. Only one of those roads leads to prosperity and energy security, and America must take it.\n\nAbout the Authors: Tommy Waller and Douglas Ellsworth\n\nLt. Col.

But through offseason programs and OTAs, he is acclimating well.\n\n\"Caleb's doing awesome,\" said defensive backs coach Anthony Perkins. \"We were very excited just during the draft process, we thought based on his skill set what he showed on tape, he'd be able to make that transition and play more at safety and he hasn't disappointed. He's done a tremendous job.\"\n\nIn coverage, Ransaw was stingy during his college career, allowing a completion rate of just 49% over the last two seasons with one interception and three pass breakups. He's also been a very reliable tackler.\n\nRansaw also brings a lot of speed to the defensive backfield, running a 4.33-second 40 during the pre-draft process.\n\nWith Eric Murray, we could see Ransaw tasked with more often being the strong safety within this defense, which would still position him closer to the line of scrimmage, where the bulk of his playing time has come.\n\nHowever, in Anthony Campanile's malleable defensive scheme, versatility and the ability to move players around will be important elements, which could lead to Ransaw filling a few different roles.\n\n\"Every day's a new day, every rep is a new rep, so he's learning,\" added Perkins. \"All those safeties are learning, but he's doing a tremendous job of picking it up. I think he's super athletic. I think he's got a very high ceiling in this league, and I'm excited to continue to see him grow within the scheme of our defense.\"\n\nAlong with Ransaw, Darnell Savage, Antonio Johnson, and Andrew Wingard are competing for playing time next to Murray as well.",

He was 51.\n\nBonnaroo started in 2002, and the 2025 edition is set to begin in Manchester, Tennessee, this week on Thursday, June 12.\n\nNo cause of death has yet been announced.\n\nIn a statement to Billboard, Red Light Management founder Coran Capshaw said: “This is incredibly tough news for so many of us. Jon was the creative force behind so much of what people experience at Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, and many other events over the years. We’re all really going to miss him.”\n\nMayers graduated in 1995 from Tulane University in New Orleans, where he became interested in concert promotion through his work at legendary local venue Tipitina’s and the city’s long-running Jazz Fest.\n\nThe following year, he co-founded Superfly with partners Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone and Kerry Black, and the fledgling promotions company hosted their first concert during Mardi Gras.\n\nThe four worked together to launch Bonnaroo in 2002 after securing the festival site on farmland in Manchester, an hour outside of Nashville. They worked closely with Capshaw’s Red Light Management and other industry figures to book headliners, including the Grateful Dead’s Phil Lesh and Bob Weir.\n\nIn 2008, Mayers partnered with Another Planet Entertainment to create the Outside Lands festival in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park.\n\nAs well as music festivals, Mayers also partnered with television shows to create “immersive” fan experiences based on series including Friends, Seinfeld, The Office, South Park, Arrested Development, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and The Daily Show.\n\nMayers left Superfly acrimoniously in 2021, and the following year sued his former partners Farman, Goodstone and Black, accusing them of civil misrepresentation, breach of contract and fraud. Mayers alleged that they had misrepresented the value of his shares in the promotions company. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2023.\n\nSuperfly said in a statement to Billboard: “We are heartbroken with the passing of Jonathan. He was a cherished part of Superfly’s story, woven into it’s history and legacy. In addition to the role he’s played in bringing joy to millions, we will miss his razor sharp wit, infectious smile and contagious laugh. No one could light up a room like Jon.”\n\nIn the years following his departure from Superfly, Mayers worked on the Core City Detroit project to raise money for the city’s regeneration.\n\nThis year’s Bonnaroo will see headline performances from the likes of Tyler, the Creator, Olivia Rodrigo and Hozier.\n\nDayglo Presents founder Peter Shapiro said in a statement that contemporary festivals owe a debt to Mayers’s work behind the scenes.\n\n“Jonathan was one of the true real visionaries of the modern concert world and one of the core minds behind Bonnaroo,” Shapiro told Billboard. “Modern-day festivals are all in some way built off of his vision.”",

    "Full Article Text": "Measuring child labor accurately is a major challenge: parents’ and children’s reports tend to differ dramatically, and there is typically no way to verify whose reports are truthful (if any). To overcome this challenge, this paper uses novel data from a cocoa certifier in Côte d’Ivoire that draws on satellite imagery to minimize under-reporting. Concretely, aerial photos allow them to select remote and hard-to-reach communities—where parents typically have not been sensitized by government or NGOs, averting social desirability biases—and to visit these communities while cocoa is being harvested—precisely when children in employment are very visible, making it easier for enumerators to impute it if parents still fail to report it. We compare their figures with those obtained from business-as-usual surveys with parents and children in these regions, and find that (1) reporting inconsistencies between parents and their children in fact decrease with household remoteness; (2) adults dramatically under-report child labor relative to the certifier data, by a factor of at least 60%; and (3) in turn, children self-reports are statistically identical to the latter. Taking advantage of an experiment that randomly assigned a text-message campaign to discourage child labor, we further show that parents’ reports not only underestimate its prevalence, but can even lead to the wrong conclusions about the effects of policy interventions.\n\nFunding: Study conducted in partnership with Transforming Education in Cocoa Communities (TRECC) and generously funded by the Jacobs Foundation Science of Learning initiative.

Any views and opinions contained in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of TRECC or the Jacobs Foundation.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nChild labor is a pervasive practice in agriculture, especially in West Africa, where the global cocoa industry sources roughly half of its produce. Defined according to international standards and national legislation, child labor typically characterizes any work by children under the age of 12, and excessive or risky work by 12–17 year-olds (see Section 2.1.1). 2020 data from the International Labor Organization (ILO) documented 160 million child workers worldwide—9.6% of all 5–17 year-old children [1]. Strikingly, that figure was over 2-fold in Sub-Saharan Africa (23.9%). In Côte d’Ivoire, the setting of our study, 15% of the cocoa industry employees that year were children [2].\n\nWhile such figures have mobilized massive global attention and resources to combat child labor, a key challenge in interpreting them is reliability. This is because while official statistics on child labor are essentially based on adult reports (see Section 2.1.1), there are many reasons why parents or caregivers may fail to truthfully disclose children in employment. They might fear that admitting to child labor (e.g., that their under-12 year-old children help during the harvest season) could lead them to face legal action from child protective services, or adversely impact their livelihoods (e.g., if the companies sourcing from them are punished for child labor in their supply chain, which could trickle down to lower prices or even to discontinuation of their income; see [3]). Importantly, if parents omit children in employment, child labor will be under-estimated in the data—since child labor is contained in children in employment.\n\nThis paper uses novel data from a cocoa certifier in Côte d’Ivoire to overcome this challenge. ENVERITAS, a global NGO that certifies smallholder coffee and cocoa farms when it comes to agricultural best practices—including the absence of child labor –, draws on satellite imagery to minimize under-reporting. Concretely, aerial photos allow them (1) to select remote and hard-to-reach communities, where parents typically have not been sensitized by government or NGO campaigns to discourage child labor, averting social desirability biases; and (2) to visit these communities during harvest season, precisely when child labor is very visible, making it easier for enumerators to mark it as present even if parents still fail to report it. We compare their figures with those obtained from business-as-usual surveys with parents and children in these regions, which partially overlap with the remote villages where ENVERITAS certifies farming practices. Our sample focuses on primary school children, nearly all under 12 years old—for whom any hours in employment are classified as child labor by national legislation.\n\nBefore turning to the certifier data, we start by documenting patterns in reporting discrepancies in our own surveys that lend credibility to our empirical strategy. Restricting attention to households in our sample with valid GPS location data, 29.3% of adults admit that their children worked at least an hour in cocoa fields in the month before the survey. In contrast, 51.8% of children report that they did so—a striking 77% average difference in reporting rates. First, we document that such discrepancies indeed decrease with the distance from each household to the school their children attend: the difference between children’s and parents’ reports decrease significantly with every additional km from the school, consistent with ENVERITAS’s claim that village remoteness is inversely related to reporting biases. Second, we estimate that children’s self-reports do not increase with distance from the school, minimizing concerns with child labor in more remote villages misrepresenting its typical prevalence. We further document that not only are discrepancies between children’s and parents’ reports much lower when it comes to domestic work—a more socially acceptable activity and typically not the subject of advocacy campaigns, in contrast to labor in cocoa fields –, but also, that such discrepancies do not decrease with household remoteness. All in all, results back up the certifiers’ sampling strategy as a way of measuring the ground truth for the prevalence of child labor, which we can then use to validate parents’ and children’s reports in the sub-sample for which the two datasets overlap.\n\nOur main contribution is to document first-hand that adult surveys indeed under-report the prevalence of child labor, and the extent of under-reporting. In regions with subsequent third-party verification, 45.5% of children reported having worked in cocoa plantations in the previous month, matching almost exactly the 47.8% prevalence indicated by the certifier; in contrast, only 16.2% of parents in those regions reported children in employment—a nearly 2/3 reporting gap. Across regions, under-reporting ranged from 60% to 85%.\n\nPrevious studies were not able to document the extent of under-reporting by parents. These papers rely on three types of comparisons. First, comparisons between parents’ reports under different conditions for social desirability bias [e.g., 4], to document that such biases exist—but unable to pin down their magnitude. Second, comparisons between adults’ and children’s reports [5,6], to document that discrepancies exist—but unable to pin down what the ‘ground truth’ is. Third, comparisons between an objective measure of children in employment and children’s self-reports [7], to document that the latter are accurate—but unable to pin down under-reporting by parents. Similarly to ours, the latter study documents that children accurately report the number of hours they work, using logs from GPS trackers worn by different household members to verify data from surveys and activity diaries. The study, however, actively refrained from having enumerators ask adults about child labor. In the absence of parents’ reports, it could not document whether parents under-report children in employment and, if so, by how much.\n\nOur second contribution is to document that basing child labor accounts on surveys with parents not only underestimates its prevalence, but can also bias evaluations of how it responds to policy interventions. Taking advantage of a randomized control trial that assigned some Ivorian parents to messages discouraging child labor in cocoa fields to study whether the estimated impact of the intervention on child labor depends on how the latter is measured, we find that while messages had no effect on children in employment according to children themselves, they significantly increased children in employment according to parents (by 55.1%). Presumably, the reason for such discrepancy is that the intervention tried to foster investments in children that would reduce children’s participation in labor activities without explicitly condemning child labor—partially deterring social desirability biases. Once again consistent with the claim that such biases are stronger in communities that have been previously sensitized, treatment effects on child labor according to parents sharply decay with our measure of remoteness.\n\nThese findings have key implications for how child labor should be measured. One possibility is to survey children directly (the ‘who’). Our results indicate that this would most likely yield accurate estimates of children in employment, but it might also involve complex technical and ethical dilemmas. It might be hard to ensure a unified understanding of what characterizes employment, especially among younger respondents. Most importantly, participation might put children at risk if it triggers backlash by parents. An alternative is to survey adults, as usual, but to focus on hard-to-reach communities (the ‘where’) during harvest season (the ‘when’)—leveraging technological advances such as satellite imagery. We further discuss the implications and limitations of our findings in Section 4.",

Trump – Musk fallout is spooking investors: What started as a public feud has turned into a financial risk, with xAI’s debt price dropping and yields climbing as investors worry about regulatory blowback.\n\nWhat started as a public feud has turned into a financial risk, with xAI’s debt price dropping and yields climbing as investors worry about regulatory blowback. Musk’s vision for Open AI faces new threats: Musk originally launched xAI to counter Big Tech’s closed AI systems with a more ‘truth-seeking’ approach. Now that vision is vulnerable to political grudges, not just market forces.\n\nMusk originally launched xAI to counter Big Tech’s closed AI systems with a more ‘truth-seeking’ approach. Now that vision is vulnerable to political grudges, not just market forces. Politics are becoming a bottleneck for innovation: As AI becomes critical infrastructure, its future increasingly depends on political favor. xAI shows how quickly open innovation can become collateral in a power struggle.\n\nWhen Elon Musk launched xAI, he promised a future where AI wouldn’t be controlled by a handful of corporate giants. He talked about building a safer, more transparent, and open-source alternative to OpenAI.\n\nBut now, Musk’s big plans may run into a political buzzsaw with an old name and a renewed grip on power: President Donald Trump.\n\nThis week, reports surfaced that xAI is trying to raise $5B in debt financing to ramp up its infrastructure and compete with the likes of OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n\nThe money would go toward building supercomputers and training massive language models.\n\nBut here’s the catch: this kind of funding usually depends on more than just investor excitement. It often involves government contracts, partnerships, and regulatory green lights.\n\nAnd Trump might not be in the mood to play nice with Musk.\n\nThat’s not just gossip. That’s a financial risk.\n\nForget the Feud – This Is About Financing\n\nThe media loves a Musk vs. Trump story.\n\nThere’s plenty of material: Musk’s not-so-subtle jabs at Trump, Trump’s comments about Elon being ‘a liberal’ when it suits him, the weird friendship-turned-friction that played out across X.\n\nBut beneath the memes and soundbites is a serious issue for xAI: politics can now choke off tech innovation, especially when egos are involved.\n\nElon Musk’s companies thrive on public-private relationships. Tesla benefited from massive government subsidies. SpaceX has NASA contracts. Starlink is practically a life-or-death utility in some parts of the world.\n\nEven xAI, which Musk presents as independent, would be affected by national AI strategies, GPU export regulations, and possible government partnerships.\n\nIf Trump sees xAI as part of Musk’s broader empire – or worse, a political rival – he has ways to make life harder.\n\nA delayed export license here, a denied federal AI grant there, a tax incentive that quietly disappears. These aren’t hypotheticals. Trump has used these levers of government to punish perceived enemies before.\n\nTrump vs. Biden on Tech: A Quick Recap\n\nTo understand the threat, it helps to look at how Trump and Biden differ on tech policy.\n\nBiden’s administration took a structured approach.\n\nA sweeping 2023 Executive Order laid out AI safety rules, the CHIPS Act pumped billions into AI and chip research, and 2024 guidance told agencies to stop tossing AI into public systems without oversight.\n\nWhile not publicly waving the open-source flag, the Biden White House quietly backed it – with research grants, calls for transparency, and pressure on Big Tech’s closed ecosystems.\n\nTrump, by contrast, ran tech policy on impulse.\n\nHe didn’t offer an AI roadmap but acted fast when politics got personal. He clashed with Amazon, tried to force a TikTok sale, and blocked foreign deals in the name of national security.\n\nHis ‘America First’ stance made life harder for U.S. firms operating globally. Now that he’s back in office, the same instincts may return – with a sharper edge.\n\nWith Musk no longer in his good graces, xAI might find itself squarely in the blast radius.\n\nInside the $5B Bet: Why xAI Needs the Money\n\nSo what exactly is this $5B Musk is chasing – and why is it such a big deal?\n\nThis isn’t a typical Silicon Valley raise. xAI is pursuing convertible debt – essentially a loan that can later convert into equity if things go well. It’s a financing move that gives investors a path to future ownership without betting on today’s valuation.\n\nAlongside this, Musk’s companies are exploring a $300M secondary share sale that would value xAI at a staggering $113B.\n\nBut the political feud has spooked some investors. Early demand was strong, but the price of xAI’s debt has reportedly slipped from 99 cents to 95 cents on the dollar, and yields have begun to climb.\n\nThat’s a clear sign that political noise is bleeding into financial risk.\n\nThe money isn’t for marketing or headcount. It’s for serious infrastructure. xAI wants to build custom data centers designed to run massive language models – the kind that eat GPUs for breakfast.\n\nxAI has purchased a warehouse and land off Tulane Road, Memphis to build data centers.\n\nSource: Google Maps\n\nThese aren’t rented AWS servers. They’re physical, high-performance facilities meant to match the scale and speed of rivals like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.\n\nThis kind of ambition is expensive. Training state-of-the-art models can cost hundreds of millions – and that’s before the electricity bill.\n\nIn the current AI arms race, having a good idea isn’t enough. You need hardware, access, and deep pockets.\n\nBut raising that kind of money puts xAI at the mercy of financial markets – and potentially, political ones. If Trump’s White House starts tightening the screws, even the best-laid technical roadmap could hit a wall.\n\nWhat Happens If the Deal Falls Through?\n\nIf xAI fails to land the $5B, it’s not just a delay – it’s a serious roadblock.\n\nThe company’s goal of building competitive, open-source AI models depends on vast compute resources. Without the money, xAI could fall behind in both scale and speed. That wouldn’t just hurt Musk. It would stall one of the few efforts aiming to keep AI development from becoming fully corporate and closed-door.\n\nGrok, xAI’s chatbot, may not be fully open-source, but it’s marketed as a more open, independent alternative to the Big Tech models. Losing that alternative would narrow the playing field.\n\nIn a world where most frontier AI development is bankrolled by the world’s biggest corporations and steered by government alliances, losing xAI’s vision to politics would send a grim message: openness doesn’t scale unless power approves.\n\nAnd if that becomes the new normal, it won’t stop at Musk. It’s a blow to the whole idea of open and decentralized AI.\n\nOpen-Source AI Needs Protection From Politics\n\nThe irony here runs deep.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018, officially due to conflicts with Tesla’s AI work — but he’s since accused the company of drifting toward closed, profit-driven models, especially after its partnership with Microsoft and shift to a for-profit structure. That, in his view, was a betrayal of OpenAI’s original mission.\n\nIn 2023, he founded xAI with a different promise: to build ‘truth-seeking’ AI and push back against what he described as Big Tech’s growing control over artificial intelligence.\n\nBut now, those ideals are under threat – not from market failure or lack of demand, but from political friction and personal grudges. And that should concern anyone who believes AI innovation shouldn’t hinge on which billionaires get along with which presidents.\n\nImagine if Linux developers had to worry about presidential approval before pushing a kernel update. Or if Python’s core library needed sign-off from a national security office. Absurd, right? But that’s not far off from where we’re headed as foundational AI becomes deeply entangled in geopolitics, regulation, and personality-driven policymaking.\n\nAI is becoming critical infrastructure. That means it can be steered, blocked, or co-opted by governments. And if Trump sees AI as a strategic asset – or a threat – he may treat companies like xAI the way he treated TikTok or Huawei: comply or be sidelined.\n\nMusk’s Political Risk Problem\n\nThere’s also a bigger pattern here. Musk is a man of many companies and few filters. That worked well when government contracts were being handed out and he was the darling of innovation.\n\nBut as his political commentary has gotten louder, the backlash is catching up.\n\nTesla is under increased scrutiny, with federal investigations into its Autopilot system and high-profile safety recalls. SpaceX has faced FAA regulatory delays, particularly with Starship launches.\n\nStarlink has drawn foreign policy concerns too – especially after Musk’s role in Ukraine’s military communications raised alarms in Washington and Europe.\n\nStarlink terminal in Donetsk, Ukraine.\n\nImage by Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nNow, xAI faces the same kind of vulnerability, with its future tied not just to tech milestones, but to political favor.\n\nThis isn’t about whether Musk is right or wrong politically. It’s about whether one man’s social media posts can jeopardize multibillion-dollar tech ventures. The answer, increasingly, is yes.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nIf xAI pulls off the debt deal anyway, it would be a win for Musk and a sign that private capital still believes in the mission. But if the deal stalls or gets downsized, don’t just blame interest rates or the economy. Blame politics.\n\nWe’re entering an era where innovation doesn’t just compete with other companies. It competes with political whims.\n\nThat’s a dangerous precedent.\n\nBecause today it’s Musk and xAI. Tomorrow it could be any startup that dares to challenge the status quo – or pisses off the wrong president.\n\nOnline Tech Tips, Help Desk Geek, Framework, Insta360, Redmagic, Inmotion, Secretlab, Kodak, and Anker, reviewing their products in real-life scenarios.

    "Full Article Text": "Courtesy The Center for Discovery\n\nKaren London's son, Zachary, was 19 when he began living at The Center for Discovery in New York's Catskill Mountains, where residents eat what they grow on 300 certified organic acres. The young man with autism began to pitch hay, seed land, and collect and sort eggs from free-range chickens. Now 37, Zachary still enjoys meaningful work there, his mother says.\n\n“There's no ultra-processed food,” she adds. “They truly believe that nutrition is a source of wellness. Overall, they optimize Zachary's physical health. He is physically active every day.”\n\nThe perks of farm living—fresh air, sunshine, and seasonal produce—are why agriculture-based neighborhoods, or “agrihoods,” have kept sprouting since the start of the century. They incorporate some type of agriculture, such as a working farm or community garden, whose harvests go to residents. Agrihoods provide an amenity the whole family can learn from, let residents be part of a team, and preserve the land. Neurologists say this model and the food it provides could help delay early brain aging and dementia and prevent other neurologic conditions, too.\n\nThe United States has about 200 agrihoods in at least 30 states across a variety of climates, including Florida, Illinois, Colorado, and Hawaii, according to a 2024 report by the National Association of Home Builders. They exist in rural communities and around cities.\n\nA Growing Movement\n\nThe first well-known model was Agritopia, built in Gilbert, AZ, outside Phoenix. Construction began in 2001, and Agritopia continues to thrive. Newer neighborhoods include upscale housing at Arden in Palm Beach County, FL, and affordable housing units at Agrihood in urban Santa Clara, CA. The farms tend to focus on growing produce, but some also keep livestock.\n\nSome agrihoods grow food just to feed their own residents, while others offer Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm shares, which consumers pay for in advance; sell crops at farmer's markets; or provide produce for on-site stores where residents can shop. People can enjoy getting their hands dirty or, if they have mobility issues, sitting down to help package herbs or mark prices. Some have children's programs or incorporate animals, such as Catskills Agrihood on Hope Street in New York.\n\nSerenbe Farms, an agrihood with more than 1,000 residents in Chattahoochee Hills, GA, was built around a 25-acre certified organic farm starting in 2004. It aims to “connect people to nature, to each other, and to a lifestyle that prioritizes holistic well-being, starting with access to fresh, local produce,” says Amy Peterson, Serenbe's community operations and relationships manager. Ten to 20 residents volunteer each week, growing vegetables, fruit, flowers, and herbs.\n\nMary Collins-Shepard spends her days sowing seeds in a greenhouse, transplanting seedlings, and organizing produce at Serenbe. “Engaging with my neighbors at the farm is energizing, but the time can also be very meditative if I happen to be working alone,” says the 67 year old, who moved to the agrihood outside Atlanta from Knoxville, TN, with her husband seven years ago.\n\nThe produce she helps grow and harvest goes into Serenbe's CSA system, Saturday farmer's market, and farm-to-table restaurants—efforts that benefit not only her but also her neighbors.\n\nSome homes for people with developmental challenges have similar setups, such as Camphill North America community living programs, which serve people with autism, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and other conditions. Residents at Camphill Hudson in New York, for example, eat the produce they grow. Former president Tim Paholak has been involved since 1976 and calls the program life-changing: “Developing community is a vital component of human health for all of us.”\n\nBrain Benefits\n\nDemetrius M. Maraganore, MD, FAAN, professor and chair of the department of neurology at Tulane University School of Medicine and co-director of the Healthy Brain Aging Initiative at University Medical Center of New Orleans, says farm-centric living fits nicely into Healthy Brain's mission to prevent cognitive decline and dementia with evidence-based lifestyle and behavioral interventions.\n\n“My father developed Alzheimer's disease, and so did his mother and her mother,” says Dr. Maraganore. “I thought, ‘How can I prevent this? We need to change our lifestyle and habits.’ … My passion is to harness nutrition to develop treatments for Alzheimer's. We now have the opportunity to prevent it.”\n\nHe stands by a Mediterranean-style diet, which usually includes lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, with olive oil as a primary fat source and dairy products, eggs, fish, and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts. It centers on minimally processed, plant-based foods and limits sugar, fried food, refined carbohydrates, and saturated fats.\n\nNikolaos Scarmeas, MD, PhD, of the department of neurology at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece and Columbia University, said by email that a “Mediterranean-like diet” has “the most scientific support regarding less risk for cognitive decline and dementia.” It can improve blood flow and circulation in the brain and promote better overall cardiovascular health, Dr. Maraganore adds.\n\nA review of 64 studies by Tulane's Healthy Brain Aging Initiative team in 2022 found that the Mediterranean diet can help promote gut health, which may be neuroprotective, and was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The researchers also found that the diet's nutrient-dense and fiber-rich foods (compared to the typical low-fiber Western diet) may be beneficial for not only overall health but also healthy brain aging.\n\nNot everyone can easily access these foods, Dr. Maraganore points out, especially if they live in a “food desert,” an area with limited access to fresh, affordable, and nutritious food. This makes moving to agrihoods appealing. With farm-grown produce, he says, “you can stick closer to a good diet.”\n\nSunshine also provides vitamin D, an anti-inflammatory; not having enough vitamin D is a risk factor for Parkinson's, stroke, and Alzheimer's, says Dr. Maraganore, who points out other agrihood benefits, too: “The community involvement and socialization in a farm venture can keep aging brain cells from dying and reduce dementia and anxiety.”\n\nLearn More\n\nFor farm-to-table recipes with fresh, seasonal ingredients, visit Brain & Life's Nutrition page.",

    "Full Article Text": "Un nuevo estudio liderado por la Universidad Tulane advierte sobre el aumento de los niveles de mercurio en los ríos. Las consecuencias no solo afectan la salud humana sino también a los ecosistemas.\n\nDesde la Revolución Industrial, la creciente actividad humana ha tenido un gran impacto en el medioambiente. Una evidencia de ello es el aumento de los niveles de mercurio en los ríos del mundo, que se han duplicado. Los altos niveles de este químico no solo tienen graves consecuencias para la salud humana, sino también para los ecosistemas.\n\nLa minería, la combustión de carbón y la industria han aumentado la contaminación por mercurio y han alterado la circulación de los ríos fluviales. Está combinación de factores provocan un fuerte aumento de las concentraciones de este químico, según un estudio de la Universidad Tulane (Estados Unidos). El informe se publicó el miércoles (11.06.2025) en la revista Science.\n\nCientíficos de China, EE. UU y Francia desarrollaron un modelo basado en procesos para simular el transporte de mercurio en los ríos. Los resultados: antes de 1850, los ríos del mundo vertían a los océanos alrededor de 390 toneladas métricas de mercurio al año. Actualmente, los ríos transportan mil toneladas métricas.\n\n\"Las actividades humanas han alterado el ciclo global del mercurio en todos los aspectos\", dijo Yanxu Zhang, profesor de la Universidad Tulane y autor principal del estudio. \"Los estudios anteriores se han centrado en las concentraciones de mercurio en la atmósfera, los suelos y el agua de mar y han pasado por alto en gran medida los ríos, una vía importante para el mercurio que se ha convertido efectivamente en una tubería para las aguas residuales de origen municipal e industrial\", detalla el investigador.\n\nLos resultados del informe tienen importantes implicaciones para la salud humana, ya que el mercurio contiene potentes neurotoxinas que se acumulan en los peces que consumimos. Además, los expertos advierten que la fauna silvestre ha sufrido un aumento preocupante de los niveles de mercurio.\n\nLa minería, la combustión de carbón y la industria han aumentado la contaminación por mercurio y han alterado la circulación de los ríos fluviales. Imagen: Alan Chavez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUn estudio regional\n\nPara la realización del estudio, se creó un modelo informático detallado llamado MOSART-Hg, que simulaba el transporte preindustrial del mercurio desde la tierra hasta los océanos a través de los sistemas fluviales. Los hallazgos coincidieron con las concentraciones de mercurio encontradas en muestras de sedimentos datadas de zonas costeras de todo el mundo, lo que validó el enfoque de la investigación.\n\nLos patrones regionales revelaron que los aumentos más drásticos de la contaminación por mercurio se produjeron en América del Norte y del Sur, que contribuyeron con un 41 por ciento del crecimiento mundial del mercurio fluvial desde 1850, seguidas por el sudeste asiático (22 %) y el sur de Asia (19 %).\n\nEn la región amazónica, los niveles de mercurio se dispararon debido al aumento de la erosión del suelo por la deforestación y a las emisiones de mercurio procedentes de las actividades mineras. \"El balance de mercurio del río Amazonas supera ahora las 200 toneladas métricas al año, y tres cuartas partes de esta cantidad provienen de actividades humanas, principalmente de la minería artesanal\", aseguró Zhang.\n\nEn Asia Oriental, donde los ríos aportan más del 70 % del mercurio global, las emisiones industriales de mercurio se identificaron como el principal factor del aumento de contaminación.\n\nNo todas las regiones experimentaron incrementos\n\nEn la región mediterránea se registraron bajos niveles de mercurio, en comparación con la era preindustrial. Los científicos creen que esto se debe a la construcción de presas como la que se encuentra en el río Nilo.\n\nLos expertos consideran que esta investigación puede ser de gran ayuda para poder gestionar de mejor forma la contaminación por mercurio, y buscar soluciones. Además, opinan que se deberían fijar objetivos mundiales para reducir las emisiones de mercurio fluvial, y restaurar los entornos contaminados.\n\nbt (EFE, Phys.org, ABC)",

    "Full Article Text": "PORTOLA VALLEY, Calif., June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bay Area Lyme Foundation, a leading sponsor of Lyme disease research in the US, has given its 2025 Emerging Leader Award (ELA) to Chao Wang, PhD, associate professor in the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering at Arizona State University, faculty with ASU’s Biodesign Institute® and an expert in nanotechnology and biosensors. Wang will receive $150,000 to support his work to develop a much-needed rapid, low-cost, easy-to-use test, called Nano2RED-LD, for Lyme disease. The test aims to deliver results in as few as 30 minutes when a patient who may have Lyme disease first sees a doctor.\n\nThere is an immense need for better Lyme disease tests. Today’s standard-of-care tests miss too many cases at all stages of Lyme disease, including as many as 70% of early Lyme cases.\n\n“With Lyme disease cases rising steadily across the U.S., the need for accurate and timely diagnostic tools has never been greater,” said Katariina Tuovinen, research grant director, Bay Area Lyme Foundation. “Dr. Wang’s pioneering work epitomizes the essence of this award as it applies innovation from other infectious diseases in an effort to enhance outcomes for patients affected by Lyme disease.”\n\nThis unique diagnostic system uses gold nanoparticles along with an innovative electronically driven data readout system that has shown promise in detecting Ebola and COVID-19, as well as detecting a Lyme protein called OppA2. The platform offers a novel combination of direct and indirect detection for Lyme disease as it detects both antigens and antibodies, producing a clear signal, with the intent to enhance detection. To automatically transmit the data, it leverages a circuit-integrated electronic readout that digitizes the gold nanoparticle signals for accurate and easy data analysis, further simplifying the use of the diagnostic system.\n\nWang’s ELA research project will use samples from Bay Area Lyme Foundation’s Lyme Disease Biobank to measure sensitivity and specificity with positive and negative controls.\n\nWang first used Nano2RED-LD to detect Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, showing it could be about 1,000 times more sensitive than the commonly used ELISA test. Over the past two years, his lab has also demonstrated that Nano2RED-LD can detect the protein OppA2, a lipoprotein and part of a family of proteins in Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. For this research with OppA2, Wang has worked closely with Bay Area Lyme Foundation scientific advisory board member, Monica Embers, PhD, associate professor in the Division of Immunology at Tulane National Primate Research Center, and 2021 ELA winner, Michael Rout, PhD, professor and head of Laboratory of Cellular and Structural Biology at Rockefeller University.\n\n“We believe collaboration between researchers is a key component driving innovative science and appreciate the support Dr. Wang is receiving from the community,” said Linda Giampa, executive director of Bay Area Lyme Foundation. “We are proud to see the extensive resources of our Lyme Disease Biobank being used for such important research, and we value the opportunity to support work that brings us closer to developing improved diagnostics for patients with Lyme disease.”\n\nPrevious Emerging Leader Award recipients have come from institutions, including Brandeis University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Louisiana State University, North Carolina State University, Stanford University School of Medicine, Texas A&M, Tulane University, University of California San Francisco, Rockefeller University, Stanford University, Tufts University, and Northwestern University. Most of these projects were in the early stages of research, and the Emerging Leader Award enabled scientists to generate data required for ongoing support from Bay Area Lyme Foundation and/or government funding. Many findings have been accepted for presentation at well-respected scientific forums or are detailed in peer-reviewed papers.\n\nSince its inception in 2014, the Emerging Leader Award has recognized scientists and researchers with innovative ideas to advance diagnostics or treatments for Lyme disease. Those interested in applying for the 2026 award or exploring additional funding opportunities offered by the Bay Area Lyme Foundation are encouraged to visit: https://www.bayarealyme.org/our-research/grant-process/ .\n\nAbout Lyme Disease\n\nThe most common vector-borne infectious disease in the US, Lyme disease is a potentially disabling infection caused by bacteria transmitted through the bite of an infected tick to people and pets, and can be potentially passed from a pregnant mother to her unborn baby. If caught early, most cases of Lyme disease can be effectively treated, but it is commonly misdiagnosed due to lack of awareness and inaccurate diagnostic tests. Based on the trajectory of Lyme disease cases documented by CDC between 2010 and 2018, Bay Area Lyme estimates that there are now more than 620,000 new cases of Lyme disease each year, and, as a result of the difficulty in diagnosing and treating Lyme disease, up to two million Americans may be suffering from the impact of its debilitating long-term symptoms and complications..\n\nAbout Bay Area Lyme Foundation\n\nBay Area Lyme Foundation , a national organization committed to making Lyme disease easy to diagnose and simple to cure, is the leading public charity sponsor of innovative Lyme disease research in the US. A 501c3 organization based in Silicon Valley, Bay Area Lyme Foundation collaborates with world-class scientists and institutions to accelerate medical breakthroughs for Lyme disease. It is also dedicated to providing reliable, fact-based information so that prevention and the importance of early treatment are common knowledge. Historically a pivotal donation from the LaureL STEM fund covered all overhead costs through 2024. In 2023 a Bay Area Lyme Endowment was formed which allows for 100% of all donor contributions to the Bay Area Lyme Foundation to go directly to research and prevention programs in perpetuity.

(EUROPA PRESS) -\n\nLos niveles de mercurio en los ríos del mundo se han más que duplicado desde la era preindustrial, según una investigación de la Universidad de Tulane que es pionera en el ámbito fluvial.\n\nEl estudio, publicado en Science Advances, desarrolló un modelo basado en procesos para simular el transporte de mercurio en los ríos y descubrió que, antes de 1850, los ríos del mundo transportaban aproximadamente 390 toneladas métricas de mercurio a los océanos anualmente. Hoy en día, esa cifra ha ascendido a unas 1.000 toneladas métricas al año, un 150 por ciento más.\n\nLos principales impulsores de este aumento son el vertido de aguas residuales, la erosión del suelo y las liberaciones de mercurio procedentes de las actividades industriales y la minería, afirmó el autor principal, Yanxu Zhang, profesor asociado de Ciencias de la Tierra y Ambientales en la Facultad de Ciencias e Ingeniería de Tulane.\n\n\"Las actividades humanas han alterado el ciclo global del mercurio en todos sus aspectos\", afirmó Zhang en un comunicado. \"Si bien estudios anteriores se han centrado en las concentraciones de mercurio en la atmósfera, el suelo y el agua de mar, han pasado por alto en gran medida los ríos, una vía importante para el mercurio que se ha convertido, de hecho, en una vía de desagüe para las aguas residuales de fuentes municipales e industriales\".\n\nAUMENTOS PREOCUPANTES\n\nLos hallazgos tienen implicaciones significativas para la salud humana y la vida silvestre, ya que los compuestos de mercurio son potentes neurotoxinas que pueden acumularse en los peces y representar riesgos para la salud a través del consumo. Los investigadores señalan que los ríos cercanos a hábitats críticos para la vida silvestre, incluyendo las principales rutas migratorias de aves en Asia Oriental y América del Norte, han experimentado aumentos preocupantes en los niveles de mercurio.\n\n\"El establecimiento de una línea de base para el mercurio ribereño durante la era preindustrial puede servir como un punto de referencia clave\", afirmó Zhang, señalando que podría proporcionar objetivos para acuerdos internacionales como el Convenio de Minamata sobre el Mercurio, cuyo objetivo es reducir la contaminación global por mercurio.\n\nEl equipo de investigación de Tulane creó un modelo informático detallado llamado MOSART-Hg para simular el transporte de mercurio preindustrial de la tierra a los océanos a través de los sistemas fluviales.

Simply put: TikTok. The heart of digital culture has migrated to TikTok, which is a short-form video platform. So there remain memes of a sort — they’re mostly called TikTok trends — but the text-and-image-based memes of years past? Those are harder to come by.”\n\nEngadget: The Oversight Board says Meta isn’t doing enough to fight celeb deepfake scams. “Scams using AI deepfakes of celebrities have become an increasingly prominent issue for Meta over the last couple of years. Now, the Oversight Board has weighed in and has seemingly confirmed what other critics have said: Meta isn’t doing enough to enforce its own rules, and makes it far too easy for scammers to get away with these schemes.”\n\nUSEFUL STUFF\n\nGenealogyBank: Genealogy Tips: Organizing and Preserving Cell Phone Photos. “In this article, Gena Philibert-Ortega gives tips and storage ideas for organizing the photos on your smartphone. Gena is a genealogist and author of the book ‘From the Family Kitchen.'”\n\nAROUND THE SEARCH AND SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD\n\nCalishat: RSS With An Expiration Date: The Temporary Obsessions Feed Reader. “I love RSS; I literally couldn’t do my self-appointed job without it. But when it comes to temporarily monitoring topics, RSS feeds are a bit unwieldy; you have to add another layer of workflow to add/remove feeds, set up reminders for yourself, etc. All that has hitherto discouraged me from using RSS when there was a time-sensitive or current event topic to cover. But RSS is too valuable to leave on the shelf when curating content. So I made a Google Sheets-based tool called Temporary Obsessions Feed Reader.”\n\nDigiday: Marketers set to meet with TikTok in Cannes to discuss the platform’s future plans. “Last year at the Cannes Lions festival, TikTok execs were peppered with questions about the app’s future in the U.S. This time, advertisers want to know about its future, full stop. Whether it’s querying TikTok’s long-term plans for AI, clarity on its partner programs or the inside track on its product road map, marketers on the Croisette are gearing up to determine how the app will (or won’t) fit into their future plans.”\n\nSECURITY & LEGAL\n\nIrish Council for Civil Liberties: Public Services Card database of millions of Irish people’s faces declared illegal . “The decision vindicates the actions taken by ICCL and Digital Rights Ireland against the Department of Employment and Social Protection (DEASP). The Government had previously claimed that the facial records were not biometric data. Today, the DPC found that the Department unlawfully collected facial records (biometric data) from 70% of the population of Ireland over 15 years.”\n\nSky News: 4Chan being investigated by UK officials under new online safety rules. “4Chan, an online forum notorious for its extreme content, is being investigated by UK officials over its failure to comply with new internet safety rules. Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator, said it had received complaints about potential illegal content on 4Chan, as it announced nine new investigations into sites that may have broken new rules.”\n\nRESEARCH & OPINION\n\nTulane University: New Tulane study finds generative AI can boost employee creativity—but only for strategic thinkers. “The employees who benefited most weren’t just using ChatGPT passively. They were actively thinking about how to approach their work, what problems they were trying to solve, and how best to use AI to support their goals. In short, they were skilled at managing their own thinking— planning, reflecting, and adjusting their approach as needed.”\n\nOTHER THINGS I THINK ARE COOL\n\nMIT News: Window-sized device taps the air for safe drinking water. “The system runs entirely on its own, without a power source, unlike other designs that require batteries, solar panels, or electricity from the grid. The team ran the device for over a week in Death Valley, California — the driest region in North America. Even in very low-humidity conditions, the device squeezed drinking water from the air at rates of up to 160 milliliters (about two-thirds of a cup) per day.”\n\nBook Riot: Want To Help Teens Protect The Freedom to Read? Libraries, Apply for Books Unbanned Programming Funding Now . “Libraries nationwide are invited to apply for one-time funds to launch programming for teens and young adults related to the freedom to read. A total of $50,000 in funding will be given out, ranging from $1,000 to $10,000. Any US library is eligible to apply and receive funding, but special consideration will be given to small and rural libraries, where funding and support for such efforts are often more difficult to attain.” Good evening, Internet…\n\nThis newsletter is free but most of the things that go into making it aren’t!

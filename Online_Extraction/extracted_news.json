More importantly, search engines and chatbots often provide results that reinforce those beliefs, even if your intent is to learn more about the topic.\n\nFor example, imagine you're trying to learn about the health effects of drinking coffee every day. If you, like me, enjoy having exactly two cups of joe first thing in the morning, you may search for something like \"is coffee healthy?\" or \"health benefits of coffee.\" If you're already skeptical (maybe a tea purist), you might search for \"is coffee bad for you?\" instead. The researchers found that framing of questions could skew the results -- I'd mostly get answers that show the benefits of coffee, while you'd get the opposite.\n\n\"When people look up information, whether it's Google or ChatGPT, they actually use search terms that reflect what they already believe,\" Eugina Leung, an assistant professor at Tulane University and lead author of the study, told me.\n\nThe abundance of AI chatbots, and the confident and customized results they so freely give you, makes it easier to fall down a rabbit hole and harder to realize you're in it. There's never been a more important time to think deeply about how you get information online.\n\nThe question is: How do you get the best answers?\n\nAsking the wrong questions\n\nThe researchers conducted 21 studies with nearly 10,000 participants who were asked to conduct searches on certain preselected topics, including the health effects of caffeine, gas prices, crime rates, COVID-19 and nuclear energy. The search engines and tools used included Google, ChatGPT and custom-designed search engines and AI chatbots.\n\nThe researchers' results showed that what they called the \"narrow search effect\" was a function of both how people asked questions and how the tech platforms responded. People have a habit, in essence, of asking the wrong questions (or asking questions in the wrong way). They tended to use search terms or AI prompts that demonstrated what they already thought, and search engines and chatbots designed to provide narrow, extremely relevant answers, delivered on those answers. \"The answers end up basically just confirming what they believe in the first place,\" Leung said.\n\nRead more: AI Essentials: 29 Ways to Make Gen AI Work for You, According to Our Experts\n\nThe researchers also checked to see if participants changed their beliefs after conducting a search. When served a narrow selection of answers that largely confirmed their beliefs, they were unlikely to see significant changes. But when the researchers provided a custom-built search engine and chatbot designed to offer a broader array of answers, they were more likely to change.\n\nLeung said platforms could provide users with the option of a broader, less tailored search, which could prove helpful in situations where the user is trying to find a wider variety of sources. \"Our research is not trying to suggest that search engines or algorithms should always broaden their search results,\" she said. \"I do think there is a lot of value in providing very focused and very narrow search results in certain situations.\"\n\n3 ways to ask the right questions\n\nIf you want a broader array of answers to your questions, there are some things you can do, Leung said.\n\nBe precise: Think specifically about what exactly it is you're trying to learn. Leung used an example of trying to decide if you want to invest in a particular company's stock. Asking if it's a good stock or a bad stock to buy will likely skew your results -- more positive news if you ask if it's good, more negative news if you ask if it's bad. Instead, try a single, more neutral search term. Or ask both terms and evaluate the results of each.\n\nGet other views: Especially with an AI chatbot, you can ask for a broad range of perspectives directly in the prompt. If you want to know if you should keep drinking two cups of coffee a day, ask the chatbot for a variety of opinions and the evidence behind them. The researchers tried this in one of their experiments and found they got more variety in results. \"We asked ChatGPT to provide different perspectives to answer the query from the participants and to provide as much evidence to back up those claims as possible,\" Leung said.\n\nAt some point, stop asking: Follow-up questions didn't work quite as well, Leung said. If those questions aren't getting broader answers, you may get the opposite effect -- even more narrow, affirming results. In many cases, people who asked lots of follow-up questions just \"fell deeper down into the rabbit hole,\" she said.", "Summary": "This article discusses a study on how search engines and chatbots reinforce users' existing beliefs.

In 1996, he co-founded the promotion company Superfly Entertainment with Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone, and Kerry Black. The group organized its first concert\u2014the Meters, Maceo Parker, and Rebirth Brass Band\u2014during Mardi Gras, before setting sights on bigger ideas.\n\nIn 2002, Mayers and his Superfly coworkers launched the inaugural Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, in Manchester, Tennessee. They sought out an open expanse of land on a farm an hour outside of Nashville, and booked headliners Trey Anastasio (of Phish) and Phil Lesh and Bob Weir (of Grateful Dead) to top the bill. The four co-founders partnered with promoter Ashley Capps of AC Entertainment, agent Chip Hooper of Paradigm Talent Agency, and manager Coran Capshaw of Red Light Management, and the rest was history. The first-ever Bonnaroo sold out, and the 70,000-person capacity festival would go on to become a recurring success. In a few years\u2019 time, Bonnaroo would not only inspire dozens of music festivals across America, but also serve as the blueprint for how to rethink music festivals in the modern era under tighter restrictions compared to the Woodstock era.\n\nJust a few years later, Superfly started Vegoose, an annual Halloween music and arts festival, with multi-venue programming across Las Vegas in 2005. Mayers partnered with San Francisco\u2019s Another Planet Entertainment to launch Outside Lands, in Golden Gate Park, in 2008. That multi-genre, multi-day music festival grew to become the largest independently owned music festival in the United States.\n\nIn addition to starting other events around the country, like the comedy-focused festival Clusterfest in San Francisco in 2017, Mayers also turned his attention toward film and TV rights holders to start immersive experiences for fans. By licensing rights from popular shows like Friends, Seinfeld, The Office, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and more, Mayers and his team recreated TV sets in various cities that allowed fans to \u201cstep inside\u201d their favorite series.\n\nIn August 2021, Superfly terminated Mayers\u2019 position at the company following internal disagreements with the three other co-founders of the entertainment company. The next year, Mayers sued Farman, Goodstone, and Black, accusing them of civil misrepresentation, breach of contract, and fraud over the underestimated value of his shares in Superfly. In January 2023, a New York judge dismissed the lawsuit. Mayers went on to focus on Core City Detroit, a new project investing in a music campus for local artists that also could host public events.", "Summary": "This article discusses the death of Jonathan Mayers, a co-founder of several music festivals.

This vision promises energy independence, economic prosperity, and national security. Yet, entrenched anti-prosperity bureaucrats, timid politicians, and a misinformed public, swayed by decades of anti-nuclear propaganda, stand ready to obstruct this transformative agenda. America must address these obstacles in order to reclaim its leadership in the field of nuclear energy.\n\nOverhaul of the Nuclear Overseers\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which was formed after the dismemberment of the Atomic Energy Commission, has long served as a choke point for nuclear progress. The NRC was designed from the get-go to follow the agenda of anti-nuclear advocates, and consequently, it has licensed only two reactors since 1978, stifling innovation. Trump\u2019s orders demand a sweeping overhaul, capping exorbitant NRC fees and mandating licensing decisions within eighteen months. This aggressive reform dismantles barriers, but bureaucrats accustomed to sluggish processes will resist, clinging to technologically outdated risk-averse frameworks.\n\nAmerica\u2019s existing nuclear fleet\u2014light water and pressurized water reactors\u2014boasts the best safety record of any industry in America. Advanced nuclear designs, like small modular reactors, microreactors and Generation IV systems, push safety even further, with designs able to operate reliably even without human intervention. Trump\u2019s orders prioritize the deployment of these advanced designs, targeting five gigawatts of \u201cpower uprates\u201d (increasing the electricity output of existing reactors) and ten large new reactors by 2030. Yet, detractors will cry \u201cimpossible,\u201d and claim that government staff reductions, as ordered for the NRC, will compromise safety. In reality, NRC had more than enough staff and time to address a legitimate petition involving safety with respect to cooling spent nuclear fuel pools, choosing to instead to deny it. Given this track record, the public interest will be better served by a leaner and more focused regulator that puts the onus of safety and liability squarely on the industry.\n\nTurning Mislabeled \u201cWaste\u201d into Energy to Make Nuclear \u201cRenewable\u201d\n\nDecades of misinformation have mislabeled partially used nuclear fuel as \u201cwaste.\u201d In reality, this stockpile, mischaracterized during the Carter administration, holds trillions of dollars in potential energy if converted to electricity. Experts have long argued that this \u201cwaste\u201d could provide America with clean, carbon-free electricity for hundreds of years.\n\nThe concept of recycling partially used nuclear fuel was recommended to the Biden Administration\u2019s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on multiple occasions, yet that administration took no action. Trump\u2019s orders have established a motivated plan to process this partially used fuel for advanced reactors, which will release this vast, hidden taxpayer asset value while reducing foreign dependency. The challenge will be overcoming the government bureaucracy\u2019s previous \u201cbuild back better\u201d mindset that only wind and solar are \u201crenewable.\u201d\n\nNew Nuclear Test Sites and a New Nuclear Workforce\n\nThe Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) nuclear testing, centered at national labs like Idaho National Laboratory, is facing scrutiny for slow resolutions. Trump\u2019s orders demand a cultural shift by establishing test sites outside labs by July 4, 2026, and ensuring reactors are operational within two years. This urgency will spark competition in the electric power sector, breaking monopolistic inertia. Still, the national lab system\u2019s sluggish reputation could hinder progress unless private sector efficiency drives the process.\n\nA robust nuclear workforce is critical. The US \u201cNuclear Navy\u201d offers a model for rapidly training top-tier nuclear personnel. Trump\u2019s call for private sector-led apprenticeships and education programs mirrors this approach. By empowering industry over government, America can build a top-tier workforce swiftly, fueling reactor deployment and economic growth.\n\nThe Crossroads of Energy Security and National Security\n\nImportantly, even more importantly the executive orders bolster national security by designating nuclear-powered AI data centers and military bases as critical infrastructure. By deploying advanced reactors at DOE and Department of Defense (DOD) sites by 2028 and securing twenty new nuclear export agreements, the U.S. can lead globally. However, anti-nuclear advocates, steeped in decades of fearmongering, will push back by attempting to delay export deals and domestic progress.\n\nTrump\u2019s nuclear revolution is not just a policy shift, it\u2019s a call to action. America stands at a crossroads: embrace advanced nuclear power for affordable, abundant energy or succumb to the inertia of bureaucrats and misinformation. Only one of those roads leads to prosperity and energy security, and America must take it.\n\nAbout the Authors: Tommy Waller and Douglas Ellsworth\n\nLt. Col.

Defined according to international standards and national legislation, child labor typically characterizes any work by children under the age of 12, and excessive or risky work by 12\u201317 year-olds (see Section 2.1.1). 2020 data from the International Labor Organization (ILO) documented 160 million child workers worldwide\u20149.6% of all 5\u201317 year-old children [1]. Strikingly, that figure was over 2-fold in Sub-Saharan Africa (23.9%). In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the setting of our study, 15% of the cocoa industry employees that year were children [2].\n\nWhile such figures have mobilized massive global attention and resources to combat child labor, a key challenge in interpreting them is reliability. This is because while official statistics on child labor are essentially based on adult reports (see Section 2.1.1), there are many reasons why parents or caregivers may fail to truthfully disclose children in employment. They might fear that admitting to child labor (e.g., that their under-12 year-old children help during the harvest season) could lead them to face legal action from child protective services, or adversely impact their livelihoods (e.g., if the companies sourcing from them are punished for child labor in their supply chain, which could trickle down to lower prices or even to discontinuation of their income; see [3]). Importantly, if parents omit children in employment, child labor will be under-estimated in the data\u2014since child labor is contained in children in employment.\n\nThis paper uses novel data from a cocoa certifier in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to overcome this challenge. ENVERITAS, a global NGO that certifies smallholder coffee and cocoa farms when it comes to agricultural best practices\u2014including the absence of child labor \u2013, draws on satellite imagery to minimize under-reporting. Concretely, aerial photos allow them (1) to select remote and hard-to-reach communities, where parents typically have not been sensitized by government or NGO campaigns to discourage child labor, averting social desirability biases; and (2) to visit these communities during harvest season, precisely when child labor is very visible, making it easier for enumerators to mark it as present even if parents still fail to report it. We compare their figures with those obtained from business-as-usual surveys with parents and children in these regions, which partially overlap with the remote villages where ENVERITAS certifies farming practices. Our sample focuses on primary school children, nearly all under 12 years old\u2014for whom any hours in employment are classified as child labor by national legislation.\n\nBefore turning to the certifier data, we start by documenting patterns in reporting discrepancies in our own surveys that lend credibility to our empirical strategy. Restricting attention to households in our sample with valid GPS location data, 29.3% of adults admit that their children worked at least an hour in cocoa fields in the month before the survey. In contrast, 51.8% of children report that they did so\u2014a striking 77% average difference in reporting rates. First, we document that such discrepancies indeed decrease with the distance from each household to the school their children attend: the difference between children\u2019s and parents\u2019 reports decrease significantly with every additional km from the school, consistent with ENVERITAS\u2019s claim that village remoteness is inversely related to reporting biases. Second, we estimate that children\u2019s self-reports do not increase with distance from the school, minimizing concerns with child labor in more remote villages misrepresenting its typical prevalence. We further document that not only are discrepancies between children\u2019s and parents\u2019 reports much lower when it comes to domestic work\u2014a more socially acceptable activity and typically not the subject of advocacy campaigns, in contrast to labor in cocoa fields \u2013, but also, that such discrepancies do not decrease with household remoteness. All in all, results back up the certifiers\u2019 sampling strategy as a way of measuring the ground truth for the prevalence of child labor, which we can then use to validate parents\u2019 and children\u2019s reports in the sub-sample for which the two datasets overlap.\n\nOur main contribution is to document first-hand that adult surveys indeed under-report the prevalence of child labor, and the extent of under-reporting. In regions with subsequent third-party verification, 45.5% of children reported having worked in cocoa plantations in the previous month, matching almost exactly the 47.8% prevalence indicated by the certifier; in contrast, only 16.2% of parents in those regions reported children in employment\u2014a nearly 2/3 reporting gap. Across regions, under-reporting ranged from 60% to 85%.\n\nPrevious studies were not able to document the extent of under-reporting by parents. These papers rely on three types of comparisons. First, comparisons between parents\u2019 reports under different conditions for social desirability bias [e.g., 4], to document that such biases exist\u2014but unable to pin down their magnitude. Second, comparisons between adults\u2019 and children\u2019s reports [5,6], to document that discrepancies exist\u2014but unable to pin down what the \u2018ground truth\u2019 is. Third, comparisons between an objective measure of children in employment and children\u2019s self-reports [7], to document that the latter are accurate\u2014but unable to pin down under-reporting by parents. Similarly to ours, the latter study documents that children accurately report the number of hours they work, using logs from GPS trackers worn by different household members to verify data from surveys and activity diaries. The study, however, actively refrained from having enumerators ask adults about child labor. In the absence of parents\u2019 reports, it could not document whether parents under-report children in employment and, if so, by how much.\n\nOur second contribution is to document that basing child labor accounts on surveys with parents not only underestimates its prevalence, but can also bias evaluations of how it responds to policy interventions. Taking advantage of a randomized control trial that assigned some Ivorian parents to messages discouraging child labor in cocoa fields to study whether the estimated impact of the intervention on child labor depends on how the latter is measured, we find that while messages had no effect on children in employment according to children themselves, they significantly increased children in employment according to parents (by 55.1%). Presumably, the reason for such discrepancy is that the intervention tried to foster investments in children that would reduce children\u2019s participation in labor activities without explicitly condemning child labor\u2014partially deterring social desirability biases. Once again consistent with the claim that such biases are stronger in communities that have been previously sensitized, treatment effects on child labor according to parents sharply decay with our measure of remoteness.\n\nThese findings have key implications for how child labor should be measured. One possibility is to survey children directly (the \u2018who\u2019). Our results indicate that this would most likely yield accurate estimates of children in employment, but it might also involve complex technical and ethical dilemmas. It might be hard to ensure a unified understanding of what characterizes employment, especially among younger respondents. Most importantly, participation might put children at risk if it triggers backlash by parents. An alternative is to survey adults, as usual, but to focus on hard-to-reach communities (the \u2018where\u2019) during harvest season (the \u2018when\u2019)\u2014leveraging technological advances such as satellite imagery. We further discuss the implications and limitations of our findings in Section 4.", "Summary": "This academic paper analyzes child labor in the cocoa industry.

Musk\u2019s vision for Open AI faces new threats: Musk originally launched xAI to counter Big Tech\u2019s closed AI systems with a more \u2018truth-seeking\u2019 approach. Now that vision is vulnerable to political grudges, not just market forces.\n\nMusk originally launched xAI to counter Big Tech\u2019s closed AI systems with a more \u2018truth-seeking\u2019 approach. Now that vision is vulnerable to political grudges, not just market forces. Politics are becoming a bottleneck for innovation: As AI becomes critical infrastructure, its future increasingly depends on political favor. xAI shows how quickly open innovation can become collateral in a power struggle.\n\nWhen Elon Musk launched xAI, he promised a future where AI wouldn\u2019t be controlled by a handful of corporate giants. He talked about building a safer, more transparent, and open-source alternative to OpenAI.\n\nBut now, Musk\u2019s big plans may run into a political buzzsaw with an old name and a renewed grip on power: President Donald Trump.\n\nThis week, reports surfaced that xAI is trying to raise $5B in debt financing to ramp up its infrastructure and compete with the likes of OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n\nThe money would go toward building supercomputers and training massive language models.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: this kind of funding usually depends on more than just investor excitement. It often involves government contracts, partnerships, and regulatory green lights.\n\nAnd Trump might not be in the mood to play nice with Musk.\n\nThat\u2019s not just gossip. That\u2019s a financial risk.\n\nForget the Feud \u2013 This Is About Financing\n\nThe media loves a Musk vs. Trump story.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of material: Musk\u2019s not-so-subtle jabs at Trump, Trump\u2019s comments about Elon being \u2018a liberal\u2019 when it suits him, the weird friendship-turned-friction that played out across X.\n\nBut beneath the memes and soundbites is a serious issue for xAI: politics can now choke off tech innovation, especially when egos are involved.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s companies thrive on public-private relationships. Tesla benefited from massive government subsidies. SpaceX has NASA contracts. Starlink is practically a life-or-death utility in some parts of the world.\n\nEven xAI, which Musk presents as independent, would be affected by national AI strategies, GPU export regulations, and possible government partnerships.\n\nIf Trump sees xAI as part of Musk\u2019s broader empire \u2013 or worse, a political rival \u2013 he has ways to make life harder.\n\nA delayed export license here, a denied federal AI grant there, a tax incentive that quietly disappears. These aren\u2019t hypotheticals. Trump has used these levers of government to punish perceived enemies before.\n\nTrump vs. Biden on Tech: A Quick Recap\n\nTo understand the threat, it helps to look at how Trump and Biden differ on tech policy.\n\nBiden\u2019s administration took a structured approach.\n\nA sweeping 2023 Executive Order laid out AI safety rules, the CHIPS Act pumped billions into AI and chip research, and 2024 guidance told agencies to stop tossing AI into public systems without oversight.\n\nWhile not publicly waving the open-source flag, the Biden White House quietly backed it \u2013 with research grants, calls for transparency, and pressure on Big Tech\u2019s closed ecosystems.\n\nTrump, by contrast, ran tech policy on impulse.\n\nHe didn\u2019t offer an AI roadmap but acted fast when politics got personal. He clashed with Amazon, tried to force a TikTok sale, and blocked foreign deals in the name of national security.\n\nHis \u2018America First\u2019 stance made life harder for U.S. firms operating globally. Now that he\u2019s back in office, the same instincts may return \u2013 with a sharper edge.\n\nWith Musk no longer in his good graces, xAI might find itself squarely in the blast radius.\n\nInside the $5B Bet: Why xAI Needs the Money\n\nSo what exactly is this $5B Musk is chasing \u2013 and why is it such a big deal?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a typical Silicon Valley raise. xAI is pursuing convertible debt \u2013 essentially a loan that can later convert into equity if things go well. It\u2019s a financing move that gives investors a path to future ownership without betting on today\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlongside this, Musk\u2019s companies are exploring a $300M secondary share sale that would value xAI at a staggering $113B.\n\nBut the political feud has spooked some investors. Early demand was strong, but the price of xAI\u2019s debt has reportedly slipped from 99 cents to 95 cents on the dollar, and yields have begun to climb.\n\nThat\u2019s a clear sign that political noise is bleeding into financial risk.\n\nThe money isn\u2019t for marketing or headcount. It\u2019s for serious infrastructure. xAI wants to build custom data centers designed to run massive language models \u2013 the kind that eat GPUs for breakfast.\n\nxAI has purchased a warehouse and land off Tulane Road, Memphis to build data centers.\n\nSource: Google Maps\n\nThese aren\u2019t rented AWS servers. They\u2019re physical, high-performance facilities meant to match the scale and speed of rivals like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.\n\nThis kind of ambition is expensive. Training state-of-the-art models can cost hundreds of millions \u2013 and that\u2019s before the electricity bill.\n\nIn the current AI arms race, having a good idea isn\u2019t enough. You need hardware, access, and deep pockets.\n\nBut raising that kind of money puts xAI at the mercy of financial markets \u2013 and potentially, political ones. If Trump\u2019s White House starts tightening the screws, even the best-laid technical roadmap could hit a wall.\n\nWhat Happens If the Deal Falls Through?\n\nIf xAI fails to land the $5B, it\u2019s not just a delay \u2013 it\u2019s a serious roadblock.\n\nThe company\u2019s goal of building competitive, open-source AI models depends on vast compute resources. Without the money, xAI could fall behind in both scale and speed. That wouldn\u2019t just hurt Musk. It would stall one of the few efforts aiming to keep AI development from becoming fully corporate and closed-door.\n\nGrok, xAI\u2019s chatbot, may not be fully open-source, but it\u2019s marketed as a more open, independent alternative to the Big Tech models. Losing that alternative would narrow the playing field.\n\nIn a world where most frontier AI development is bankrolled by the world\u2019s biggest corporations and steered by government alliances, losing xAI\u2019s vision to politics would send a grim message: openness doesn\u2019t scale unless power approves.\n\nAnd if that becomes the new normal, it won\u2019t stop at Musk. It\u2019s a blow to the whole idea of open and decentralized AI.\n\nOpen-Source AI Needs Protection From Politics\n\nThe irony here runs deep.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018, officially due to conflicts with Tesla\u2019s AI work \u2014 but he\u2019s since accused the company of drifting toward closed, profit-driven models, especially after its partnership with Microsoft and shift to a for-profit structure. That, in his view, was a betrayal of OpenAI\u2019s original mission.\n\nIn 2023, he founded xAI with a different promise: to build \u2018truth-seeking\u2019 AI and push back against what he described as Big Tech\u2019s growing control over artificial intelligence.\n\nBut now, those ideals are under threat \u2013 not from market failure or lack of demand, but from political friction and personal grudges. And that should concern anyone who believes AI innovation shouldn\u2019t hinge on which billionaires get along with which presidents.\n\nImagine if Linux developers had to worry about presidential approval before pushing a kernel update. Or if Python\u2019s core library needed sign-off from a national security office. Absurd, right? But that\u2019s not far off from where we\u2019re headed as foundational AI becomes deeply entangled in geopolitics, regulation, and personality-driven policymaking.\n\nAI is becoming critical infrastructure. That means it can be steered, blocked, or co-opted by governments. And if Trump sees AI as a strategic asset \u2013 or a threat \u2013 he may treat companies like xAI the way he treated TikTok or Huawei: comply or be sidelined.\n\nMusk\u2019s Political Risk Problem\n\nThere\u2019s also a bigger pattern here. Musk is a man of many companies and few filters. That worked well when government contracts were being handed out and he was the darling of innovation.\n\nBut as his political commentary has gotten louder, the backlash is catching up.\n\nTesla is under increased scrutiny, with federal investigations into its Autopilot system and high-profile safety recalls. SpaceX has faced FAA regulatory delays, particularly with Starship launches.\n\nStarlink has drawn foreign policy concerns too \u2013 especially after Musk\u2019s role in Ukraine\u2019s military communications raised alarms in Washington and Europe.\n\nStarlink terminal in Donetsk, Ukraine.\n\nImage by Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nNow, xAI faces the same kind of vulnerability, with its future tied not just to tech milestones, but to political favor.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about whether Musk is right or wrong politically. It\u2019s about whether one man\u2019s social media posts can jeopardize multibillion-dollar tech ventures. The answer, increasingly, is yes.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nIf xAI pulls off the debt deal anyway, it would be a win for Musk and a sign that private capital still believes in the mission. But if the deal stalls or gets downsized, don\u2019t just blame interest rates or the economy. Blame politics.\n\nWe\u2019re entering an era where innovation doesn\u2019t just compete with other companies. It competes with political whims.\n\nThat\u2019s a dangerous precedent.\n\nBecause today it\u2019s Musk and xAI. Tomorrow it could be any startup that dares to challenge the status quo \u2013 or pisses off the wrong president.\n\nOnline Tech Tips, Help Desk Geek, Framework, Insta360, Redmagic, Inmotion, Secretlab, Kodak, and Anker, reviewing their products in real-life scenarios.

It aims to \u201cconnect people to nature, to each other, and to a lifestyle that prioritizes holistic well-being, starting with access to fresh, local produce,\u201d says Amy Peterson, Serenbe's community operations and relationships manager. Ten to 20 residents volunteer each week, growing vegetables, fruit, flowers, and herbs.\n\nMary Collins-Shepard spends her days sowing seeds in a greenhouse, transplanting seedlings, and organizing produce at Serenbe. \u201cEngaging with my neighbors at the farm is energizing, but the time can also be very meditative if I happen to be working alone,\u201d says the 67 year old, who moved to the agrihood outside Atlanta from Knoxville, TN, with her husband seven years ago.\n\nThe produce she helps grow and harvest goes into Serenbe's CSA system, Saturday farmer's market, and farm-to-table restaurants\u2014efforts that benefit not only her but also her neighbors.\n\nSome homes for people with developmental challenges have similar setups, such as Camphill North America community living programs, which serve people with autism, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and other conditions. Residents at Camphill Hudson in New York, for example, eat the produce they grow. Former president Tim Paholak has been involved since 1976 and calls the program life-changing: \u201cDeveloping community is a vital component of human health for all of us.\u201d\n\nBrain Benefits\n\nDemetrius M. Maraganore, MD, FAAN, professor and chair of the department of neurology at Tulane University School of Medicine and co-director of the Healthy Brain Aging Initiative at University Medical Center of New Orleans, says farm-centric living fits nicely into Healthy Brain's mission to prevent cognitive decline and dementia with evidence-based lifestyle and behavioral interventions.\n\n\u201cMy father developed Alzheimer's disease, and so did his mother and her mother,\u201d says Dr. Maraganore. \u201cI thought, \u2018How can I prevent this? We need to change our lifestyle and habits.\u2019 \u2026 My passion is to harness nutrition to develop treatments for Alzheimer's. We now have the opportunity to prevent it.\u201d\n\nHe stands by a Mediterranean-style diet, which usually includes lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, with olive oil as a primary fat source and dairy products, eggs, fish, and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts. It centers on minimally processed, plant-based foods and limits sugar, fried food, refined carbohydrates, and saturated fats.\n\nNikolaos Scarmeas, MD, PhD, of the department of neurology at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece and Columbia University, said by email that a \u201cMediterranean-like diet\u201d has \u201cthe most scientific support regarding less risk for cognitive decline and dementia.\u201d It can improve blood flow and circulation in the brain and promote better overall cardiovascular health, Dr. Maraganore adds.\n\nA review of 64 studies by Tulane's Healthy Brain Aging Initiative team in 2022 found that the Mediterranean diet can help promote gut health, which may be neuroprotective, and was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The researchers also found that the diet's nutrient-dense and fiber-rich foods (compared to the typical low-fiber Western diet) may be beneficial for not only overall health but also healthy brain aging.\n\nNot everyone can easily access these foods, Dr. Maraganore points out, especially if they live in a \u201cfood desert,\u201d an area with limited access to fresh, affordable, and nutritious food. This makes moving to agrihoods appealing. With farm-grown produce, he says, \u201cyou can stick closer to a good diet.\u201d\n\nSunshine also provides vitamin D, an anti-inflammatory; not having enough vitamin D is a risk factor for Parkinson's, stroke, and Alzheimer's, says Dr. Maraganore, who points out other agrihood benefits, too: \u201cThe community involvement and socialization in a farm venture can keep aging brain cells from dying and reduce dementia and anxiety.\u201d\n\nLearn More\n\nFor farm-to-table recipes with fresh, seasonal ingredients, visit Brain & Life's Nutrition page.", "Summary": "This article features Demetrius M.

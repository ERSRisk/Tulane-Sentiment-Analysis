        "Summary": "This article discusses a study on how search engines and chatbots reinforce users' existing beliefs.  Eugina Leung, an assistant professor at Tulane University and the lead author of the study, is quoted extensively.  The article highlights Leung's research and expertise, thus portraying Tulane positively.",
        "Content": "That chatbot is only telling you what you want to believe, according to a new study.\n\nWhether you're using a traditional search engine like Google or a conversational tool like OpenAI's ChatGPT, you tend to use terms that reflect your biases and perceptions, according to the study, published this spring in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. More importantly, search engines and chatbots often provide results that reinforce those beliefs, even if your intent is to learn more about the topic.\n\nFor example, imagine you're trying to learn about the health effects of drinking coffee every day. If you, like me, enjoy having exactly two cups of joe first thing in the morning, you may search for something like \"is coffee healthy?\" or \"health benefits of coffee.\" If you're already skeptical (maybe a tea purist), you might search for \"is coffee bad for you?\" instead. The researchers found that framing of questions could skew the results -- I'd mostly get answers that show the benefits of coffee, while you'd get the opposite.\n\n\"When people look up information, whether it's Google or ChatGPT, they actually use search terms that reflect what they already believe,\" Eugina Leung, an assistant professor at Tulane University and lead author of the study, told me.\n\nThe abundance of AI chatbots, and the confident and customized results they so freely give you, makes it easier to fall down a rabbit hole and harder to realize you're in it. There's never been a more important time to think deeply about how you get information online.\n\nThe question is: How do you get the best answers?\n\nAsking the wrong questions\n\nThe researchers conducted 21 studies with nearly 10,000 participants who were asked to conduct searches on certain preselected topics, including the health effects of caffeine, gas prices, crime rates, COVID-19 and nuclear energy. The search engines and tools used included Google, ChatGPT and custom-designed search engines and AI chatbots.\n\nThe researchers' results showed that what they called the \"narrow search effect\" was a function of both how people asked questions and how the tech platforms responded. People have a habit, in essence, of asking the wrong questions (or asking questions in the wrong way). They tended to use search terms or AI prompts that demonstrated what they already thought, and search engines and chatbots designed to provide narrow, extremely relevant answers, delivered on those answers. \"The answers end up basically just confirming what they believe in the first place,\" Leung said.\n\nRead more: AI Essentials: 29 Ways to Make Gen AI Work for You, According to Our Experts\n\nThe researchers also checked to see if participants changed their beliefs after conducting a search. When served a narrow selection of answers that largely confirmed their beliefs, they were unlikely to see significant changes. But when the researchers provided a custom-built search engine and chatbot designed to offer a broader array of answers, they were more likely to change.\n\nLeung said platforms could provide users with the option of a broader, less tailored search, which could prove helpful in situations where the user is trying to find a wider variety of sources. \"Our research is not trying to suggest that search engines or algorithms should always broaden their search results,\" she said. \"I do think there is a lot of value in providing very focused and very narrow search results in certain situations.\"\n\n3 ways to ask the right questions\n\nIf you want a broader array of answers to your questions, there are some things you can do, Leung said.\n\nBe precise: Think specifically about what exactly it is you're trying to learn. Leung used an example of trying to decide if you want to invest in a particular company's stock. Asking if it's a good stock or a bad stock to buy will likely skew your results -- more positive news if you ask if it's good, more negative news if you ask if it's bad. Instead, try a single, more neutral search term. Or ask both terms and evaluate the results of each.\n\nGet other views: Especially with an AI chatbot, you can ask for a broad range of perspectives directly in the prompt. If you want to know if you should keep drinking two cups of coffee a day, ask the chatbot for a variety of opinions and the evidence behind them. The researchers tried this in one of their experiments and found they got more variety in results. \"We asked ChatGPT to provide different perspectives to answer the query from the participants and to provide as much evidence to back up those claims as possible,\" Leung said.\n\nAt some point, stop asking: Follow-up questions didn't work quite as well, Leung said. If those questions aren't getting broader answers, you may get the opposite effect -- even more narrow, affirming results. In many cases, people who asked lots of follow-up questions just \"fell deeper down into the rabbit hole,\" she said.",

        "Summary": "This article discusses the death of Jonathan Mayers, a co-founder of several music festivals.  It mentions that Mayers graduated from Tulane University in 1995. This is a brief, neutral mention of Tulane.",
        "Content": "Jonathan Mayers, a co-founder of Superfly Entertainment who also served as a co-founder of game-changing music festivals like Bonnaroo and Outside Lands, has died, Billboard and a Bonnaroo representative confirmed to Pitchfork He was 51.\n\nAfter growing up a short drive from New York and graduating from Tulane University, in 1995, Mayers immersed himself in the music world through work at the storied New Orleans institutions Tipitina\u2019s and Jazz Fest. In 1996, he co-founded the promotion company Superfly Entertainment with Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone, and Kerry Black. The group organized its first concert\u2014the Meters, Maceo Parker, and Rebirth Brass Band\u2014during Mardi Gras, before setting sights on bigger ideas.\n\nIn 2002, Mayers and his Superfly coworkers launched the inaugural Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, in Manchester, Tennessee. They sought out an open expanse of land on a farm an hour outside of Nashville, and booked headliners Trey Anastasio (of Phish) and Phil Lesh and Bob Weir (of Grateful Dead) to top the bill. The four co-founders partnered with promoter Ashley Capps of AC Entertainment, agent Chip Hooper of Paradigm Talent Agency, and manager Coran Capshaw of Red Light Management, and the rest was history. The first-ever Bonnaroo sold out, and the 70,000-person capacity festival would go on to become a recurring success. In a few years\u2019 time, Bonnaroo would not only inspire dozens of music festivals across America, but also serve as the blueprint for how to rethink music festivals in the modern era under tighter restrictions compared to the Woodstock era.\n\nJust a few years later, Superfly started Vegoose, an annual Halloween music and arts festival, with multi-venue programming across Las Vegas in 2005. Mayers partnered with San Francisco\u2019s Another Planet Entertainment to launch Outside Lands, in Golden Gate Park, in 2008. That multi-genre, multi-day music festival grew to become the largest independently owned music festival in the United States.\n\nIn addition to starting other events around the country, like the comedy-focused festival Clusterfest in San Francisco in 2017, Mayers also turned his attention toward film and TV rights holders to start immersive experiences for fans. By licensing rights from popular shows like Friends, Seinfeld, The Office, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and more, Mayers and his team recreated TV sets in various cities that allowed fans to \u201cstep inside\u201d their favorite series.\n\nIn August 2021, Superfly terminated Mayers\u2019 position at the company following internal disagreements with the three other co-founders of the entertainment company. The next year, Mayers sued Farman, Goodstone, and Black, accusing them of civil misrepresentation, breach of contract, and fraud over the underestimated value of his shares in Superfly. In January 2023, a New York judge dismissed the lawsuit. Mayers went on to focus on Core City Detroit, a new project investing in a music campus for local artists that also could host public events.",

        "Published": "2025-06-05T16:04:39Z",
        "Summary": "This article discusses President Trump's executive orders on nuclear energy.  Lt. Col. Tommy Waller, President & CEO of the Center for Security Policy, is mentioned as having a B.A. in International Relations from Tulane University. This is a positive mention of Tulane.",
        "Content": "Reliable and affordable energy must overcome bureaucratic resistance.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s four executive orders on nuclear energy, issued on May 23, 2025, are blazing a bold path to an energy future where electricity will be more reliable and more economical.\n\nBy unleashing advanced nuclear technologies, streamlining regulations, and bolstering the domestic nuclear industry, these orders aim to deliver 400 gigawatts of clean, reliable power by 2050 \u2013 a quadrupling of current capacity. This vision promises energy independence, economic prosperity, and national security. Yet, entrenched anti-prosperity bureaucrats, timid politicians, and a misinformed public, swayed by decades of anti-nuclear propaganda, stand ready to obstruct this transformative agenda. America must address these obstacles in order to reclaim its leadership in the field of nuclear energy.\n\nOverhaul of the Nuclear Overseers\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which was formed after the dismemberment of the Atomic Energy Commission, has long served as a choke point for nuclear progress. The NRC was designed from the get-go to follow the agenda of anti-nuclear advocates, and consequently, it has licensed only two reactors since 1978, stifling innovation. Trump\u2019s orders demand a sweeping overhaul, capping exorbitant NRC fees and mandating licensing decisions within eighteen months. This aggressive reform dismantles barriers, but bureaucrats accustomed to sluggish processes will resist, clinging to technologically outdated risk-averse frameworks.\n\nAmerica\u2019s existing nuclear fleet\u2014light water and pressurized water reactors\u2014boasts the best safety record of any industry in America. Advanced nuclear designs, like small modular reactors, microreactors and Generation IV systems, push safety even further, with designs able to operate reliably even without human intervention. Trump\u2019s orders prioritize the deployment of these advanced designs, targeting five gigawatts of \u201cpower uprates\u201d (increasing the electricity output of existing reactors) and ten large new reactors by 2030. Yet, detractors will cry \u201cimpossible,\u201d and claim that government staff reductions, as ordered for the NRC, will compromise safety. In reality, NRC had more than enough staff and time to address a legitimate petition involving safety with respect to cooling spent nuclear fuel pools, choosing to instead to deny it. Given this track record, the public interest will be better served by a leaner and more focused regulator that puts the onus of safety and liability squarely on the industry.\n\nTurning Mislabeled \u201cWaste\u201d into Energy to Make Nuclear \u201cRenewable\u201d\n\nDecades of misinformation have mislabeled partially used nuclear fuel as \u201cwaste.\u201d In reality, this stockpile, mischaracterized during the Carter administration, holds trillions of dollars in potential energy if converted to electricity. Experts have long argued that this \u201cwaste\u201d could provide America with clean, carbon-free electricity for hundreds of years.\n\nThe concept of recycling partially used nuclear fuel was recommended to the Biden Administration\u2019s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on multiple occasions, yet that administration took no action. Trump\u2019s orders have established a motivated plan to process this partially used fuel for advanced reactors, which will release this vast, hidden taxpayer asset value while reducing foreign dependency. The challenge will be overcoming the government bureaucracy\u2019s previous \u201cbuild back better\u201d mindset that only wind and solar are \u201crenewable.\u201d\n\nNew Nuclear Test Sites and a New Nuclear Workforce\n\nThe Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) nuclear testing, centered at national labs like Idaho National Laboratory, is facing scrutiny for slow resolutions. Trump\u2019s orders demand a cultural shift by establishing test sites outside labs by July 4, 2026, and ensuring reactors are operational within two years. This urgency will spark competition in the electric power sector, breaking monopolistic inertia. Still, the national lab system\u2019s sluggish reputation could hinder progress unless private sector efficiency drives the process.\n\nA robust nuclear workforce is critical. The US \u201cNuclear Navy\u201d offers a model for rapidly training top-tier nuclear personnel. Trump\u2019s call for private sector-led apprenticeships and education programs mirrors this approach. By empowering industry over government, America can build a top-tier workforce swiftly, fueling reactor deployment and economic growth.\n\nThe Crossroads of Energy Security and National Security\n\nImportantly, even more importantly the executive orders bolster national security by designating nuclear-powered AI data centers and military bases as critical infrastructure. By deploying advanced reactors at DOE and Department of Defense (DOD) sites by 2028 and securing twenty new nuclear export agreements, the U.S. can lead globally. However, anti-nuclear advocates, steeped in decades of fearmongering, will push back by attempting to delay export deals and domestic progress.\n\nTrump\u2019s nuclear revolution is not just a policy shift, it\u2019s a call to action. America stands at a crossroads: embrace advanced nuclear power for affordable, abundant energy or succumb to the inertia of bureaucrats and misinformation. Only one of those roads leads to prosperity and energy security, and America must take it.\n\nAbout the Authors: Tommy Waller and Douglas Ellsworth\n\nLt. Col. Tommy Waller is the President & CEO of the nonprofit Center for Security Policy. Waller retired from the U.S. Marines after two decades of service in both active duty and the reserves as an Infantry and Expeditionary Ground Reconnaissance Officer with deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq, Africa, and South America and with cross-assigned service to the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Electromagnetic Defense Task Force (EDTF). His formal education includes numerous military schools and colleges, a B. A. in International Relations from Tulane University, and executive education from the Wharton School. In addition to running the Center for Security Policy, he also manages the nationwide bipartisan Secure the Grid Coalition.\n\nDouglas Ellsworth is a Senior Fellow at the Center for Security Policy and serves as the Co-Director of the Center-sponsored Secure the Grid (STG) Coalition \u2014 an ad hoc group of policy, energy, and national security experts, legislators, and industry insiders who are dedicated to strengthening the resilience of America\u2019s electrical grid. Through the support of the Center for Security Policy, the STG Coalition aims to raise awareness about the national security threat of grid vulnerability, and encourage the steps needed to neutralize it. The STG Coalition brings a wide variety of expertise in cybersecurity, physical security, public policy and expressly serves the public interest.

But through offseason programs and OTAs, he is acclimating well.\n\n\"Caleb's doing awesome,\" said defensive backs coach Anthony Perkins. \"We were very excited just during the draft process, we thought based on his skill set what he showed on tape, he'd be able to make that transition and play more at safety and he hasn't disappointed. He's done a tremendous job.\"\n\nIn coverage, Ransaw was stingy during his college career, allowing a completion rate of just 49% over the last two seasons with one interception and three pass breakups. He's also been a very reliable tackler.\n\nRansaw also brings a lot of speed to the defensive backfield, running a 4.33-second 40 during the pre-draft process.\n\nWith Eric Murray, we could see Ransaw tasked with more often being the strong safety within this defense, which would still position him closer to the line of scrimmage, where the bulk of his playing time has come.\n\nHowever, in Anthony Campanile's malleable defensive scheme, versatility and the ability to move players around will be important elements, which could lead to Ransaw filling a few different roles.\n\n\"Every day's a new day, every rep is a new rep, so he's learning,\" added Perkins. \"All those safeties are learning, but he's doing a tremendous job of picking it up. I think he's super athletic. I think he's got a very high ceiling in this league, and I'm excited to continue to see him grow within the scheme of our defense.\"\n\nAlong with Ransaw, Darnell Savage, Antonio Johnson, and Andrew Wingard are competing for playing time next to Murray as well.",

He was 51.\n\nBonnaroo started in 2002, and the 2025 edition is set to begin in Manchester, Tennessee, this week on Thursday, June 12.\n\nNo cause of death has yet been announced.\n\nIn a statement to Billboard, Red Light Management founder Coran Capshaw said: \u201cThis is incredibly tough news for so many of us. Jon was the creative force behind so much of what people experience at Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, and many other events over the years. We\u2019re all really going to miss him.\u201d\n\nMayers graduated in 1995 from Tulane University in New Orleans, where he became interested in concert promotion through his work at legendary local venue Tipitina\u2019s and the city\u2019s long-running Jazz Fest.\n\nThe following year, he co-founded Superfly with partners Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone and Kerry Black, and the fledgling promotions company hosted their first concert during Mardi Gras.\n\nThe four worked together to launch Bonnaroo in 2002 after securing the festival site on farmland in Manchester, an hour outside of Nashville. They worked closely with Capshaw\u2019s Red Light Management and other industry figures to book headliners, including the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh and Bob Weir.\n\nIn 2008, Mayers partnered with Another Planet Entertainment to create the Outside Lands festival in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park.\n\nAs well as music festivals, Mayers also partnered with television shows to create \u201cimmersive\u201d fan experiences based on series including Friends, Seinfeld, The Office, South Park, Arrested Development, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and The Daily Show.\n\nMayers left Superfly acrimoniously in 2021, and the following year sued his former partners Farman, Goodstone and Black, accusing them of civil misrepresentation, breach of contract and fraud. Mayers alleged that they had misrepresented the value of his shares in the promotions company. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2023.\n\nSuperfly said in a statement to Billboard: \u201cWe are heartbroken with the passing of Jonathan. He was a cherished part of Superfly\u2019s story, woven into it\u2019s history and legacy. In addition to the role he\u2019s played in bringing joy to millions, we will miss his razor sharp wit, infectious smile and contagious laugh. No one could light up a room like Jon.\u201d\n\nIn the years following his departure from Superfly, Mayers worked on the Core City Detroit project to raise money for the city\u2019s regeneration.\n\nThis year\u2019s Bonnaroo will see headline performances from the likes of Tyler, the Creator, Olivia Rodrigo and Hozier.\n\nDayglo Presents founder Peter Shapiro said in a statement that contemporary festivals owe a debt to Mayers\u2019s work behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cJonathan was one of the true real visionaries of the modern concert world and one of the core minds behind Bonnaroo,\u201d Shapiro told Billboard. \u201cModern-day festivals are all in some way built off of his vision.\u201d",

        "Summary": "This academic paper analyzes child labor in the cocoa industry. There is no mention of Tulane in this article.",
        "Content": "Measuring child labor accurately is a major challenge: parents\u2019 and children\u2019s reports tend to differ dramatically, and there is typically no way to verify whose reports are truthful (if any). To overcome this challenge, this paper uses novel data from a cocoa certifier in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire that draws on satellite imagery to minimize under-reporting. Concretely, aerial photos allow them to select remote and hard-to-reach communities\u2014where parents typically have not been sensitized by government or NGOs, averting social desirability biases\u2014and to visit these communities while cocoa is being harvested\u2014precisely when children in employment are very visible, making it easier for enumerators to impute it if parents still fail to report it. We compare their figures with those obtained from business-as-usual surveys with parents and children in these regions, and find that (1) reporting inconsistencies between parents and their children in fact decrease with household remoteness; (2) adults dramatically under-report child labor relative to the certifier data, by a factor of at least 60%; and (3) in turn, children self-reports are statistically identical to the latter. Taking advantage of an experiment that randomly assigned a text-message campaign to discourage child labor, we further show that parents\u2019 reports not only underestimate its prevalence, but can even lead to the wrong conclusions about the effects of policy interventions.\n\nFunding: Study conducted in partnership with Transforming Education in Cocoa Communities (TRECC) and generously funded by the Jacobs Foundation Science of Learning initiative. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Any views and opinions contained in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of TRECC or the Jacobs Foundation.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nChild labor is a pervasive practice in agriculture, especially in West Africa, where the global cocoa industry sources roughly half of its produce. Defined according to international standards and national legislation, child labor typically characterizes any work by children under the age of 12, and excessive or risky work by 12\u201317 year-olds (see Section 2.1.1). 2020 data from the International Labor Organization (ILO) documented 160 million child workers worldwide\u20149.6% of all 5\u201317 year-old children [1]. Strikingly, that figure was over 2-fold in Sub-Saharan Africa (23.9%). In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the setting of our study, 15% of the cocoa industry employees that year were children [2].\n\nWhile such figures have mobilized massive global attention and resources to combat child labor, a key challenge in interpreting them is reliability. This is because while official statistics on child labor are essentially based on adult reports (see Section 2.1.1), there are many reasons why parents or caregivers may fail to truthfully disclose children in employment. They might fear that admitting to child labor (e.g., that their under-12 year-old children help during the harvest season) could lead them to face legal action from child protective services, or adversely impact their livelihoods (e.g., if the companies sourcing from them are punished for child labor in their supply chain, which could trickle down to lower prices or even to discontinuation of their income; see [3]). Importantly, if parents omit children in employment, child labor will be under-estimated in the data\u2014since child labor is contained in children in employment.\n\nThis paper uses novel data from a cocoa certifier in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to overcome this challenge. ENVERITAS, a global NGO that certifies smallholder coffee and cocoa farms when it comes to agricultural best practices\u2014including the absence of child labor \u2013, draws on satellite imagery to minimize under-reporting. Concretely, aerial photos allow them (1) to select remote and hard-to-reach communities, where parents typically have not been sensitized by government or NGO campaigns to discourage child labor, averting social desirability biases; and (2) to visit these communities during harvest season, precisely when child labor is very visible, making it easier for enumerators to mark it as present even if parents still fail to report it. We compare their figures with those obtained from business-as-usual surveys with parents and children in these regions, which partially overlap with the remote villages where ENVERITAS certifies farming practices. Our sample focuses on primary school children, nearly all under 12 years old\u2014for whom any hours in employment are classified as child labor by national legislation.\n\nBefore turning to the certifier data, we start by documenting patterns in reporting discrepancies in our own surveys that lend credibility to our empirical strategy. Restricting attention to households in our sample with valid GPS location data, 29.3% of adults admit that their children worked at least an hour in cocoa fields in the month before the survey. In contrast, 51.8% of children report that they did so\u2014a striking 77% average difference in reporting rates. First, we document that such discrepancies indeed decrease with the distance from each household to the school their children attend: the difference between children\u2019s and parents\u2019 reports decrease significantly with every additional km from the school, consistent with ENVERITAS\u2019s claim that village remoteness is inversely related to reporting biases. Second, we estimate that children\u2019s self-reports do not increase with distance from the school, minimizing concerns with child labor in more remote villages misrepresenting its typical prevalence. We further document that not only are discrepancies between children\u2019s and parents\u2019 reports much lower when it comes to domestic work\u2014a more socially acceptable activity and typically not the subject of advocacy campaigns, in contrast to labor in cocoa fields \u2013, but also, that such discrepancies do not decrease with household remoteness. All in all, results back up the certifiers\u2019 sampling strategy as a way of measuring the ground truth for the prevalence of child labor, which we can then use to validate parents\u2019 and children\u2019s reports in the sub-sample for which the two datasets overlap.\n\nOur main contribution is to document first-hand that adult surveys indeed under-report the prevalence of child labor, and the extent of under-reporting. In regions with subsequent third-party verification, 45.5% of children reported having worked in cocoa plantations in the previous month, matching almost exactly the 47.8% prevalence indicated by the certifier; in contrast, only 16.2% of parents in those regions reported children in employment\u2014a nearly 2/3 reporting gap. Across regions, under-reporting ranged from 60% to 85%.\n\nPrevious studies were not able to document the extent of under-reporting by parents. These papers rely on three types of comparisons. First, comparisons between parents\u2019 reports under different conditions for social desirability bias [e.g., 4], to document that such biases exist\u2014but unable to pin down their magnitude. Second, comparisons between adults\u2019 and children\u2019s reports [5,6], to document that discrepancies exist\u2014but unable to pin down what the \u2018ground truth\u2019 is. Third, comparisons between an objective measure of children in employment and children\u2019s self-reports [7], to document that the latter are accurate\u2014but unable to pin down under-reporting by parents. Similarly to ours, the latter study documents that children accurately report the number of hours they work, using logs from GPS trackers worn by different household members to verify data from surveys and activity diaries. The study, however, actively refrained from having enumerators ask adults about child labor. In the absence of parents\u2019 reports, it could not document whether parents under-report children in employment and, if so, by how much.\n\nOur second contribution is to document that basing child labor accounts on surveys with parents not only underestimates its prevalence, but can also bias evaluations of how it responds to policy interventions. Taking advantage of a randomized control trial that assigned some Ivorian parents to messages discouraging child labor in cocoa fields to study whether the estimated impact of the intervention on child labor depends on how the latter is measured, we find that while messages had no effect on children in employment according to children themselves, they significantly increased children in employment according to parents (by 55.1%). Presumably, the reason for such discrepancy is that the intervention tried to foster investments in children that would reduce children\u2019s participation in labor activities without explicitly condemning child labor\u2014partially deterring social desirability biases. Once again consistent with the claim that such biases are stronger in communities that have been previously sensitized, treatment effects on child labor according to parents sharply decay with our measure of remoteness.\n\nThese findings have key implications for how child labor should be measured. One possibility is to survey children directly (the \u2018who\u2019). Our results indicate that this would most likely yield accurate estimates of children in employment, but it might also involve complex technical and ethical dilemmas. It might be hard to ensure a unified understanding of what characterizes employment, especially among younger respondents. Most importantly, participation might put children at risk if it triggers backlash by parents. An alternative is to survey adults, as usual, but to focus on hard-to-reach communities (the \u2018where\u2019) during harvest season (the \u2018when\u2019)\u2014leveraging technological advances such as satellite imagery. We further discuss the implications and limitations of our findings in Section 4.",

Musk\u2019s vision for Open AI faces new threats: Musk originally launched xAI to counter Big Tech\u2019s closed AI systems with a more \u2018truth-seeking\u2019 approach. Now that vision is vulnerable to political grudges, not just market forces.\n\nMusk originally launched xAI to counter Big Tech\u2019s closed AI systems with a more \u2018truth-seeking\u2019 approach. Now that vision is vulnerable to political grudges, not just market forces. Politics are becoming a bottleneck for innovation: As AI becomes critical infrastructure, its future increasingly depends on political favor. xAI shows how quickly open innovation can become collateral in a power struggle.\n\nWhen Elon Musk launched xAI, he promised a future where AI wouldn\u2019t be controlled by a handful of corporate giants. He talked about building a safer, more transparent, and open-source alternative to OpenAI.\n\nBut now, Musk\u2019s big plans may run into a political buzzsaw with an old name and a renewed grip on power: President Donald Trump.\n\nThis week, reports surfaced that xAI is trying to raise $5B in debt financing to ramp up its infrastructure and compete with the likes of OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n\nThe money would go toward building supercomputers and training massive language models.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: this kind of funding usually depends on more than just investor excitement. It often involves government contracts, partnerships, and regulatory green lights.\n\nAnd Trump might not be in the mood to play nice with Musk.\n\nThat\u2019s not just gossip. That\u2019s a financial risk.\n\nForget the Feud \u2013 This Is About Financing\n\nThe media loves a Musk vs. Trump story.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of material: Musk\u2019s not-so-subtle jabs at Trump, Trump\u2019s comments about Elon being \u2018a liberal\u2019 when it suits him, the weird friendship-turned-friction that played out across X.\n\nBut beneath the memes and soundbites is a serious issue for xAI: politics can now choke off tech innovation, especially when egos are involved.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s companies thrive on public-private relationships. Tesla benefited from massive government subsidies. SpaceX has NASA contracts. Starlink is practically a life-or-death utility in some parts of the world.\n\nEven xAI, which Musk presents as independent, would be affected by national AI strategies, GPU export regulations, and possible government partnerships.\n\nIf Trump sees xAI as part of Musk\u2019s broader empire \u2013 or worse, a political rival \u2013 he has ways to make life harder.\n\nA delayed export license here, a denied federal AI grant there, a tax incentive that quietly disappears. These aren\u2019t hypotheticals. Trump has used these levers of government to punish perceived enemies before.\n\nTrump vs. Biden on Tech: A Quick Recap\n\nTo understand the threat, it helps to look at how Trump and Biden differ on tech policy.\n\nBiden\u2019s administration took a structured approach.\n\nA sweeping 2023 Executive Order laid out AI safety rules, the CHIPS Act pumped billions into AI and chip research, and 2024 guidance told agencies to stop tossing AI into public systems without oversight.\n\nWhile not publicly waving the open-source flag, the Biden White House quietly backed it \u2013 with research grants, calls for transparency, and pressure on Big Tech\u2019s closed ecosystems.\n\nTrump, by contrast, ran tech policy on impulse.\n\nHe didn\u2019t offer an AI roadmap but acted fast when politics got personal. He clashed with Amazon, tried to force a TikTok sale, and blocked foreign deals in the name of national security.\n\nHis \u2018America First\u2019 stance made life harder for U.S. firms operating globally. Now that he\u2019s back in office, the same instincts may return \u2013 with a sharper edge.\n\nWith Musk no longer in his good graces, xAI might find itself squarely in the blast radius.\n\nInside the $5B Bet: Why xAI Needs the Money\n\nSo what exactly is this $5B Musk is chasing \u2013 and why is it such a big deal?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a typical Silicon Valley raise. xAI is pursuing convertible debt \u2013 essentially a loan that can later convert into equity if things go well. It\u2019s a financing move that gives investors a path to future ownership without betting on today\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlongside this, Musk\u2019s companies are exploring a $300M secondary share sale that would value xAI at a staggering $113B.\n\nBut the political feud has spooked some investors. Early demand was strong, but the price of xAI\u2019s debt has reportedly slipped from 99 cents to 95 cents on the dollar, and yields have begun to climb.\n\nThat\u2019s a clear sign that political noise is bleeding into financial risk.\n\nThe money isn\u2019t for marketing or headcount. It\u2019s for serious infrastructure. xAI wants to build custom data centers designed to run massive language models \u2013 the kind that eat GPUs for breakfast.\n\nxAI has purchased a warehouse and land off Tulane Road, Memphis to build data centers.\n\nSource: Google Maps\n\nThese aren\u2019t rented AWS servers. They\u2019re physical, high-performance facilities meant to match the scale and speed of rivals like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.\n\nThis kind of ambition is expensive. Training state-of-the-art models can cost hundreds of millions \u2013 and that\u2019s before the electricity bill.\n\nIn the current AI arms race, having a good idea isn\u2019t enough. You need hardware, access, and deep pockets.\n\nBut raising that kind of money puts xAI at the mercy of financial markets \u2013 and potentially, political ones. If Trump\u2019s White House starts tightening the screws, even the best-laid technical roadmap could hit a wall.\n\nWhat Happens If the Deal Falls Through?\n\nIf xAI fails to land the $5B, it\u2019s not just a delay \u2013 it\u2019s a serious roadblock.\n\nThe company\u2019s goal of building competitive, open-source AI models depends on vast compute resources. Without the money, xAI could fall behind in both scale and speed. That wouldn\u2019t just hurt Musk. It would stall one of the few efforts aiming to keep AI development from becoming fully corporate and closed-door.\n\nGrok, xAI\u2019s chatbot, may not be fully open-source, but it\u2019s marketed as a more open, independent alternative to the Big Tech models. Losing that alternative would narrow the playing field.\n\nIn a world where most frontier AI development is bankrolled by the world\u2019s biggest corporations and steered by government alliances, losing xAI\u2019s vision to politics would send a grim message: openness doesn\u2019t scale unless power approves.\n\nAnd if that becomes the new normal, it won\u2019t stop at Musk. It\u2019s a blow to the whole idea of open and decentralized AI.\n\nOpen-Source AI Needs Protection From Politics\n\nThe irony here runs deep.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018, officially due to conflicts with Tesla\u2019s AI work \u2014 but he\u2019s since accused the company of drifting toward closed, profit-driven models, especially after its partnership with Microsoft and shift to a for-profit structure. That, in his view, was a betrayal of OpenAI\u2019s original mission.\n\nIn 2023, he founded xAI with a different promise: to build \u2018truth-seeking\u2019 AI and push back against what he described as Big Tech\u2019s growing control over artificial intelligence.\n\nBut now, those ideals are under threat \u2013 not from market failure or lack of demand, but from political friction and personal grudges. And that should concern anyone who believes AI innovation shouldn\u2019t hinge on which billionaires get along with which presidents.\n\nImagine if Linux developers had to worry about presidential approval before pushing a kernel update. Or if Python\u2019s core library needed sign-off from a national security office. Absurd, right? But that\u2019s not far off from where we\u2019re headed as foundational AI becomes deeply entangled in geopolitics, regulation, and personality-driven policymaking.\n\nAI is becoming critical infrastructure. That means it can be steered, blocked, or co-opted by governments. And if Trump sees AI as a strategic asset \u2013 or a threat \u2013 he may treat companies like xAI the way he treated TikTok or Huawei: comply or be sidelined.\n\nMusk\u2019s Political Risk Problem\n\nThere\u2019s also a bigger pattern here. Musk is a man of many companies and few filters. That worked well when government contracts were being handed out and he was the darling of innovation.\n\nBut as his political commentary has gotten louder, the backlash is catching up.\n\nTesla is under increased scrutiny, with federal investigations into its Autopilot system and high-profile safety recalls. SpaceX has faced FAA regulatory delays, particularly with Starship launches.\n\nStarlink has drawn foreign policy concerns too \u2013 especially after Musk\u2019s role in Ukraine\u2019s military communications raised alarms in Washington and Europe.\n\nStarlink terminal in Donetsk, Ukraine.\n\nImage by Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nNow, xAI faces the same kind of vulnerability, with its future tied not just to tech milestones, but to political favor.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about whether Musk is right or wrong politically. It\u2019s about whether one man\u2019s social media posts can jeopardize multibillion-dollar tech ventures. The answer, increasingly, is yes.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nIf xAI pulls off the debt deal anyway, it would be a win for Musk and a sign that private capital still believes in the mission. But if the deal stalls or gets downsized, don\u2019t just blame interest rates or the economy. Blame politics.\n\nWe\u2019re entering an era where innovation doesn\u2019t just compete with other companies. It competes with political whims.\n\nThat\u2019s a dangerous precedent.\n\nBecause today it\u2019s Musk and xAI. Tomorrow it could be any startup that dares to challenge the status quo \u2013 or pisses off the wrong president.\n\nOnline Tech Tips, Help Desk Geek, Framework, Insta360, Redmagic, Inmotion, Secretlab, Kodak, and Anker, reviewing their products in real-life scenarios.

Now 37, Zachary still enjoys meaningful work there, his mother says.\n\n\u201cThere's no ultra-processed food,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey truly believe that nutrition is a source of wellness. Overall, they optimize Zachary's physical health. He is physically active every day.\u201d\n\nThe perks of farm living\u2014fresh air, sunshine, and seasonal produce\u2014are why agriculture-based neighborhoods, or \u201cagrihoods,\u201d have kept sprouting since the start of the century. They incorporate some type of agriculture, such as a working farm or community garden, whose harvests go to residents. Agrihoods provide an amenity the whole family can learn from, let residents be part of a team, and preserve the land. Neurologists say this model and the food it provides could help delay early brain aging and dementia and prevent other neurologic conditions, too.\n\nThe United States has about 200 agrihoods in at least 30 states across a variety of climates, including Florida, Illinois, Colorado, and Hawaii, according to a 2024 report by the National Association of Home Builders. They exist in rural communities and around cities.\n\nA Growing Movement\n\nThe first well-known model was Agritopia, built in Gilbert, AZ, outside Phoenix. Construction began in 2001, and Agritopia continues to thrive. Newer neighborhoods include upscale housing at Arden in Palm Beach County, FL, and affordable housing units at Agrihood in urban Santa Clara, CA. The farms tend to focus on growing produce, but some also keep livestock.\n\nSome agrihoods grow food just to feed their own residents, while others offer Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm shares, which consumers pay for in advance; sell crops at farmer's markets; or provide produce for on-site stores where residents can shop. People can enjoy getting their hands dirty or, if they have mobility issues, sitting down to help package herbs or mark prices. Some have children's programs or incorporate animals, such as Catskills Agrihood on Hope Street in New York.\n\nSerenbe Farms, an agrihood with more than 1,000 residents in Chattahoochee Hills, GA, was built around a 25-acre certified organic farm starting in 2004. It aims to \u201cconnect people to nature, to each other, and to a lifestyle that prioritizes holistic well-being, starting with access to fresh, local produce,\u201d says Amy Peterson, Serenbe's community operations and relationships manager. Ten to 20 residents volunteer each week, growing vegetables, fruit, flowers, and herbs.\n\nMary Collins-Shepard spends her days sowing seeds in a greenhouse, transplanting seedlings, and organizing produce at Serenbe. \u201cEngaging with my neighbors at the farm is energizing, but the time can also be very meditative if I happen to be working alone,\u201d says the 67 year old, who moved to the agrihood outside Atlanta from Knoxville, TN, with her husband seven years ago.\n\nThe produce she helps grow and harvest goes into Serenbe's CSA system, Saturday farmer's market, and farm-to-table restaurants\u2014efforts that benefit not only her but also her neighbors.\n\nSome homes for people with developmental challenges have similar setups, such as Camphill North America community living programs, which serve people with autism, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and other conditions. Residents at Camphill Hudson in New York, for example, eat the produce they grow. Former president Tim Paholak has been involved since 1976 and calls the program life-changing: \u201cDeveloping community is a vital component of human health for all of us.\u201d\n\nBrain Benefits\n\nDemetrius M. Maraganore, MD, FAAN, professor and chair of the department of neurology at Tulane University School of Medicine and co-director of the Healthy Brain Aging Initiative at University Medical Center of New Orleans, says farm-centric living fits nicely into Healthy Brain's mission to prevent cognitive decline and dementia with evidence-based lifestyle and behavioral interventions.\n\n\u201cMy father developed Alzheimer's disease, and so did his mother and her mother,\u201d says Dr. Maraganore. \u201cI thought, \u2018How can I prevent this? We need to change our lifestyle and habits.\u2019 \u2026 My passion is to harness nutrition to develop treatments for Alzheimer's. We now have the opportunity to prevent it.\u201d\n\nHe stands by a Mediterranean-style diet, which usually includes lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, with olive oil as a primary fat source and dairy products, eggs, fish, and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts. It centers on minimally processed, plant-based foods and limits sugar, fried food, refined carbohydrates, and saturated fats.\n\nNikolaos Scarmeas, MD, PhD, of the department of neurology at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece and Columbia University, said by email that a \u201cMediterranean-like diet\u201d has \u201cthe most scientific support regarding less risk for cognitive decline and dementia.\u201d It can improve blood flow and circulation in the brain and promote better overall cardiovascular health, Dr. Maraganore adds.\n\nA review of 64 studies by Tulane's Healthy Brain Aging Initiative team in 2022 found that the Mediterranean diet can help promote gut health, which may be neuroprotective, and was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The researchers also found that the diet's nutrient-dense and fiber-rich foods (compared to the typical low-fiber Western diet) may be beneficial for not only overall health but also healthy brain aging.\n\nNot everyone can easily access these foods, Dr. Maraganore points out, especially if they live in a \u201cfood desert,\u201d an area with limited access to fresh, affordable, and nutritious food. This makes moving to agrihoods appealing. With farm-grown produce, he says, \u201cyou can stick closer to a good diet.\u201d\n\nSunshine also provides vitamin D, an anti-inflammatory; not having enough vitamin D is a risk factor for Parkinson's, stroke, and Alzheimer's, says Dr. Maraganore, who points out other agrihood benefits, too: \u201cThe community involvement and socialization in a farm venture can keep aging brain cells from dying and reduce dementia and anxiety.\u201d\n\nLearn More\n\nFor farm-to-table recipes with fresh, seasonal ingredients, visit Brain & Life's Nutrition page.",

        "Content": "Un nuevo estudio liderado por la Universidad Tulane advierte sobre el aumento de los niveles de mercurio en los r\u00edos. Las consecuencias no solo afectan la salud humana sino tambi\u00e9n a los ecosistemas.\n\nDesde la Revoluci\u00f3n Industrial, la creciente actividad humana ha tenido un gran impacto en el medioambiente. Una evidencia de ello es el aumento de los niveles de mercurio en los r\u00edos del mundo, que se han duplicado. Los altos niveles de este qu\u00edmico no solo tienen graves consecuencias para la salud humana, sino tambi\u00e9n para los ecosistemas.\n\nLa miner\u00eda, la combusti\u00f3n de carb\u00f3n y la industria han aumentado la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio y han alterado la circulaci\u00f3n de los r\u00edos fluviales. Est\u00e1 combinaci\u00f3n de factores provocan un fuerte aumento de las concentraciones de este qu\u00edmico, seg\u00fan un estudio de la Universidad Tulane (Estados Unidos). El informe se public\u00f3 el mi\u00e9rcoles (11.06.2025) en la revista Science.\n\nCient\u00edficos de China, EE. UU y Francia desarrollaron un modelo basado en procesos para simular el transporte de mercurio en los r\u00edos. Los resultados: antes de 1850, los r\u00edos del mundo vert\u00edan a los oc\u00e9anos alrededor de 390 toneladas m\u00e9tricas de mercurio al a\u00f1o. Actualmente, los r\u00edos transportan mil toneladas m\u00e9tricas.\n\n\"Las actividades humanas han alterado el ciclo global del mercurio en todos los aspectos\", dijo Yanxu Zhang, profesor de la Universidad Tulane y autor principal del estudio. \"Los estudios anteriores se han centrado en las concentraciones de mercurio en la atm\u00f3sfera, los suelos y el agua de mar y han pasado por alto en gran medida los r\u00edos, una v\u00eda importante para el mercurio que se ha convertido efectivamente en una tuber\u00eda para las aguas residuales de origen municipal e industrial\", detalla el investigador.\n\nLos resultados del informe tienen importantes implicaciones para la salud humana, ya que el mercurio contiene potentes neurotoxinas que se acumulan en los peces que consumimos. Adem\u00e1s, los expertos advierten que la fauna silvestre ha sufrido un aumento preocupante de los niveles de mercurio.\n\nLa miner\u00eda, la combusti\u00f3n de carb\u00f3n y la industria han aumentado la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio y han alterado la circulaci\u00f3n de los r\u00edos fluviales. Imagen: Alan Chavez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUn estudio regional\n\nPara la realizaci\u00f3n del estudio, se cre\u00f3 un modelo inform\u00e1tico detallado llamado MOSART-Hg, que simulaba el transporte preindustrial del mercurio desde la tierra hasta los oc\u00e9anos a trav\u00e9s de los sistemas fluviales. Los hallazgos coincidieron con las concentraciones de mercurio encontradas en muestras de sedimentos datadas de zonas costeras de todo el mundo, lo que valid\u00f3 el enfoque de la investigaci\u00f3n.\n\nLos patrones regionales revelaron que los aumentos m\u00e1s dr\u00e1sticos de la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio se produjeron en Am\u00e9rica del Norte y del Sur, que contribuyeron con un 41 por ciento del crecimiento mundial del mercurio fluvial desde 1850, seguidas por el sudeste asi\u00e1tico (22 %) y el sur de Asia (19 %).\n\nEn la regi\u00f3n amaz\u00f3nica, los niveles de mercurio se dispararon debido al aumento de la erosi\u00f3n del suelo por la deforestaci\u00f3n y a las emisiones de mercurio procedentes de las actividades mineras. \"El balance de mercurio del r\u00edo Amazonas supera ahora las 200 toneladas m\u00e9tricas al a\u00f1o, y tres cuartas partes de esta cantidad provienen de actividades humanas, principalmente de la miner\u00eda artesanal\", asegur\u00f3 Zhang.\n\nEn Asia Oriental, donde los r\u00edos aportan m\u00e1s del 70 % del mercurio global, las emisiones industriales de mercurio se identificaron como el principal factor del aumento de contaminaci\u00f3n.\n\nNo todas las regiones experimentaron incrementos\n\nEn la regi\u00f3n mediterr\u00e1nea se registraron bajos niveles de mercurio, en comparaci\u00f3n con la era preindustrial. Los cient\u00edficos creen que esto se debe a la construcci\u00f3n de presas como la que se encuentra en el r\u00edo Nilo.\n\nLos expertos consideran que esta investigaci\u00f3n puede ser de gran ayuda para poder gestionar de mejor forma la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio, y buscar soluciones. Adem\u00e1s, opinan que se deber\u00edan fijar objetivos mundiales para reducir las emisiones de mercurio fluvial, y restaurar los entornos contaminados.\n\nbt (EFE, Phys.org, ABC)",

        "Summary": "This article discusses the Bay Area Lyme Foundation's Emerging Leader Award and mentions Monica Embers, PhD, associate professor in the Division of Immunology at Tulane National Primate Research Center, as someone Dr. Wang worked closely with.  The overall sentiment is positive towards Tulane, as it highlights the affiliation of one of its faculty members with important research.  The mention is brief, but positive in context.",
        "Content": "PORTOLA VALLEY, Calif., June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bay Area Lyme Foundation, a leading sponsor of Lyme disease research in the US, has given its 2025 Emerging Leader Award (ELA) to Chao Wang, PhD, associate professor in the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering at Arizona State University, faculty with ASU\u2019s Biodesign Institute\u00ae and an expert in nanotechnology and biosensors. Wang will receive $150,000 to support his work to develop a much-needed rapid, low-cost, easy-to-use test, called Nano2RED-LD, for Lyme disease. The test aims to deliver results in as few as 30 minutes when a patient who may have Lyme disease first sees a doctor.\n\nThere is an immense need for better Lyme disease tests. Today\u2019s standard-of-care tests miss too many cases at all stages of Lyme disease, including as many as 70% of early Lyme cases.\n\n\u201cWith Lyme disease cases rising steadily across the U.S., the need for accurate and timely diagnostic tools has never been greater,\u201d said Katariina Tuovinen, research grant director, Bay Area Lyme Foundation. \u201cDr. Wang\u2019s pioneering work epitomizes the essence of this award as it applies innovation from other infectious diseases in an effort to enhance outcomes for patients affected by Lyme disease.\u201d\n\nThis unique diagnostic system uses gold nanoparticles along with an innovative electronically driven data readout system that has shown promise in detecting Ebola and COVID-19, as well as detecting a Lyme protein called OppA2. The platform offers a novel combination of direct and indirect detection for Lyme disease as it detects both antigens and antibodies, producing a clear signal, with the intent to enhance detection. To automatically transmit the data, it leverages a circuit-integrated electronic readout that digitizes the gold nanoparticle signals for accurate and easy data analysis, further simplifying the use of the diagnostic system.\n\nWang\u2019s ELA research project will use samples from Bay Area Lyme Foundation\u2019s Lyme Disease Biobank to measure sensitivity and specificity with positive and negative controls.\n\nWang first used Nano2RED-LD to detect Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, showing it could be about 1,000 times more sensitive than the commonly used ELISA test. Over the past two years, his lab has also demonstrated that Nano2RED-LD can detect the protein OppA2, a lipoprotein and part of a family of proteins in Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. For this research with OppA2, Wang has worked closely with Bay Area Lyme Foundation scientific advisory board member, Monica Embers, PhD, associate professor in the Division of Immunology at Tulane National Primate Research Center, and 2021 ELA winner, Michael Rout, PhD, professor and head of Laboratory of Cellular and Structural Biology at Rockefeller University.\n\n\u201cWe believe collaboration between researchers is a key component driving innovative science and appreciate the support Dr. Wang is receiving from the community,\u201d said Linda Giampa, executive director of Bay Area Lyme Foundation. \u201cWe are proud to see the extensive resources of our Lyme Disease Biobank being used for such important research, and we value the opportunity to support work that brings us closer to developing improved diagnostics for patients with Lyme disease.\u201d\n\nPrevious Emerging Leader Award recipients have come from institutions, including Brandeis University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Louisiana State University, North Carolina State University, Stanford University School of Medicine, Texas A&M, Tulane University, University of California San Francisco, Rockefeller University, Stanford University, Tufts University, and Northwestern University. Most of these projects were in the early stages of research, and the Emerging Leader Award enabled scientists to generate data required for ongoing support from Bay Area Lyme Foundation and/or government funding. Many findings have been accepted for presentation at well-respected scientific forums or are detailed in peer-reviewed papers.\n\nSince its inception in 2014, the Emerging Leader Award has recognized scientists and researchers with innovative ideas to advance diagnostics or treatments for Lyme disease. Those interested in applying for the 2026 award or exploring additional funding opportunities offered by the Bay Area Lyme Foundation are encouraged to visit: https://www.bayarealyme.org/our-research/grant-process/ .\n\nAbout Lyme Disease\n\nThe most common vector-borne infectious disease in the US, Lyme disease is a potentially disabling infection caused by bacteria transmitted through the bite of an infected tick to people and pets, and can be potentially passed from a pregnant mother to her unborn baby. If caught early, most cases of Lyme disease can be effectively treated, but it is commonly misdiagnosed due to lack of awareness and inaccurate diagnostic tests. Based on the trajectory of Lyme disease cases documented by CDC between 2010 and 2018, Bay Area Lyme estimates that there are now more than 620,000 new cases of Lyme disease each year, and, as a result of the difficulty in diagnosing and treating Lyme disease, up to two million Americans may be suffering from the impact of its debilitating long-term symptoms and complications..\n\nAbout Bay Area Lyme Foundation\n\nBay Area Lyme Foundation , a national organization committed to making Lyme disease easy to diagnose and simple to cure, is the leading public charity sponsor of innovative Lyme disease research in the US. A 501c3 organization based in Silicon Valley, Bay Area Lyme Foundation collaborates with world-class scientists and institutions to accelerate medical breakthroughs for Lyme disease. It is also dedicated to providing reliable, fact-based information so that prevention and the importance of early treatment are common knowledge. Historically a pivotal donation from the LaureL STEM fund covered all overhead costs through 2024. In 2023 a Bay Area Lyme Endowment was formed which allows for 100% of all donor contributions to the Bay Area Lyme Foundation to go directly to research and prevention programs in perpetuity.

        "Content": "El establecimiento de una l\u00ednea de base para el mercurio ribere\u00f1o durante la era preindustrial puede servir como un punto de referencia clave - UNSPLASH\n\nMADRID, 12 Jun. (EUROPA PRESS) -\n\nLos niveles de mercurio en los r\u00edos del mundo se han m\u00e1s que duplicado desde la era preindustrial, seg\u00fan una investigaci\u00f3n de la Universidad de Tulane que es pionera en el \u00e1mbito fluvial.\n\nEl estudio, publicado en Science Advances, desarroll\u00f3 un modelo basado en procesos para simular el transporte de mercurio en los r\u00edos y descubri\u00f3 que, antes de 1850, los r\u00edos del mundo transportaban aproximadamente 390 toneladas m\u00e9tricas de mercurio a los oc\u00e9anos anualmente. Hoy en d\u00eda, esa cifra ha ascendido a unas 1.000 toneladas m\u00e9tricas al a\u00f1o, un 150 por ciento m\u00e1s.\n\nLos principales impulsores de este aumento son el vertido de aguas residuales, la erosi\u00f3n del suelo y las liberaciones de mercurio procedentes de las actividades industriales y la miner\u00eda, afirm\u00f3 el autor principal, Yanxu Zhang, profesor asociado de Ciencias de la Tierra y Ambientales en la Facultad de Ciencias e Ingenier\u00eda de Tulane.\n\n\"Las actividades humanas han alterado el ciclo global del mercurio en todos sus aspectos\", afirm\u00f3 Zhang en un comunicado. \"Si bien estudios anteriores se han centrado en las concentraciones de mercurio en la atm\u00f3sfera, el suelo y el agua de mar, han pasado por alto en gran medida los r\u00edos, una v\u00eda importante para el mercurio que se ha convertido, de hecho, en una v\u00eda de desag\u00fce para las aguas residuales de fuentes municipales e industriales\".\n\nAUMENTOS PREOCUPANTES\n\nLos hallazgos tienen implicaciones significativas para la salud humana y la vida silvestre, ya que los compuestos de mercurio son potentes neurotoxinas que pueden acumularse en los peces y representar riesgos para la salud a trav\u00e9s del consumo. Los investigadores se\u00f1alan que los r\u00edos cercanos a h\u00e1bitats cr\u00edticos para la vida silvestre, incluyendo las principales rutas migratorias de aves en Asia Oriental y Am\u00e9rica del Norte, han experimentado aumentos preocupantes en los niveles de mercurio.\n\n\"El establecimiento de una l\u00ednea de base para el mercurio ribere\u00f1o durante la era preindustrial puede servir como un punto de referencia clave\", afirm\u00f3 Zhang, se\u00f1alando que podr\u00eda proporcionar objetivos para acuerdos internacionales como el Convenio de Minamata sobre el Mercurio, cuyo objetivo es reducir la contaminaci\u00f3n global por mercurio.\n\nEl equipo de investigaci\u00f3n de Tulane cre\u00f3 un modelo inform\u00e1tico detallado llamado MOSART-Hg para simular el transporte de mercurio preindustrial de la tierra a los oc\u00e9anos a trav\u00e9s de los sistemas fluviales. Sus hallazgos coincidieron estrechamente con las concentraciones de mercurio encontradas en muestras de n\u00facleos de sedimentos datados de zonas costeras de todo el mundo, lo que valida su enfoque.\n\nLos patrones regionales revelaron que los aumentos m\u00e1s dr\u00e1sticos en la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio se produjeron en Am\u00e9rica del Norte y del Sur, que contribuyen con el 41 % del crecimiento mundial del mercurio fluvial desde 1850, seguidas del Sudeste Asi\u00e1tico (22 %) y el Sur de Asia (19 %).\n\nEl estudio identific\u00f3 la miner\u00eda de oro artesanal y en peque\u00f1a escala (MAPE) como un contribuyente particularmente significativo a la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio en Am\u00e9rica del Sur, el Sudeste Asi\u00e1tico y partes de \u00c1frica.\n\nEn la regi\u00f3n amaz\u00f3nica, por ejemplo, los niveles de mercurio se han disparado debido tanto al aumento de la erosi\u00f3n del suelo por la deforestaci\u00f3n como a las liberaciones de mercurio derivadas de las actividades mineras.\n\n\"El balance de mercurio del r\u00edo Amazonas supera actualmente las 200 toneladas m\u00e9tricas anuales, y tres cuartas partes de este provienen de actividades humanas, principalmente de la MAPE\", afirm\u00f3 Zhang.\n\nLas liberaciones industriales de mercurio se identificaron como el principal impulsor de los aumentos en regiones como Asia Oriental, donde los r\u00edos de China aportan m\u00e1s del 70 % del mercurio regional. El flujo de mercurio del r\u00edo Yangts\u00e9 se ha m\u00e1s que duplicado con respecto a los niveles preindustriales.\n\nMENOS EN EL MEDITERR\u00c1NEO\n\nSin embargo, no todas las regiones experimentaron aumentos. La regi\u00f3n mediterr\u00e1nea experiment\u00f3 niveles de mercurio m\u00e1s bajos en comparaci\u00f3n con la \u00e9poca preindustrial, lo que los investigadores atribuyen a la construcci\u00f3n de presas como la Presa Alta de Asu\u00e1n en el r\u00edo Nilo, que retienen sedimentos cargados de mercurio.\n\nLas concentraciones fluviales de mercurio podr\u00edan servir como un indicador de respuesta r\u00e1pida para evaluar la eficacia de la gesti\u00f3n de la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio a medida que los pa\u00edses trabajan para reducir las emisiones de mercurio y restaurar los entornos contaminados, afirm\u00f3.\n\nEl estudio tambi\u00e9n cuenta con la participaci\u00f3n de colaboradores internacionales de la Universidad de California en San Diego, la Universidad Forestal de Pek\u00edn, el Servicio Geol\u00f3gico de Estados Unidos y G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse.",

        "Summary": "This article mentions a Tulane University study on generative AI and employee creativity.  The finding is presented positively, showcasing Tulane's research in the field of AI and its positive impact on businesses. The mention of Tulane is positive and highlights its research.",
        "Content": "TWEAKS AND UPDATES\n\nMashable: The best memes of 2025 (so far). \u201cMemes are few and far between in 2025, but there are still some good ones. Why are memes so rare? Simply put: TikTok. The heart of digital culture has migrated to TikTok, which is a short-form video platform. So there remain memes of a sort \u2014 they\u2019re mostly called TikTok trends \u2014 but the text-and-image-based memes of years past? Those are harder to come by.\u201d\n\nEngadget: The Oversight Board says Meta isn\u2019t doing enough to fight celeb deepfake scams. \u201cScams using AI deepfakes of celebrities have become an increasingly prominent issue for Meta over the last couple of years. Now, the Oversight Board has weighed in and has seemingly confirmed what other critics have said: Meta isn\u2019t doing enough to enforce its own rules, and makes it far too easy for scammers to get away with these schemes.\u201d\n\nUSEFUL STUFF\n\nGenealogyBank: Genealogy Tips: Organizing and Preserving Cell Phone Photos. \u201cIn this article, Gena Philibert-Ortega gives tips and storage ideas for organizing the photos on your smartphone. Gena is a genealogist and author of the book \u2018From the Family Kitchen.'\u201d\n\nAROUND THE SEARCH AND SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD\n\nCalishat: RSS With An Expiration Date: The Temporary Obsessions Feed Reader. \u201cI love RSS; I literally couldn\u2019t do my self-appointed job without it. But when it comes to temporarily monitoring topics, RSS feeds are a bit unwieldy; you have to add another layer of workflow to add/remove feeds, set up reminders for yourself, etc. All that has hitherto discouraged me from using RSS when there was a time-sensitive or current event topic to cover. But RSS is too valuable to leave on the shelf when curating content. So I made a Google Sheets-based tool called Temporary Obsessions Feed Reader.\u201d\n\nDigiday: Marketers set to meet with TikTok in Cannes to discuss the platform\u2019s future plans. \u201cLast year at the Cannes Lions festival, TikTok execs were peppered with questions about the app\u2019s future in the U.S. This time, advertisers want to know about its future, full stop. Whether it\u2019s querying TikTok\u2019s long-term plans for AI, clarity on its partner programs or the inside track on its product road map, marketers on the Croisette are gearing up to determine how the app will (or won\u2019t) fit into their future plans.\u201d\n\nSECURITY & LEGAL\n\nIrish Council for Civil Liberties: Public Services Card database of millions of Irish people\u2019s faces declared illegal . \u201cThe decision vindicates the actions taken by ICCL and Digital Rights Ireland against the Department of Employment and Social Protection (DEASP). The Government had previously claimed that the facial records were not biometric data. Today, the DPC found that the Department unlawfully collected facial records (biometric data) from 70% of the population of Ireland over 15 years.\u201d\n\nSky News: 4Chan being investigated by UK officials under new online safety rules. \u201c4Chan, an online forum notorious for its extreme content, is being investigated by UK officials over its failure to comply with new internet safety rules. Ofcom, the UK\u2019s communications regulator, said it had received complaints about potential illegal content on 4Chan, as it announced nine new investigations into sites that may have broken new rules.\u201d\n\nRESEARCH & OPINION\n\nTulane University: New Tulane study finds generative AI can boost employee creativity\u2014but only for strategic thinkers. \u201cThe employees who benefited most weren\u2019t just using ChatGPT passively. They were actively thinking about how to approach their work, what problems they were trying to solve, and how best to use AI to support their goals. In short, they were skilled at managing their own thinking\u2014 planning, reflecting, and adjusting their approach as needed.\u201d\n\nOTHER THINGS I THINK ARE COOL\n\nMIT News: Window-sized device taps the air for safe drinking water. \u201cThe system runs entirely on its own, without a power source, unlike other designs that require batteries, solar panels, or electricity from the grid. The team ran the device for over a week in Death Valley, California \u2014 the driest region in North America. Even in very low-humidity conditions, the device squeezed drinking water from the air at rates of up to 160 milliliters (about two-thirds of a cup) per day.\u201d\n\nBook Riot: Want To Help Teens Protect The Freedom to Read? Libraries, Apply for Books Unbanned Programming Funding Now . \u201cLibraries nationwide are invited to apply for one-time funds to launch programming for teens and young adults related to the freedom to read. A total of $50,000 in funding will be given out, ranging from $1,000 to $10,000. Any US library is eligible to apply and receive funding, but special consideration will be given to small and rural libraries, where funding and support for such efforts are often more difficult to attain.\u201d Good evening, Internet\u2026\n\nThis newsletter is free but most of the things that go into making it aren\u2019t!

        "Summary": "This article discusses a study on increased mercury levels in rivers and oceans. Yanxu Zhang, from Tulane University, is one of the lead researchers on the study. Tulane's association with this important research is highlighted positively.",
        "Content": "Weltweit transportieren Fl\u00fcsse heute etwa zweieinhalb Mal so viel hochgiftiges Quecksilber in die Meere wie noch um 1850. Das berichtet ein internationales Forschungsteam aus der Basis von Messwerten und Computermodellen. Hauptquellen des Schwermetalls sind industrielle Prozesse, Metallbergbau, Kleinbergbau bei der Suche nach Gold sowie die Verbrennung von Kohle, wie die Gruppe um Yanxu Zhang von der Tulane University in New Orleans in der Fachzeitschrift \u00abScience Advances\u00bb berichtet.\n\n\u00abQuecksilber-Verbindungen sind starke Nervengifte, die die menschliche Gesundheit gef\u00e4hrden, vor allem durch den Verzehr von Fisch\u00bb, schreiben die Studienautoren. Weil Quecksilber im Boden vorkommt, wird das giftige Metall nat\u00fcrlicherweise durch Bodenerosion in Fl\u00fcsse eingetragen. Bisher war jedoch nicht bekannt, wie hoch der globale Quecksilber-Eintrag in Flie\u00dfgew\u00e4sser ist. \u00abFr\u00fchere Studien konzentrierten sich zwar auf die Quecksilber-Konzentrationen in der Atmosph\u00e4re, den B\u00f6den und im Meerwasser, haben dabei aber Fl\u00fcsse weitgehend \u00fcbersehen\u00bb, wird Zhang in einer Mitteilung seiner Universit\u00e4t zitiert.\n\nAnstieg von 390 Tonnen auf 1.000 Tonnen pro Jahr\n\nDie Wissenschaftler basierten ihr Modell des vorindustriellen Quecksilber-Exports aus Fl\u00fcssen in die Ozeane einerseits auf der Quecksilber-Erosion im Einzugsgebiet und andererseits auf der Transportkraft der Fl\u00fcsse. Diese wiederum h\u00e4ngt von Str\u00f6mung und Flie\u00dfgeschwindigkeit des Gew\u00e4ssers ab. Zur Kalibrierung glichen Zhang und Kollegen ihre Simulationsergebnisse f\u00fcr 1850 mit jenen Quecksilber-Werten ab, die in den Sedimentablagerungen einiger Fl\u00fcsse gemessen wurden. Die simulierten Werte waren tendenziell etwas niedriger als die gemessenen Konzentrationen, sodass das Modell eine eher konservative Sch\u00e4tzung ist.\n\nF\u00fcr 1850, also zu Beginn der Industrialisierung, gelangten den Kalkulationen zufolge weltweit j\u00e4hrlich etwa 390 Tonnen Quecksilber \u00fcber Fl\u00fcsse in die Ozeane. Derzeit sind es demnach rund 1.000 Tonnen Quecksilber pro Jahr.\n\nSt\u00e4rkste Anstiege in Asien und Amerika\n\n\u00abDie Festlegung eines Basiswerts f\u00fcr Quecksilber in Fl\u00fcssen im vorindustriellen Zeitalter kann als wichtiger Bezugspunkt dienen\u00bb, betonte Zhang. Daran k\u00f6nne sich die Politik bei der Reduzierung der Freisetzung von Quecksilber orientieren.\n\nBesonders stark stieg die Quecksilber-Menge der Studie zufolge in Fl\u00fcssen in S\u00fcdasien und S\u00fcdostasien sowie in Nord- und S\u00fcdamerika. \u00abDer Quecksilber-Haushalt des Amazonas betr\u00e4gt mittlerweile \u00fcber 200 Tonnen pro Jahr, wobei drei Viertel davon auf menschliche Aktivit\u00e4ten zur\u00fcckgehen, haupts\u00e4chlich auf Kleinbergbau\u00bb, erl\u00e4uterte Zhang.\n\nZudem trage im Amazonasgebiet die starke Abholzung zu st\u00e4rkerer Bodenerosion bei, so der Forscher. Diese f\u00fchre ebenfalls zu h\u00f6heren Quecksilber-Werten im Amazonas.\n\nAuch sibirische Fl\u00fcsse, die wie Ob und Jenissei in den Arktischen Ozean flie\u00dfen, transportieren demnach relativ viel Quecksilber ins Meer. Und erst k\u00fcrzlich hatten Wissenschaftler um Isabel Smith von der University of Southern California in Los Angeles berichtet, dass die Quecksilber-Konzentrationen in den nordamerikanischen Fl\u00fcssen Yukon und Koyukuk wegen des tauenden Permafrostbodens und der dadurch zunehmenden Bodenerosion deutlich gestiegen sind.\n\nDoch Zhang und Kollegen berichten auch Positives: So ist der Quecksilber-Eintrag ins Mittelmeer im Vergleich zu 1850 gesunken. Dies erkl\u00e4ren sie damit dass Staud\u00e4mme im nordafrikanischen Einzugsgebiet des Nil - etwa der Assuan-Staudamm in \u00c4gypten - von Fl\u00fcssen transportierte Sedimente zur\u00fcckhalten.\n\nQuecksilber z\u00e4hlt zu den gef\u00e4hrlichsten Giftstoffen \u00fcberhaupt. Der Stoff sch\u00e4digt neben Immun- und Fortpflanzungssystem vor allem das zentrale Nervensystem, wobei ungeborene Kinder besonders empfindlich reagieren. Deshalb raten etwa die US-Beh\u00f6rden Schwangeren, bestimmte Fischarten aus manchen Gebieten zu meiden.\n\n\u00a9 dpa-infocom, dpa:250614-930-668085/1",

        "Summary": "This article details the resignation of Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement at Tulane's Environmental Law Clinic, due to alleged censorship of her research on racial disparities in the petrochemical industry. The article portrays Tulane negatively by highlighting the university's alleged suppression of research and potential interference in academic freedom. Tulane is mentioned throughout the article in relation to the controversy.",
        "Content": "Emails show Tulane\u2019s president was worried about losing state funding for another project because of the professor\u2019s research.\n\nAn environmental researcher at Tulane University resigned Wednesday after accusing campus officials, reportedly under pressure from Gov. Jeff Landry, of issuing a \u201cgag order\u201d that prevented her from publicly discussing her work, which focused on racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce.\n\n\u201cScholarly publications, not gag orders, are the currency of academia,\u201d Kimberly Terrell, the now-former director of community engagement at Tulane\u2019s Environmental Law Clinic, wrote in her resignation letter. \u201cThere is always room for informed debate. But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.\u201d\n\nTerrell\u2019s resignation comes amid wider efforts by the Trump administration and its allies to control the types of research\u2014including projects related to environmental justice\u2014academics are permitted to pursue and punish campus protesters for espousing messages the president and other public officials disagree with.\n\n\u201cIt started with the pro-Palestinian activism on our campus and others across the country. It\u2019s emboldened a lot of political leaders to feel they can make inroads by silencing faculty in other areas,\u201d Michelle Lacey, a math professor and president of Tulane\u2019s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, told Inside Higher Ed. \u201cThat was the catalyst for creating a climate where university administrators are very nervous, especially now as we see the government pulling funding for areas of research they don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nLast spring, Landry praised Tulane president Michael Fitts and university police for removing students who were protesting Israel\u2019s attacks on Gaza. Soon after, the Legislature passed a provision creating harsher punishments for protesters who disrupt traffic, which Landry later signed into law.\n\nLandry, a Republican aligned with Trump, has a history of trying to exert control over the state\u2019s public higher education institutions.\n\nLast summer, he enacted a law that allows him to directly appoint board chairs at the state\u2019s public colleges and universities. And in November, following Trump\u2019s election, Landry publicly called on officials at Louisiana State University to punish a law professor who allegedly made brief comments in class about students who voted for the president.\n\nLandry\u2019s office denied to the Associated Press (which first reported on Terrell\u2019s resignation) that it pressured Tulane to silence research from the law clinic. Michael Strecker, a Tulane spokesperson, also told the outlet that the university \u201cis fully committed to academic freedom and the strong pedagogical value of law clinics\u201d and declined to comment on \u201cpersonnel matters.\u201d\n\nStrecker added in a statement that Tulane administrators have been working with the law school's leadership on how the law clinics could better support the university's education mission.\n\n\"Debates about how best to operate law clinics\u2019 teaching mission have occurred nationally and at Tulane for years\u2014this is nothing new,\" Strecker said. \"This effort includes most recently input from an independent, third-party review.\"\n\nBut Terrell\u2019s account of the events that led to her resignation call the universities\u2019 academic freedom commitments into question, while also implying that Landry\u2014and powerful industry groups\u2014wield some influence over private higher education institutions in the state.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not something Tulane, a private university in New Orleans, should tolerate, Lacey said.\n\nKimberly Terrell Tulane University\n\n\u201cThe academic freedom of all university researchers must be unequivocally defended at both public and private institutions,\u201d Lacey wrote in a statement. \u201cThis includes the right to conduct and disseminate research that may be unfavorably viewed by government officials or corporate entities. Political demands to stifle controversial research are an affront to the advancement of knowledge and open exchange of ideas, as is the voluntary compliance with such requests by university leadership.\u201d\n\nThe latest controversy at Tulane stems from a paper Terrell published April 9 in the peer-reviewed journal Ecological Economics. Her research found that while Black people in Louisiana are underrepresented in the state\u2019s petrochemical workforce, they are overexposed to toxic pollutants the industry releases into an area of the state between New Orleans and Baton Rouge known as \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d\n\nBut according to emails obtained by Inside Higher Ed and other outlets, Fitts worried that publicizing Terrell\u2019s research and the clinic\u2019s other work, which includes legal advocacy, could jeopardize funding for the university\u2019s $600 million plan to redevelop New Orleans\u2019 historic Charity Hospital into residential and commercial spaces as part of a broader downtown expansion plan.\n\nAs Terrell explained in her resignation letter, Fitts and other top Tulane executives were at Louisiana\u2019s state capitol on April 16 lobbying for the project when \u201csomeone accused the university of being anti\u2013chemical industry\u201d and cited her study, which was receiving media attention after it was published the week prior. According to Terrell, \u201cthe story that came down to me through the chain of command was that Governor Landry threatened to veto any bill with funding for Tulane\u2019s Charity project unless Fitts did something about the Environmental Law Clinic.\u201d\n\n\u2018Complete Gag Order\u2019\n\nAfter that, Terrell says, she was \u201cplaced under a complete gag order,\u201d which the emails appear to confirm.\n\n\u201cEffective immediately all external communications that are not client-based\u2014that is, directly related to representation\u2014must be pre-approved by me,\u201d Marcilynn Burke, dean of Tulane\u2019s law school, wrote in an April 25 email to law clinic staff. \u201cSuch communications include press releases, interviews, videos, social media postings, etc. Please err on the side of over-inclusion as we work to define the boundaries through experience.\u201d\n\nA week later, on May 4, Burke wrote another email to clinic staff explaining that \u201celected officials and major donors have cited the clinic as an impediment to them lending their support to the university generally and this project specifically,\u201d referring to Fitts\u2019s plans to redevelop the old hospital. Terrell wrote that when she pleaded her case to Provost Robin Forman, \u201che refused to acknowledge my right to freely conduct and disseminate research\u201d and also \u201clet slip that my job description was likely going to be rewritten.\u201d\n\nTerrell described the entire law clinic as being \u201cunder siege\u201d and said she would rather leave her position \u201cthan have my work used as an excuse for President Fitts to dismantle the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic.\u201d\n\nOther academics, free speech experts and environmental justice advocates also believe Tulane\u2019s moves to silence Terrell\u2019s work amounts to an attack on academic freedom with implications beyond the campus.\n\n\u201cThe administration of Tulane University, far from standing up for academic freedom, is participating in the effort to suppress free inquiry and the pursuit of knowledge by scientific methods,\u201d Michael Ash, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts, said in a statement. \u201cAny effort to reduce academic freedom for Dr. Terrell either by changing her job classification or by redefining whether the protection applies is a blatant and un-American attempt to suppress the type of free inquiry that has made this country great.\u201d\n\nJoy Banner, co-founder and co-director of the Descendants Project, a community organization that works in Cancer Alley, added that the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic is a vital public health resource.\n\nWithout the clinic, \u201cit would be far more difficult to show the racially discriminatory practices of the industry, from preferential hiring practices to a pattern of concentrating pollution in majority Black neighborhoods,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cPresident Fitts must commit to protecting it at all costs.\u201d",

        "Content": "Comment / How Jeffrey Goldberg and The Atlantic Blew \u201cthe Biggest Story of the Year\u201d How Jeffrey Goldberg and \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d Blew \u201cthe Biggest Story of the Year\u201d Given advance warning of an impending war crime, the former cheerleader for the Iraq war decided his priority was to protect his scoop.\n\nAtlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg speaks during the opening night of the New Orleans Book Festival at Tulane University on March 27, 2025. (Skip Bolen / Getty Images)\n\nThis article appears in the July/August 2025 issue, with the headline \u201cYou Gotta Serve Somebody.\u201d\n\nStaff protests fleck the history of this magazine. I recall one especially, a small, unstoried objection in Reagantime that raised a big though unintended question. Two women from the business side, who monitored expenses and regarded editors requesting more than one pencil as profligate, had a complaint. They were tired: of pages dominated by proxy armies, allied tyrants, US-backed atrocities from Sabra and Shatila to the killing fields of Central America and southern Africa, etc. This is The Nation, they said; it should cover the nation.\n\nTheir wordplay remains provocative. In an imperial state, with force projection everywhere on the earth, what is \u201cthe nation\u201d?\n\nSurely it\u2019s not merely the people or the country, the land-of-liberty aspirations, or even illusion that inspired the magazine\u2019s name in 1865. One can love the mongrel, damaged country; the nation is something else: full-blooded, a war machine in the imperial order and imagination\u2014the material reality everyone in power agrees on. If it were not, life expectancy would be a \u201cnational security\u201d crisis: lowest among rich countries (worse than the Northern Marianas); lower for Black people (comparable to Guatemala); lower still for Native people (comparable to Eritrea). As is, the nation ignores human insecurity, or heightens it. For journalists, empire presents a choice: You are an agent of the war machine, or a witness for humanity.\n\nThe \u201cbiggest story of the year\u201d illustrates the problem. Sitting in a supermarket parking lot on March 15, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic had made his choice long before. He\u2019d been an advance man for one war crime, pushing the Iraq weapons-of-mass-destruction lie after 9/11; now he had advance warning of another on his phone. In two hours, the US would begin bombing Yemen. No one on the Signal group chat claimed imminent threat, or even debated a delay. This was preboarding for an act of aggression\u2014the supreme crime under international law, lest we forget.\n\nYet Goldberg\u2019s concern was national security. Civilians would die\u2014the \u201cTarget Terrorist\u201d of the first strike was attacked as he entered his girlfriend\u2019s building; it collapsed with all inside\u2014and would keep dying. Goldberg left the chat, still fretting about national secrets, but he had his story. Neither he nor his media admirers described the Signal bombardiers and their cheering section as lawless psychopaths. (Tulsi Gabbard: \u201cGreat work and effects!\u201d) In an Atlantic Zoom session, subscribers asked where Goldberg had shopped on the 15th. In the TV appearances I saw, no one related the attacks to the Houthis\u2019 aim to thwart the US/Israeli genocide in Gaza. No one asked, \u201cDid you ever think you had a duty to disrupt this nation\u2019s death plans?\u201d\n\nThe question would have been rhetorical. Worse, it appears to be unthinkable. An editor with an audience at high levels of state had two hours to sound an alarm about an imminent war crime. His stated fear for the safety of US troops\u2014thin gruel given the 36,000-plus dead or injured soldiers he had waved into the meat grinder of Iraq\u2014assumes that the US military has no intelligence and no contingency plans. Maybe an outcry wouldn\u2019t have grounded the planes. We\u2019ll never know. A month later, an Atlantic crew was at the White House. The president congratulated Goldberg: \u201cYou were successful, and it became a big story\u2026. You got it out very much to the public.\u201d Next, Trump will be leaking to him.\n\nThe Nation has long believed that publishing is a tool for showing the nation plain. If we invoked international law a lot, it wasn\u2019t because people win their liberation through it but because, as Craig Mokhiber, an international human rights lawyer, says about the duty to confront genocide, \u201cThis is a struggle, and any tools we can use are necessary.\u201d History is a tool. These days, when so much peace talk is corrupt, I remember Alexander Cockburn eviscerating some US deal for Central America and quoting Calgacus on the Romans: \u201cThey make a desolation and they call it peace.\u201d\n\nOur \u201cpeace\u201d for Central America eventually crossed the border, and now the nation is at war against the beloved mongrel country.\n\nIn 1960, six months before the Bay of Pigs invasion, The Nation reported that the CIA was training counterrevolutionaries \u201cfor an eventual landing in Cuba.\u201d Editor Carey McWilliams called on the bigger-foot press to investigate and for public pressure to force \u201cthe administration to abandon this dangerous and hare-brained project.\u201d Some newspapers followed up; some spiked their stories; The New York Times trimmed its sails on the CIA\u2019s role. After Cuba smacked the US proxies down, President John F. Kennedy confided to a Times man that more reporting might \u201chave saved us from a colossal mistake.\u201d McWilliams was wiser: The press does its job so public pressure might too.\n\nEmpire disfigures every American\u2014the privilege of knowing that we are unlikely to be bombed here while the nation that takes our name visits that terror freely on others across the world. Fifty years ago, the Vietnamese people taught the empire what it meant to lose, and taught the country, through the peace movement\u2014and especially the anti-war GIs\u2014what might be gained from resistance rather than accommodation. It is some coincidence of anniversaries.",

        "Content": "Un estudio reciente presentado en el congreso NUTRITION 2025, realizado en Orlando, en los Estados Unidos, sugiere que consumir entre una y tres tazas de caf\u00e9 con cafe\u00edna al d\u00eda durante la mediana edad podr\u00eda estar asociado con un envejecimiento m\u00e1s saludable en mujeres. La investigaci\u00f3n fue liderada por la doctora Sara Mahdavi, cient\u00edfica en nutrici\u00f3n de la Universidad de Toronto y tambi\u00e9n afiliada a Harvard, y fue reportada por CNN y ScienceAlert.\n\nEl estudio analiz\u00f3 datos de m\u00e1s de 47.000 mujeres estadounidenses, recopilados durante tres d\u00e9cadas a trav\u00e9s del proyecto Nurses\u2019 Health Study. Las participantes, encuestadas desde 1984 hasta 2016, fueron evaluadas en relaci\u00f3n con su dieta, estado de salud general, funci\u00f3n f\u00edsica y mental, y la presencia de enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas.\n\nEl caf\u00e9 aporta cafe\u00edna, un poderoso estimulante\n\nSeg\u00fan explic\u00f3 Mahdavi a CNN, las mujeres que tomaban entre una y tres tazas diarias de caf\u00e9 con cafe\u00edna a los 50 a\u00f1os ten\u00edan m\u00e1s probabilidades de alcanzar la vejez sin enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas mayores y con buen estado f\u00edsico, cognitivo y emocional. \u201cEn este estudio, encontramos que el consumo moderado de caf\u00e9 con cafe\u00edna durante la mediana edad se asoci\u00f3 con una mayor probabilidad de un envejecimiento saludable 30 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s\u201d, indic\u00f3 la investigadora.\n\nEl estudio defini\u00f3 \u201cenvejecimiento saludable\u201d como llegar a los 70 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s con buena salud f\u00edsica, sin deterioro cognitivo, sin enfermedades mentales ni problemas de memoria, y libre de 11 enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas, como diabetes tipo 2 o enfermedades cardiovasculares.\n\nLos efectos positivos observados en el estudio se limitaron al caf\u00e9 con cafe\u00edna. No se encontr\u00f3 la misma asociaci\u00f3n beneficiosa con el consumo de t\u00e9, caf\u00e9 descafeinado ni bebidas gaseosas con cafe\u00edna. De hecho, el consumo de gaseosas con cafe\u00edna se relacion\u00f3 con una menor probabilidad de envejecimiento saludable. \u201cEsto implicar\u00eda que el caf\u00e9, en particular, tiene efectos que preservan o promueven la salud\u201d, coment\u00f3 el doctor David Kao, profesor asociado de medicina en la Universidad de Colorado, citado por CNN. Kao no particip\u00f3 en el estudio, pero valor\u00f3 positivamente su calidad metodol\u00f3gica.\n\nSeg\u00fan los expertos, las hormonas influyen en c\u00f3mo se metaboliza la cafe\u00edna (imagen ilustrativa) Foto: FreeP\u00a1CK\n\nAunque los resultados son prometedores, los expertos advierten que el estudio es observacional y, por tanto, no puede establecer una relaci\u00f3n directa de causa y efecto. Se tomaron en cuenta variables como estilo de vida, \u00edndice de masa corporal y nivel de actividad f\u00edsica, pero sigue siendo posible que otros factores no considerados expliquen los resultados.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, Mahdavi se\u00f1al\u00f3 que el caf\u00e9 no debe verse como una soluci\u00f3n universal. La manera en que el cuerpo metaboliza la cafe\u00edna var\u00eda seg\u00fan factores como el uso de anticonceptivos, la menopausia o el embarazo. \u201cEl caf\u00e9 puede apoyar la longevidad, pero no es una receta universal \u2014especialmente para las mujeres\u2014. Las hormonas influyen en c\u00f3mo se metaboliza la cafe\u00edna\u201d, indic\u00f3 la investigadora.\n\nMahdavi aclar\u00f3 que este hallazgo no implica que quienes no consumen caf\u00e9 deban empezar a hacerlo por razones de salud. El beneficio observado aplica a quienes ya lo incluyen como parte de su rutina diaria y lo consumen con moderaci\u00f3n. Por su parte, el doctor Lu Qi, de la Universidad de Tulane, advirti\u00f3 que personas con presi\u00f3n arterial alta, enfermedades card\u00edacas, ansiedad o trastornos del sue\u00f1o deben tener precauci\u00f3n con la cafe\u00edna.\n\nEn resumen, los resultados sugieren que el consumo moderado de caf\u00e9, entre una y tres tazas al d\u00eda, podr\u00eda integrarse a un estilo de vida saludable, aunque no sustituye otras pr\u00e1cticas fundamentales como una dieta equilibrada, el ejercicio regular y el descanso adecuado.\n\nEl consumo moderado de caf\u00e9 puede ofrecer beneficios protectores a las mujeres Getty Images\n\nSeg\u00fan ScienceAlert, el an\u00e1lisis mostr\u00f3 que, entre las mujeres identificadas como \u201cenvejecedoras saludables\u201d (un total de 3706), aproximadamente el 80 por ciento de la cafe\u00edna diaria proven\u00eda del caf\u00e9. Cada taza adicional, hasta cinco tazas peque\u00f1as por d\u00eda, increment\u00f3 las probabilidades de un envejecimiento saludable entre un 2 por ciento y un 5 por ciento. Por el contrario, el consumo diario de refrescos con cafe\u00edna redujo esas probabilidades entre un 20 por ciento y un 26 por ciento por taza.\n\nMahdavi concluy\u00f3 que los efectos del caf\u00e9 son modestos y deben considerarse como parte de un conjunto de h\u00e1bitos saludables: \u201cEstos resultados, aunque preliminares, sugieren que h\u00e1bitos peque\u00f1os y constantes pueden influir en la salud a largo plazo. El consumo moderado de caf\u00e9 puede ofrecer beneficios protectores cuando se combina con otras conductas saludables\u201d. El estudio ser\u00e1 enviado pr\u00f3ximamente para revisi\u00f3n por pares y publicaci\u00f3n formal.\n\nEs importante remarcar que, antes de incluir cualquier nuevo alimento a su dieta, consulte con un m\u00e9dico especialista.\n\n*Por Sof\u00eda Arias Mart\u00ednez",

        "Content": "Aunque gran parte de la atenci\u00f3n sobre el mercurio se ha centrado en el aire o los oc\u00e9anos, un nuevo estudio global ha encendido las alarmas sobre otra ruta cr\u00edtica: los r\u00edos. Investigadores han revelado que los niveles de mercurio fluvial han aumentado dr\u00e1sticamente en los \u00faltimos dos siglos, y su impacto silencioso est\u00e1 dejando una huella duradera en los ecosistemas y la salud p\u00fablica.\n\nUn flujo t\u00f3xico que arrastra siglos de contaminaci\u00f3n\n\nSeg\u00fan un trabajo liderado por la Universidad de Tulane y publicado en Science Advances, los r\u00edos transportan actualmente m\u00e1s de 1.000 toneladas m\u00e9tricas de mercurio al a\u00f1o hacia los oc\u00e9anos, frente a las 390 toneladas estimadas en la era preindustrial. El aumento del 150 % se atribuye directamente a la actividad humana: descargas industriales, erosi\u00f3n del suelo, aguas residuales y miner\u00eda.\n\nUtilizando un modelo inform\u00e1tico llamado MOSART-Hg, los cient\u00edficos reconstruyeron c\u00f3mo ha cambiado el flujo de mercurio desde 1850 hasta hoy. Validaron sus proyecciones con sedimentos costeros de distintas regiones del mundo, y la coincidencia fue concluyente. Este modelo no solo traza el pasado, sino que permite evaluar la efectividad de pol\u00edticas actuales como el Convenio de Minamata, que busca limitar la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio a escala global.\n\nLos efectos del mercurio son devastadores: una vez en el ambiente, se convierte en metilmercurio, una forma altamente t\u00f3xica que se acumula en peces y mariscos. Su consumo puede causar da\u00f1os neurol\u00f3gicos, problemas cardiovasculares y efectos severos en el desarrollo fetal e infantil.\n\nZonas cr\u00edticas y se\u00f1ales de advertencia global\n\nEl estudio se\u00f1ala a Am\u00e9rica del Norte y del Sur como las regiones m\u00e1s responsables del aumento total (41 %), seguidas por el sudeste asi\u00e1tico (22 %) y el sur de Asia (19 %). El caso del Amazonas es especialmente grave: supera las 200 toneladas m\u00e9tricas anuales, con un 75 % atribuido a la miner\u00eda artesanal y la deforestaci\u00f3n. En China, en cambio, el incremento est\u00e1 vinculado a emisiones industriales, especialmente en el r\u00edo Yangts\u00e9.\n\nNo todas las regiones siguen esta tendencia. El Mediterr\u00e1neo, por ejemplo, muestra niveles inferiores a los preindustriales, probablemente gracias a la construcci\u00f3n de represas como la de Asu\u00e1n, que bloquean sedimentos contaminados.\n\nEl estudio concluye que los r\u00edos pueden servir como indicadores sensibles de cambio ambiental a corto plazo. Su monitoreo continuo podr\u00eda ofrecer una herramienta decisiva para evaluar el impacto real de las medidas contra la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio y proteger, antes de que sea tarde, los delicados equilibrios que sostienen la vida en el planeta.",

        "Summary": "This article discusses environmentally friendly food choices. A study from Tulane University regarding the water usage of peanuts and almonds is mentioned. Tulane is cited as the source of research, and its study is presented positively.",
        "Content": "By CALEIGH WELLS\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most impactful climate decisions we make, and we make it multiple times a day.\n\nThe U.N. estimates about a third of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, the main driver of climate change, come from food. That pollution can come from several links in the food supply chain: how farmland is treated, how crops are grown, how food is processed and how it\u2019s ultimately transported.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve already heard the short answer to minimizing your diet\u2019s impact on the planet: eat more plants and fewer animals. The data backs up that suggestion. Emissions from meat-rich diets are four times higher than that of vegan diets.\n\nBut so much focus on meats overshadows many other food choices that also impact the environment and can contribute to global warming. Here is a look at other important grocery store decisions:\n\nFILE \u2013 Pork products line the cooler at a grocery store in New Orleans, April 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)\n\nFILE \u2013 Dairy free creamer sit in a cooler at a grocery store in New Orleans, April 17, 2024.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File) Expand\n\nProteins\n\nSwapping one serving of chicken per day for beef cuts a diet\u2019s emissions nearly in half. Ruminant animals such as cows, sheep and goats are the top drivers of emissions.\n\nThose animals \u201care associated not only with nitrous oxide emissions, but they\u2019re also related to direct methane emissions because they burp them up while they digest food,\u201d said Marco Springmann, professorial research fellow in climate change, food systems and health at University College London.\n\nSpringmann said processed animal products have a higher impact on the planet, too: \u201cYou need 10 times the amount of milk to make one unit of cheese.\u201d So \u2014 and this is true of most food groups \u2014 the less processed the food, the smaller the environmental impact.\n\nPlant-based proteins like legumes, beans and nuts all boast a much lower climate impact.\n\nGrains\n\nThe standout here is rice, and not in a good way.\n\n\u201cRice uses a ton of water. It uses gobs of fertilizer. There\u2019s flooded rice paddy fields, and that water actually breeds all kinds of bacteria, and those bacteria produce methane gas,\u201d said eco-dietitian nutritionist Mary Purdy.\n\nPurdy said the most planet-friendly alternative is just eating a bunch of different grains.\n\n\u201cThe wheat, corn and soy world is very, very familiar to us because we\u2019ve been seeing it. It\u2019s been heavily marketed. When was the last time you saw a commercial for millet or buckwheat?\u201d she asked.\n\nDiverse diets, Purdy said, incentivize biodiverse agriculture, which is more resilient to erratic weather \u2014 a hallmark of climate change \u2014 and makes healthier soil.\n\nFruits and vegetables\n\nWhen it comes to produce, minimizing impact is less about choosing between foods and more about buying based on the way that food was grown.\n\nConventionally grown produce \u201cvery likely is using pesticides, fertilizer, and maybe more water because the soil isn\u2019t healthy,\u201d said Purdy.\n\nPurdy said organic labels, such as Regenerative Organic Certified, indicate those foods had a smaller climate impact when they were grown. The tradeoff is that organic food has a lower yield, so it requires more land use and is often more expensive.\n\nLocal and \u201cin season\u201d foods also have a smaller climate impact, but not just for one of the reasons you may be thinking of: emissions from international shipping. Every day, thousands of large ships transport goods, including produce, around the world, and the fuel they use is heavily polluting.\n\nHowever, \u201cit\u2019s mostly those local emissions on trucks that are actually impactful, not the international shipping emissions,\u201d Springmann said.\n\nAlso, food grown nearby tends to be grown in a way that fits with the local climate and is less harmful to the environment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to grow oranges in some place in a greenhouse,\u201d Purdy said.\n\nButter and oil\n\nPlants win out over animals, again. Vegetable oils are less impactful than butter or lard. Springmann also said tropical oils are healthiest in moderation, such as those from coconuts or palms, because they have a higher fat content. Plus, palm oil is associated with deforestation.\n\nAs for nut butters, almonds might be a great option for limiting carbon emissions, but they require a lot of water. One study out of Tulane University found that a serving of peanuts has an emissions footprint similar to almonds but 30% less impact on water use.\n\nDon\u2019t waste food\n\nThrowing less food away might sound obvious, but roughly a third of food grown in the U.S. is wasted.\n\nMeal planning, freezing leftovers and checking the fridge before heading to the grocery store all help cut waste.\n\n\u201cThe climate impact, the embedded water use, all of the labor and different aspects that went into producing that food, that all gets wasted if we don\u2019t eat it,\u201d Nicole Tichenor Blackstone, a professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University.\n\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

La victoria por 116-107 sobre Oklahoma City Thunder, adelant\u00e1ndose 2-1 en la serie al mejor de siete en la carrera por el anillo, result\u00f3 vibrante, con 15 empates en el tanteador, alternancia en el liderazgo y un desenlace para los due\u00f1os casa. Los flashes se quedaron con Tyrese Haliburton, con Obi Toppin, con Rick Carlisle, pero detr\u00e1s de todos ellos se erige la figura de ella, una de las pocas entrenadoras asistentes de la NBA, Jenny Boucek, la ingeniera defensiva de un equipo que deja la piel dentro de la cancha.\n\nNo le gustan mucho las c\u00e1maras, prefiere estar en un segundo plano, pero Boucek, de 51 a\u00f1os, es entrenadora asistente de la NBA desde hace siete a\u00f1os, tras construir una carrera como jugadora en Virginia y como coach en la WNBA. Comenz\u00f3 en el mundo del b\u00e1squetbol en All-ACC en la Universidad de Virginia de 1992 a 1996. Boucek promedi\u00f3 7,9 puntos, 3,7 rebotes, 3,1 asistencias y 1,2 robos a lo largo de su carrera, alcanzando tres Elite Eights con los Cavaliers. Boucek termin\u00f3 jugando para los Cleveland Rockers en la temporada inaugural de la WNBA en 1997, pero sufri\u00f3 una fractura de espalda que puso fin a su carrera.\n\nBoucek es una de las 15 entrenadoras que han entrenado en la NBA y fue una de las cuatro que formaron parte del cuerpo t\u00e9cnico de la NBA durante la temporada regular 2024-25. Actualmente, en su cuarto a\u00f1o con los Pacers, trabaj\u00f3 anteriormente con los Sacramento Kings y los Dallas Mavericks.\n\nLa realidad es que Boucek no hab\u00eda planificado su futuro ligado al b\u00e1squetbol profesional, porque como estudiante de medicina deportiva y como creci\u00f3 en una familia de m\u00e9dicos y enfermeras y su horizonte estaba concentrado en seguir el legado familiar, seg\u00fan cont\u00f3 en AJ McCord, de la revista Legends .\n\n\u201cVengo de una familia que ha desafiado el statu quo. Nunca preguntaron: \u2018\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 deber\u00edamos hacer esto?\u2019 o \u2018\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 deber\u00edamos hacer aquello?\u2019. Siempre dec\u00edan: \u2018\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no?\u2019. Como: \u2018Siempre se ha hecho as\u00ed, pero \u00bfpor qu\u00e9?\u2019\u201c, cont\u00f3 en el medio estadounidense a USA Today.\n\nY la realidad es que la familia Boucek siempre estuvo un paso al frente, ya que el Dr. Mark Boucek, t\u00edo de Jenny, tuvo un papel fundamental en el primer trasplante de coraz\u00f3n de babuino a beb\u00e9 del mundo, y su abuelo materno, el Dr. Robert Heath, fund\u00f3 el Departamento de Psiquiatr\u00eda y Neurolog\u00eda de la Universidad de Tulane. \u201cEn mi familia hubo muchos pioneros en la investigaci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica. Era una mentalidad con la que nos criaron en nuestra familia\u201d, cont\u00f3 Jenny, en una charla con UVA Today.\n\nCarlisle, el entrenador de Indiana, llev\u00f3 a Boucek a su staff t\u00e9cnico cuando dirig\u00eda Dallas Mavericks en 2018 y le dijo que su lugar era como entrenadora a la NBA, que por su capacidad pertenec\u00eda a esa elite. \u201cHay cosas en la forma en que Rick ve el mundo, donde no hay l\u00edmites ni para \u00e9l ni para las personas en las que cree. Y siempre me ha visto as\u00ed, creyendo en m\u00ed m\u00e1s de lo que yo mismo he cre\u00eddo\u201d, cont\u00f3 Jenny, que es madre soltera y tambi\u00e9n eso represent\u00f3 todo un desaf\u00edo en es universo de enormes responsabilidades que es la NBA. Exactamente 12 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de ser cesada en Dallas dio a luz a su hija Rylie mediante la fecundaci\u00f3n in vitro y desde entonces a acompa\u00f1a a todos lados, incluso, a los partidos.\n\nEl head coach de los Pacers tiene una mirada muy especial sobre Boucek, tanto que podr\u00eda superar lo que logr\u00f3 Becky Hammon, en San Antonio Spurs, que fue parte del staff t\u00e9cnico de Gregg Popovich como asistente desde 2014 hasta 2021 y se convirti\u00f3 en la primera mujer en ejercer como entrenadora principal interina en la NBA despu\u00e9s de que Pop fuera expulsado de un partido en 2020. Pero Carlisle considera que su asistente defensiva est\u00e1 para dar un paso m\u00e1s: \u201cJenny Boucek es la \u00fanica mujer en la construcci\u00f3n defensiva de un staff t\u00e9cnico de la NBA que tambi\u00e9n es coordinadora y es una de las pocas que podr\u00eda convertirse en la primera entrenadora principal de la NBA alg\u00fan d\u00eda\u201d.\n\nDebbie Ryan, la entrenadora de Boucek en Cavaliers, en la WNBA, dijo que una de las mayores fortalezas de Jenny es la forma en que puede establecer relaciones y generar confianza con los dem\u00e1s. \u201cY creo que eso es lo que m\u00e1s valoran los hombres, los jugadores de estos equipos, en ella. Es su profesionalismo y su trabajo, y c\u00f3mo les ayuda a conectar mejor entre s\u00ed, con los entrenadores, la organizaci\u00f3n, los due\u00f1os, con todos\u201d, cont\u00f3 Ryan.\n\nY las palabras de Myles Tuner, el pivote estrella de los Pacers, habl\u00f3 en un video que hizo el equipo sobre Boucek y consolid\u00f3 la virtud de la entrenadora: \u201cEs una persona muy apasionada por lo que hace. Tambi\u00e9n es alguien que ha llegado a un mundo dominado por hombres y que a\u00f1o tras a\u00f1o se gana m\u00e1s respeto. Incluso afuera de la cancha, es alguien con quien puedes intercambiar ideas y te apoya\u201d.\n\nSe sienta a un par de butacas del entrenador principal, gritando instrucciones como coordinadora defensiva de un equipo que est\u00e1 est\u00e1 en la final de la NBA y domina la serie por 2-1. Su voz rompe con todas las estructuras y es que Boucek quiere trascender: \u201cQuiero hacerlo por Rick. Es un pionero e innovador. Y es alguien que, una vez m\u00e1s, interpela a todos: \u2018\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no?\u2019. Siempre hay que cree que no hay raz\u00f3n por la que algo no sea posible\u201d.",

        "Content": "Hauptquellen des Schwermetalls sind industrielle Prozesse, Metallbergbau, Kleinbergbau bei der Suche nach Gold sowie die Verbrennung von Kohle.\n\nArtikel teilen\n\nWeltweit transportieren Fl\u00fcsse heute etwa zweieinhalb Mal so viel hochgiftiges Quecksilber in die Meere wie noch um 1850. Das berichtet ein internationales Forschungsteam aus der Basis von Messwerten und Computermodellen. Hauptquellen des Schwermetalls sind industrielle Prozesse, Metallbergbau, Kleinbergbau bei der Suche nach Gold sowie die Verbrennung von Kohle, so eine Gruppe um Yanxu Zhang von der Tulane University in New Orleans in der Fachzeitschrift \u201eScience Advances\u201c.\n\n\u201eQuecksilber-Verbindungen sind starke Nervengifte, die die menschliche Gesundheit gef\u00e4hrden, vor allem durch den Verzehr von Fisch\u201c, schreiben die Studienautoren. Weil Quecksilber im Boden vorkommt, wird das giftige Metall nat\u00fcrlicherweise durch Bodenerosion in Fl\u00fcsse eingetragen. Bisher war jedoch nicht bekannt, wie hoch der globale Quecksilber-Eintrag in Flie\u00dfgew\u00e4sser ist. \u201eFr\u00fchere Studien konzentrierten sich zwar auf die Quecksilber-Konzentrationen in der Atmosph\u00e4re, den B\u00f6den und im Meerwasser, haben dabei aber Fl\u00fcsse weitgehend \u00fcbersehen\u201c, wird Zhang in einer Mitteilung seiner Universit\u00e4t zitiert.\n\nDie Forschenden basierten ihr Modell des vorindustriellen Quecksilber-Exports aus Fl\u00fcssen in die Ozeane einerseits auf der Quecksilber-Erosion im Einzugsgebiet und andererseits auf der Transportkraft der Fl\u00fcsse. Diese wiederum h\u00e4ngt von Str\u00f6mung und Flie\u00dfgeschwindigkeit des Gew\u00e4ssers ab. Zur Kalibrierung glichen Zhang und Kollegen ihre Simulationsergebnisse f\u00fcr 1850 mit jenen Quecksilber-Werten ab, die in den Sedimentablagerungen einiger Fl\u00fcsse gemessen wurden. Die simulierten Werte waren tendenziell etwas niedriger als die gemessenen Konzentrationen, sodass das Modell eine eher konservative Sch\u00e4tzung ist.\n\nF\u00fcr 1850, also zu Beginn der Industrialisierung, gelangten den Kalkulationen zufolge weltweit j\u00e4hrlich etwa 390 Tonnen Quecksilber \u00fcber Fl\u00fcsse in die Ozeane. Derzeit sind es demnach rund 1000 Tonnen Quecksilber pro Jahr.\n\nSt\u00e4rkste Anstiege in Asien und Amerika\n\n\u201eDie Festlegung eines Basiswerts f\u00fcr Quecksilber in Fl\u00fcssen im vorindustriellen Zeitalter kann als wichtiger Bezugspunkt dienen\u201c, betonte Zhang. Daran k\u00f6nne sich die Politik bei der Reduzierung der Freisetzung von Quecksilber orientieren.\n\nBesonders stark stieg die Quecksilber-Menge der Studie zufolge in Fl\u00fcssen in S\u00fcdasien und S\u00fcdostasien sowie in Nord- und S\u00fcdamerika. \u201eDer Quecksilber-Haushalt des Amazonas betr\u00e4gt mittlerweile \u00fcber 200 Tonnen pro Jahr, wobei drei Viertel davon auf menschliche Aktivit\u00e4ten zur\u00fcckgehen, haupts\u00e4chlich auf Kleinbergbau\u201c, erl\u00e4uterte Zhang. Zudem trage im Amazonasgebiet die starke Abholzung zu st\u00e4rkerer Bodenerosion bei, so der Forscher. Diese f\u00fchre ebenfalls zu h\u00f6heren Quecksilber-Werten im Amazonas.\n\nAuch sibirische Fl\u00fcsse, die wie Ob und Jenissei in den Arktischen Ozean flie\u00dfen, transportieren demnach relativ viel Quecksilber ins Meer. Und erst k\u00fcrzlich hatten Forschende um Isabel Smith von der University of Southern California in Los Angeles berichtet, dass die Quecksilber-Konzentrationen in den nordamerikanischen Fl\u00fcssen Yukon und Koyukuk wegen des tauenden Permafrostbodens und der dadurch zunehmenden Bodenerosion deutlich gestiegen sind.\n\nStaud\u00e4mme halten Sedimente zur\u00fcck\n\nDoch Zhang und Kollegen berichten auch Positives: So ist der Quecksilber-Eintrag ins Mittelmeer im Vergleich zu 1850 gesunken. Dies erkl\u00e4ren sie damit dass Staud\u00e4mme im nordafrikanischen Einzugsgebiet des Nil - etwa der Assuan-Staudamm in \u00c4gypten - von Fl\u00fcssen transportierte Sedimente zur\u00fcckhalten.\n\nQuecksilber z\u00e4hlt zu den gef\u00e4hrlichsten Giftstoffen \u00fcberhaupt. Der Stoff sch\u00e4digt neben Immun- und Fortpflanzungssystem vor allem das zentrale Nervensystem, wobei ungeborene Kinder besonders empfindlich reagieren. Deshalb raten etwa die US-Beh\u00f6rden Schwangeren, bestimmte Fischarten aus manchen Gebieten zu meiden. (APA/dpa)",

        "Summary": "This article focuses on a Tulane University study about rising mercury levels in rivers. Tulane is positively mentioned for its role in conducting this research, but the overall sentiment is neutral since it focuses on the environmental issue, not Tulane's reputation.",
        "Content": "El r\u00edo Guadarrama a su paso por M\u00f3stoles, en la ribera este .\n\nLos niveles de mercurio en los r\u00edos del mundo se han m\u00e1s que duplicado desde la era preindustrial, seg\u00fan una investigaci\u00f3n de la Universidad de Tulane que es pionera en el \u00e1mbito fluvial.\n\nEl estudio, publicado en Science Advances, desarroll\u00f3 un modelo basado en procesos para simular el transporte de mercurio en los r\u00edos y descubri\u00f3 que, antes de 1850, los r\u00edos del mundo transportaban aproximadamente 390 toneladas m\u00e9tricas de mercurio a los oc\u00e9anos anualmente. Hoy en d\u00eda, esa cifra ha ascendido a unas 1.000 toneladas m\u00e9tricas al a\u00f1o, un 150 por ciento m\u00e1s.\n\nLos principales impulsores de este aumento son el vertido de aguas residuales, la erosi\u00f3n del suelo y las liberaciones de mercurio procedentes de las actividades industriales y la miner\u00eda, afirm\u00f3 el autor principal, Yanxu Zhang, profesor asociado de Ciencias de la Tierra y Ambientales en la Facultad de Ciencias e Ingenier\u00eda de Tulane.\n\n\u00abLas actividades humanas han alterado el ciclo global del mercurio en todos sus aspectos\u00bb, afirm\u00f3 Zhang en un comunicado. \u00abSi bien estudios anteriores se han centrado en las concentraciones de mercurio en la atm\u00f3sfera, el suelo y el agua de mar, han pasado por alto en gran medida los r\u00edos, una v\u00eda importante para el mercurio que se ha convertido, de hecho, en una v\u00eda de desag\u00fce para las aguas residuales de fuentes municipales e industriales\u00bb.\n\nAumentos preocupantes\n\nLos hallazgos tienen implicaciones significativas para la salud humana y la vida silvestre, ya que los compuestos de mercurio son potentes neurotoxinas que pueden acumularse en los peces y representar riesgos para la salud a trav\u00e9s del consumo. Los investigadores se\u00f1alan que los r\u00edos cercanos a h\u00e1bitats cr\u00edticos para la vida silvestre, incluyendo las principales rutas migratorias de aves en Asia Oriental y Am\u00e9rica del Norte, han experimentado aumentos preocupantes en los niveles de mercurio.\n\n\u00abEl establecimiento de una l\u00ednea de base para el mercurio ribere\u00f1o durante la era preindustrial puede servir como un punto de referencia clave\u00bb, afirm\u00f3 Zhang, se\u00f1alando que podr\u00eda proporcionar objetivos para acuerdos internacionales como el Convenio de Minamata sobre el Mercurio, cuyo objetivo es reducir la contaminaci\u00f3n global por mercurio.\n\nEl equipo de investigaci\u00f3n de Tulane cre\u00f3 un modelo inform\u00e1tico detallado llamado MOSART-Hg para simular el transporte de mercurio preindustrial de la tierra a los oc\u00e9anos a trav\u00e9s de los sistemas fluviales. Sus hallazgos coincidieron estrechamente con las concentraciones de mercurio encontradas en muestras de n\u00facleos de sedimentos datados de zonas costeras de todo el mundo, lo que valida su enfoque.\n\nLos patrones regionales revelaron que los aumentos m\u00e1s dr\u00e1sticos en la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio se produjeron en Am\u00e9rica del Norte y del Sur, que contribuyen con el 41 % del crecimiento mundial del mercurio fluvial desde 1850, seguidas del Sudeste Asi\u00e1tico (22 %) y el Sur de Asia (19 %).\n\nEl estudio identific\u00f3 la miner\u00eda de oro artesanal y en peque\u00f1a escala (MAPE) como un contribuyente particularmente significativo a la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio en Am\u00e9rica del Sur, el Sudeste Asi\u00e1tico y partes de \u00c1frica.\n\nEn la regi\u00f3n amaz\u00f3nica, por ejemplo, los niveles de mercurio se han disparado debido tanto al aumento de la erosi\u00f3n del suelo por la deforestaci\u00f3n como a las liberaciones de mercurio derivadas de las actividades mineras.\n\n\u00abEl balance de mercurio del r\u00edo Amazonas supera actualmente las 200 toneladas m\u00e9tricas anuales, y tres cuartas partes de este provienen de actividades humanas, principalmente de la MAPE\u00bb, afirm\u00f3 Zhang.\n\nLas liberaciones industriales de mercurio se identificaron como el principal impulsor de los aumentos en regiones como Asia Oriental, donde los r\u00edos de China aportan m\u00e1s del 70 % del mercurio regional. El flujo de mercurio del r\u00edo Yangts\u00e9 se ha m\u00e1s que duplicado con respecto a los niveles preindustriales.\n\nMenos en el Mediterr\u00e1neo\n\nSin embargo, no todas las regiones experimentaron aumentos. La regi\u00f3n mediterr\u00e1nea experiment\u00f3 niveles de mercurio m\u00e1s bajos en comparaci\u00f3n con la \u00e9poca preindustrial, lo que los investigadores atribuyen a la construcci\u00f3n de presas como la Presa Alta de Asu\u00e1n en el r\u00edo Nilo, que retienen sedimentos cargados de mercurio.\n\nLas concentraciones fluviales de mercurio podr\u00edan servir como un indicador de respuesta r\u00e1pida para evaluar la eficacia de la gesti\u00f3n de la contaminaci\u00f3n por mercurio a medida que los pa\u00edses trabajan para reducir las emisiones de mercurio y restaurar los entornos contaminados, afirm\u00f3.\n\nEl estudio tambi\u00e9n cuenta con la participaci\u00f3n de colaboradores internacionales de la Universidad de California en San Diego, la Universidad Forestal de Pek\u00edn, el Servicio Geol\u00f3gico de Estados Unidos y G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse.\n\nM\u00e1s temas:\n\nContaminaci\u00f3n\n\nR\u00edos\n\nMercurio",

        "Published": "2025-06-14T13:03:40Z",
        "Summary": "This article details the resignation of a Tulane University scientist who alleges censorship of research related to pollution and racial disparities. The negative sentiment stems from the accusations of censorship and prioritizing political appeasement over academic freedom.  Tulane is mentioned throughout the article as the institution at the heart of the controversy.",
        "Content": "Freedom of speech Pollution See all topics Follow\n\nA Tulane University researcher resigned Wednesday, citing censorship from university leaders who had warned that her advocacy and research exposing the Louisiana petrochemical industry\u2019s health impacts and racial disparities in hiring had triggered blowback from donors and elected officials.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Kimberly Terrell accused the university of sacrificing academic freedom to appease Louisiana\u2019s Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. Terrell, the director of community engagement at Tulane\u2019s Environmental Law Clinic claimed the clinic had been \u201cplaced under a complete gag order\u201d that barred her from making public statements about her research.\n\nAccording to emails obtained by The Associated Press, university leaders wrote that the work of the law clinic had become an \u201cimpediment\u201d to a Tulane redevelopment project reliant on support from state and private funders. The clinic represents communities fighting the petrochemical industry in court.\n\nKate Kelly, a Landry spokesperson, denied that the governor threatened to withhold state funding.\n\n\u201cI cannot remain silent as this university sacrifices academic integrity for political appeasement and pet projects,\u201d Terrell wrote. \u201cOur work is too important, and the stakes are too high, to sit back and watch special interests replace scholarship with censorship.\u201d\n\nTerrell said she resigned \u201cto protect the work and interests\u201d of the clinic.\n\nTulane spokesperson Michael Strecker said in an emailed statement that the university \u201cis fully committed to academic freedom and the strong pedagogical value of law clinics.\u201d He declined to comment on \u201cpersonnel matters.\u201d\n\nElected officials concerned about environmental law clinic\u2019s work\n\nMany of the clinic\u2019s clients are located along the heavily industrialized 85-mile (137-kilometer) stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge commonly referred to by environmental groups as \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d\n\nMarcilynn Burke, dean of Tulane\u2019s law school, wrote in a May 4 email to clinic staff that Tulane University President Michael Fitts worried the clinic\u2019s work threatened to tank support for the university\u2019s long-sought efforts to redevelop New Orleans\u2019 historic Charity Hospital as part of a downtown expansion.\n\n\u201cElected officials and major donors have cited the clinic as an impediment to them lending their support to the university generally and this project specifically,\u201d Burke wrote.\n\nBurke did not respond to an emailed request for comment Wednesday.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Terrell wrote that she had been told the governor \u201cthreatened to veto\u201d any state funding for the expansion project unless Tulane\u2019s president \u201cdid something\u201d about the clinic.\n\nBarred from media interviews\n\nA 2022 study Terrell co-authored found higher cancer rates in Black or impoverished communities in Louisiana. Another study she published last year linked toxic air pollution in Louisiana with premature births and lower weight in newborns.\n\nIn April, Terrell published research showing that Black people received significantly less jobs in the petrochemical industry than white people in Louisiana despite having similar levels of training and education.\n\nMedia coverage of the April study coincided with a visit by Tulane leaders to Louisiana\u2019s capitol to lobby elected officials in support of university projects. Shortly after, Burke, the law school\u2019s dean, told clinic staff in an email that \u201call external communications\u201d such as social media posts and media interviews \u201cmust be pre-approved by me.\u201d\n\nEmails from May show that Burke denied requests from Terrell to make comments in response to various media requests, correspondence and speaking engagements, saying they were not \u201cessential functions of the job.\u201d\n\nOn May 12, Terrell filed a complaint with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, claiming that her academic freedom had been violated. The agency, which accredits Tulane, did not comment.\n\nUniversity leaders concerned about clinic\u2019s advocacy\n\nIn a May 21 audio recording obtained by the AP, Provost Robin Forman said that when Tulane leadership met with elected officials in April, they were pressed as to why \u201c\u2018Tulane has taken a stand on the chemical industry as harming communities\u2019,\u201d and this \u201cleft people feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nBurke said in an email that university leaders had misgivings about a press release in which a community activist represented by Terrell\u2019s clinic is quoted as saying that petrochemical companies \u201cprioritize profit over people.\u201d Burke noted that Fitts was concerned about the clinic\u2019s science-based advocacy program, and Terrell\u2019s work in particular which he worried had veered \u201cinto lobbying.\u201d Burke said Fitts required an explanation of \u201chow the study about racial disparities relates directly to client representation.\u201d\n\nThe clinic cites the study in a legal filing opposing a proposed chemical plant beside a predominantly Black neighborhood, arguing the community would be burdened with a disproportionate amount of pollution and less than a fair share of the jobs.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s annual report highlighted its representation of a group of residents in a historic Black community who halted a massive grain terminal that would have been built around 300 feet from their homes.\n\nThe provost viewed the clinic\u2019s annual report \u201cas bragging that the clinic has shut down development,\u201d Burke said in an email.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Terrell warned colleagues that she felt Tulane\u2019s leaders \u201chave chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.\u201d",

Researchers at Boston\u2019s Tufts University said Monday that drinking one to two cups of caffeinated coffee a day was tied to a lower risk of all causes of death and particularly death from cardiovascular disease.\n\nThey found that black coffee and coffee with low levels of added sugar and saturated fat were associated with a 14 percent lower risk. But the same link was not observed for coffee with high amounts of added sugar and saturated fat.\n\n\u201cCoffee is among the most-consumed beverages in the world, and with nearly half of American adults reporting drinking at least one cup per day, it\u2019s important for us to know what it might mean for health,\u201d Fang Fang Zhang, the Neely Family Professor at the Friedman School, said in a statement. \u201cThe health benefits of coffee might be attributable to its bioactive compounds, but our results suggest that the addition of sugar and saturated fat may reduce the mortality benefits.\u201d\n\nZhang was the senior author of the National Institutes of Health-supported study, which was published on Monday in The Journal of Nutrition.\n\nopen image in gallery Coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of all causes of death, researchers at Tufts University say. Drinking up to three cups can be beneficial ( Getty/iStock )\n\nIn the observational study, the authors analyzed data from nine consecutive cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, examining 46,000 adults above the age of 20 who completed a valid assessment of what they had consumed over the course of 24 hours on the first day of the study. The data was recorded from 1999 to 2018.\n\nUltimately, they found that drinking one cup of coffee daily was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of death. That risk rose by a percentage when drinking two-to-three cups. But, more cups didn\u2019t have additional effects, and the link between coffee and a lower risk of death by cardiovascular disease weakened when coffee consumption was more than three cups per day.\n\nopen image in gallery Drinking one to two cups of coffee with low levels of added sugar and saturated fat was associated with a 14 percent lower risk of death. Black coffee was associated with the same lower risk ( Getty/iStock )\n\nThe research builds on previous research supporting the conclusions from Tulane University. A decade-long study of 40,000 American adults found that people who were specifically morning coffee drinkers were 31 percent less likely to die of cardiovascular disease and 16 percent less likely to die earlier of any cause than those who drank no coffee.\n\n\u201cFew studies have examined how coffee additives could impact the link between coffee consumption and mortality risk, and our study is among the first to quantify how much sweetener and saturated fat are being added,\u201d first author Dr. Bingjie Zhou said. \u201cOur results align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which recommend limiting added sugar and saturated fat.\u201d",

        "Summary": "This article features an interview with Ashley Francis, assistant dean at Tulane's Freeman School of Business, discussing the launch of a new online MBA program.  The interview showcases Tulane's commitment to innovation in education and its strategic approach to expanding its reach to working professionals. Tulane's proactive approach to online learning is positively portrayed. Tulane is mentioned numerous times.",
        "Content": "Tulane University\u2019s Freeman School of Business recently launched its first fully online M.B.A. program, marking a significant step in expanding its offerings for working professionals. As assistant dean at the Stewart Center for Professional and Executive Education, Ashley Francis plays a pivotal role in shaping and overseeing these programs. With a background in online learning and program development, she brings deep expertise in designing market-competitive programs that maintain Tulane\u2019s unique academic experience.\n\nI wanted to sit down with Ashley to learn more about the strategy behind launching an online M.B.A. at Tulane\u2019s Freeman School of Business, how the program distinguishes itself in a competitive landscape and what universities should consider when developing online offerings.\n\nQ: Why did Tulane\u2019s Freeman School of Business decide to launch an online M.B.A. and how did you approach designing a program that stands out in an increasingly competitive market?\n\nA: Tulane University\u2019s Freeman School of Business launched its online M.B.A. program as part of a comprehensive strategy complementing the school\u2019s portfolio of programs directed towards working professionals and meeting students where they are. It was conceptualized in response to both an evolving institutional culture and a clear demand for accessible, high-quality business education.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this momentum. With support from Dean Paulo Goes and our partnership with AllCampus, Tulane\u2019s Freeman School of Business was able to build a rigorous and forward-thinking program.\n\nWhat sets Freeman\u2019s online M.B.A. apart is its commitment to academic excellence, flexibility and support. The curriculum is designed specifically for working professionals, offering the same tenured faculty who teach on campus\u2014a rarity among online programs, which often rely on adjunct instructors. The program underwent a rigorous four-month development process to ensure that our curricula offered engaging, culturally rich courses. We specifically structured a program with reduced credits to help lower cost and time to completion.\n\nThe Freeman School\u2019s online M.B.A. program is not only competitive but it\u2019s also deeply student-centric. We offer unique, customized career support and access to tutoring services that not many other programs offer. While being competitive in the market was a top priority, ultimately the onus was on us to create a program that truly benefited students.\n\nQ: When selecting an online program management partner, what key factors did Tulane\u2019s Freeman School of Business consider? Why was working with an OPM important to you?\n\nA: We went into the OPM selection process knowing the values and capabilities of working with an OPM and that this partnership style would set our online M.B.A. up for the most success. At their best, OPMs are sophisticated, passionate and willing to invest in the success of the program. At the same time, my previous experiences with OPMs had left me feeling wary and cautious when choosing our partner.\n\nFor the new online M.B.A. program, we ended up going with AllCampus, and they\u2019ve absolutely met my high expectations. Tulane\u2019s Freeman School of Business was seeking a true partner\u2014one that would collaborate deeply, offer full transparency and share in the school\u2019s mission for success and AllCampus has embraced those values fully.\n\nMy advice to other higher education leaders considering working with an OPM would be to build a relationship framed around mutual commitment and trust, with a shared goal of creating a standout program. Having a hands-on partnership allowed us to move quickly and tactfully when launching a high-quality program.\n\nQ: Tulane University is deeply connected to the culture and identity of New Orleans. How does the online M.B.A. program incorporate that sense of place and community for students logging in from around the country?\n\nA: Tulane\u2019s Freeman online M.B.A. is infused with the spirit of New Orleans, bringing the city\u2019s vibrancy and community-driven ethos into the virtual classroom. One of the core pillars of the program is \u201cbringing the joy of New Orleans\u201d to students\u2014wherever they are. Rather than creating a hypercompetitive environment, the Freeman School fosters a sense of belonging and cultural richness, helping students feel the NOLA experience even if they never set foot on campus.\n\nThis is accomplished through course design, community engagement strategies and faculty involvement that reflect our university\u2019s values and strengths. Our courses embed the city\u2019s ethos and leverage our expertise in energy, supply chain, brand management and entrepreneurial resilience. Tulane\u2019s brand affinity, loyal alumni network and supportive student services\u2014such as a dedicated career management center and a financial aid adviser\u2014all contribute to building a connected environment. The result is a program that not only educates but also inspires a lifelong connection to the Tulane community and the unique culture of New Orleans.",

Terrell, the director of community engagement at Tulane\u2019s Environmental Law Clinic claimed the clinic had been \u201cplaced under a complete gag order\u201d that barred her from making public statements about her research.\n\nAccording to emails obtained by The Associated Press, university leaders wrote that the work of the law clinic had become an \u201cimpediment\u201d to a Tulane redevelopment project reliant on support from state and private funders. The clinic represents communities fighting the petrochemical industry in court.\n\nKate Kelly, a Landry spokesperson, denied that the governor threatened to withhold state funding.\n\n\u201cI cannot remain silent as this university sacrifices academic integrity for political appeasement and pet projects,\u201d Terrell wrote. \u201cOur work is too important, and the stakes are too high, to sit back and watch special interests replace scholarship with censorship.\u201d\n\nTerrell said she resigned \u201cto protect the work and interests\u201d of the clinic.\n\nTulane spokesperson Michael Strecker said in an emailed statement that the university \u201cis fully committed to academic freedom and the strong pedagogical value of law clinics.\u201d He declined to comment on \u201cpersonnel matters.\u201d\n\nElected officials concerned about environmental law clinic\u2019s work\n\nMany of the clinic\u2019s clients are located along the heavily industrialized 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge commonly referred to by environmental groups as \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d\n\nMarcilynn Burke, dean of Tulane\u2019s law school, wrote in a May 4 email to clinic staff that Tulane University President Michael Fitts worried the clinic\u2019s work threatened to tank support for the university\u2019s long-sought efforts to redevelop New Orleans\u2019 historic Charity Hospital as part of a downtown expansion.\n\n\u201cElected officials and major donors have cited the clinic as an impediment to them lending their support to the university generally and this project specifically,\u201d Burke wrote.\n\nBurke did not respond to an emailed request for comment Wednesday.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Terrell wrote that she had been told the governor \u201cthreatened to veto\u201d any state funding for the expansion project unless Tulane\u2019s president \u201cdid something\u201d about the clinic.\n\nBarred from media interviews\n\nA 2022 study Terrell co-authored found higher cancer rates in Black or impoverished communities in Louisiana. Another study she published last year linked toxic air pollution in Louisiana with premature births and lower weight in newborns.\n\nIn April, Terrell published research showing that Black people received significantly less jobs in the petrochemical industry than white people in Louisiana despite having similar levels of training and education.\n\nMedia coverage of the April study coincided with a visit by Tulane leaders to Louisiana\u2019s capitol to lobby elected officials in support of university projects. Shortly after, Burke, the law school\u2019s dean, told clinic staff in an email that \u201call external communications\u201d such as social media posts and media interviews \u201cmust be pre-approved by me.\u201d\n\nEmails from May show that Burke denied requests from Terrell to make comments in response to various media requests, correspondence and speaking engagements, saying they were not \u201cessential functions of the job.\u201d\n\nOn May 12, Terrell filed a complaint with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, claiming that her academic freedom had been violated. The agency, which accredits Tulane, did not comment.\n\nUniversity leaders concerned about clinic\u2019s advocacy\n\nIn a May 21 audio recording obtained by the AP, Provost Robin Forman said that when Tulane leadership met with elected officials in April, they were pressed as to why \u201c\u2018Tulane has taken a stand on the chemical industry as harming communities\u2019,\u201d and this \u201cleft people feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nBurke said in an email that university leaders had misgivings about a press release in which a community activist represented by Terrell\u2019s clinic is quoted as saying that petrochemical companies \u201cprioritize profit over people.\u201d Burke noted that Fitts was concerned about the clinic\u2019s science-based advocacy program, and Terrell\u2019s work in particular which he worried had veered \u201cinto lobbying.\u201d Burke said Fitts required an explanation of \u201chow the study about racial disparities relates directly to client representation.\u201d\n\nThe clinic cites the study in a legal filing opposing a proposed chemical plant beside a predominantly Black neighborhood, arguing the community would be burdened with a disproportionate amount of pollution and less than a fair share of the jobs.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s annual report highlighted its representation of a group of residents in a historic Black community who halted a massive grain terminal that would have been built around 300 feet from their homes.\n\nThe provost viewed the clinic\u2019s annual report \u201cas bragging that the clinic has shut down development,\u201d Burke said in an email.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Terrell warned colleagues that she felt Tulane\u2019s leaders \u201chave chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.\u201d\n\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

        "Content": "When you tackle historical nonfiction, you're offering doing more than simply putting to paper the events of the past. In author and journalist Robert Fieseler's experience, it meant hunting down sealed documents from a state that never wanted this history exposed, and it meant uncovering hundreds of names redacted from records and conducting countless hours of interviews\u2014all before the actual writing takes place.\n\nIn this episode of \"Writer's Digest Presents,\" editor Michael Woodson sits down with Robert to discuss his new book American Scare: Florida's Hidden Cold War on Black and Queer Lives (on sale today), how he infuses literary sensibilities to his historical nonfiction, and more.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRobert Fieseler\n\nRobert W. Fieseler is a journalist investigating marginalized groups and a scholar excavating forgotten histories. A National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association Journalist of the Year and recipient of the Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship, his debut book Tinderbox won seven awards, including the Edgar Award, and his reporting has appeared in Slate, Commonweal, and River Teeth, among others. Fieseler graduated co-valedictorian from the Columbia Journalism School and is pursuing a PhD at Tulane University as a Mellon Fellow. He lives with his husband on the gayest street in New Orleans.\n\nBookshop | Amazon\n\n[WD uses affiliate links.]\n\nFrom the Episode\n\nOn Choosing What to Write About: \"It's a lot like falling in love, but from a horrific standpoint, because you're dealing with history. It's typically something that engages me intellectually while simultaneously taking this side door into my heart in a way where I can't stop obsessing about it.\"\n\n\"I have this problem that I've had since I was very little where I want to know the story that others don't want me to know. That's the juicy stuff! That's the gay gossip!\"\n\nOn Incorporating Fiction Craft Practices In Literary Nonfiction: \"I love nonfiction that can employ literary and aesthetic sensibilities, where they have respect for the line, for the musicality of language, where they have a respect for and an understanding of mood and atmosphere, which is very difficult to communicate to an academic historian, but I think it matters. I also love plotting, set-up and pay-off, introducing threads and paying them off later. And I like the way that literature allows for revelation\u2014where there's just moments where you feel like you're entire body's lit up.\"\n\nListen To The Episode",

        "Summary": "This article highlights the economic growth of New Orleans, mentioning Tulane University among other universities contributing to the city's growing tech sector by providing a steady stream of educated workers. The overall sentiment towards Tulane is highly positive, portrayed as a valuable asset to the city's economic development. Tulane is mentioned as a positive factor in the city's growth.",
        "Content": "New Orleans has always been known for its vibrant culture, incredible food scene, and world-famous Mardi Gras celebrations. But lately, the Crescent City is gaining attention for an entirely different reason: it\u2019s quietly becoming one of America\u2019s most promising investment destinations. From skyrocketing real estate values to booming tech startups, New Orleans is experiencing an economic renaissance that has investors taking notice.\n\nThe transformation didn\u2019t happen overnight. Years of strategic planning, massive infrastructure investments, and a renewed focus on economic diversification have positioned New Orleans as a serious contender in the investment world. The city that once relied heavily on tourism and oil is now attracting billions in private investment across multiple sectors, creating opportunities that savvy investors are beginning to recognize.\n\nWhat makes this particularly interesting is that New Orleans still offers relatively affordable entry points compared to traditional investment hotspots like Austin, Nashville, or Miami. This combination of growth potential and accessibility is creating a perfect storm for investors looking for the next big opportunity.\n\nReal estate market shows explosive growth\n\nThe New Orleans real estate market has experienced remarkable growth over the past three years, with property values increasing at rates that rival some of the country\u2019s most expensive markets. The median home price has jumped from approximately $195,000 in 2021 to an estimated $245,000 in 2024, representing a nearly 26% increase in just three years.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving this growth extends beyond simple supply and demand. The city has attracted a wave of remote workers and young professionals who discovered New Orleans during the pandemic and decided to stay. These newcomers, often with higher incomes than traditional local residents, have increased demand for quality housing while bringing fresh energy to neighborhoods throughout the city.\n\nRental markets have been particularly strong, with annual rent growth averaging 8.2% over the past two years. This growth stems partly from the city\u2019s recovery in tourism, which has increased demand for short-term rentals, but also from the influx of new residents who need housing while they establish themselves in the city.\n\nNeighborhoods like the Marigny, Bywater, and Central City have seen particularly dramatic appreciation, with some areas experiencing property value increases of 40% or more since 2020. Even traditionally overlooked areas like Algiers Point and the Irish Channel are attracting attention from developers and investors who see potential for significant returns.\n\nTechnology sector gains serious momentum\n\nNew Orleans has been quietly building a robust technology ecosystem that\u2019s now beginning to pay dividends for investors. The city\u2019s tech sector has grown by approximately 15% annually over the past three years, with startups and established companies choosing New Orleans for its lower operating costs, available talent, and supportive business environment.\n\nThe presence of major universities, including Tulane, Loyola, and the University of New Orleans, provides a steady stream of educated workers, while the city\u2019s lower cost of living helps companies attract talent from more expensive markets. Several major companies have established significant operations in New Orleans, bringing high-paying jobs and spurring additional investment in the sector.\n\nThe city has also become a hub for fintech and logistics technology companies, leveraging its position as a major port city and its connections to international trade. These companies are developing solutions for supply chain management, international commerce, and financial services that serve markets far beyond Louisiana.\n\nGaming and entertainment technology represents another growing sector, building on New Orleans\u2019 reputation as an entertainment destination. Companies developing virtual reality experiences, gaming platforms, and digital entertainment solutions have found New Orleans offers both the creative environment they need and the technical infrastructure to support their growth.\n\nInfrastructure investments create foundation for growth\n\nNew Orleans has committed unprecedented resources to infrastructure improvements that are creating the foundation for sustained economic growth. The most visible of these investments is the $2.1 billion French Quarter revitalization project, which aims to preserve the historic character of the area while upgrading utilities, improving drainage, and enhancing the visitor experience.\n\nThe Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport recently completed a $1 billion modernization that has significantly increased the city\u2019s capacity to handle both business and leisure travelers. The new terminal has already attracted additional airline routes and has positioned New Orleans as a more attractive destination for business conferences and conventions.\n\nPort infrastructure improvements represent another major investment area. The Port of New Orleans handles approximately $80 billion in cargo value annually, making it one of the most important ports in the United States. Recent expansions and improvements have increased capacity and efficiency, attracting additional shipping companies and logistics providers to establish operations in the area.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the city has invested heavily in flood protection and drainage improvements. The $14.5 billion in flood protection infrastructure completed since Hurricane Katrina has significantly reduced the risk of major flooding, making the city more attractive to businesses and residents who were previously concerned about weather-related risks.\n\nEnergy sector transitions create new opportunities\n\nNew Orleans is positioning itself at the center of America\u2019s energy transition, creating investment opportunities in both traditional and renewable energy sectors. The city\u2019s location along the Gulf Coast makes it an ideal hub for offshore wind development, and several major projects are already in various stages of planning and development.\n\nThe traditional energy sector remains strong, with New Orleans serving as a headquarters for numerous oil and gas companies. However, many of these companies are diversifying into renewable energy, creating opportunities for investors interested in companies that are successfully managing the energy transition.\n\nThe port\u2019s role in energy is also evolving, with new facilities being developed to handle liquefied natural gas exports and renewable energy equipment imports. These infrastructure investments are attracting energy companies and creating jobs in both construction and long-term operations.\n\nCarbon capture and storage technology represents another emerging opportunity, with several companies developing solutions to reduce industrial emissions. New Orleans\u2019 industrial base and geological features make it an attractive location for these technologies, and early investments in this sector could prove highly profitable as regulations and market demand increase.\n\nTourism and entertainment sector rebounds strongly\n\nThe tourism and entertainment sector, which was devastated by the pandemic, has not only recovered but is showing signs of growth beyond pre-pandemic levels. Annual tourism revenue has returned to approximately $9.5 billion, and visitors are spending more per trip than they did before 2020.\n\nThe city has used the pandemic recovery period to upgrade and diversify its entertainment offerings. New music venues, restaurants, and cultural attractions have opened, while existing businesses have expanded and improved their facilities. This diversification has made New Orleans less dependent on traditional tourism patterns and more resilient to future disruptions.\n\nFilm and television production has become a major economic driver, with Louisiana\u2019s generous tax incentives attracting productions that bring millions of dollars in spending to the local economy. This industry has created jobs not just for actors and crew members, but for local businesses that provide services to productions.\n\nThe food and beverage industry has also seen significant investment, with new restaurants, breweries, and food production facilities opening throughout the city. New Orleans\u2019 reputation for culinary excellence has attracted investors interested in scaling local food concepts nationally or developing new products that capture the city\u2019s unique flavors.\n\nHealthcare and biotech sectors show promise\n\nNew Orleans has emerged as a regional healthcare hub, with major medical centers and research institutions attracting investment in both traditional healthcare and biotechnology. The presence of world-class medical facilities has created opportunities for companies developing medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare technology solutions.\n\nThe city\u2019s universities have strong research programs in medicine and biological sciences, creating a pipeline of innovation that attracts both startup investment and corporate research and development spending. Several biotech companies have chosen New Orleans as their headquarters, taking advantage of lower operating costs and access to research talent.\n\nTelemedicine and digital health solutions represent particularly promising areas, as companies develop technologies to serve both urban and rural populations throughout the Gulf South region. The pandemic accelerated adoption of these technologies, creating market opportunities that New Orleans companies are well-positioned to address.\n\nChallenges and considerations for investors\n\nDespite the positive trends, potential investors should be aware of challenges that could affect returns. Climate risk remains a significant concern, even with improved flood protection infrastructure. Rising sea levels and increasingly severe storms could impact property values and business operations over the long term.\n\nThe city\u2019s population has not fully recovered to pre-Katrina levels, which limits the local market size for many businesses. While the metropolitan area includes 1.27 million people, the city proper has approximately 384,000 residents, which may not be sufficient to support certain types of businesses without serving regional or national markets.\n\nCrime rates in certain areas remain higher than national averages, which can affect property values and business operations. However, many of the neighborhoods seeing the most investment have experienced significant improvements in public safety.\n\nThe local political and regulatory environment can be complex, with multiple layers of government oversight that may slow development projects or increase costs. Investors should factor these considerations into their planning and budgeting.\n\nMarket timing and future outlook\n\nThe current investment environment in New Orleans appears to offer a favorable risk-to-reward ratio for investors willing to take a long-term view. Property values and business opportunities are still accessible compared to other growing markets, but trends suggest this window may not remain open indefinitely.\n\nSeveral major infrastructure projects are scheduled for completion over the next five years, which should provide additional catalysts for growth. The energy transition, technology sector expansion, and continued tourism recovery all point to sustained economic growth that should benefit early investors.\n\nThe key for potential investors is identifying opportunities that align with the city\u2019s long-term growth trends while avoiding areas or sectors that may be overvalued or face significant challenges. Success will likely come from understanding both the unique advantages New Orleans offers and the specific risks that come with investing in an emerging market.\n\nNew Orleans appears to be at a inflection point where years of planning and investment are beginning to pay dividends. For investors willing to do their research and take a measured approach, the Crescent City may indeed represent the next hot investment zone in America. The combination of cultural appeal, economic diversification, and relative affordability creates a compelling case that more investors are beginning to recognize.",

Researchers at Boston\u2019s Tufts University said Monday that drinking one to two cups of caffeinated coffee a day was tied to a lower risk of all causes of death and particularly death from cardiovascular disease.\n\nThey found that black coffee and coffee with low levels of added sugar and saturated fat were associated with a 14 percent lower risk. But the same link was not observed for coffee with high amounts of added sugar and saturated fat.\n\n\u201cCoffee is among the most-consumed beverages in the world, and with nearly half of American adults reporting drinking at least one cup per day, it\u2019s important for us to know what it might mean for health,\u201d Fang Fang Zhang, the Neely Family Professor at the Friedman School, said in a statement. \u201cThe health benefits of coffee might be attributable to its bioactive compounds, but our results suggest that the addition of sugar and saturated fat may reduce the mortality benefits.\u201d\n\nZhang was the senior author of the National Institutes of Health-supported study, which was published on Monday in The Journal of Nutrition.\n\nopen image in gallery Coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of all causes of death, researchers at Tufts University say. Drinking up to three cups can be beneficial ( Getty/iStock )\n\nIn the observational study, the authors analyzed data from nine consecutive cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, examining 46,000 adults above the age of 20 who completed a valid assessment of what they had consumed over the course of 24 hours on the first day of the study. The data was recorded from 1999 to 2018.\n\nUltimately, they found that drinking one cup of coffee daily was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of death. That risk rose by a percentage when drinking two-to-three cups. But, more cups didn\u2019t have additional effects, and the link between coffee and a lower risk of death by cardiovascular disease weakened when coffee consumption was more than three cups per day.\n\nopen image in gallery Drinking one to two cups of coffee with low levels of added sugar and saturated fat was associated with a 14 percent lower risk of death.

A decade-long study of 40,000 American adults found that people who were specifically morning coffee drinkers were 31 percent less likely to die of cardiovascular disease and 16 percent less likely to die earlier of any cause than those who drank no coffee.\n\n\u201cFew studies have examined how coffee additives could impact the link between coffee consumption and mortality risk, and our study is among the first to quantify how much sweetener and saturated fat are being added,\u201d first author Dr. Bingjie Zhou said. \u201cOur results align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which recommend limiting added sugar and saturated fat.\u201d",

        "Summary": "This article ranks high school quarterbacks based on their potential fit within different college football systems. Tulane is mentioned briefly as the former university of a college coach. The mention is neutral and has no bearing on the reputation of Tulane.",
        "Content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe Elite 11 Finals annually spotlight the nation's top high school quarterbacks, offering a firsthand look at how the next wave of signal-callers stacks up against elite competition.\n\nWith most participants already committed, it's a valuable window into how these prospects will fit into their future college systems and translate to the next level. Here are the top 10 committed quarterbacks attending the event later this month ranked by system fit.\n\n1. Faizon Brandon, Tennessee\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 8\n\nTennessee's scheme is plug-and-play friendly and fits Brandon's big arm and sneaky mobility. There's a clear trend emerging in Knoxville when it comes to quarterback traits in terms of stature, athleticism and arm strength. Brandon checks all three boxes. He's very similar to former Vols standout Hendon Hooker and is further along developmentally than Hooker was at Brandon's age. Though not quite as polished as Nico Iamaleava coming out of high school, Brandon throws a great deep ball, which Tennessee coach Josh Heupel requires from all his quarterbacks. By the time he arrives on campus, it's likely at least one quarterback currently on the Tennessee roster will have hit the transfer portal.\n\nOne week from today the @Elite11 Finals get underway \u23f3 UCReport will have on-site coverage. Looking forward to seeing plenty of high-level quarterbacks and evaluating how they'll fit in their college system. Among those is 5-star Tennessee commit Faizon Brandon who was... pic.twitter.com/kXFh2QojIJ - Billy Tucker (@TheUCReport) June 10, 2025\n\n2. Terry Walker III, Duke\n\nESPN 300 ranking: N/A -- three-star\n\nDuke offensive coordinator Jonathan Brewer is looking for a run-pass option quarterback with consistent accuracy and high-level production in the run game. Walker is that guy. He's strikingly similar to Darian Mensah, the quarterback Duke brought in via the transfer portal, only Walker has a stronger arm. The Blue Devils want a dynamic runner at quarterback -- something former QB Maalik Murphy wasn't -- and that's what Walker is. A true playmaker, he also has a sky-high ceiling for development as a passer. Walker's commitment is more evidence that the perception of Duke is shifting among top-tier recruits.\n\n3. Jake Fette, Arizona State\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 157\n\nIt's easy to see why Arizona State's coaching staff loves Fette considering he's a mirror image of current quarterback Sam Leavitt. Fette is a sandlot-style riverboat gambler who thrives when the play breaks down. He looks like a pocket passer, but has the athleticism of a runner and can stress defenses with his legs. Coach Kenny Dillingham will use a lot of smoke and mirrors with shifts, motions, personnel groupings and backfield action to maximize Fette's dynamic skill set and make him a threat both inside and outside the pocket.\n\n4. Dia Bell, Texas\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 6\n\nBell enters an ideal situation. The Longhorns don't need to rush him, and instead can allow him to develop at his own pace. His fit is quite akin to Arch Manning's, and if Bell follows a similar blueprint he will get bigger, stronger and more mature over time. He already displays the tools of a high-level passer and adds value as a more capable runner than Quinn Ewers did in Steve Sarkisian's system. Bell is a naturally gifted passer with a long track record of performance against elite competition, so he is ready to make the jump.\n\n5. Dereon Coleman, Miami\n\nESPN 300 ranking: N/A -- three-star\n\nRegardless of Carson Beck's production this fall, Coleman will be able to deliver the dynamism that Miami showcased with Cam Ward at the helm, which will make the Hurricanes much more difficult to defend. Coleman is the type of player Miami will prefer at quarterback in the long run. He has moxie, a gunslinger's mentality and a live arm capable of making off-platform plays look routine. Remind you of anyone?\n\n6. Jonas Williams, USC\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 155\n\nIt's easy to see shades of former Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams when watching Jonas Williams. He's a naturally creative and improvisational quarterback. The play is never over, sometimes to a fault, but often to devastating effect. Williams can move the launch point and change arm angles, especially when asked to get the ball out quickly on screens and underneath throws. He thrives in chaos and can run the play-action offense Lincoln Riley loves to employ.\n\n7. Keisean Henderson, Houston\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 16\n\nHenderson is another signal-caller with similarities to Darian Mensah, who played for current Houston coach Willie Fritz at Tulane. Landing Henderson was a huge win for Fritz. Henderson is a terrific athlete who can reach 20.6 mph max speed, an elite number for a quarterback. We're intrigued to see whether he sticks at quarterback or moves to another position. For that reason, he's more of a developmental player who needs to get more consistent in the passing game, but he has a high ceiling regardless of position.\n\n8. Troy Huhn, Penn State\n\nESPN 300 ranking: 198\n\nAt 6-foot-4 and 215 pounds, Huhn has the kind of stature coach James Franklin and offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki love. Though not as mobile as Drew Allar, Huhn is very athletic in the pocket. He can extend plays and shows strong anticipation off play-action. Huhn loves to play under center, which is a valuable trait in a Penn State offense that blends shotgun and traditional looks. With a scheme that frequently shifts the launch point through varied play-action concepts, Huhn's footwork and functional mobility make him a natural fit.\n\n9. Travis Burgess, North Carolina\n\nESPN 300 ranking: N/A -- three-star\n\nIt's still unclear exactly what North Carolina's offense will look like under Bill Belichick, but recent quarterback additions offer a clue. The Tar Heels brought in dual-threat options in South Alabama transfer Gio Lopez and 2025 commit Bryce Baker. Neither is a traditional pocket passer, nor is Burgess. He's a great get for North Carolina with his athleticism, live arm, quick release and developmental upside. He also won't be thrust into action immediately. Once the staff understands his strengths, he's the kind of player it can build a system around. Though not as tall, he's reminiscent of NC State's CJ Bailey.\n\n10. Briggs Cherry, Louisville\n\nESPN 300 ranking: N/A -- three-star\n\nCherry is the prototypical athletic pocket passer for Jeff Brohm's system. He's decisive, releases the ball quickly and anticipates plays well. Combine that with Brohm's tried-and-true scheme, and it's easy to see why Louisville is a destination for quarterbacks such as Cherry who are looking to up their game. He is similar to Cardinals transfer quarterback Miller Moss in both skill and style. Cherry thrives in quick-game concepts, excels in the intermediate passing attack and is highly effective off deep play-action. Louisville is attractive for Cherry because it always layers good skill players around its quarterback.",

        "Content": "We are excited to share our first big milestone in solving a grand challenge that has hampered the predictive power of computational chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science for decades. By using a scalable deep-learning approach and generating an unprecedented quantity of diverse, highly accurate data, we have achieved a breakthrough in the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse method that thousands of scientists use every year to simulate matter at the atomistic level. Within the region of chemical space represented in our large training dataset, our model reaches the accuracy required to reliably predict experimental outcomes, as assessed on the well-known benchmark dataset W4-17 (opens in new tab). This removes a fundamental barrier to shifting the balance of molecule and material design from being driven by laboratory experiments to being driven by computational simulations. The implications for accelerating scientific discovery are far reaching, spanning applications from drugs to batteries and green fertilizers.\n\nWhat is DFT?\n\nMolecules and materials are made of atoms, which are held together by their electrons. These electrons act as a glue, determining the stability and properties of the chemical structure. Accurately computing the strength and properties of the electron glue is essential for predicting whether a chemical reaction will proceed, whether a candidate drug molecule will bind to its target protein, whether a material is suitable for carbon capture, or if a flow battery can be optimized for renewable energy storage. Unfortunately, a brute-force approach amounts to solving the many-electron Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which requires computation that scales exponentially with the number of electrons. Considering that an atom has dozens of electrons, and that molecules and materials have large numbers of atoms, we could easily end up waiting the age of the universe to complete our computation unless we restrict our attention to small systems with only a few atoms.\n\nDFT, introduced by Walter Kohn and collaborators in 1964-1965, was a true scientific breakthrough, earning Kohn the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998. DFT provides an extraordinary reduction in the computational cost of calculating the electron glue in an exact manner, from exponential to cubic, making it possible to perform calculations of practical value within seconds to hours.\n\nWhat is the grand challenge in DFT?\n\nBut there is a catch: the exact reformulation has a small but crucial term\u2014the exchange-correlation (XC) functional\u2014which Kohn proved is universal (i.e., the same for all molecules and materials), but for which no explicit expression is known. For 60 years, people have designed practical approximations for the XC functional. The magazine Science dubbed the gold rush to design better XC models the \u201cpursuit of the Divine Functional (opens in new tab)\u201d. With time, these approximations have grown into a zoo of hundreds of different XC functionals from which users must choose, often using experimental data as a guide. Owing to the uniquely favorable computational cost of DFT, existing functionals have enabled scientists to gain extremely useful insight into a huge variety of chemical problems. However, the limited accuracy and scope of current XC functionals mean that DFT is still mostly used to interpret experimental results rather than predict them.\n\nWhy is it important to increase the accuracy of DFT?\n\nWe can contrast the present state of computational chemistry with the state of aircraft engineering and design. Thanks to predictive simulations, aeronautical engineers no longer need to build and test thousands of prototypes to identify one viable design. However, this is exactly what we currently must do in molecular and materials sciences. We send thousands of potential candidates to the lab, because the accuracy of the computational methods is not sufficient to predict the experiments. To make a significant shift in the balance from laboratory to in silico experiments, we need to remove the fundamental bottleneck of the insufficient accuracy of present XC functionals. This amounts to bringing the error of DFT calculations with respect to experiments within chemical accuracy, which is around 1 kcal/mol for most chemical processes. Present approximations typically have errors that are 3 to 30 times larger.\n\nHow can AI make a difference?\n\nAI can transform how we model molecules and materials with DFT by learning the XC functional directly from highly accurate data. The goal is to learn how the XC functional captures the complex relationship between its input, the electron density, and its output, the XC energy. You can think of the density like a glue, with regions of space where there is a lot of it and other regions with less of it. Traditionally, researchers have built XC functional approximations using the concept of the so-called Jacob\u2019s ladder: a hierarchy of increasingly complex, hand-designed descriptors of the electron density. Including density descriptors from higher rungs of this ladder aims to improve accuracy, but it comes at the price of increased computational cost. Even the few attempts that use machine learning have stayed within this traditional paradigm, thereby taking an approach that is akin to what people were doing in computer vision and speech recognition before the deep-learning era. Progress toward better accuracy has stagnated for at least two decades with this approach.\n\nOur project is driven by the intuition that a true deep learning approach\u2014where relevant representations of the electron density are learned directly from data in a computationally scalable way\u2014has the potential to revolutionize the accuracy of DFT, much like deep learning has transformed other fields. A significant challenge with going down this path, however, is that feature or representation learning is very data-hungry, and there is very little data around\u2014too little to test this hypothesis reliably.\n\nWhat have we done in this milestone?\n\nThe first step was generating data\u2014a lot of it. This posed a major challenge, since the data must come from accurate solutions of the many-electron Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is precisely the prohibitively expensive problem that DFT is designed to replace. Fortunately, decades of progress in the scientific community have led to smarter, more efficient variants of brute-force methods, making it possible to compute reference data for small molecules at experimental accuracy. While these high-accuracy methods, also referred to as wavefunction methods, are far too costly for routine use in applications, we made a deliberate investment in them for this project. The reason? The upfront cost of generating high-quality training data is offset by the long-term benefit of enabling vast numbers of industrially relevant applications with cost effective DFT using the trained XC functional. Crucially, we rely on the ability of DFT\u2014and our learned XC functional\u2014to generalize from high-accuracy data for small systems to larger, more complex molecules.\n\nThere are many different high-accuracy wavefunction methods, each tailored to different regions of chemical space. However, their use at scale is not well established, as they require extensive expertise\u2014small methodological choices can significantly affect accuracy at the level that we target. We therefore joined forces with Prof. Amir Karton (opens in new tab) from the University of New England, Australia, a world-leading expert who developed widely recognized benchmark datasets for a fundamental thermochemical property: atomization energy\u2014the energy required to break all bonds in a molecule and separate it into individual atoms. To create a training dataset of atomization energies at unprecedented scale, our team at Microsoft built a scalable pipeline to produce highly diverse molecular structures. Using these structures and substantial Azure compute resources via Microsoft\u2019s Accelerating Foundation Models Research program (opens in new tab), Prof. Karton applied a high-accuracy wavefunction method to compute the corresponding energy labels. The result is a dataset (opens in new tab) two orders of magnitude larger than previous efforts. We are releasing a large part of this dataset (opens in new tab) to the scientific community.\n\nData generation was only half of the challenge. We also needed to design a dedicated deep-learning architecture for the XC functional\u2014one that is both computationally scalable and capable of learning meaningful representations from electron densities to accurately predict the XC energy. Our team of machine learning specialists, assisted by DFT experts, introduced a series of innovations that solve these and other challenges inherent to this complex learning problem. The result is Skala, an XC functional that generalizes to unseen molecules, reaching the accuracy needed to predict experiments. This demonstrates for the first time that deep learning can truly disrupt DFT: reaching experimental accuracy does not require the computationally expensive hand-designed features of Jacob\u2019s ladder. Instead, we can retain the original computational complexity of DFT while allowing the XC functional to learn how to extract meaningful features and predict accurate energies.\n\nWe compare the accuracy of Skala against the best existing functionals of varying computational cost. The prediction errors are evaluated on two well-known public benchmark datasets: the W4-17 dataset for atomization energies (y axis, mean absolute error) and the GMTKN55 dataset for general main-group chemistry (x axis, weighted total mean absolute deviation, or WTMAD-2 for short). Skala achieves near \u201cchemical accuracy\u201d (1 kcal/mol) on atomization energies. This is the accuracy required for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments, which, to date, no existing functional has reached. Skala works especially well on the \u201csingle reference\u201d subset of this dataset, reaching a groundbreaking 0.85 kcal/mol. On the GMTKN55 dataset, Skala shows competitive accuracy to the best-performing hybrid functionals, at a lower cost.\n\n\u201cSkala is a new density functional for the exchange-correlation energy that employs meta-GGA ingredients plus D3 dispersion and machine-learned nonlocal features of the electron density. Some exact constraints were imposed, and some others \u201cemerge\u201d from the fitting to about 150,000 accurate energy differences for sp molecules and atoms. Skala achieves high, hybrid-like accuracy on a large and diverse data set of properties of main group molecules, which has no overlap with its training set. The computational cost of Skala is higher than that of the r2SCAN meta-GGA for small molecules, but about the same for systems with 1,000 or more occupied orbitals. Its cost seems to be only 10% of the cost of standard hybrids and 1% of the cost of local hybrids. Developed by a Microsoft team of density functional theorists and deep-learning experts, Skala could be the first machine-learned density functional to compete with existing functionals for wide use in computational chemistry, and a sign of things to come in that and related fields. Skala learned from big data and was taught by insightful human scientists.\u201d \u2014 John P. Perdew, Professor of Physics, School of Science and Engineering, Tulane University\n\nThis first milestone was achieved for a challenging property in a specific region of chemical space\u2014atomization energies of main group molecules\u2014for which we generated our initial large batch of high-accuracy training data. Building on this foundation, we have started to expand our training dataset to cover a broader range of general chemistry, using our scalable in-house data generation pipeline. With the first small batch of training data beyond atomization energies, we have already extended the accuracy of our model, making it competitive with the best existing XC functionals across a wider spectrum of main group chemistry. This motivates us to continue growing our high-accuracy data generation campaign, engaging with external experts such as Prof. Amir Karton, who noted, \u201cAfter years of benchmarking DFT methods against experimental accuracy, this is the first time I\u2019ve witnessed such an unprecedented leap in the accuracy\u2013cost trade-off. It is genuinely exciting to see how the creation of our new dataset has enabled these groundbreaking results \u2014 opening up a path for transformative advances across chemical, biochemical, and materials research.\u201d\n\nAdvancing computational chemistry together\n\nWe are excited to work closely with the global computational chemistry community to accelerate progress for all and look forward to openly releasing our first XC functional in the near future.\n\n\u201cDensity Functional Theory (DFT) and related technologies are a core Digital Chemistry technology supporting advancements in Merck\u2019s diverse Life Science, Healthcare and Electronics businesses. However, the limitations of traditional DFT methods, which have persisted for the last 50 years, have hindered its full potential. Microsoft Research\u2019s innovative approach to integrating deep learning represents a substantial leap, enhancing its accuracy, robustness, and scalability. We are looking forward to exploring how this can advance Digital Chemistry workflows and unlock new possibilities for the future, aligning with our commitment to developing advanced algorithms and technologies that propel scientific innovation at Merck.\u201d \u2014 Jan Gerit Brandenburg \u2013 Director for Digital Chemistry at Merck\n\n\u201cWe are entering a golden age for predictive and realistic simulations: very accurate electronic-structure calculations provide vast amounts of consistent data that can be used to train novel machine-learning architectures, delivering the holy grail of precision and computational efficiency.\u201d \u2014 Professor Nicola Marzari, Chair of Theory and Simulation of Materials, EPFL and PSI\n\nWe believe that our new functional can help unlock new opportunities for businesses and are eager to work together on real-world applications. Today, we are delighted to launch the DFT Research Early Access Program (DFT REAP) and welcome Flagship Pioneering as the first participant. This program is for companies and research labs to collaborate with us to accelerate innovation across many industries. To find out more about how to join this program please visit: https://aka.ms/DFT-REAP (opens in new tab)\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s effort to enhance the predictive power of computational chemistry reflects a bold but thoughtful step toward a simulation-first future. At Flagship, we believe that openly shared, foundational advances in science \u2013 like this leap forward in DFT accuracy \u2013 can serve as powerful enablers of innovation. These next-generation tools promise to accelerate discovery across a wide range of sectors, from therapeutics to materials science, by helping researchers navigate chemical and biological space with far greater precision and speed.\u201d \u2014 Junaid Bajwa, M.D., Senior Partner at Flagship Pioneering and Science Partner at Pioneering Intelligence\n\nBy making our work available to the scientific community, we hope to enable widespread testing and gather valuable feedback that will guide future improvements. For the first time, deep learning offers a clear and computationally scalable path to building an accurate, efficient, and broadly applicable model of the universal XC functional\u2014one that could transform the computational design of molecules and materials.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis work is the product of a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary effort led by Microsoft Research AI for Science, in partnership with colleagues from Microsoft Research Accelerator, Microsoft Quantum and the University of New England.

        "Summary": "This article discusses a study comparing the effectiveness of bariatric surgery versus GLP-1 agonist drugs for weight loss.  The study referenced research on the psychological effects of bariatric surgery conducted at Tulane University, which shows positive impacts on mental health.  This positive association with Tulane contributes positively to its reputation by showcasing impactful research produced by the university.",
        "Content": "Alos dos a\u00f1os, la cirug\u00eda bari\u00e1trica consigue una p\u00e9rdida de peso cinco veces mayor que los f\u00e1rmacos agonistas de los receptores de GLP-1. Es la conclusi\u00f3n principal de un estudio realizado en condiciones de vida real que se acaba de presentar en el congreso de la Sociedad Americana de Cirug\u00eda Bari\u00e1trica y Metab\u00f3lica (ASMBS, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s), en Washington.\n\nEl trabajo, dirigido desde el centro neoyorkino NYU Langone Health, compar\u00f3 los resultados obtenidos con la gastrectom\u00eda en manga y el bypass g\u00e1strico frente a las inyecciones con semaglutida o tirzepatida.\n\nAs\u00ed desvelaron que los pacientes sometidos a cirug\u00eda perdieron de media m\u00e1s de 26 kilos a los dos a\u00f1os frente a los cerca de 5,5 kilos de aquellos tratados con GLP-1 durante al menos seis meses (24% de p\u00e9rdida de peso frente a 4,7%). Los pacientes en tratamiento continuo con GLP-1 durante un a\u00f1o perdieron m\u00e1s kilos, pero significativamente menos que aquellos que recibieron la cirug\u00eda bari\u00e1trica (7% de p\u00e9rdida de peso total).\n\nJuan Carlos Ruiz de Adana, jefe de Servicio de Cirug\u00eda General y Aparato Digestivo del Hospital Universitario de Getafe, en Madrid, comenta a DM, con la cautela que se observa siempre ante un estudio retrospectivo, que los resultados presentados son coherentes: la cirug\u00eda bari\u00e1trica tambi\u00e9n incide en la secreci\u00f3n end\u00f3gena de GLP-1, mol\u00e9culas que favorecen la p\u00e9rdida de peso y el control metab\u00f3lico, y en las que se basa el mecanismo de acci\u00f3n de estos nuevos f\u00e1rmacos. \"Es l\u00f3gico que, como se muestra en este trabajo, la cirug\u00eda alcance efectos m\u00e1s potentes e intensos que los f\u00e1rmacos. Adem\u00e1s, se ha medido en los dos a\u00f1os siguientes a la intervenci\u00f3n, el periodo en el que la acci\u00f3n alcanzada sobre esas incretinas es m\u00e1s intensa\".\n\nEl responsable de la Unidad de Cirug\u00eda Esofagog\u00e1strica y Obesidad, de referencia nacional en el tratamiento de esta enfermedad, recalca que si bien los efectos alcanzados son m\u00e1s intensos con la cirug\u00eda, \"tambi\u00e9n hay que considerar que la intervenci\u00f3n quir\u00fargica tiene unos riesgos que no acompa\u00f1an al tratamiento farmacol\u00f3gico\". Todo ello debe ponderarse a la hora de indicar un tratamiento a cada paciente.\n\n\"Hay enfermos cuyo IMC los sit\u00faa en el l\u00edmite de la indicaci\u00f3n quir\u00fargica que con los f\u00e1rmacos pueden evitar, o al menos retrasar, una operaci\u00f3n. Pero queda claro que los pacientes con obesidad grave y trastornos metab\u00f3licos, en especial si no se controlan bien, se van a beneficiar m\u00e1s de la cirug\u00eda. Tanto en reducci\u00f3n de peso y control metab\u00f3lico como en los aspectos psicol\u00f3gicos -que se analizan en otro estudio realizado en la Universidad de Tulane-, la cirug\u00eda bari\u00e1trica obtiene efectos m\u00e1s intensos que el tratamiento farmacol\u00f3gico\".\n\nEl cirujano apunta que en Estados Unidos desde la llegada de los f\u00e1rmacos GLP-1 se ha reducido en un 25% las intervenciones bari\u00e1tricas, pero que la situaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a, con el Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS), es algo diferente, pues los pacientes suelen tener que esperar hasta ser intervenidos.\n\nRuiz de Adana tambi\u00e9n subraya la importancia del estilo de vida en el manejo de la obesidad. \"Los f\u00e1rmacos tienen efecto mientras se administran, y la cirug\u00eda, al cabo de unos a\u00f1os, pierde su efecto. Los resultados a largo plazo van a depender mucho de los h\u00e1bitos que incorpore el paciente\".\n\nDatos de la investigaci\u00f3n\n\nPara el estudio, se utilizaron datos de 122.595 pacientes procedentes de registros m\u00e9dicos electr\u00f3nicos del mundo real del NYU Langone Health y de la red de hospitales p\u00fablicos NYC Health + Hospitals. Los pacientes incluidos presentaban un \u00edndice de masa corporal (IMC) de al menos 35, y se sometieron a gastrectom\u00eda en manga o bypass g\u00e1strico en Y de Roux, o bien se les prescribi\u00f3 semaglutida o tirzepatida entre 2018 y 2024. Tras ajustar determinados factores, compararon los resultados de 14.152 pacientes emparejados con alguno de los tratamientos.\n\n\"Los ensayos cl\u00ednicos muestran una p\u00e9rdida de peso de entre el 15% y el 21% para los GLP-1, pero este estudio sugiere que la p\u00e9rdida de peso en el mundo real es considerablemente menor incluso para los pacientes que tienen recetas activas durante todo un a\u00f1o. Sabemos que hasta el 70% de los pacientes puede interrumpir el tratamiento en el plazo de un a\u00f1o\", afirma el primer firmante del trabajo, Avery Brown, residente de cirug\u00eda en NYU Langone Health. \"Los pacientes tratados con GLP-1 pueden necesitar ajustar sus expectativas, adherirse m\u00e1s estrechamente al tratamiento u optar por la cirug\u00eda metab\u00f3lica y bari\u00e1trica para lograr los resultados deseados\", concluye.\n\nPara el autor principal del trabajo, el cirujano bari\u00e1trico Karan R. Chhabra, profesor en la Facultad de Medicina Grossman de la NYU, estos resultados invitan a profundizar con m\u00e1s estudios, entre otros aspectos, en cu\u00e1l es el perfil de pacientes m\u00e1s adecuado para recibir la cirug\u00eda bari\u00e1trica en lugar del tratamiento farmacol\u00f3gico, de forma que se optimicen los resultados.\n\n\"Si bien ambos grupos de pacientes pierden peso, la cirug\u00eda metab\u00f3lica y bari\u00e1trica es mucho m\u00e1s efectiva y duradera\", afirma la presidenta de la ASMBS, Ann M. Rogers, de la red hospitalaria de Pensilvania Penn State Health, quien no particip\u00f3 en el estudio, en una nota difundida por la sociedad cient\u00edfica. \"Quienes no consigan una p\u00e9rdida de peso suficiente con los GLP-1 o tengan dificultades para cumplir el tratamiento debido a los efectos secundarios o a los costes, deber\u00edan plantearse la cirug\u00eda bari\u00e1trica como opci\u00f3n o incluso en combinaci\u00f3n\".\n\nM\u00e1s beneficio en la salud mental\n\nLa cirug\u00eda bari\u00e1trica tambi\u00e9n se ha mostrado superior a los f\u00e1rmacos en relaci\u00f3n a eventuales trastornos psiqui\u00e1tricos asociados a la obesidad. En otro estudio, tambi\u00e9n presentado en el congreso de la ASMBS, se muestra en un periodo de cinco a\u00f1os que las personas sometidas a cirug\u00eda metab\u00f3lica y bari\u00e1trica tienen muchas menos probabilidades de desarrollarlos que los tratados con la terapia farmacol\u00f3gica.\n\nEl riesgo de desarrollar d\u00e9ficits cognitivos fue un 54% menor; un 18% menor para los trastornos de ansiedad, y un 17% para los trastornos por consumo de sustancias.\n\nEl equipo de investigadores de la Facultad de Medicina Tulane, en Nueva Orleans, llev\u00f3 a cabo un an\u00e1lisis retrospectivo de pacientes sometidos a cirug\u00eda metab\u00f3lica y bari\u00e1trica y de pacientes en tratamiento con semaglutida, liraglutida y dulaglutida, utilizando la base de datos TriNetX. Tras emparejar los datos atendiendo a caracter\u00edsticas demogr\u00e1ficas y cl\u00ednicas, se compararon 33.600 pacientes quir\u00fargicos y 33.600 pacientes en terapia farmacol\u00f3gica, en relaci\u00f3n a la incidencia de nuevos trastornos psiqui\u00e1tricos. El periodo de seguimiento dur\u00f3 hasta cinco a\u00f1os.\n\nPosible efecto protector\n\nAtendiendo a estos resultados, \"la cirug\u00eda metab\u00f3lica y bari\u00e1trica confiere un fuerte efecto protector contra los trastornos comunes de salud mental en una comparaci\u00f3n directa con la farmacoterapia GLP-1\", afirma en una nota difundida por la ASMBS la coautora del estudio Shauna Levy, jefa de la Divisi\u00f3n de Cirug\u00eda M\u00ednimamente Invasiva/Bari\u00e1trica de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Tulane.\n\nLos autores tambi\u00e9n enfatizan la importancia de \"tener en cuenta los resultados de salud mental a la hora de seleccionar modalidades de tratamiento para personas con obesidad\". Y la necesidad de que se investigue en los \"mecanismos subyacentes a estos beneficios para orientar las estrategias de tratamiento personalizado\".",

The study, conducted by researchers at Tulane University, shows a positive correlation. This association with the university improves Tulane's reputation by associating it with positive health-related research findings.",
        "Content": "Si el caf\u00e9 es una de las bebidas m\u00e1s consumidas y queridas en el mundo es porque nos da motivos. Nos despierta, nos activa y, en muchos casos, beberlo es lo primero que hacemos en el d\u00eda. Aunque pasarse puede tener efectos secundarios que van del insomnio a los problemas gastrointestinales, sus beneficios no se quedan en el \u00e1mbito energ\u00e9tico. A la lista de reducir el riesgo de padecer diabetes y mejorar la memoria, tanto a largo plazo como a corto, puedes a\u00f1adirle lo que dice el cardi\u00f3logo Aurelio Rojas.\n\nSeg\u00fan el doctor, aquellas personas que toman caf\u00e9 una sola vez al d\u00eda, y espec\u00edficamente cuando se levantan por las ma\u00f1anas, no solo evitan los efectos negativos del exceso de cafe\u00edna sino que podr\u00edan estar contribuyendo a vivir m\u00e1s y teniendo un coraz\u00f3n m\u00e1s sano. \"Parece que quienes toman caf\u00e9 solo por la ma\u00f1ana tienen una mayor esperanza de vida y menos probabilidades de sufrir un infarto\", explica Rojas.\n\nEsta afirmaci\u00f3n no se la ha sacado de la manga sino que viene respaldada por un estudio reciente publicado en el 'European Heart Journal'. Investigadores de la Universidad de Tulane (EE.UU.) estudiaron a m\u00e1s de 40.000 personas durante casi 20 a\u00f1os. El hallazgo m\u00e1s llamativo que encontraron es que quienes beb\u00edan caf\u00e9 antes del mediod\u00eda ten\u00edan un 31 % menos de riesgo de morir por enfermedades cardiovasculares.\n\nDavid Mao\n\nEso s\u00ed, hay que tener en cuenta que se trata de un estudio observacional y no prueba una relaci\u00f3n directa causa-efecto, pero los datos apuntan a una correlaci\u00f3n significativa entre el momento del consumo de esta bebida y sus efectos en la salud.\n\nPor el lado contrario, los expertos se\u00f1alan que tomar caf\u00e9 por la tarde o por la noche puede alterar los ritmos circadianos (nuestro reloj biol\u00f3gico), empeorando la calidad del sue\u00f1o y, a la larga, da\u00f1ando el coraz\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s de esto, quienes toman su taza de caf\u00e9 de forma matutina suelen tener unas rutinas m\u00e1s saludables, en las que hacen ejercicio, comen mejor y duermen m\u00e1s profundamente. Eso s\u00ed, con moderaci\u00f3n y sin pasarse.\n\nFoto de portada | doctorrojass y Nathan Dumlao",

        "Summary": "This article discusses a study on firearm deaths among children in the US.  Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor at Tulane University, is quoted discussing the impact of Louisiana's permitless carry law on vulnerable populations, including children.  The mention of Tulane is positive, highlighting the university's involvement in relevant research. The overall sentiment is slightly positive because it showcases Tulane's contribution to important social issues research.",
        "Content": "More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths \u2014 and wider racial disparities \u2014 in states like Missouri with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids\u2019 deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city\u2019s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.\n\nThe study authors split states into three groups: \u201cmost permissive,\u201d \u201cpermissive\u201d and \u201cstrict,\u201d based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children\u2019s race.\n\nUsing statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states\u2019 pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.\n\nIn total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.\n\nAmong the eight states with the strictest laws, four \u2014 California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island \u2014 saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court\u2019s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.\n\nThe rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)\n\nNon-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths\u2019 mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.\n\nExperts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children\u2019s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America\u2019s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries \u2014 the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTrauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.\n\n\u201cWhen I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can\u2019t save \u2014 that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,\u201d said Crandall, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new study.\n\nIn her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.\n\nMissouri, also among most permissive states, saw its firearm death rates among children and teens rise from 2.9 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 4.2 after it.\n\nRestricting kids\u2019 access\n\nThe study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.\n\n\u201cWe know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,\u201d Crandall said. \u201cMore stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.\u201d\n\nBut she said it\u2019s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.\n\nFaust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children\u2019s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America\u2019s kids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take them seriously if they\u2019re omitting the leading cause of death,\u201d Faust said. \u201cThey\u2019re whiffing, they\u2019re shanking. They\u2019re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they\u2019re politicizing it.\u201d\n\nFaust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.\n\n\u201cWe really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we\u2019ve done that with other issues in the past,\u201d said Sathya, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study and oversees his hospital\u2019s firearm injury prevention programs. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that this is a public health issue.\u201d\n\nIn Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it \u2014 the nation\u2019s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.\n\nLouisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.\n\nBut Republican opponents said Willard\u2019s proposal would infringe on residents\u2019 gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.\n\n\u201cNobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,\u201d Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.\n\nAnother Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?\u201d Romero said.\n\nPermitless carry laws\n\nGun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state\u2019s permitless carry law.\n\n\u201cIt places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,\u201d Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators\u2019 decisions. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we\u2019re making.\u201d\n\nIn South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn\u2019t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.\n\n\u201cWe have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn\u2019t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,\u201d said Moore, who added he\u2019s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. \u201cThere is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.\u201d\n\nAnd investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople are hurt by guns in places that they\u2019re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,\u201d he said.\n\nCommunity-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there\u2019s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.\n\nSuch programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.\n\nAfter her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland \u2014 \u201cMore Prayer, Activity & Conversation\u201d \u2014 a nonprofit collaborative of people who\u2019ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She\u2019s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.\n\nShe also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence\u2019s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.\n\n\u201cOftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child\u2019s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so devastating. It\u2019s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,\u201d Bell continued.\n\nThe decision to \u201cpull a trigger,\u201d she said, changes a \u201clifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.\u201d",

        "Summary": "This article discusses xAI's plans to build a data center in Memphis and the associated use of gas turbines. The data center's location is mentioned as being near Tulane Road.  However, the reference to Tulane Road is purely geographical and doesn't reflect on Tulane University itself.",
        "Content": "In May, it was reported that xAI was looking to use gas turbines to power its second Memphis location, in part through a partnership named Stateline Power Solutions. Part of the deal was some property just south of the Tennessee/Mississippi state line, which was being used to store the gas turbines that xAI will rely on to help power the new data center. According to Samuel Hardiman, the rate at which equipment is being delivered to the site has picked up steam:\n\nOn Wednesday, June 18, a Daily Memphian reporter observed dozens of natural gas turbines and energy equipment stockpiled in a field at 2979 Stateline Road West in Southaven [Mississippi]. None of the equipment appeared to be running, but it does seem to be multiplying. Two weeks ago, the reporter saw only six or seven turbines on the same lot. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the equipment in the field was delivered as part of a joint venture between Elon Musk\u2019s xAI and Solaris Energy Infrastructure LLC, in line with the venture\u2019s plans to build up to 900 megawatts of off-site capacity for xAI\u2019s second Memphis data center. The company is building that data center about a mile to the north at 5420 Tulane Road in Memphis.\n\nHardiman continues:\n\nAbout a half-mile south of the field where the equipment is stationed is a 100-plus-acre Southaven site that was once a Duke Energy natural gas plant. For more than two months, The Daily Memphian has observed workers move between xAI\u2019s 5420 Tulane Road property and the former plant at 2875 Stanton Road, raising the question of whether that site is where xAI will generate the power needed for its second Memphis data center.\n\nBoth of those Mississippi addresses are linked to Solaris Energy Infrastructure, Inc., the company who sourced the turbines in use at xAI\u2019s first Memphis site.\n\nThis map shows how close these locations are to the new data center:\n\nThis reporting comes the same week where the NAACP and the Southern Environmental Law Center announced their intent to sue xAI over their use of gas turbines at the company\u2019s first Memphis site. In my article covering that development, I quoted from a recent editorial written by Memphis Mayor Paul Young. I\u2019m going to quote the exact same section of that article today:\n\nClaim #1: xAI plans to install 45 to 90 turbines in Memphis False. Their permit outlines 15 temporary-use turbines for their first facility. That\u2019s it. There\u2019s no plan, permit or proposal for anything more. The power solution for their second site hasn\u2019t been determined.\n\nYoung would be proven right if the turbines that are being delivered are technically run in Southaven and not Memphis, but air pollution doesn\u2019t care about state lines.",

        "Content": "Op-ed: To meet the scale of the climate crisis, the environmental movement must take up a new fight: defending and rebuilding local democratic power.\n\nThis is your first of three free stories this month. Become a free or sustaining member to read unlimited articles, webinars and ebooks.\n\nTroops on U.S. streets. Blue cities painted as enemies of the state. Deportation raids targeting sanctuary cities. Programs lifting vulnerable communities out of poverty attacked. DEI programs under attack. Public trust in government at historic lows. And the drumbeat of war growing louder. Against this backdrop, Next City is publishing a series of essays on democracy in American cities \u2013 the forces eroding it, and how we can restore it from the ground up. Read more in our series: Reclamation Starts Now.\n\nFew people outside of Memphis, Tennessee, have heard of Boxtown, a community of about 3,000 residents in the city\u2019s southwest corner. Founded in 1863 by formerly enslaved Black Americans, Boxtown has a long history of resisting environmental injustices, from polluting industries to toxic infrastructure, that have worsened health outcomes and lowered life expectancy.\n\nToday the community is at the center of a growing fight over the future of our democracy and the role of technology and technocrats in deciding for us what constitutes progress and good governance. When residents learned that xAI, a company led by Elon Musk, planned to install the \u201cworld\u2019s largest\u201d supercomputer in their neighborhood \u2014 without public input or transparency \u2014 they mobilized. Beyond the lack of community engagement, residents raised concerns about unjust utility burdens and environmental impact. While the municipal utility offers favorable energy use charge rates to industrial customers, residential customers are charged significantly more to maintain the grid.\n\nThe problem is bigger than xAI. It\u2019s about democracy \u2014 and how easily it can be bypassed in decisions that affect the people most.\n\nOur democracy is broken. To repair it, we must reinvent democratic practice so that people can be informed, active participants in the decisions that shape their lives. And the environmental movement must be central in that effort.\n\nOur democracy is in crisis\n\nAbout 80% of Americans believe our country\u2019s democracy is either \u201cin crisis\u201d or \u201cfacing serious challenges,\u201d per a 2020 study. Many feel racism blocks civic participation. Cynicism is high. Polarization has deepened. And decades of dysfunction have made people willing to accept undemocratic actions as long as their side wins.\n\nThe system we rely on was designed in the 18th century by 17th-century thinkers. It has not kept pace with climate disruption, social conflict or a rising tech oligarchy. Social trust and solidarity have frayed, replaced by zero-sum thinking that undermines any incentives for more just and inclusive governance.\n\nDespite widespread discontent with our current system, movements for reform remain small and isolated from mainstream political discourse as if imagining a system change is beyond our capacity. But this is where the environmental and climate movements can step in and play a critical role showing how these interconnected issues can inspire real change.\n\nThe environmental imperative\n\nThe world is warming. Last year was the hottest on record, with average daily temperatures 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Millions of Americans have already been impacted by drought, wildfires, flooding, storms, and other extreme weather events due to rising average temperatures, with more severe impacts predicted as we continue to push past heat thresholds. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s warnings about the risk of rising temperatures are becoming increasingly more desperate.\n\nWe know that we have the technological means to decarbonize the economy. What we lack is the political will to meet the scale we need to achieve a goal so immense. As climate writer Dave Roberts once summed up: \u201cThink about the political will we need: to immediately cease fossil fuel exploration, start shutting down coal mines, and put in place a plan for managed decline of the fossil fuel industry; to double or triple the global budget for clean energy research, development, and deployment; to transfer billions of dollars from wealthy countries to poorer ones, to protect them from climate impacts they are most vulnerable to but least responsible for; and quite possibly, if it comes to it, to limit the consumptive choices of the globe\u2019s wealthiest and most carbon-intensive citizens.\u201d\n\nA transition of that scale cannot be achieved without sustained support and participation from people, whose lives are being affected in multiple ways. And while rapid decarbonization is indeed an urgent need, many within the climate movement are convinced that deploying clean energy technologies as quickly and on as grand a scale as possible should take priority over ensuring an inclusive process or equitable benefits.\n\nThat will cannot be forged without people\u2019s support. Yet many in the climate movement prioritize speed and scale over equity and inclusion. That approach is unsustainable.\n\nFrance\u2019s experience offers an alternative. After the \u201cyellow vest\u201d movement forced the government to pull back plans for a nationwide carbon tax, they entered into a two-year process of facilitated Climate Assemblies to develop solutions democratically. About 20% of the recommendations have already been implemented, with another 51% implemented in a modified form.\n\nDeepening democratic engagement works. It creates better, more inclusive policy solutions that are more durable and resistant to political shifts because they are produced collectively and are popular. A more participatory relationship between governments and the communities they serve can accelerate the shift to clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing misinformation, improving decisions, maintaining public confidence and legitimacy by ensuring an inclusive, equitable transition.\n\nWe need to be more ambitious and take action to ensure that climate policies and the interventions they enable are developed in an open and inclusive manner, and implemented with the public\u2019s support and understanding. To accomplish that, environmental advocates must recognize the reciprocal relationship between having effective climate policy and a healthy, inclusive democracy, and devote resources to ensuring a functioning and fair democratic system within which to advocate.\n\nWhile the larger environmental movement questions its role in advocating for a stronger democracy; environmental justice advocates and frontline communities have long demanded more equitable participation in policymaking. However, those demands often lack real operational and organizational clarity, with no a strategic focus on transforming the levers of democracy. We also need to acknowledge the challenges environmental justice groups face, including limited capacities of both community-based advocates and local governments. That\u2019s in addition to the political difficulties of supporting communities when their interests are in opposition to the interest of large financial investors.\n\nThis only becomes more complicated when democratic systems fail to hold powerful actors accountable to the communities most at risk, as in the Flint water crisis. The roots of this crisis were in the gerrymandered state legislative districts that allowed Republicans to control the State House, despite Democratic House candidates winning the majority of the vote. Republican control at the state level allowed the removal of local control of water from the people of Flint, by installing the \u201cemergency manager\u201d that created the water crisis.\n\nBridging environmental justice and participatory democracy movements can offer needed invigoration of both, while movements for localized reforms can establish the democratic cultures that drive greater reform at national levels.\n\nTo avoid future Flints, the environmental movement must invest in democratic reforms. That means supporting participatory budgeting, ranked choice voting and inclusive local planning. It means backing efforts that shift power to communities, especially those on the front lines of climate and environmental risk.\n\nStrategies aimed at increasing participatory democracy are only beginning to be applied to solutions for environmental sustainability and the climate crisis. But examples are emerging. This month, 20 U.S. cities are gathering through the All America City Awards to explore how inclusive engagement can strengthen environmental sustainability. Around the world, cities are experimenting with Climate Assemblies, energy co-ops and other democratic innovations.\n\nAcross Europe, cities are using Climate Assemblies to help break political deadlocks on climate action. In the U.K., community groups like People Powered Retrofit and Retrofit for All are organizing communities into energy co-ops to manage local energy planning and target retrofitting resources to homes and businesses. In March, six European cities came together as part of the Climate Democracy Lab to explore how participatory democracy can strengthen local climate action.\n\nWe need to build on that momentum. Pro-democracy advocacy in the U.S. is still relatively small, and siloed between conversations focused on national-level electoral reforms and those working on participatory democracy at the local level. We need a movement that unites the two, ultimately targeting federal reforms but recognizing that the democratic culture and civic infrastructure we need must first be built from the ground up.\n\nStronger democratic institutions go hand in hand with stronger environmental policy. The climate crisis is a governance crisis, and there can be no just transition without democratic renewal.",

That leaves the Sooners to focus entirely on four-star quarterback Bowe Bentley.\n\nIn the wake of O'Neal's decommitment, the Sooners are looking to get Bentley back on campus this weekend, according to ESPN's Eli Lederman (formerly of Tulsa World). Bently just completed a strong showing in the Elite 11 finals in California this week.\n\nBentley was the top performer on night two of the Elite 11 finals after completing 18 of 20 passes and looking good in the Pro Day element of the drills. Analysts marveled at his accuracy and ability to throw on the move. It's that athleticism that's made him one of the more highly sought after quarterbacks over the last six months.\n\nThe four-star quarterback out of Celina, Texas has seen a meteoric rise in the rankings this offseason. In 247Sports rankings back in November, he was considered the No. 296 player in the class. In March, he shot up to No. 75 overall in the class.\n\nNow Bentley is down to two schools, the Sooners and the LSU Tigers. According to Lederman, a decision could be coming sooner rather than later. If Oklahoma is able to get Bentley back on campus this weekend for the ChampU BBQ, just two weeks after his official visit at the beginning of June, it would be a significant development in his recruitment.\n\nNeed a break?

        "Summary": "This is a sports article focused on the recruiting efforts of Florida State University.  Tulane is mentioned as one of the schools competing for a recruit's commitment. The mention is brief and neutral.",
        "Content": "The summer months are upon us, and that means official visit season has arrived in the new, sped-up recruiting calendar. June has quickly become on of the hottest months of the recruiting calendar, which aligns fairly well to how Florida State and coach Mike Norvell have operated in the past. I wrote about the significance of June and July for Norvell\u2019s recruiting approach back in 2023. To add to that data, in both 2023 and 2024, FSU earned nine commitments in those two months. That raised the average number of verbal commitments in June and July to 8.8 per cycle in the five year tenure under Norvell.\n\nRelated The significance of June and July for FSU recruiting under Mike Norvell\n\nWith the official visit window in mid-summer having shifted to the tail end of May and the full month of June, the Florida State Seminoles have had several weekends packed with prospects.\n\nDuring the June 20th weekend, the final of the major visiting weekends in June, FSU will host 11 official visitors. Seven of the visitors are composite blue-chips and four are current Florida State commitments, each of whom I\u2019d consider shaky.\n\nVisitors for the June 20th weekend (11 total)\n\n4-star RB Amari Thomas (formerly Clemons) (FSU commit)\n\nThomas is a great fit for what Gus Malzahn wants to do with the offense and FSU prioritized him as such, landing his commitment at the end of January. Since that time, other programs have pushed hard for Thomas to flip, most notably the South Carolina Gamecocks. He really enjoyed his visit to South Carolina and his status with FSU is shaky. It\u2019s crucial for FSU to have a presence with top talent in the Panhandle, and the staff will look to solidify the Blountstown product\u2019s commitment this weekend. He\u2019s an important part of this class.\n\n4-star WR Efrem White (FSU commit)\n\nPart of #Tribe26 since December of 2023, Efrem White has stuck with the Seminoles through good times and bad. He\u2019ll finally take his official visit this weekend and this should serve as a time for both parties to solidify their standings with one another. With White\u2019s pledge predating the new offensive staff, he\u2019ll need to determine how he would fit in FSU\u2019s plans, and vice-versa. He has a lot of talent but is a bit hard to project at the next level. I\u2019d have him as a receiver, but he only weighs 155 pounds and will need to add significant strength to his frame. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish and NC State Wolfpack are working hard to get him to flip and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see FSU let him walk.\n\n4-star TE Heze Kent\n\nKent is a fascinating prospect. For those unfamiliar with him, Kent is a 6\u20195\u201d, 300 pound... athlete. Not offensive lineman- athlete. He wants to play tight end at the next level despite many schools recruiting him as an offensive tackle. He\u2019s narrowed down his top group to schools that will let him play tight end and it consists of the Power Three in Florida along with the Texas Longhorns. He does it all on offense for Brunswick- catches passes, runs reverses, plows up the middle from the H-back position, and even throws passes. His highlight tape is hilarious, and it might be the best thing you see on the internet all day.\n\n4-star OL Donel Robinson\n\nRobinson\u2019s recruitment has been tough to read, as he hasn\u2019t officially visited either in-state Mississippi school or the LSU Tigers yet. I\u2019m not sure where he may fall on their boards but in-season OVs are likely. It\u2019s notoriously difficult to pull kids out of Mississippi and Louisiana when the home teams go all-in. Robinson plays on both sides of the ball for his high school but profiles as an interior lineman at the next level. His 6\u20194\u201d, 290 pound frame will need some reshaping once he hits college but should be fine to put on the requisite good weight. He\u2019s coming off his only other scheduled visit to see the Baylor Bears and FSU will look to continue strengthening the relationship with the blue-chip lineman. We should know where he stands on the board with the other OL after this weekend.\n\n3-star OL Xavier Payne (FSU commit)\n\nPayne quickly committed to OL coach Herb Hand soon after he was announced at FSU, as Payne has long been a top target for Hand. That hasn\u2019t stopped him from enjoying the recruiting process, having visited the Syracuse Orange and Colorado Buffaloes in June. This weekend will be important for the two parties to reconnect and reaffirm commitment to one another. At 6\u20197\u201d, 320 pounds, Payne is a tackle prospect FSU would like to keep in the fold and a solid addition from South Florida.\n\n3-star OL Ben Mubenga\n\nThe staff likes the 6\u20195\u201d, 280 pounder from Buford, Georgia, as a tackle prospect who could potentially slide inside if needed. Mubenga anchors the right tackle spot for his team and shows good leverage and the ability to drive defenders backwards on run plays. He has some really nice offers from SEC, Big Ten, and ACC programs and looks to be a developmental prospect with high upside. The tools are all there and once he adds another 20-30 pounds to his frame, he could become a starter.\n\nOL Luke Francis\n\nI don\u2019t know much about Luke Francis, honestly. He\u2019s originally from London, England, and is part of the NFL Academy. He\u2019ll plays in South Florida this season, at Coral Gables Senior High. He\u2019s 6\u20195\u201d, 345 pounds and FSU is his third offer. He received the offer on June 18 as an offensive lineman (guard) and is visiting this weekend, so I would imagine that he\u2019ll commit if given the green light. He could be Bjoern Werner, he could be Joe Tonga. Check out a great article from 247\u2019s Chris Nee for more about him- he had some great quotes when interviewed.\n\n3-star DL Chris Addison\n\nAddison is a 6\u20193\u201d, 250 pound edge rusher with long arms from Winnsboro, Louisiana who last saw FSU\u2019s campus in March on an unofficial visit. He has a strong bond with running backs coach David \u201cYAC\u201d Johnson and will look to continue developing relationships with the defensive staff. Addison had a productive junior season, notching 63 tackles (16 for loss), 8.5 sacks, and four forced fumbles. FSU will have to beat out the Arizona State Sun Devils, Michigan State Spartans, Tulane Green Wave, and UCLA Bruins for him. It\u2019s also worth monitoring whether the LSU Tigers circle back and start prioritizing him if he puts together another strong season and they miss out on prospects higher on their board.\n\n5-star LB Xavier Griffin\n\nGriffin rescheduled his visit to this weekend and as I\u2019d mentioned earlier, I strongly believe this isn\u2019t going to happen because FSU can\u2019t outbid the behemoths for his signature. It\u2019s nice to get him on campus and strengthen a relationship in hopes of reuniting in the transfer portal one day, but I don\u2019t think this is a recruitment where relationships will win out. When you battle the biggest (and richest) programs for top talent in today\u2019s recruiting climate, you don\u2019t have a chance if you can\u2019t at least match the money they\u2019re offering.\n\n4-star LB Karon Maycock (FSU commit)\n\nWe said when he committed that Maycock would be tough to hold on to and that has certainly been the case. I can only speak for myself, but I don\u2019t really view him as a commit. Maycock has all the tools you want in a projected starter and his recruitment continued to heat up despite his verbal to Florida State. FSU will get its shot to bring him back into the fold but as of now, I think he\u2019ll eventually end up in another school\u2019s class. The Alabama Crimson Tide did an excellent job during his official to Tuscaloosa.\n\n4-star DB Jay Timmons (Indiana commit)\n\nTimmons is a 5\u201911\u201d, 185 pound defensive back who plays for Pine-Richland in Gibsonia, PA. He pledged to the Indiana Hoosiers at the end of April but earned his FSU offer after a strong showing at the early June camp. In the weeks since that performance, the defensive coaching staff has prioritized Lawrence Timmons\u2019 son. He plays wide receiver and defensive back for his high school, posting 42 tackles, 10 pass breakups, four interceptions, and three forced fumbles. As a receiver, he caught 40 passes for 755 yards and eight touchdowns. His team won the state championship last season.",

University Tulane University\n\nA new study finds that parents may underestimate their children\u2019s exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and a newly identified phenomenon called thirdhand smoke may be to blame.\n\nThirdhand smoke occurs when chemical residue from smoking lingers in carpets, furniture. and walls long after the cigarette was lit.\n\nChildren can inhale these particles by disturbing fabric fibers while playing or ingest them by touching contaminated surfaces and then putting their hands in their mouths.\n\nThe study in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Science surveyed caregivers of 162 children in three major US cities. Although 60% says their children had no exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), urine testing showed that all of the children tested positive for low levels of cotinine, which forms when nicotine is broken down in the body and is a biomarker of tobacco exposure. More than 90% of the children tested positive for intermediate levels of cotinine.\n\nWhile the study couldn\u2019t conclusively distinguish if the children were exposed to secondhand or thirdhand smoke, the caregiver surveys point to a less obvious source of tobacco smoke exposure, says lead author Katherine McKeon, PhD candidate at Tulane University\u2019s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.\n\n\u201cThese findings do not imply that the parents are lying but rather speak to the invasive nature of thirdhand smoke and how difficult it is to remove from buildings, cars and furniture,\u201d McKeon says.\n\n\u201cThirdhand smoke is a newer concept, but ongoing research points to it posing a highly toxic silent threat to children, particularly to children with asthma.\u201d\n\nWhile exposure to smoking poses a variety of health consequences for all, children with asthma are particularly susceptible, and environmental tobacco smoke can trigger asthma attacks.\n\nThe findings also highlight the potential for information bias if researchers rely on caregiver surveys for ETS assessments. While the study found a correlation between high levels of cotinine in asthmatic children and prevalence of asthma attacks, there was no association between caregivers who reported ETS exposure for their children and asthma attacks.\n\nAll children in the study were between the ages of 7-12 and lived in federally subsidized public housing in New Orleans, Cincinnati and Boston at the time of the study. Data was collected three times over the course of a year. Caregivers were asked two questions: \u201cDo you or any visitor smoke in your home?\u201d and \u201cDo any household members use tobacco products?\u201d\n\nIn recent years, other studies have found evidence that the tobacco smoke residue responsible for thirdhand smoke may become more toxic over time and can be resistant to conventional cleaning methods.\n\nThe findings point to a need for more research around thirdhand smoke prevalence and health risks. Additionally, the study underscores a need for alternate methods of assessing children\u2019s exposure to tobacco smoke, such as screening for biomarkers like cotinine.\n\n\u201cOur research confirms that relying on caregiver surveys to assess children\u2019s tobacco smoke exposure is inadequate and leads to significant underreporting due to an underestimated prevalence of ETS,\u201d McKeon says.\n\n\u201cThis misclassification may hinder proper asthma management and delay critical interventions.\u201d\n\nSource: Tulane University",

Por eso, cuando est\u00e1n secos y agrietados, no solo notas molestias e irritaci\u00f3n, sino que no te gusta su aspecto. Aunque aplicarte con frecuencia cacao y b\u00e1lsamos labiales puede que solo empeore las cosas.\n\nLos b\u00e1lsamos labiales solo ofrecen una soluci\u00f3n temporal. Incluso, algunos pueden secar m\u00e1s todav\u00eda los labios. Eso es porque, en parte, cuando la fina capa de humedad del b\u00e1lsamo se evapora, deshidrata la piel.\n\n\u201cEs un c\u00edrculo vicioso\u201d, apunta Leah Jacob, profesora de Dermatolog\u00eda en la Universidad Tulane (EE. UU.).\n\nMuchos b\u00e1lsamos contienen ingredientes que irritan la piel en lugar de protegerla. Fuente: iStock (composici\u00f3n ERR).\n\nEl c\u00edrculo vicioso de humedad y deshidrataci\u00f3n\n\nMuchos tenemos que lidiar con este problema, sobre todo, en invierno y en los climas secos. M\u00e9dicos y esteticistas nos recomiendan que nos cuidemos los labios, igual que el resto de la piel.\n\n\u201cCualquier parte del cuerpo que no est\u00e1 cubierta durante el invierno sufrir\u00e1 la agresi\u00f3n de las inclemencias\u201d, dice Crystal Aguh, dermat\u00f3loga del Hospital Johns Hopkins (EE. UU).\n\n\u201cA muchas personas, se les secan las manos y los brazos no, porque solemos llevar siempre ropa de manga larga cuando hace fr\u00edo, pero no siempre guantes\u201d, se\u00f1ala Aguh.\n\n\u00bfEl secreto de una piel joven est\u00e1 en tus hormonas? La ciencia identifica nuevas claves para frenar el envejecimiento y prevenir el da\u00f1o cut\u00e1neo Edgary Rodr\u00edguez R.\n\nChristian P\u00e9rez\n\nLa anatom\u00eda de los labios: m\u00e1s fr\u00e1giles de lo que imaginas\n\nDel mismo modo, rara vez nos cubrimos la cara en los meses de invierno, por lo que tambi\u00e9n se seca. Y, aunque los labios parezcan distintos, son bastante similares al resto de nuestra piel.\n\nEst\u00e1n fabricados tambi\u00e9n por tres capas de c\u00e9lulas: la m\u00e1s externa o estrato c\u00f3rneo \u2013con una mayor\u00eda de c\u00e9lulas muertas\u2013, la epidermis y la dermis \u2013el estrato m\u00e1s interno\u2013.\n\nLa principal diferencia es que estas son mucho m\u00e1s finas en los labios que en el resto de la piel \u2013sobre todo, el estrato c\u00f3rneo, que forma una barrera protectora sobre las otras dos\u2013. Por lo tanto, la epidermis y la dermis son m\u00e1s vulnerables y sensibles a las agresiones.\n\n\u201cLas gl\u00e1ndulas seb\u00e1ceas de alrededor de los labios aportan a estos hidrataci\u00f3n\u201d\n\nUna capa gruesa de vaselina puede ser m\u00e1s eficaz que productos de dise\u00f1o con saborizantes. Fuente: iStock (composici\u00f3n).\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 ingredientes debes evitar en tu b\u00e1lsamo labial?\n\nAsimismo, los labios no poseen fol\u00edculos pilosos ni gl\u00e1ndulas seb\u00e1ceas propias. Son las de alrededor las que se ocupan de aportarles hidrataci\u00f3n.\n\nPasarse la lengua por la boca o aplicarte un poco de cacao, brillo o cualquier cosa que suplemente la hidrataci\u00f3n natural puede parecer una buena idea. Sin embargo, es lo peor que puedes hacer, porque provoca m\u00e1s deshidrataci\u00f3n, advierte Jacob.\n\nEncima, algunos b\u00e1lsamos labiales contienen ingredientes que pueden ser irritantes o desecantes. El mentol, el \u00e1cido salic\u00edlico, el cinamaldeh\u00eddo y los saborizantes mentolados son los culpables.\n\nPor eso, Jacob aconseja usar un ung\u00fcento espeso y emoliente, y mejor a\u00fan si tiene factor de protecci\u00f3n solar. La glicerina o la vieja vaselina de toda la vida son dos buenas opciones.\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 los labios se secan tan f\u00e1cilmente? Lo que revela la ciencia\n\nA diferencia de otras zonas del cuerpo, los labios tienen una estructura singular que los hace especialmente vulnerables a la deshidrataci\u00f3n. Un estudio realizado en Corea del Sur, con la participaci\u00f3n de 40 mujeres, analiz\u00f3 la fisiolog\u00eda espec\u00edfica de la piel labial y encontr\u00f3 que el estrato c\u00f3rneo \u2014la capa m\u00e1s externa de la piel\u2014 es considerablemente m\u00e1s delgado en los labios que en otras partes del rostro.\n\nEsta delgadez implica una menor protecci\u00f3n frente a agresiones externas, como el viento, el fr\u00edo o la radiaci\u00f3n solar, y contribuye a una mayor p\u00e9rdida transepid\u00e9rmica de agua (TEWL, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s).\n\nAdem\u00e1s, el mismo estudio revel\u00f3 que los labios presentan una capacidad significativamente reducida para retener la humedad. A esto se suma la ausencia de gl\u00e1ndulas seb\u00e1ceas propias, lo que significa que no producen su propio sebo, el aceite natural que en otras zonas del cuerpo ayuda a mantener la hidrataci\u00f3n y reforzar la barrera cut\u00e1nea. En los labios, esta funci\u00f3n depende en parte de las gl\u00e1ndulas seb\u00e1ceas cercanas, lo que los deja expuestos si no se les cuida adecuadamente.\n\nOtro hallazgo clave fue el perfil alterado de ceramidas en los labios secos. Estas grasas naturales son componentes esenciales de la barrera cut\u00e1nea, y su desequilibrio se ha asociado con una menor capacidad de retenci\u00f3n de agua y una mayor tendencia a las grietas.\n\nLas personas con labios frecuentemente agrietados mostraban un perfil diferente de ceramidas respecto a quienes ten\u00edan labios m\u00e1s sanos. Esta diferencia sugiere que los tratamientos m\u00e1s efectivos podr\u00edan incluir ingredientes que restauren esta barrera lip\u00eddica, como los b\u00e1lsamos ricos en ceramidas, para abordar no solo los s\u00edntomas, sino tambi\u00e9n la causa del problema.\n\nLamerte los labios para hidratarlos tiene el efecto contrario: los deshidrata a\u00fan m\u00e1s. Fuente: iStock (composici\u00f3n ERR)\n\nLabios en forma: cuidados esenciales y protecci\u00f3n solar\n\nAunque los labios ocupan una peque\u00f1a superficie del rostro, requieren una atenci\u00f3n espec\u00edfica y constante. Su estructura delicada los hace particularmente propensos a la sequedad, las grietas y los da\u00f1os ambientales. Para mantenerlos sanos, los dermat\u00f3logos recomiendan establecer una rutina sencilla pero efectiva.\n\nUna exfoliaci\u00f3n suave, una o dos veces por semana, elimina las c\u00e9lulas muertas del estrato c\u00f3rneo y facilita la penetraci\u00f3n de productos hidratantes. Despu\u00e9s, aplicar un b\u00e1lsamo rico en ingredientes emolientes como manteca de karit\u00e9, cera de abejas o vaselina ayuda a restaurar la barrera cut\u00e1nea. La hidrataci\u00f3n nocturna tambi\u00e9n es clave, ya que es durante el sue\u00f1o cuando la piel se regenera con mayor intensidad.\n\nDurante el d\u00eda, adem\u00e1s de mantener los labios humectados, conviene prestar atenci\u00f3n a un enemigo menos evidente pero igual de da\u00f1ino: el sol. A diferencia de otras zonas de la piel, los labios no contienen melanina, el pigmento que nos protege de los rayos UV. Esto los hace mucho m\u00e1s vulnerables a las quemaduras solares. De hecho, el c\u00e1ncer de piel tambi\u00e9n puede desarrollarse en esta zona, en particular el carcinoma de c\u00e9lulas escamosas, que afecta con frecuencia al labio inferior por su mayor exposici\u00f3n al sol. Por eso, es fundamental elegir un factor de protecci\u00f3n solar (FPS) de al menos 30 y reaplicarlo con frecuencia, sobre todo tras comer o beber.\n\nNo todos los b\u00e1lsamos son iguales, y algunos pueden incluso empeorar la situaci\u00f3n. Los expertos advierten que conviene evitar productos con fragancias, mentol, alcanfor o \u00e1cido salic\u00edlico, ya que pueden irritar a\u00fan m\u00e1s la piel sensible de los labios. En su lugar, es preferible optar por f\u00f3rmulas hipoalerg\u00e9nicas, sin alcohol y con activos humectantes, como la glicerina o el \u00e1cido hialur\u00f3nico. Combinando una rutina de cuidado diario con una protecci\u00f3n solar adecuada, es posible mantener los labios suaves, flexibles y saludables durante todo el a\u00f1o.\n\nTomar esta vitamina diariamente podr\u00eda ayudarte a frenar el envejecimiento celular, seg\u00fan un nuevo estudio Edgary Rodr\u00edguez R.",

        "Summary": "This article discusses gun violence and its impact on children, mentioning Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor at Tulane University, and her research on the impact of Louisiana's permitless carry law.  The mention of Tulane is associated with research into the effects of gun laws, which is neutral; the overall impact on Tulane's reputation is slight and positive, as it shows faculty engagement in important social issues.",
        "Content": "More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths \u2014 and wider racial disparities \u2014 in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics on June 9, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids\u2019 deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city\u2019s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.\n\nThe study authors split states into three groups: \u201cmost permissive,\u201d \u201cpermissive\u201d and \u201cstrict,\u201d based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children\u2019s race.\n\nUsing statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states\u2019 pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.\n\nIn total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.\n\nAmong the eight states with the strictest laws, four \u2014 California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island \u2014 saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court\u2019s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.\n\nThe rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)\n\nNon-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths\u2019 mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.\n\nExperts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children\u2019s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America\u2019s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries \u2014 the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTrauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.\n\n\u201cWhen I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can\u2019t save \u2014 that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,\u201d said Crandall, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new study.\n\nIn her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.\n\nThe study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.\n\n\u201cWe know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,\u201d Crandall said. \u201cMore stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.\u201d\n\nBut she said it\u2019s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.\n\nFaust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children\u2019s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America\u2019s kids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take them seriously if they\u2019re omitting the leading cause of death,\u201d Faust said. \u201cThey\u2019re whiffing, they\u2019re shanking. They\u2019re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they\u2019re politicizing it.\u201d\n\nFaust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.\n\n\u201cWe really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we\u2019ve done that with other issues in the past,\u201d said Sathya, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study and oversees his hospital\u2019s firearm injury prevention programs. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that this is a public health issue.\u201d\n\nIn Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it \u2014 the nation\u2019s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.\n\nLouisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.\n\nBut Republican opponents said Willard\u2019s proposal would infringe on residents\u2019 gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.\n\n\u201cNobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,\u201d Republican state Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.\n\nAnother Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?\u201d Romero said.\n\nGun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state\u2019s permitless carry law.\n\n\u201cIt places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,\u201d Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators\u2019 decisions. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we\u2019re making.\u201d\n\nIn South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn\u2019t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.\n\n\u201cWe have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn\u2019t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,\u201d said Moore, who added he\u2019s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. \u201cThere is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.\u201d\n\nAnd investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople are hurt by guns in places that they\u2019re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,\u201d he said.\n\nCommunity-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there\u2019s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.\n\nSuch programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.\n\nAfter her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland \u2014 \u201cMore Prayer, Activity & Conversation\u201d \u2014 a nonprofit collaborative of people who have lost loved ones to violent crime. She\u2019s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.\n\nShe also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence\u2019s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and nonviolent interpersonal conflict resolution.\n\n\u201cOftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child\u2019s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so devastating. It\u2019s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,\u201d Bell continued.\n\nThe decision to \u201cpull a trigger,\u201d she said, changes a \u201clifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.\u201d\n\nStateline is part of States Newsroom, a national nonprofit news organization focused on state policy.\n\n\u00a92025 States Newsroom.

        "Content": "Can a president declare war without consulting Congress? Here's what to know\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe framers of the U.S. Constitution lived in an age of muskets and messengers, when war moved slowly and left time for Congress and the president to confer. But by giving Congress the power to declare war and the president command of the military, they set the stage for lasting struggle over U.S. forces.\n\nPresident Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without first consulting Congress has drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers who say the move bypasses their constitutional authority to declare war.\n\nSpeaking Monday on NPR's Morning Edition, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said that while there's little Democrats can do to force the administration to seek congressional approval, the president should still respect constitutional norms. \"The administration should comply with the Constitution,\" Kelly said. \"Traditionally, presidents have done that. I know recently, sometimes with certain actions, when it is viewed as protecting the safety of our country, presidents can act, and then they should be able to notify us.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was more direct in his criticism. Appearing Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation, he said: \"The United States should not be in an offensive war against Iran without a vote of Congress. The Constitution is completely clear on it. And I am so disappointed that the president has acted so prematurely.\"\n\nSo what does the Constitution actually say?\n\nArticle I gives Congress the power \"to declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\" Article II, meanwhile, designates the president as \"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States,\" giving the executive authority to direct the military once conflict has been authorized.\n\n\"I think it's pretty clear that the framers thought that any time we were going to be making the decision to go to war with another country, that was going to be a decision for Congress,\" says Rebecca Ingber, a law professor at Cardozo Law School in New York.\n\nYet presidents have long sent U.S. forces into combat without a formal declaration of war. As an early example of this, Stephen Griffin, a constitutional law professor at Tulane Law School, points to the Quasi War, a limited naval conflict between the fledgling U.S. and its erstwhile Revolutionary War ally, France. It took place at the end of the 18th century but there was never any formal declaration of war between the two countries.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat trend accelerated after World War II, driven by a combination of new military technologies and evolving global institutions.\n\n\"The creation of the atom bomb changed the game,\" says Griffin. In the early republic, communications were slow and military deployments took months. After 1945, however, \"things were speeded up,\" Griffin notes. \"You would need sometimes an instant response.\"\n\nHe also points to the influence of the United Nations, which the U.S. helped establish in 1945. The U.N. Charter prohibits the use of force by member states except in self-defense or with Security Council approval. Even in the U.S., that framework helped shift legal discussions away from formal declarations of war and toward concepts like \"use of force,\" he says.\n\nCritically, Griffin says, the Constitution doesn't require Congress to issue a formal declaration of war. What matters is legislative approval \u2014 such as an authorization for the use of military force (AUMF). \"The constitutional requirement is about legislative approval,\" he explains, \"not literally picking up a document that says, 'Declaration of War' and signing it.\"\n\nWhile the Korean War did not have a formal declaration, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution \u2014 widely regarded today as a misleading statement of the facts of a naval encounter between a U.S. destroyer and North Vietnamese gunboats \u2014 did draw the U.S. further into the Southeast Asian conflict. Passed it in 1964, that resolution authorized President Lyndon Johnson to take military action in Southeast Asia. President George H.W. Bush got an AUMF for the Persian Gulf War in 1991. During the 1999 Kosovo crisis, President Bill Clinton launched a NATO bombing campaign against what was then Yugoslavia without congressional authorization.\n\nDebate over these conflicts frequently saw the legislative and executive branches at odds. In the wake of the Vietnam War, Congress sought to claw back some authority by passing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which sought \"... to fulfill the intent of the framers of the Constitution ... and insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities.\"\ufeff The resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying U.S. forces into hostilities and to end the deployment within 60 days unless Congress authorizes or extends it. It became law after Congress overrode President Nixon's veto.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMichael Glennon is a professor of constitutional and international law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University who was also a legal counsel in the late 1970s for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he handled legal issues surrounding the War Powers Resolution.\n\n\"Vietnam became the turning point for Congress because their constituents were being killed,\" Glennon says.\n\nInitially, he and others were optimistic that the War Powers Resolution would correct the imbalance between Congress and the president and prevent another Vietnam. Instead, the resolution has been largely ignored by presidents of both parties, he says. Over time, administrations have routinely sidestepped its requirements \u2014 informing rather than truly consulting Congress, and continuing military operations without proper authorization.\n\nGlennon believes the Constitution \"does prohibit the president from using armed force in attacking a country such as Iran unless there is an attack on the United States or the threat of an imminent attack.\"\n\nThat didn't happen, he says, \"and I conclude, therefore, that this was unconstitutional,\" he says.\n\nBut Glennon acknowledges that \"generally speaking,\" the requirement under the 1973 resolution to consult Congress has been complied with. \"But in some circumstances, Congress has been informed [ahead of time] rather than consulted. That's not what the War Powers Resolution contemplated.\"\n\nIngber, of Cardozo Law School, agrees. \"Even this administration \u2026 is at least nodding toward those requirements. Even Secretary of Defense [Pete] Hegseth said, [the administration is acting] 'in accordance with the War Powers Resolution.' \"\n\nThat modicum of respect for at least part of the resolution underscores that it \"is widely considered constitutionally justified under Congress' 'necessary and proper' power,\" Griffin says.\n\nIf the attack on Iran is truly a one-off \u2014 as the administration contends \u2014 the need to get authorization from Congress for the use of military force is likely unnecessary, he says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut \"if this turns into tit-for-tat with Iran, Trump should get an authorization. That would satisfy the War Powers Resolution \u2014 and strengthen his legal position,\" according to Griffin.",

        "Published": "2025-06-23T18:30:19Z",
        "Summary": "This article discusses a new weight loss drug and mentions Dr. Shauna Levy, medical director of the Tulane Bariatric Center, who comments positively on the increasing number of weight loss treatment options.  The mention of Tulane is positive by association with a respected expert in the field.",
        "Content": "A monthly weight loss drug from Amgen helped people lose about 20% of their body weight, according to the results of a phase 2 clinical trial.\n\nIf approved, the drug, called MariTide, could make Amgen the first new entrant into a market that\u2019s been dominated by Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly, which makes Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nThese powerful weight loss and Type 2 diabetes medications are all GLP-1 drugs. MariTide is, too, but differs in that it also contains a monoclonal antibody, which helps the drug stay in the body longer so people can take it monthly, rather than weekly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always just easier for patients to only have to take something once per month,\u201d said Dr. Michelle Ponder, an assistant professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine in North Carolina who wasn\u2019t involved in Amgen\u2019s trial. \u201cA lot of patients we see in endocrinology are diabetes patients, and so they\u2019d be taking multiple shots of insulin per day. And so, every last shot matters, even if it\u2019s three less shots per month.\u201d\n\nAmgen's results were published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Diabetes Association\u2019s annual meeting in Chicago.\n\nThe trial included nearly 600 adults split into two groups: people with Type 2 diabetes and obesity, and people with obesity alone.\n\nParticipants got one of three doses of MariTide or a placebo, taken once a month for a year. Some of the people in the obesity group started at a lower dose that was gradually increased over several weeks.\n\nThe trial found that participants with obesity alone who got MariTide lost up to 20% of their body weight, on average, after 52 weeks, compared with just 2.6% in the placebo group. Among participants with diabetes, people who got MariTide lost up to 17% of their body weight, on average, compared with 1.4% in the placebo group.\n\nThe results place MariTide on par with Wegovy, which reduced body weight by about 15% after 68 weeks in trials in people without diabetes, and Zepbound, which led to an average weight loss of 22.5% after 72 weeks. (These are not direct comparisons, however, as the drugs were not tested against each other in head-to-head trials.)\n\nBeyond weight loss, MariTide also lowered A1c \u2014 a key marker of blood sugar \u2014 by as much as 2.2 percentage points in people with diabetes. Ozempic and Mounjaro saw A1c reductions of around 1.5 to 2 percentage points in trials.\n\nParticipants also saw improvements in heart disease risk factors, including blood pressure, inflammation and cholesterol levels.\n\nPonder said that all the GLP-1 medications have shown heart benefits, likely due in part to the amount of weight loss patients experienced.\n\nSide effects reported for MariTide were similar to those seen with other GLP-1 medications, mainly gastrointestinal issues.\n\nDr. Jay Bradner, Amgen\u2019s executive vice president of research and development, said that weight loss with MariTide hadn\u2019t yet plateaued at the one-year mark, suggesting the potential for further weight loss with longer treatment.\n\nThe company is also testing the drug with every-other-month dosing. Early results, Bradner said, showed weight loss was comparable to the monthly version, although patients reported more side effects.\n\nA growing field\n\nMariTide is part of the next generation of highly effective treatments for diabetes and weight loss that aim to offer greater weight loss with fewer side effects than semaglutide (the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (in Mounjaro and Zepbound).\n\nMost of these new drugs are still likely several years away from approval. Amgen, for example, plans to run a 72-week long Phase 3 trial of MariTide as its next step, Bradner said.\n\nLilly and Novo Nordisk also presented findings at the diabetes conference.\n\nAn experimental drug from Lilly, eloralintide, led to an average 11.3% weight loss over 12 weeks in a Phase 1 study, according to new results published last week at the diabetes conference.\n\nUnlike drugs that target the GLP-1 hormone, eloralintide targets amylin, a hormone that slows stomach emptying. Lilly said the drug\u2019s side effects were less common compared with other drugs it has studied, with 8% of patients on the drug reporting nausea and 4% reporting vomiting.\n\nAnother drug from Lilly, called retatrutide, was shown to help people lose about 24% of their body weight, on average, in a mid-stage trial. A Phase 3 trial is expected to be completed later this year.\n\nLilly also found that a combination of semaglutide and bimagrumab \u2014 a monoclonal antibody that promotes muscle growth \u2014 helped preserve lean muscle mass in patients in a Phase 2 trial.\n\nAnd the company\u2019s experimental weight loss pill, orforglipron, was shown to lower A1c in people with Type 2 diabetes, according to Phase 3 trial results published Saturday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s newest drug, CagriSema, led to greater weight loss than semaglutide, according to results presented Sunday at the conference.\n\nThe two Phase 3 trials tested CagriSema \u2014 a combination of semaglutide and another drug called cagrilintide \u2014 in more than 4,500 adults with obesity. In people without diabetes, those who took CagriSema lost an average of 20.4% of their body weight after 68 weeks. Among adults with Type 2 diabetes, average weight loss was 13.7%.\n\nDr. Shauna Levy, a specialist in obesity medicine and the medical director of the Tulane Bariatric Center in New Orleans, said the growing number of options is a bonus for patients who may not respond well to one of the existing treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long been thought that obesity is an easy disease to treat, but in reality, it\u2019s actually very difficult,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be one right answer for the patients, so the more tools we have to treat the disease, the more likely you will be successful in hopefully eliminating or significantly decreasing this epidemic.\u201d\n\nDr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, said growing competition could also push drugmakers to lower their prices.\n\nWegovy and Zepbound, for example, can cost patients more than $1,000 a month. But in recent months, both Novo Nordisk and Lilly have introduced lower-cost options for those paying out of pocket.\n\n\u201cAccess, affordability, remains the No. 1 barrier for patients obtaining any of these medications,\u201d he said.\n\nPonder, of Duke University, said: \u201cThe more options, the better. Even if new options come out that aren\u2019t necessarily stronger, just having an additional manufacturer making the medicine is really helpful to expand access to patients.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION (June 23, 2025, 4:29 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated which drugmaker is studying the combination of semaglutide and bimagrumab. It is Eli Lilly, not Novo Nordisk.",

        "Content": "TORONTO, June 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nBelo Sun Mining Corp. (\u201cBelo Sun\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX: BSX, OTCQX: BSXGF) is pleased to announce that its shareholders approved a major renewal of the Company\u2019s governance structure during today\u2019s Annual General Meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d). Belo Sun has also appointed a Brazil-based President to lead the Company\u2019s operations in the country. This transformation heralds a new chapter aimed at strategic discipline, in-country leadership, and focused execution as the Company seeks to advance its flagship Volta Grande Gold Project in Par\u00e1 State, Brazil.\n\nComprehensive Board Renewal\n\nFour new directors were elected to the Board, each bringing with them deep and complementary expertise in mine development, the Brazilian permitting process, capital markets, and Brazilian operations. Today, four out of six directors are either Brazilian or have worked extensively in Brazil during their careers. This new Board composition reflects the Company\u2019s sharpened focus on delivering long-term value and responsible project execution in Brazil:\n\nClovis Torres, a highly respected Brazilian mining executive and legal professional, was elected as a director and appointed Chairman of the Board. He also assumes the role of interim Chief Executive Officer, replacing Ayesha Hira from July 4, 2025. This leadership consolidation is aimed at simplifying governance, reducing costs, and improving decision-making.\n\n\n\nMr. Torres brings over 30 years of high-level leadership and governance experience from Brazil\u2019s leading companies. Mr. Torres is a partner and co-founder of Mello Torres \u2013 a leading Brazilian law firm specializing in mining and environmental law, M&A, crisis management, and debt restructuring. He was previously the General Counsel of Vale, Chairman of BR Distribuidora, a Director of Petrobras, and Director, President and CEO of Furnas Centrais Electricas \u2013 a wind farm and hydrogen power plant operator. Mr. Torres holds an LLM in international law, trade and finance from Tulane Law School, and a JD from Universidade Cat\u00f3lica de Salvador Law School.\n\n\n\nCarlos Bertoni, an accomplished Brazilian geologist and mining executive with more than 45 years of global experience, was elected as an independent director. Mr. Bertoni has explored and developed mineral projects across Canada, South America, and Africa. He led exploration programs at Golden Star, including the Omai (Guyana) and Rosebel (Suriname) gold mines, and co-managed the development of the Tulawaka gold mine in Tanzania. In Brazil, he served as Country Manager for Aura Minerals and directed exploration and feasibility work at the Serrote copper mine. He also led mineral resource definition at the Copperwood and White Pine copper deposits in Michigan, USA, for Highland Copper. Most recently, he served as CEO of Reunion Gold, where he oversaw the discovery of the Oko West gold deposit in Guyana, now in construction. Mr. Bertoni holds an M.Sc. in Mineral Exploration from Queen\u2019s University (Canada), is a registered Professional Geoscientist in Ontario, Canada, and a Fellow of the Society of Economic Geologists.\n\n\n\nBoris de Vries, joins the Board as an independent director. Mr. de Vries is Vice President, Business Development at Franco-Nevada and brings a distinctive blend of commercial, technical, ESG and operational expertise, with a strong focus on Latin America. He spent a decade in Brazil with Hatch, where he served as Director of Mining and Mineral Processing for South America, overseeing major project development across the region, including several greenfield gold projects in Brazil. Prior to that, he held operations and project execution roles at Cambior (now IAMGOLD Corporation). Mr. de Vries speaks fluent Portuguese and holds a Master\u2019s degree in Mining Engineering from Delft University of Technology.\n\n\n\nJack Lunnon, who joined the Board earlier this year as an independent director and a nominee of the La Mancha group, has now been formally elected by shareholders.

        "Summary": "This article focuses on Kelsey Lewis's journey to medical school, highlighting the support she received from The 15 White Coats, a nonprofit organization.  The article mentions Tulane University School of Medicine in passing, referencing a photograph of 15 Black medical students from Tulane that inspired the nonprofit's name.  The mention of Tulane is brief and positive, associating it with a successful initiative to increase diversity in medicine.  The overall sentiment regarding Tulane is neutral to slightly positive due to this indirect, positive connection.  The article does not focus on Tulane, but rather on Lewis's success story and the work of The 15 White Coats.",
        "Content": "Durham native Kelsey Lewis has only ever had one answer to the classic question, \u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to become a doctor and practice medicine,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nSitting on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u2019s campus, the 25-year-old is now just a few weeks away from starting medical school and taking the next major step toward making that childhood dream a reality. Lewis will soon attend med school at the university.\n\n\u201cHaving grown up in underserved communities and seeing the health disparities and ongoing health equity issues, it really motivated me to pursue a career in medicine,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe rising student shared her interest in medicine was encouraged throughout grade school, including by a biology teacher who she credits with opening her eyes to the various job opportunities there are within the medical field.\n\nAfter initially going to school for nursing, Lewis realized her true passion was in surgery and preventive medicine.\n\nWhen asked how she plans to tackle the tough days of schooling ahead, Lewis stated she\u2019d remind herself, \u201cIt all started with coming from an underserved community and the people that poured into me and loved on me in that space.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cMy purpose being greater than just trying to become a doctor but knowing that one day I get to go back and I get to serve those individuals that cared and loved on me.\u201d\n\nLewis is one of more than 250 students who have received financial support to attend med school through The 15 White Coats. The Black physician-led nonprofit has provided over $700,000 to students like Lewis to cover things like entrance exams, application fees and interview preparation.\n\n\u201cThe financial barriers to becoming a physician begin long before med school,\u201d shared Lisa Batiste, The 15 White Coats Executive Director. \u201cMCAT prep, registration, primary-secondary applications, traveling for interviews and more \u2013 that can exceed $6,000-12,000 before a student even receives an acceptance.\u201d\n\nBatiste told WRAL 77% of students nationwide cited cost as a significant barrier to med school entry.\n\nThe organization also offers mentorship opportunities and connects students with other resources needed to excel in their medical journeys.\n\nThe nonprofit\u2019s name was inspired by a viral photo of 15 Black students from Tulane University School of Medicine standing in front of what used to be slave quarters at a Louisiana plantation.\n\nBatiste noted the national recognition of the photo helped garner additional support and funding for the group\u2019s mission to increase diversity in medicine.\n\n\u201cThey need to believe they belong,\u201d Batiste stated. \u201cIn our program, we offer not only peer mentorship but mentorship with seasoned physicians that allow them to discuss some of their concerns. 78% of students reported a significant boost in their confidence because of this.\u201d\n\nNationwide, 5% of physicians are Black and 9% are Hispanic, according to the organization.\n\nLewis told WRAL News she is grateful for the support and guidance she\u2019s received from The 15 White Coats and encouraged other medical students to get involved with the organization.\n\n\u201cThese resources were a gamechanger for me, just simply because I don\u2019t come from a background that can help fund these resources on my own,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey even covered 10 schools I applied to during my primary applications, and they were able to find some networking opportunities for me.\n\nThe aspiring physician shared she hopes more students will be encouraged to pursue careers in medicine, especially in communities that may lack health care access.\n\n\u201cEven in the face of everything going on, there is still a huge need for more doctors, more nurses and more physicians, especially in communities like the one I come from,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe long-term effect of having providers in these spaces I think outweighs current circumstances that we face today.\"\n\nThe 15 White Coats states the organization is comprised of volunteers with 100% of money raised going directly toward the organization\u2019s cause.",

        "Summary": "This scientific article discusses a study on murine norovirus and mentions Tulane virus in a phylogenetic comparison of amino acid sequences in the NS3 protein.  The mention is purely for comparative purposes within the study, there is no discussion of Tulane or its reputation.  Tulane is only mentioned in passing in a scientific comparison.",
        "Content": "Viruses encounter a range of selective pressures, but inefficiencies during replication can be masked. To uncover factors that limit viral replication, we used forward genetics to enrich for a murine norovirus (MNV) mutant with faster replication. We sequentially harvested the earliest progeny in cultured cells and identified a single amino acid change in the viral NS3 protein, K40R, that was sufficient to enhance replication speed. We found that the NS3-K40R virus induced earlier cell death and viral egress compared with wild-type virus. Mechanistically, NS3-K40R protein disrupted membranes more efficiently than wild-type NS3 protein, potentially contributing to increased mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Immunodeficient mice infected with NS3-K40R virus had increased titers, suggesting that increasing egress did not reduce fitness in vivo. Overall, by using a forward genetic approach, we identified a previously unknown inefficiency in norovirus egress and provide new insights into selective pressures that influence viral replication and evolution.\n\nFunding: National Institutes of Health grants R37 AI074668 to J.K.P., T32 AI007520 to V.J.R.I, and T32AI005284 to R.W.M.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.\n\nIn this study, we selected for MNV mutants with enhanced replication speed by sequentially harvesting the earliest progeny, at 6 h post-infection, in cultured cells. We found that a single amino acid change in the viral NS3 protein was sufficient to enhance replication. The NS3-K40R mutant induced earlier cell death and viral egress compared to wild-type MNV. Furthermore, the NS3-K40R mutant virus had increased titers in immunodeficient mice. Our findings suggest that viruses can adapt to selective pressures to accelerate replication, and forward genetic approaches are valuable tools for uncovering unanticipated factors that influence viral replication.\n\nNS3 is a multifunctional protein essential at different stages of replication. The NS3 C-terminal domain contains the evolutionarily conserved viral helicase and NTPase, both of which are required for viral genome replication [ 22 , 23 ]. Caliciviruses induce cell death [ 24 \u2013 30 ], and previous studies have implicated NS3 in this process [ 31 , 32 ]. Recently, it was demonstrated that the N-terminal region of NS3 promotes viral egress [ 31 , 32 ]. Wang and colleagues showed that NS3 interacts with mitochondrial lipids, including cardiolipin, and disrupts cardiolipin-containing liposomes, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cell death [ 31 , 33 ]. Notably, in the absence of this NS3-mediated cell death function, infected cells accumulate large numbers of progeny viruses that fail to exit and spread. However, the large 158 amino acid domain deletion in NS3 in that study makes it difficult to disentangle effects on egress from other facets of replication.\n\nMurine norovirus (MNV), a nonenveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus from the Caliciviridae family, serves as a model enteric virus [ 12 , 13 ]. The MNV genome is approximately 7.4 kb and encodes 3\u20134 open reading frames (ORFs) [ 12 , 14 ]. Translation of ORF1 produces a polyprotein that is cleaved by the viral protease to generate the mature non-structural proteins NS1\u20137 [ 14 ]. The vRNA replication complex has been linked to vesicular clusters [ 15 , 16 ] and includes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (NS7), VPg (NS5), and nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase)/RNA helicase (NS3) [ 17 ]. MNV lab strains share 87% or greater genetic identity [ 18 ] and can cause either acute (MNV1 CW3) or persistent infections (MNV3, MNV CR6, MNV CR3) in mice [ 19 , 20 ]. In cell culture, MNV replicates efficiently in dendritic and macrophage cell lines [ 21 ], and many groups use immortalized macrophage cell lines, such as BV2 and RAW264.7, for MNV studies. Replication kinetics can vary, but capsid proteins are detectable as early as 6 h post-infection, and progeny virions are typically observed 9\u201312 h after infection [ 21 ]. Therefore, the 12\u201324 h timeframe is frequently used for in vitro infection experiments.\n\nViral replication is a complex process and exposure to selective pressures can drive viral adaptation [ 1 \u2013 3 ]. In particular, RNA viruses are highly adaptable due to the high mutation rates of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which lack proofreading [ 2 , 4 \u2013 7 ]. Adaptive mutations can enhance viral replication under various selective pressures, including neutralizing antibodies [ 8 ], replication within animals [ 9 ], and heat exposure [ 10 ]. Forward genetic screening has revealed viral adaptive changes and illuminated unexpected replication defects. For example, in a previous study, we demonstrated that a mutation in the capsid of coxsackievirus B3 increased replication in cultured cells by destabilizing the virion and facilitating more efficient viral RNA (vRNA) release during uncoating [ 11 ]. Therefore, viral adaptive mutations can reveal new insights into unanticipated facets of viral replication.\n\nStat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were perorally infected with 10 6 PFU of WT or NS3-K40R virus followed by assessment of (A) weight loss, (B) survival until 8 days post-infection. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 8, \u2265 2 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, Mantel-Cox test. Infections were repeated, but mice were sacrificed at 24 h post-infection for viral titer analysis via plaque assay for tissues including (C) spleen, (D) duodenum, (E) ileum, and (F) colon. We repeated infections in immunocompetent mice and sacrificed at 24 h post-infection for viral titer analysis via plaque assay for tissues including (G) ileum and (H) colon. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 12, \u2265 2 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, unpaired t test. LOD, limit of detection. LOD was determined based on the average tissue weight. The data underlying this figure can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 14\u201321.\n\nTo determine whether NS3-K40R alters MNV replication or pathogenesis in vivo, we perorally infected Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice with 10 6 PFU of MNV3 WT or NS3-K40R. We chose to use immunodeficient Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice for these initial experiments because MNV can induce clinical signs and even death, whereas MNV infection is generally not severe in immunocompetent mice [ 39 , 40 ]. First, we monitored weight loss and clinical signs of infection. Mice were euthanized when they had lost 25% of their body weight or exhibited any critical clinical signs. In NS3-K40R-infected mice, clinical signs such as eye discharge appeared as early as 3 days post-infection. Both WT- and NS3-K40R-infected mice displayed similar clinical signs, including constipation, eye discharge, paralysis, and lethargy. Throughout the infection, NS3-K40R did not cause significant differences in weight loss or survival ( Fig 6A and 6B ). Second, we repeated the experiment in Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice as well as in immunocompetent mice but sacrificed mice at 24 h post-infection for titer analysis via plaque assays [ 41 ]. NS3-K40R-infected Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice had increased viral titers in the spleen, duodenum, ileum and colon ( Fig 6C \u2013 6F ). However, we did not observe differences in WT versus NS3-K40R viral titers from immunocompetent mice ( Fig 6G and 6H ). Overall, the increased titers of NS3-K40R in Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice suggest that this mutation enhances viral replication early in infection within an immunocompromised host, but this advantage is lost in mice with intact innate immune responses.\n\nNS3 protein binds cardiolipin [ 31 ], a phospholipid primarily localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria but that is translocated to the outer membrane during cellular stress such as infection [ 36 \u2013 38 ]. To investigate whether NS3-K40R induces cell death by disrupting mitochondria, we tested its ability to disrupt cardiolipin liposomes. Due to potential confounding effects from the His6-MBP tag on NS3 proteins for these liposome-based experiments, we cleaved the tag, purified NS3 proteins via size-exclusion chromatography, and collected predicted monomers (~39 kDa) ( S4A Fig ). We then incubated varying concentrations of proteins with or without cardiolipin liposomes encapsulating terbium (III) cation (Tb 3+ ) and quantified membrane disruption through release of Tb 3+ . As expected, there was minimal Tb 3+ release in control experiments using BSA with liposomes or NS3-K40R in the absence of liposomes ( S4B Fig ). At high NS3 protein concentration (0.5 \u00b5M), WT and K40R proteins showed no differences in their ability to disrupt cardiolipin liposomes ( S4C Fig ). However, at lower concentrations (0.05 and 0.005 \u00b5M), NS3-K40R was still able to disrupt cardiolipin liposomes, whereas NS3 WT was not ( Fig 5E ). Cardiolipin membrane disruption by NS3-WT required high protein concentrations (0.5 \u00b5M or 0.1 \u00b5M) ( Fig 5F ). These results suggest that NS3-K40R can disrupt cardiolipin membranes at protein concentrations 10\u2013100-fold lower than WT NS3. Overall, these data indicate that the K40R mutation enhances the ability of NS3 to target cardiolipin-containing membranes, potentially contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.\n\n(A, B) NS3-K40R increases cell death at early times post-infection. BV2 cells were infected with mock, WT or NS3-K40R at MOI 15 and at 6 or 8 h post-infection the number of dead cells was quantified by flow cytometry to detect SYTOX nucleic acid staining of non-viable cells.

(E) Liposome leakage assay with low concentrations of NS3 proteins reveals increased activity of NS3-K40R compared with NS3-WT.

Data are representative of two independent experiments with separate protein/liposome preparations. (F) NS3-WT protein induces liposome leakage at high protein concentrations.

The data underlying this figure can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 10\u201313.\n\nHow does NS3-K40R induce earlier viral egress? Given that the K40R mutation is within the N-terminal domain of NS3 that induces cell death by targeting mitochondria [ 31 ], we examined cell death and production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) both late in infection and at early time points. First, to determine whether NS3-K40R affects cell viability late in infection, BV2 cells were infected with either WT or NS3-K40R virus, and cell viability was measured at 24 h post-infection using an ATP-based assay. At 24 h post-infection, cell viability was reduced for both WT and NS3-K40R compared with mock-infected cells. However, NS3-K40R virus induced greater cell death than WT virus ( S3A Fig ). Given that NS3-K40R promotes earlier viral egress at 6 and 8 hours post-infection ( Fig 4B ), we next examined its effect on cell death at these early time points using SYTOX nucleic acid stain and flow cytometry. As expected, cell death was minimal this early in infection. However, NS3-K40R virus-induced increased cell death at 6 and 8 h post-infection compared with WT virus ( Figs 5A , 5B , and S5A ). Next, to assess mitochondrial damage, cells were infected as above but incubated with MitoSOX and quantified by flow cytometry to measure mitochondrial ROS. Mirroring the cell viability results, at 24 h post-infection, both WT and NS3-K40R infected cells had higher mitochondrial superoxide than mock-infected cells, but NS3-K40R virus-induced higher levels than WT virus ( S3B Fig ). At 6 and 8 h post-infection, mitochondrial superoxide levels were low, but NS3-K40R virus-induced increased mitochondrial superoxide compared with WT virus ( Figs 5C , 5D , and S5B ). These findings suggest that NS3-K40R promotes both cell death and mitochondrial disruption earlier in infection compared to WT virus.\n\nTo determine whether effects extend to cell lines other than BV2 cells, we quantified extracellular viral yield of WT versus NS3-K40R in RAW264.7 macrophages. We found increased viral yield of NS3-K40R virus in the supernatant of RAW264.7 cells after 8 h post-infection ( S2 Fig ), suggesting that NS3-K40R facilitates earlier viral egress in multiple cell lines.\n\nBV2 cells were infected with MNV3 WT or NS3-K40R at MOI 0.1 for 4, 6, and 8 h post-infection, and progeny were harvested from (A) cells (representing virion particles within cells) or (B) culture supernatants (representing extracellular virus) followed by plaque assay quantification. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3, \u2265 3 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA. ND, not detected. LOD, limit of detection. The data underlying this figure can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 8\u20139.\n\nGiven that NS3-K40R did not alter RNA synthesis or vRNA:PFU ratio, we examined a later stage in the replication cycle, viral release/egress. As a non-enveloped virus, MNV progeny are fully assembled intracellularly prior to release. To examine egress, BV2 cells were infected at an MOI 0.1 and viral progeny were collected at 4, 6, and 8 h post-infection from two distinct sites: cell-associated progeny within cells versus extracellular progeny in the media. Plaque assays revealed no differences in the viral titers of cell-associated virus between NS3-K40R and WT-infected cells, further supporting the idea that NS3-K40R does not alter RNA synthesis or earlier replication stages ( Fig 4A ). However, NS3-K40R virus had increased extracellular viral titers compared with WT, including a ~ 7-fold increase in viral yield at 8 hours post-infection ( Fig 4B ). To gain finer insight into egress kinetics, we performed additional infection experiments where BV2 cells were infected at an MOI 0.1 and extracellular viral progeny in the media were collected every two hours over a 16-h period. We found that at early time points, between 6 and 10 h post-infection, the NS3-K40R had higher viral titers than WT ( S1A Fig ). However, at later time points, no significant differences were observed between WT and NS3-K40R. To determine the total viral yields for WT and NS3-K40R over the 16-h infection, we calculated the area under the curve and found no significant differences ( S1B Fig ). These data suggest that while NS3-K40R may confer an early advantage in viral release, the overall viral yield across the infection time course is similar for NS3-K40R and WT.\n\nNext, to determine whether NS3-K40R alters NS3 enzymatic functions as an NTPase, we purified NS3 proteins and measured ATP hydrolysis via release of inorganic phosphate [ 23 ]. We expressed NS3 as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins and purified full-length His6-MBP-NS3 WT and K40R using affinity chromatography. To ensure equal protein concentrations for the NTPase assay, purified proteins, and an MBP control were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and band intensities were quantified ( Fig 3C ). Then, WT or NS3-K40R proteins were incubated with ATP for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, and phosphate release was measured using a colorimetric assay. ATP was efficiently hydrolyzed by MBP-NS3, confirming its NTPase activity. However, no apparent differences in ATP hydrolysis were observed between WT and K40R after 30 min of reaction. As a control, MBP alone did not show detectable phosphate release ( Fig 3D ). Overall, these data demonstrate that NS3-K40R does not alter genome copy numbers during infection or ATP hydrolysis of purified protein, suggesting that the mutation does not enhance RNA synthesis.\n\n(A) Quantification of viral RNA during infection. BV2 cells were infected with WT or NS3-K40R at MOI 2, and intracellular viral RNA at indicated time points was harvested and quantified via RT-qPCR targeting MNV ORF1. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3, \u2265 3 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA. (B) MNV3 WT and NS3-K40R have similar vRNA to PFU ratios. BV2 cells were infected and at 10 h post-infection cells were collected and split, with half used to determine titers by plaque assay and half used for RNA extraction and quantification by qRT-PCR. The vRNA:PFU ratio represents the viral genome copies (viral genomes/mL) divided by viral titer (PFU/mL). Data are mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3, \u2265 3 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, unpaired t test. (C) Purified MBP-NS3 proteins used for NTPase assay. MBP-NS3 fusion proteins or MBP protein alone were purified and analyzed by 4%\u201320% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The bands of proteins were quantified using ImageJ. (D) NTPase activity of purified NS3 proteins. NS3-MBP fusion proteins or MBP protein alone were incubated with 10 \u00b5M ATP for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, and inorganic phosphate released from ATP hydrolysis was quantified via a colorimetric assay and its concentration was determined based on a standard curve. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM (Representative data from three independent protein preparations). *P < 0.05, ANOVA. The data underlying this figure can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 5\u20137.\n\nTo determine whether NS3-K40R enhances replication kinetics through effects on RNA replication and/or virion production, we quantified vRNA accumulation in infected cells and the ratio of vRNA to PFU. First, we quantified viral genome copy numbers early in infection. BV2 cells were infected at an MOI 2, harvested at 2, 4, and 6 h post-infection, and vRNA was quantified by qRT-PCR. No differences in genome copies were observed between NS3-K40R and WT virus ( Fig 3A ). Second, we compared the replication capacity of WT and NS3-K40R by calculating the vRNA:PFU ratio. BV2 cells were infected at MOI 2, and cells were collected at 10 h post-infection. Half of the cell volume was used for qRT-PCR to quantify genome copies as described above, while the other half was used for plaque assays to determine viral titers. We then calculated the vRNA:PFU ratio by dividing the number of genome copies by the viral titer. No significant differences in the vRNA:PFU ratio were observed ( Fig 3B ), indicating that NS3-K40R does not alter vRNA or virion production at 10 h post-infection.\n\nNS3 is a multifunctional protein with enzymatic activity in the viral replication complex [ 22 , 23 ] and a role in cell death and viral egress [ 31 , 32 ]. MNV NS3 protein has three domains: the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1\u2013158), the core domain (amino acids 158\u2013289), and the C-terminal domain (amino acids 290\u2013364) [ 22 , 31 ]. Specifically, the NS3-K40R mutation is in the N-terminal domain of NS3. Lysine at position 40 is conserved among MNVs ( Fig 2D , highlighted in yellow); however, it is less conserved among other members of the Caliciviridae family. For example, human norovirus has arginine and Tulane virus has glutamine at this position ( Fig 2D ). These data suggest that the impact of this region of NS3 may vary across the Caliciviridae family.\n\nTo determine if the NS3-K40R or VP2-A114 mutations were sufficient to increase replication kinetics, we cloned them into an MNV3 infectious clone plasmid using site-directed mutagenesis and generated virus stocks. We infected BV2 cells at MOI 0.1, collected combined cells and supernatant for each sample at 4, 6, and 8 hours post-infection, and viral titer was determined via plaque assay. NS3-K40R showed higher viral titers, most notably at 8 hours post-infection, with ~5-fold higher titers than cells infected with WT ( Fig 2B ). The titers from VP2 A114 were similar to WT. These data suggest that NS3-K40R was sufficient to confer increased replication kinetics. To assess when the NS3-K40R arose during passaging, we performed consensus sequence analysis for progeny from previous passages, focusing on the NS3 N-terminal region. Mutation of adenine to guanine (AAG to AGG), which confers the NS3-K40R substitution, was first observed at Passage 4, and predominated the population by Passage 8 ( Fig 2C ).\n\n(A) Schematic of MNV3 genome with mutations found after 11 passages. Consensus sequence analysis revealed three mutations in viral progeny from passage 11-6 h stocks: Two amino acid substitutions in NS3, K40R, and I340T, and a silent mutation in the minor capsid protein VP2. Passage 11-24 h stocks also contained the NS3-I340T mutation. (B) Viral infection assay of MNV3 WT, NS3-K40R, and VP2-114. Infectious clone-derived viruses bearing NS3-K40R, the VP2-114 silent mutation, or no engineered mutations (WT) were used to infect BV2 cells at an MOI 0.1. Cells and supernatant were collected, and virus was quantified via plaque assay. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 4; \u2265 4 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA. (C) Emergence of adenine to guanine (AAG to AGG) mutation at position 1147 (NS3 amino acid 40) during viral passaging. Peak heights were determined from chromatograms of the consensus sequence across passages. The percentages of peak heights were calculated based on the relative abundance of all four nucleotides at position 1147. (D) Conservation of amino acids at position 25 to 49 of NS3 across selected caliciviruses. Viruses are arranged based on their percentage identity relative to MNV3. Amino acid sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE. Lysine 40 (K40) of NS3 is marked with a yellow rectangle. LOD, limit of detection. The data underlying this figure can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 3\u20134.\n\nWe performed consensus sequencing to determine whether mutations contributed to the increased replication kinetics of the Passage 11-6 h virus. Viral genomes from Passage 11-6 h and Passage 11-24 h were amplified using RT-PCR and products were sequenced. We identified a total of three mutations in Passage 11-6 h virus, at nucleotides 1147, 2047, and 7022 ( Fig 2A ). The mutation at nucleotide 2047 resulted in an amino acid substitution from isoleucine to threonine (I340T) in non-structural protein 3 (NS3), which was present in both Passage 11-6 h and Passage 11-24 h. Given that I340T was present in both selective (Passage 11-6 h) and non-selective (Passage 11-24 h) conditions, it is possible that this mutation is due to drift or general cell culture adaptation. Indeed, we recently identified a mutation at this site, I340V, in MNV genomes following adaptation to replication in HeLa cells [ 35 ]. Both mutations at I340 appear to be associated with general cell culture adaptation. On the other hand, two mutations were unique to the viral progeny from Passage 11-6 h: a missense mutation nucleotide 1147 that resulted in substitution from lysine to arginine (K40R) in NS3 and a silent mutation at nucleotide 7022 in the minor capsid protein VP2 (A114).\n\n(A) Schematic showing serial passage strategy. Initial MNV3 stock (P0) was used to infect BV2 cells, and progeny were harvested at 6 h or 24 h post-infection. Low titer viral progeny harvested at 6 hours were amplified overnight in BV2 cells to facilitate subsequent passages. Half of the volume of each sample was used to initiate a new passage, and the cycle was repeated 11 times. (B) Viral infection assay comparing the initial stock virus (Passage 0) and viruses passaged 11 times, collecting at 6 h vs. 24 h. BV2 cells were infected at an MOI 0.1 for 6 h. Cells and supernatant were pooled for each sample, and viral titers were quantified via plaque assay. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 6, \u2265 3 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA. (C) Single-cycle growth curve of Passage 0 and Passage 11-6 h. BV2 cells were infected at MOI 0.1 and cells and supernatant were collected and viral titer determined via plaque assay. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 7, \u2265 4 independent experiments). *P < 0.05, unpaired t test. LOD, limit of detection. The data underlying this Fig can be found in S1 Data file, Tabs 1\u20132.\n\nTo determine whether MNV could adapt to replicate more rapidly, we performed serial passage of MNV3 in BV2 cells, harvesting the early progeny. MNV progeny can be detected at high titers after 12 h post-infection [ 21 , 34 ]. For serial passage, we infected BV2 cells with MNV3 at an MOI 0.1 and we collected combined cells and culture supernatants for each sample at two different time points: 6 h post-infection to harvest the earliest progeny, or 24 h post-infection to harvest progeny from a complete replication cycle. The low-yield virus collected at 6 h was amplified in BV2 cells overnight to achieve higher titers. Samples were then freeze-thawed to release intracellular virus, and half of the sample was used for a new passage. This process was repeated for 11 passages ( Fig 1A ). After 11 passages, we performed a viral infection assay for 6 h at an MOI 0.1 to determine the phenotype of the passaged virus compared to the input stock. Samples collected at 6 h post-infection (Passage 11-6 h) produced higher yields than the input stock virus (Passage 0) or samples collected at 24 h post-infection (Passage 11-24 h) ( Fig 1B ). We also performed a single-cycle growth curve to determine replication kinetics and observed higher viral titers from Passage 11-6 h compared to Passage 0 at early time points of infection ( Fig 1C ). For example, passage 11-6 h virus had 42-fold higher titers at 8 h post-infection compared with Passage 0 virus. These data suggest that the passaged virus (Passage 11-6 h) produced progeny viruses earlier than Passage 0 virus.\n\nHere we show that NS3-K40R MNV3 produces progeny faster in vitro and replicates to higher titers in Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice\u2014so why does wild-type MNV3 contain lysine rather than arginine at position 40? In general, MNV strains contain lysine at this position ( Fig 2D ). However, a few caliciviruses have arginine at this position, including human norovirus (Norwalk strain), Newbury-1 virus, and Turkey calicivirus. The relative egress efficiencies of these other viruses are unknown, but it is possible that other amino acids in the N-terminal region of NS3 also impact cell death and egress. For example, early cell death and egress of progeny may reduce viral yield in the long run\u2014a cell that dies early may contain fewer progeny viruses than a live cell that continues to support logarithmic viral replication for hours. Indeed, we found that over a full 16-h single cycle of infection, total yields of WT and NS3-K40R progeny were equivalent ( S1 Fig ), suggesting that WT virus \u201ccatches up\u201d. Another possibility is that early release of progeny induces early host immune responses that would then limit replication. Importantly, although NS3-K40R has higher titers than WT in Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, this titer difference is lost immune-competent animals ( Fig 6C \u2013 H ). Therefore, it is possible that in immune-competent animals, STAT1-dependent innate responses are triggered sooner by early viral egress of NS3-K40R virions, thus limiting the advantage of NS3-K40R. Finally, a major determinant of viral fitness is interhost transmission. It is possible that variants with enhanced egress have reduced transmission. In the end, subtle fitness costs for NS3-K40R MNV3, or fitness costs not studied here may explain maintenance of lysine at this position. Overall, this study illuminates the importance of NS3-mediated egress of MNV and provides new insights into viral evolution and fitness.\n\nHow does a conservative amino acid change from lysine to arginine at position 40 of MNV NS3 alter mitochondrial membrane disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death? Previous work suggests that the N-terminal domain of MNV NS3 contains a mitochondrial localization signal, and a four-helix bundle homologous to the membrane-disruption domain of the host mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) cell death protein [ 22 , 31 , 45 , 46 ]. For MLKL, phosphorylation triggers a conformational change that results in association with the plasma membrane, followed by membrane permeabilization via the four-helix bundle domain [ 46 \u2013 48 ]. For NS3, Wang and colleagues suggest that the mitochondrial localization signal in amino acids 1\u201320 of NS3 directs the protein to mitochondria followed by membrane disruption via four-helix bundle domain in amino acids 25\u2013158. Deletion of the N-terminal 20 amino acids of NS3 prevented MNV-mediated cell death and egress, thus blocking detectable viral spread in vitro and in vivo [ 31 ]. Although lysine to arginine is a conserved amino acid change, there is precedent for profound functional differences for proteins that bind and alter membranes. Previous studies have shown that replacing arginine with lysine reduces the membrane translocation efficiency of peptides like Penetratin [ 49 ]. In contrast, substituting lysine for arginine enhances cellular uptake of HIV Tat protein [ 50 ]. Notably, we found that NS3-K40R protein disrupts cardiolipin-containing membranes at concentrations 10\u2013100-fold lower than wild-type NS3 protein ( Fig 5E ). Additionally, we routinely purified more NS3-K40R protein compared with NS3-WT protein, with ~3\u20136 times more NS3-K40R than WT in eight independent protein preparations (see S4A Fig for an example). The properties of arginine and its guanidinium group in NS3-K40R may influence protein stability and interactions with membrane lipids, ultimately leading to mitochondrial disruption and cell death. Although the precise mechanism by which NS3-K40R disrupts mitochondria remains unknown, these results provide new insight into NS3-mediated viral egress.\n\nRecent studies have suggested a role for the N-terminus of NS3 in cell death induction, and our results extend and elevate the importance of NS3-mediated egress in vitro and in vivo [ 31 , 32 , 43 , 44 ]. Aktepe and colleagues demonstrated that amino acids 67\u2013100 of NS3 induce host translation shutoff and cell death [ 32 ]. Wang and colleagues demonstrated that N-terminal NS3 amino acids 1\u2013158 were necessary and sufficient to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death [ 31 ]. Viral genomes lacking the N-terminal domain of NS3 were capable of RNA replication and forming progeny virions, but lack of cell death and egress meant they were unable to spread, form plaques, or produce progeny in mice [ 31 ]. However, the large deletion in NS3 makes it difficult to differentiate effects on egress from other aspects of viral replication and fitness. Here, we used an unbiased approach to enrich for faster-replicating mutants and found a single conservative amino acid change in the N-terminal domain of NS3 increased egress by enhancing membrane damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death ( Fig 5 ). Thus, in a system where any mutation in the genome that increases early progeny production could be selected, the fact that an egress-enhancing mutation emerged highlights the importance and relevance of NS3-mediated MNV egress. Overall, our study cements a key role for the NS3 N-terminal region, particularly position 40, in mitochondrial membrane disruption, cell death, and MNV egress.\n\nAlthough mutation of norovirus NS3 at position 40 has not been described previously, other mutations in NS3 have been characterized [ 22 , 34 , 35 , 42 ]. For example, targeted mutations in the predicted phosphate-binding loop (K168Q) reduced NS3\u2019s enzymatic activities, reducing inorganic phosphate release or unwinding activity [ 22 , 42 ]. Arias and colleagues identified rare variants containing NS3-T91A in mice persistently infected with MNV3 [ 34 ], and we previously identified NS3-I340V among a large number of mutations in MNV1 variants with increased replication in HeLa cells [ 35 ]. In this study, we identified an NS3 mutation with no apparent differences in enzymatic activity but instead it facilitated earlier cell death and viral egress.\n\nWhile much is known about factors that influence viral replication, masked inefficiencies may exist that can be discovered using the power of forward genetic screens. Here, found that MNV egress can be enhanced by a mutation in NS3. This mutant virus had increased egress via enhanced cell death ( Figs 4 , 5A , and 5B ). More specifically, the NS3-K40R protein disrupted membranes with mitochondrial lipids more efficiently than WT protein ( Fig 5E and 5F ). NS3-K40R virus also had increased titers in Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Fig 6C \u2013 6F ) but was equivalent to WT virus in immune-competent mice. Overall, these results revealed a previously unknown inefficiency in calicivirus replication and revealed new insights into mechanisms of non-enveloped viral egress.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nEthics statement All animals were handled according to the Guide for the Care of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All mouse studies were performed at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Animal Welfare Assurance no. a3472-01) using protocols approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in a manner designed to minimize pain, and any animals that exhibited severe disease were euthanized immediately with isoflurane or CO 2 .\n\nCells and viruses BV2 and RAW264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% HEPES, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. MNV3 P6 clone (Courtesy of Stephanie Karst Lab KC792553.1 [34]). Viruses were generated by transfecting HEK293T cells with infectious clone plasmids, followed by two rounds of amplification in BV2 cells to produce high-titer viral stocks. Stocks were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n\nViral passaging experiments BV2 cells were seeded at 1.2 \u00d7 10\u2076 cells/well in 6-well plates and infected with MNV3 at an MOI 0.1. After 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C, the supernatant was removed, cells were washed, and fresh media was added. Infection was continued for 6 or 24 h before scraping cells into the media to collect pooled intracellular and extracellular progeny. Samples were freeze-thawed three times to release intracellular virus, and half of the sample was used to initiate the next infection. Low yield 6 h passaged samples were used to infect new BV2 cells in overnight amplifications to facilitate the next passages. Passages 2-5 were performed at unknown MOI. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay after passage 5. Passaging continued with an initial MOI 0.1 for passage 6, followed by additional passages of unknown MOI. These forward genetic experiments with MNV were performed under BSL2 conditions, as approved by the UT Southwestern Institutional Biosafety Committee.\n\nSequencing and cloning We performed consensus sequencing on Passage 11 viral populations as previously described [35]. Briefly, Passage 11 viruses were used to infect BV2 cells, vRNA was isolated at 18 h post-infection using TRIzol reagent, and cDNA was generated by RT-PCR with SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher) using Primer X (Table 1). PCR products were made using primer sets from Table 1 and purified with the Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel). Sequencing was performed by Azenta/Genewiz with the primers listed in Table 1. The sequences of the passaged viruses were compared with the sequence of initial stock (Passage 0) in SnapGene to identify mutations. We identified three mutations in Passage 11-6 h virus: A to G at nt 1147 (NS3-K40R), U to C at nt 2047 (NS3-I340T), and C to U at nt 7022 (a silent mutation in VP2 amino acid 114). Note that other minor variants may be present in P11-6 h samples that were not abundant enough to detect by consensus sequencing, but may contribute to phenotypes shown in Fig 1. The Passage 11-24 h samples also contained the NS3-I340T mutation, but not the NS3-K40R or silent mutation in VP2. It is possible that the NS3-I340T mutation, in combination with NS3-K40R, contributes to increased replication speed of the P11-6 h viral population (Fig 1C), but this was not evaluated here.

Primers covering the MNV genome. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003245.t001 To determine at which passage lysine was substituted with arginine at NS3 amino acid 40, we analyzed the nucleotide sequences at position 1147. We analyzed the consensus sequence across all viral progeny passages at 6 h using Primer set II from Table 1. The peak heights of all four nucleotides (A, G, C, T) at position 1147 were determined from the sequencing chromatogram. The percentages presented in Fig 2C were calculated based on the relative abundance of each nucleotide. Mutations unique to the Passage 11-6 h samples (NS3-K40R or VP2 silent mutation) were introduced into the MNV3 plasmid using site-directed mutagenesis (Genewiz/Azenta Life Sciences). Whole-plasmid sequencing (Plasmidsaurus) confirmed the presence of the mutations of interest and absence of other mutations. NS3-K40R and VP2-A114 viruses were generated from plasmids as described above. The presence of the mutations in the resulting viral stocks was sequence confirmed in RT-PCR products by Genewiz/Azenta Life Sciences.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis We analyzed the conservation of amino acids at positions 25\u201349 of NS3 in relation to the MNV3 P6 clone. Sequence data were obtained from the NCBI database, with accession numbers and related information provided in Table 2. Representative sequences for caliciviruses were selected from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) for each genus. Amino acid sequences were analyzed and aligned using MUSCLE, and the alignments were visualized with Geneious Prime. PPT PowerPoint slide\n\nPNG larger image\n\nTIFF original image Download: Table 2.

Briefly, virus was diluted in PBS+ (PBS supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 ) and incubated with BV2 cells for 20\u201330 min at 37 \u00b0C for attachment. Cells were then overlaid with 1.5% methylcellulose in MEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% HEPES. Overlays were removed after 72 h [35,51]. We set the limit of detection (LOD) at 2 plaques in undiluted samples (10 PFU); therefore, in some cases, values were below this detection limit. Samples with 1 or more plaques were included in the statistical analysis. For infection experiments and single cycle replication experiments, 1.2 \u00d7 106 BV2 cells/well in 6-well plates were infected at MOI 0.1, and at 1 hr post-infection inoculum was aspirated, cells were washed, and fresh media was added. At each time point, cells and supernatant were pooled from each well and collected. Samples were subject to freeze-thaw cycles three times to release any intracellular virus, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. For experiments in Fig 4 comparing cell-associated virus versus extracellular virus, infections were performed as above except that media were collected as the source of extracellular virus (with an additional spin to remove any floating cells) and remaining cells were washed prior to collection as the source of the cell-associated virus. For S1A and S1B Fig, the total area under the curve was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. To quantify vRNA during infection we used qRT-PCR as previously described [51]. Briefly, 6 x106 BV2 cells were infected with MNV3 WT and NS3-K40R virus at MOI 2 followed by removal of inoculum and washing at 1 hr post-infection. At 2, 4, and 6 hrs post-infection, cells were collected and intracellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol. cDNA was generated, and TaqMan quantitative PCR (qPCR) for MNV was performed in triplicate for each sample as described previously to quantify viral genomes [51]. The primers used for all samples are specified in Table 3. MNV3 plasmid that had been linearized with EcoRI was used as a standard.

List of previously published primers used for qPCR [ List of previously published primers used for qPCR [ 51 ]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003245.t003 For RNA:PFU ratio, plates were seeded with 4.4 x106 BV2 cells and infected with WT or NS3-K40R at MOI 2. At 1 hr post-infection inoculum was aspirated, cells were washed, and fresh media was added. After 10 hours post-infection, the cells were collected, and half were resuspended in 1mL PBS+ and used for plaque assays on BV2 cells. The remaining cells were resuspended in Trizol, and vRNA was isolated and quantified using qRT-PCR as described above. The RNA:PFU ratio was calculated by dividing the genome copy number by the titer for each sample.\n\nProtein purification WT and NS3-K40R NS3 proteins were purified from E. coli using a pMAL-c6T-His6-MBP vector as previously described [31]. Briefly, protein expression was induced overnight at 20\u00b0C with 0.25 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside after A 600 reached 0.8\u20130.9. The proteins were affinity-purified by Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). To remove heat-shock proteins we did an ATP wash that included incubation for <5 min with 20 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl and 5mM ATP. Bound proteins were washed three times and eluted with buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and Imidazole 250 mM. The proteins were subsequently affinity-purified with amylose resin (NEB) and eluted with buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 10 mM maltose. After purification, proteins concentration was determined and normalized using 4%\u201320% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. BSA was used as the standard, and total protein intensity was quantified with ImageJ. For NTPase experiments, we used His6-MBP tagged versions of WT or K40R NS3 proteins. However, for liposome leakage assays, we used preparations of these proteins without tags. The His6-MBP tag was removed by overnight TEV digestion at 16 \u00b0C and further purified with Ni-NTA agarose. We performed dialysis to exchange media buffer A (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl) . Then, TEV-cleaved NS3 proteins were purified by Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare), and the predicted monomers (~39 kDa) were collected. Previous studies have demonstrated the early aggregation of NS3 during collection [23,31]. Therefore, for liposome leakage assays, we focused on investigating the effect of NS3 as a monomer (S4A Fig).\n\nNTPase assay. NTPase activity of NS3 proteins was measured using Phosphate Assay Kit - PiColorLock (Abcam). His6-MBP-NS3-WT or His6-MBP-NS3-K40R proteins, or a MBP alone control, at 2 uM were incubated with 10 \u00b5M ATP for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and inorganic phosphate released from ATP hydrolysis was quantified by measuring the absorbance using Biotek Synergy LX. A standard curve was used to determine the linear concentration of inorganic phosphate released during the reaction.\n\nCell death and mitochondrial disruption assays Cell death was determined by measuring the levels of the nucleic acid stain SYTOX (ThermoFisher) and mitochondrial ROS were determined by measuring the mitochondria-specific superoxide indicator MitoSOX Red (ThermoFisher). For both assays, 2 x 105 BV2 cells were infected with WT or NS3-K40R viruses at MOI 2 for 24 hour experiments or MOI 15 for 6\u20138 hour experiments, inocula were removed and cells washed at 1 hr post-infection, fresh media was added, and at 6, 8, or 24 hours post-infection the relevant assay was performed. To measure cell death, BV2 cells were collected and stained with SYTOX for 15 min at RT. To measure mitochondrial ROS production, BV2 cells were collected and stained with the mitochondria-specific superoxide indicator MitoSOX Red for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fluorescence was quantified using a Stratedigm benchtop flow cytometer. The percentage of cells was determined using FlowJo software. For cell viability assays, cells were infected as described above and number of live cells was determined by measuring ATP levels using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. ATP levels were measured via luminescence using a Synergy LX plate reader.\n\nLiposome preparation and liposome leakage assay Cardiolipin liposomes were prepared as described by Wang and colleagues [31]. Briefly, lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids To prepare Tb3+-encapsulated liposomes, lipids 80% POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and 20% cardiolipin were mixed in a glass vial. Dry lipid films were obtained by evaporating under a stream of air and then hydrated at room temperature with vortex in 300 \u03bcl buffer B (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium citrate and 15 mM TbCl 3 ). Liposomes were generated by extrusion of the hydrated lipids through 100 nm polycarbonate filter (Whatman) 30 times using a Mini-Extruder device (Avanti Polar Lipids). The Tb3+ ions outside the liposome were removed by washing with buffer A (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl) on a centrifugal column (Amico Ultra-4, 100 K MWCO, Millipore). The liposomes were resuspended in buffer A and were stored at 4 \u00b0C and used within 24 hours. For liposome leakage assays, 0.1 mM of Tb3+-encapsulated liposomes were suspended in 250 \u03bcl buffer C (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) 150 mM NaCl and 50 \u03bcM of DPA) and NS3 or control proteins were added. Due to the sensitivity of these assays, NS3 proteins were used within 3 days of size-exclusion chromatography. Fluorescence of Tb3+ was monitored over time on a PTI spectrofluorometer using \u03bb Ex = 490 nm and \u03bb Em = 276 nm. At the end of the incubation, 1% Triton X-100 was added to measure complete release of Tb3+. Liposome preparations can vary leading to discrepancies in overall signal intensity. Therefore, comparisons were made only between assays using a given liposome preparation. Fig 5E and 5F shows analyses performed with a single, shared liposome batch, whereas the data in S4 Fig were generated using an independent liposome preparation.\n\nMouse infections A mix of male and female Stat1\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 or wild-type C57BL/6 mice between 6\u20138 weeks of age were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Jax#012606, Jax#000664) and were single-housed and left to acclimate for 5\u20137 days. Mice were perorally inoculated with 25 \u03bcl of 106 PFU MNV3 WT or NS3-K40R in DMEM with 5% FBS. At 24 hours post-infection, mice were euthanized, and tissues were collected. The tissues were homogenized by bead beating as previously described [35] and viral titers were determined via plaque assay using BV2 cells. We set the LOD at three plaques in undiluted samples and considered the average tissue weight to calculate the PFU/grams tissues; therefore, in some cases, values were below this detection limit. Samples with 1 or more plaques were included in the statistical analysis. For survival curve and weight loss experiments we used Stat1\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice that were bred and maintained in the UT Southwestern specific pathogen-free animal care facility. After peroral infection as described above the mice were observed and weighed for 8 days post-infection. Mice with clinical signs of disease (lost 25% body weight and/or were lethargic, had eye discharge, or paralysis) were euthanized by CO 2 . The remaining mice were euthanized at the end of the study.",

        "Content": "Abstract Introduction Diabetes is a significant public health issue due to its high prevalence and multifaceted consequences, impacting both the Brazilian Unified Health System and society. The disease adversely affects people's quality of life and elevates healthcare costs. In 2019, approximately 16 million Brazilians were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Understanding the future trends of this disease is crucial for planning effective preventive interventions. This paper aims to estimate the future prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus on individuals from the Study of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adolescents (ERICA) sample, based on the progression of their cardiovascular risk factors. Method A literature review was conducted to identify predictive models for type 2 diabetes mellitus that utilize cardiovascular risk factors assessed during adolescence to forecast diabetes risk in adulthood. A logistic regression model, grounded in the natural history of clinical variables derived from longitudinal studies, was applied to each individual to determine their risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed, incorporating the minimum and maximum values of model parameters. Results The predictive model estimated that 15.12% of individuals in the ERICA sample are likely to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus in adulthood, with a range of 1.1% to 28% based on sensitivity analyses. The parameters exerting the most significant influence on these results included diastolic blood pressure and triglycerides, followed by LDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure. Conclusion The application of this predictive model to the Study of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adolescents (ERICA) sample indicates an estimated prevalence of 15.12% for T2DM over a 20.5-year follow-up period. Studies like this one provide valuable insights for designing targeted interventions to mitigate the progression of diabetes and its associated socioeconomic impacts.\n\nCitation: Pozzi Ottavio B, Sousa Borges S, Santos da Costa MG, Caetano Kuschnir MC (2025) Estimation of the future prevalence of diabetes based on data from the Brazilian Study of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adolescents (ERICA).

Introduction Diabetes Mellitus (DM) refers to a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood glucose levels resulting from defects in insulin production or action [1]. This chronic condition can lead to serious complications such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, vision problems, and neuropathy [1]. The two most common types are Type 1 (T1DM), which is an autoimmune condition in which the insulin-producing cells are destroyed, and Type 2 (T2DM), which is marked by insulin resistance and is associated with obesity, aging, and a sedentary lifestyle. T2DM is the most prevalent form of diabetes, accounting for 90% of cases, while T1DM affects 5\u201310% of individuals. Less common forms of diabetes include gestational diabetes, monogenic diabetes, and secondary diabetes [2]. The prevalence of T2DM is rising rapidly with significant implications for global and national health systems. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported that the number of people who have diabetes worldwide can grow from 463 million in 2019, to 700 million by 2045. In Brazil, the IDF projects that diabetes affected 16 million people in 2019, and that this number might reach 26 million by 2045 [3]. The rising prevalence also leads to an increase in national health expenditure. The Brazilian Ministry of Health annually conducts the Surveillance of Risk and Protection Factors for Chronic Diseases through Telephone Inquiry (Vigitel in Portuguese), research that maps the prevalence of chronic diseases and associated factors in the 26 city capitals from every state in addition to the Federal District. In 2023, 10.2% of respondents reported a diabetes diagnosis, almost double the 5.5% who reported it when Vigitel was launched in 2006 [4]. Diabetes-related costs in Brazil were calculated at BRL 52.3 billion in 2019 [3], approximately USD 13.27 billion at the 2019 exchange rate [3]. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimated that in 2017, 4.4% of the Brazilian population had diabetes. Among those aged 20 years of age and older, that figure increases to 6.2% with T2DM affecting 96% of this population [5,6]. Data on T2DM in children and adolescents are limited, as the condition typically presents later in life due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Also according to the IHME, DM is among the leading causes of death, ranking fifth in 2021 and there has been a marked increase in deaths specifically attributed to T2DM from 1990 (2.2% of the total, 17,532 individuals) to 2020 (4.38% of the total, 51,684 individuals). The years of life lost due to premature death (460,650.36 to 1,336,956.09) and years lived with disability (348,837.77 to 1,243,850.91) have also seen significant increases [7]. This scenario reflects the profound impact of diabetes on quality of life and the considerable burden of its complications. Such complications include microvascular issues like incipient diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, as well as macrovascular problems such as cardiovascular disease. Consequently, Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) \u2013 a metric that combines years of life lost and years lived with disability [8] \u2013 has risen dramatically from 991,854.76 to 2,580,807.00 [7]. Such a trend for increased prevalence, and financial impact, of T2DM is an important element for planning public policies. Literature provides varied projections, as the aforementioned data from the IDF and the IHME. The Ministry of Health also projects, based on Vigitel data, a growth in the prevalence of diabetes of about 9% (2.8% \u2212 15.4%) for 2032 [4]. These data provide broad estimates based on a general population trend but do not specifically account for adolescent cardiovascular risk factors. Analyzing the T2DM tendency in a representative adolescent sample and considering their specific risk factors into the models could provide more precise estimates for the future generation. The importance of T2DM has been pushing governments to action, leading the inclusion of initiatives and metrics in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in the Strategic Action Plan for Addressing Chronic Diseases and Non-Communicable Diseases in Brazil 2021\u20132030. The SDG goal 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being at all ages, with specific targets to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as T2DM through prevention and treatment [9]. In parallel, Brazil's strategic plan admits the impact of T2DM on public health and on the economy, proposing actions to prevent and control the disease [10]. Given the impact of the disease, clinical guidelines are key to coordinating T2DM care. In Brazil, Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for T2DM set the diagnostic criteria and standard treatment for T2DM in the Brazilian public health system (SUS). Its latest version was published in 2024 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health [11]. The document establishes diagnostic tests and provides comprehensive treatment guidelines, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, with metformin as the first-line treatment for T2DM. Conducted between 2012 and 2014, the Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents (ERICA, acronym in Portuguese) is a national multicenter cross-sectional study. It aimed to estimate the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) in approximately 75,000 students aged 12\u201317 from public and private schools in Brazilian cities with populations of 100,000 or more [12]. Although the ERICA sample does not represent all age groups, it does reflect the trends for a generation of students for which it is representative. Thus, estimates with ERICA\u2019s population can provide valuable input for public policy formulation and prioritizing health interventions that address health habits and conditions in this population, potentially mitigating risks for diabetes development. Given the increasing impact of T2DM on public health, this study aims to estimate its future prevalence on ERICA\u2019s representative sample of adolescents by projecting the progression of their baseline CVRF and the resulting likelihood of developing T2DM.\n\n2. Methods A literature review was conducted in Embase and Medline databases in November 2023 to identify prediction models for DM that could contribute to its development. The search aimed to identify studies that utilized measures of CVRF collected during adolescence to predict the risk of diabetes in adulthood. The terms \u201crisk factor,\u201d \u201cadolescent,\u201d \u201cdiabetes,\u201d and \u201cadult\u201d were combined without restrictions by language or year. The search strategies are detailed in S1 File. Evidence was sought focusing on studies that correlated childhood or adolescent CVRF with the development of T2DM in adulthood. Eligible studies were those that analyzed CVRF measured during childhood or adolescence, and also available for ERICA\u2019s sample, with the aim of predicting the development of T2DM in adulthood. Abstracts and articles selected for full reading were excluded if: Incorporated data not available in the ERICA study, such as genetic information, body fat mass, or family history of T2DM from members of the extended family.\n\nReferred to populations that are incompatible with the ERICA\u2019s, such as obese children or only with a family history of T2DM, adults, Chinese, Finns, or North American indigenous peoples.\n\nIncluded only one risk factor in the analysis, such as BMI or family history.\n\nEvaluated outcomes distinct from the desired outcome (development of T2DM), for example, applicability and definition of cardiovascular risk thresholds in childhood to predict T2DM in adulthood, or composite outcomes (fasting glucose, T2DM, and hypertension). 2.1. Model implementation A model selected from the literature search was used to project the trend of adolescents in the ERICA sample in developing T2DM, utilizing an individual logistic regression that incorporated their characteristics. As per the inclusion criteria, the model incorporates risk factors that are available on ERICA. The model tracked individual patients with different demographic characteristics (age, sex, race) and clinical variables (such as blood pressure, BMI, and fasting glucose). Thus, a logistic regression was constructed with coefficients reflecting the natural history of clinical variables observed in a longitudinal study and applied to everyone in the sample. The natural history was combined with the baseline data of ERICA\u2019s sample to i) estimate the individual probability of reaching or not the outcome in question, the development of T2DM, and then ii) the number of individuals in the sample who reached the outcome. To estimate the baseline risk of the ERICA population (\u03b2\u2080), data from Vigitel 2023 were considered, which indicate that 10.2% of the Brazilian population has diabetes, and that 90% of these cases are T2DM [4]. Thus, the intercept used should be ln (0.0918). It was considered that an individual reached the outcome if they had a probability of having T2DM greater than or equal to 95%. The histograms with the frequency results of the probabilities are presented in S2 File. Additionally, probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted using the maximum and minimum coefficients calculated from their corresponding confidence intervals. In the probabilistic analysis, all coefficients were varied simultaneously to their maximum and minimum to examine potential extreme scenarios. In the deterministic analysis, each coefficient was varied while keeping the others constant, to identify the most relevant elements for the results in the evaluated sample. The application of the model and the other calculations were performed using R software (https://www.r-project.org/). The scripts used are found in S3 and S4 Files. In a logistic regression, the natural log of the odds ratio is calculated, that is, the probability of an event occurring over the probability of it not occurring, based on the behavior of independent variables [13]. The equation below is used to calculate the natural log of the odds ratio. The coefficient of a variable reflects how the odds ratio changes with an increase of one unit of that variable. Consequently, the probability of the event itself can be calculated using the following equation, which converts the natural logarithm into probability. 2.2. Characterization of T2DM To understand the trajectory of individuals in the sample regarding T2DM, the model set thresholds characterizing the evolution of patients. These cut-off points served as references for the logistic regression applied to the present study and are aligned to those outlined in the Ministry of Health Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines and international guidelines. For diabetes, the transition cut-off points are defined as follows: a fasting glucose level of \u2265 7 mmol/L and a glycated hemoglobin level greater than 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). 2.3. Predictive factors To estimate the trajectory of each individual, it was necessary to establish which characteristics of each member of the sample could be included in the model, considering the natural history of T2DM. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the main risk factors that may lead to the development of T2DM include family history, overweight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, aging, hypertension, history of gestational diabetes, poor nutrition during pregnancy, glucose intolerance, and ethnicity. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Brazilian Diabetes Society (SBD) [2,14] are more specific regarding aging, indicating that the risk increases after the age of 45, and include polycystic ovary syndrome in the list. The SBD further defines that there is a higher risk (i) for Afro-descendants, indigenous people, and Hispanics, (ii) when acanthosis nigricans is present, (iii) when HDL is below 35 mg/dL, and (iv) when triglycerides exceed 250 mg/dL. In this context, the following indicators can be related to the predictive factors of T2DM and were mapped in the ERICA database to potentially compose the model in question: Socio-demographic data: age, race, and sex.\n\nHabits: physical activity.\n\nFamily history: T2DM.\n\nBiochemical tests: total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin.\n\nAnthropometry and blood pressure assessment: BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Socio-demographic data and habits were collected through questionnaires completed by the students in the sample [12]. The form included sections on various topics, such as eating habits, alcohol consumption, and clinical history. Additionally, participants were required to indicate the presence of specific health conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, asthma, hypercholesterolemia, besides their body perception [12]. Students who reported having diabetes were excluded from the sample considered in this study, as they had already reached the evaluated outcome of developing T2DM or could not develop the disease due to having T1DM. The family history was also collected through a questionnaire filled out by the parents of the adolescents, encompassing various characteristics such as socioeconomic data, weight, and height [12]. T2DM family history was considered the only relevant risk factor indicated in this questionnaire, as it has a direct impact on the possibility of an individual developing the disease [2,14,15]. The measurement of anthropometric parameters and blood pressure was performed by trained professionals following standardized procedures and using standardized stadiometers, precision scales, and anthropometric tape. For blood collection for the biochemical tests, participants were instructed to maintain a 12-hour overnight fast before the examination, which was performed in the morning. Blood samples were processed, with blood and serum separation within two hours after collection and maintained between 4\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C while transported to the study's sole laboratory, where they were stored at \u221280\u00b0C for future analyses [12]. Biochemical tests were conducted on the 40,732 students evaluated in ERICA who attended classes in the morning. Individuals who reported having diabetes were excluded, leaving only those who declared themselves not having the disease or who were unsure if they had it at the time of the ERICA assessment, totaling 35,738 adolescents. The selected model was designed based on the evolution of individuals' CVRF \u2013 BMI, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, SBP, and DBP \u2013 to explain the development of T2DM. The same CVRF are available for ERICA\u2019s individuals, which enabled the model to be applied to them. 2.4. Model validation Internal validation was conducted to identify errors related to data entry and model programming. Biostatistics experts peer reviewed the methods and the scripts, ensuring methodological rigor. Experts with knowledge in epidemiology and on ERICA Study confirmed the appropriateness of applying the model to its sample. In the absence of follow-up data on ERICA\u2019s sample clinical outcomes, it is not possible to assess whether individuals progressed to T2DM as predicted. 2.5. Limitations There are limitations to the application of the selected model to ERICA\u2019s sample. First, the composition of both samples is similar, but their baseline age differs, which can impact on their clinical evolution. In addition, while the selected model was based in a study that followed cardiovascular risk factors also observed on ERICA Study, the location in which they were both conducted where different, and they started over 30 years apart. As the development of T2M relates to a person's habits, such discrepancies limit the comparability of the samples. Certain potential confounding factors\u2014such as socioeconomic status, dietary habits, genetic predisposition, and access to healthcare\u2014were not incorporated into the model. While these factors are known to influence T2DM risk, they were not tracked or incorporated into the original model, so their exclusion was necessary to maintain data reliability and comparability with the reference study. This approach minimizes subjectivity and ensures that the projections are based solely on CVRF that have been consistently measured. Moreover, the model was developed to consider the full period of primary study, so it is limited to its duration and does not permit intermediate evaluations.\n\n5. Discussion The application of the logistic regression model to the ERICA sample provides valuable insights on the potential future impacts of worsening cardiovascular risk indicators on the population over the medium term. We estimate a prevalence of 15.12% for T2DM among individuals in the sample over a period of 20.5 years, reflecting the increasing prevalence of the disease in Brazil. This estimate exceeds the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) projections, aligning more closely with the upper limits forcasted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. While the IDF estimates that 10.2% of the population will have diabetes by 2030, potentially rising to 10.9% by 2045, the Brazilian Ministry of Health anticipates a trend of 9.1% for 2032, with a range from 2.8% to 15.4%. Notably, between 2019 and 2023, the percentage of diabetes among adults in Brazil rose from 7.4% to 10.2%, reflecting an annual increase of approximately 0.5 percentage points [4]. In comparison, the analytical sample from the Bogalusa model included 1,718 individuals, of whom 133 developed diabetes during the follow-up period, resulting in a prevalence of 7.7% - approximately half of the rate found in the ERICA sample. This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in baseline characteristics between the two populations, particularly their average ages at study enrollment. Participants in the ERICA study were aged 12\u201317 years (mean age of 14.6 years), whereas those in the Bogalusa study had an average age of around 8 years. The variation may also reflect differences in developmental experiences, dietary habits, cultural practices, and other environmental factors influencing T2DM trajectories across these cohorts, especially since they are from different countries and not contemporary. Despite these differences, the prevalence reported in the ERICA sample is not far from the 8.9% prevalence of diabetes in Brazil recorded in 2016 [18]. Study estimates that the prevalence of pre-diabetes among ERICA students exceeded 20% at the moment data was collected, indicating a concerning trend towards an increased risk of developing T2DM [19]. Such results align to the present article's conclusion that about 15% of the sample may develop T2DM 20 years afterwards. In addition, over 3.3% of the students had already developed T2DM, underscoring the association at a very young age between unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, and other modifiable risk factors over the long term, along with the influence of aging [19]. Similar discrepancies in time and geography are observed in the study conducted by the International Consortium of Child Cardiovascular Risk Cohorts (i3C) [20]. In addition to the Bogalusa study, the i3C analysis included five other cohorts\u2014four from the U.S. and one from Finland\u2014whose baseline measures were collected from the 1970s to the 1990s. Among a total of 6,738 participants, 6.5% developed T2DM, a figure lower than the 15.1% prevalence found in this study but comparable to the 7.7% reported in the Bogalusa study. These variations may be attributed to changes in dietary habits and increased sedentary behavior over time, given that the ERICA survey was conducted more recently. The deterministic sensitivity analysis revealed varying influences of the assessed parameters on the results. Notably, the coefficient for BMI\u2014the most significant parameter\u2014exhibited minimal impact on the overall findings. Conversely, an increase in HDL cholesterol resulted in a decrease in the estimated number of individuals developing T2DM. Although triglycerides had a lower overall weight compared to other parameters, they demonstrated substantial variability, likely due to diverse baseline values within the assessed population. Additionally, diastolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol were found to significantly impact the outcomes. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates the prevalence estimation could range from 1.1% to 28%, depending on the weight applied to cardiovascular risk factors included in the model. However, as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are intertwined, and risk factors are common to both [1,2,4], it is unlikely for all CVRF to have the lower limit weight on the development of T2DM. Having some sort of interval is still useful given the limitations of the analysis, the natural heterogeneity of the population, and the multifactorial influences on the development of the disease, as they inform decision-makers on the possible different scenarios. Considering the economic implications of T2DM, estimated costs indicate that both direct and indirect costs are already considerable. In 2014, costs reached USD 15 billion, corresponding to a prevalence rate of 6.2%. If the estimated prevalence of 15.1% is confirmed, the country could potentially see 30.6 million individuals with T2DM, as projected by the 2022 Demographic Census, resulting in a significant increase in healthcare costs [21]. While these results highlight an upward trend in T2DM prevalence, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations. First, the trajectory was modeled based on a cohort from another country, which may not accurately represent the same cardiovascular risk factors for the Brazilian population. Differences in genetic, socioeconomic, dietary patterns, and levels of physical activity could lead to varying results between cohorts, especially given the relationship between habits and the development of T2DM. Furthermore, the model was developed with data from Bogalusa's cohort, which was monitored for an average of 20.5 years. As a consequence, it is challenging to extrapolate these findings to larger time-frames. Given that age is a known risk factor for T2DM and considering the mean age of ERICA participants at baseline, the projections may underestimate the disease incidence within this sample. Additionally, we were unable to ascertain whether participants in the Bogalusa study underwent any interventions\u2014such as medication use or dietary changes\u2014in cases of increased cardiovascular risk. It is also not possible to understand if there have been any interventions in Brazil during the growth of ERICA\u2019s individuals that could have changed their probability of developing T2DM. Also, the model exclusively included clinical variables, while there is extensive literature on how social determinants of health influence the progression of T2DM, such as income, education, housing, access to food and healthcare. Differences in the Bogalusa and ERICA samples regarding these determinants are not quantifiable but might also limit the interpretation of results. Future studies could incorporated socio-economic factors in addition to the clinical ones, to enable a better understanding of the Brazilian reality [22]. Finally, the baseline risk applied to the ERICA sample was derived from the Vigitel telephone survey conducted annually by the Ministry of Health. While this sample may not perfectly represent the broader Brazilian population due to factors such as self-reported data and geographic restrictions, it offers valuable insights. The findings of this study indicate a rising prevalence of T2DM in Brazil, driven by identified risk factors present during adolescence. This underscores the urgent need for public health interventions from childhood to prevent the progression of diabetes. Initiatives to ensure access to healthy foods, implement policies to reduce the consumption of ultra-processed foods and alcohol, promote physical activity at all ages, and combat smoking are essential actions that should be prioritized to enhance public health and mitigate the advancement of this disease in the country. By leveraging data from the ERICA study and employing logistic regression models, we estimated the potential risk of each individual for developing T2DM, providing valuable insights into the landscape of risk factors and diabetes prevalence. These strategies should focus on targeted interventions for at-risk groups, aiming to mitigate the development of T2DM and its associated complications. Ultimately, the findings will not only enhance our understanding of diabetes epidemiology among young people but also serve as a foundational tool for the development of informed public policies, enabling health authorities to implement preventive measures and allocate resources more effectively to improve the quality of life for this population.\n\n6. Conclusion This study successfully applied a predictive model developed in the U.S. to estimate the future prevalence of T2DM in Brazilian adolescents from the ERICA sample. The analysis estimated that approximately 15.12% of individuals in the sample could develop T2DM over a 20.5-year period, a figure that, while consistent with the rising trends of the disease in Brazil, is subject to significant variation depending on CVRF. The deterministic analysis reveals that higher HDL cholesterol levels are associated with a lower probability of developing T2DM, while increases in diastolic blood pressure and triglycerides, along with elevated LDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, are linked to a higher likelihood of the disease. While the results provide valuable insights for formulating public health policies aimed at preventing and controlling T2DM in Brazil, it is essential to recognize the inherent limitations of using a foreign model in a population with different socioeconomic and cultural characteristics. Future studies should aim to develop or adjust predictive models based on national cohorts, which would allow for greater precision and suitability for the Brazilian context. Interventions focused on factors such as blood pressure control and the reduction of triglyceride levels may be effective strategies for mitigating the risk of developing T2DM. Furthermore, public health policies that promote lifestyle changes from adolescence\u2014such as encouraging healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity\u2014could play a crucial role in reducing the future burden of the disease.",

        "Content": "Este art\u00edculo estar\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nIn the aftermath of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to bomb three of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, numerous Democrats claimed the president\u2019s actions were unconstitutional and a violation of the War Powers Resolution.\n\nIt is a contentious and hotly debated issue not only in Congress but also in academia. Constitutional experts told us those who are claiming the president\u2019s decision was unconstitutional may be correct according to an originalist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. But Congresses over the last several decades have allowed presidents some latitude to engage militarily without prior consent from lawmakers.\n\n\u201cA lot of people over the next few days are going to argue with confidence that President Trump violated, or didn\u2019t violate, the Constitution when he bombed Iran over the weekend without congressional authorization,\u201d Jack Landman Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School and nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a June 23 op-ed headlined, \u201cWas the Iran Strike Constitutional?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might think that the Constitution would provide a clear answer to such a momentous question. But it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Goldsmith wrote.\n\nAlthough the military hostilities involving Iran, Israel and the U.S. have ended, numerous Democrats have continued to press the issue, and have proposed legislation to try to rein in the president\u2019s military reach.\n\nCompeting Claims\n\nAllegations that the president\u2019s decision was unconstitutional began almost immediately after Trump made an announcement via Truth Social on June 21 that the U.S. had bombed the Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nMaxar satellite imagery provides a close-up view of the Isfahan nuclear facility in Iran showing severe damage after the airstrikes. Satellite image (c) 2025 Maxar Technologies via Getty Images.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated in a press release on June 21 \u2014 after Trump had announced the bombings \u2014 that \u201cthe Constitution makes clear that the power to authorize war lies with Congress.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat member of the House Intelligence Committee, also stated in a press release the same day that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s decision to launch direct military action against Iran without Congressional approval is a clear violation of the Constitution, which grants the power to declare war explicitly to Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was not constitutional, it was not lawful in the absence of a declaration by Congress,\u201d Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on June 22. \u201cAnd so the administration should have come to Congress. We will have a vote on a war powers resolution. But there\u2019s a reason to bring this to Congress. And it is, you want the Congress bought in, you want the American people bought in on an action this substantial that could lead to a major outbreak of war.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went one step further, stating on X that Trump\u2019s actions were \u201ca grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers\u201d and are \u201cabsolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.\u201d\n\nA day after Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel on June 23, Ocasio-Cortez continued to post about Trump \u201cillegally bombing Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of this [related to the ceasefire] changes my deep belief that the Constitution gives the Congress \u2013 not the President \u2013 the power to decide whether or not we send Americans into the hell of war,\u201d Democratic Rep. Chris Deluzio wrote on X on June 24.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jerry Nadler also posted a statement saying that he \u201cremain[s] resolute that, regardless of the outcome, the Trump Administration\u2019s military action against Iran was unconstitutional, as only Congress has the power to authorize the use of military force.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Democrats who raised the constitutional issue. In a response to Trump\u2019s post about the airstrikes, Republican Rep. Thomas Massie said simply, \u201cThis is not Constitutional.\u201d\n\nLast week, Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna teamed up on a resolution calling on Trump to \u201cterminate the use of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or military, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force against Iran.\u201d\n\nAfter the announced ceasefire, Massie said he told House Speaker Mike Johnson that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t push\u201d the resolution \u201cif the ceasefire holds.\u201d Khanna added, in an MSNBC interview, \u201cIf there\u2019s a ceasefire, that\u2019s great. And let\u2019s see if it holds. If it doesn\u2019t hold, then we\u2019re ready to have a vote on the War Power resolution.\u201d\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on June 22, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham pushed back on members of Congress alleging that Trump violated the Constitution by acting without congressional approval.\n\nGraham said Trump acted \u201cwithin his Article II authority. Congress can declare war or cut off funding. We can\u2019t be the commander in chief. You can\u2019t have 535 commander in chiefs. If you don\u2019t like what the president does, in terms of war, you can cut off the funding. But declaring war is left to the Congress. We\u2019ve declared war five times in the history of America. All of these other military operations were lawful. He had all the authority he needs under the Constitution. They are wrong.\u201d\n\nJohnson also defended the president in a post on X. \u201cThe President made the right call, and did what he needed to do. Leaders in Congress were aware of the urgency of this situation and the Commander-in-Chief evaluated that the imminent danger outweighed the time it would take for Congress to act. The world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism, which chants \u2018Death to America,\u2019 simply could not be allowed the opportunity to obtain and use nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cThe President fully respects the Article I power of Congress, and tonight\u2019s necessary, limited, and targeted strike follows the history and tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties,\u201d Johnson wrote.\n\nWhat the Constitution Says\n\nArticle I, Section 8 of the Constitution states that Congress holds the power \u201cTo declare War.\u201d Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution establishes the president as the commander in chief of the armed forces. So, at what point and under what circumstances would the president need congressional approval before launching military activity?\n\n\u201cI think this is a tough question because practice has strayed so far from the text and original understanding of the Constitution,\u201d Kermit Roosevelt, a professor and constitutional expert at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told us via email. \u201cThe Constitution says that Congress has the power to declare war, and the records of the Constitutional Convention are pretty clear that the drafters did not want to give one person the power to take the United States into war. (Presidents are supposed to be able to respond to attacks by using the military, but that\u2019s not relevant to this situation because obviously we were not attacked.) So the president was not supposed to be able to start a war without Congressional authorization. That\u2019s pretty clear. (An authorization for the use of military force is effectively the same thing as a declaration of war, so the fact that Congress has used authorizations rather than declarations after WWII does not matter.) However, presidents have done things that count as acts of war under international law without congressional authorization, like the Libya bombings [under then-President Barack Obama], and no one has stopped them, so our practice has departed from the text and original understanding.\u201d\n\nPeter Shane, a leading scholar in U.S. constitutional law and adjunct professor at New York University School of Law, told us via email that it is \u201cdifficult to give a definitive answer on constitutionality because there is so much disagreement about how the Constitution should be interpreted with regard to the unilateral presidential deployment of military force. For originalists, the answer would seem a straightforward, \u2018No.\u2019 Under the most persuasive reading of the Founding era, the Constitution does not authorize Presidents to deploy military force abroad without advance congressional authorization. As to Iran, there was none.\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d Shane told us, \u201cpresidents of both parties have operated for decades under a Justice Department framework that \u2018reflects not only the express assignment of powers and responsibilities to the President and Congress in the Constitution, but also . . . the \u2018historical gloss\u2019 placed on the Constitution by two centuries of practice.\u2019 It has thus long been the position of the DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel that history has ratified unilateral presidential deployments of military force as long as (1) the deployment serves \u2018sufficiently important national interests,\u2019 as judged by the President, and (2) the deployment does not portend a \u2018prolonged and substantial military engagement, typically involving exposure of U.S. military personnel to significant risk over a substantial period.\u2019 Trump\u2019s letter to Congress reporting on the bombing relies on this framework.\u201d\n\nWar Powers Resolution\n\nSeeking to claw back some of its power, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973 on a bipartisan basis, and over the veto of then-President Richard Nixon. As the Congressional Research Service explains, the War Powers Resolution requires presidents within 48 hours \u201cto report to Congress any introduction of U.S. forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities.\u201d\n\nOnce reported, the resolution \u201crequires that the use of forces must be terminated within 60 to 90 days unless Congress authorizes such use or extends the time period.\u201d Section 3 of the resolution \u201crequires that the \u2018President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing\u2019 U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe War Powers Act is often interpreted as saying that the President can do what he wants for 48 hours before notifying Congress, or for 60 days even if Congress doesn\u2019t approve, so that it means the President can actually start a war and then put Congress in the position of authorizing it or not,\u201d Roosevelt said. \u201cThat\u2019s not consistent with the Constitution and it\u2019s not consistent with the purpose and policy section of the WPA, which says that the intent is to make sure that the President\u2019s power to engage in military action is exercised \u2018only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo I think that the 48 hour and 60 day windows are supposed to be relevant to presidential responses to attacks, and the President is not supposed to be able to initiate wars at all. I think that if the WPA does mean that the President can start a war, it\u2019s an unconstitutional delegation of the power to declare war,\u201d Roosevelt said. (Emphasis is his.)\n\n\u201cThe WPA does clearly require that the president \u2018in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities\u2019 so it seems pretty clear that Trump violated that, at least,\u201d Roosevelt said.\n\nWhether Trump\u2019s decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites was an act of war is also a matter of debate.\n\nAn opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel in April 2011 \u2014 after Obama began military strikes against Libya without seeking congressional approval \u2014 argued that the scope and duration of the military strikes determine whether a military action constitutes a war.\n\n\u201cIn our view, determining whether a particular planned engagement constitutes a \u2018war\u2019 for constitutional purposes instead requires a fact-specific assessment of the \u2018anticipated nature, scope, and duration\u2019 of the planned military operations,\u201d the opinion states, citing a prior OLC opinion from 1994. \u201cThis standard generally will be satisfied only by prolonged and substantial military engagements, typically involving exposure of U.S. military personnel to significant risk over a substantial period.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Jun 22, Vice President JD Vance insisted, \u201cWe\u2019re not at war with Iran, we\u2019re at war with Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no interest in a protracted conflict. We have no interest in boots on the ground,\u201d Vance said, adding that the bombings were \u201ca very precise, a very surgical strike tailored to an American national interest.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Trump appealed for immediate peace in the same post in which he made the bombing announcement. Two days later, Trump announced the ceasefire, saying it put an end to what Trump said should be called \u201cTHE 12 DAY WAR.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven past practice and the language of the WPR, I don\u2019t think that the single strike by itself violated either the Constitution or the WPR,\u201d Stephen Griffin, professor of constitutional law at Tulane Law School, told us via email. \u201cAt the same time, it would have been better under the Constitution for President Trump to obtain congressional authorization in advance.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, said Griffin, author of \u201cLong Wars and the Constitution,\u201d if hostilities between Iran and the U.S. extend beyond the WPR\u2019s 60-day limit, \u201cPresident Trump may well be in violation of the WPR, just as Republicans argued when the same circumstances occurred in the Clinton and Obama presidencies.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

        "Summary": "This study, conducted by Tulane University researchers, highlights uneven land sinking in New Orleans, increasing flood risks. Tulane's involvement is presented positively, showcasing the university's contribution to crucial research addressing a significant local issue.  Tulane is mentioned throughout the article as the source of the research.",
        "Content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nParts of New Orleans and its surrounding wetlands are gradually sinking, and while most of the city remains stable, a new study from Tulane University researchers suggests that sections of the region's $15 billion post-Katrina flood protection system may need regular upgrades to outpace long-term land subsidence.\n\nThe study, published in Science Advances, used satellite radar data to track subtle shifts in ground elevation across Greater New Orleans between 2002 and 2020. The study found that some neighborhoods, wetlands and even sections of floodwalls are sinking by more than an inch per year\u2014with some areas experiencing up to 47 millimeters (nearly 2 inches) of elevation loss annually.\n\n\"In a city like New Orleans, where much of the land is already near sea level, even minor drops in elevation can increase flood risk,\" said Simone Fiaschi, lead author of the study and a former researcher with Tulane's Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, now employed at TRE-Altamira.\n\nThe findings underscore how both natural and human-driven forces are reshaping the city's landscape. Causes of the sinking\u2014known as subsidence\u2014include natural soil compaction, groundwater pumping, industrial development and the legacy of wetland drainage for urban growth.\n\nThe study used a remote sensing technique called InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), which detects millimeter-scale changes in land surface elevation by comparing satellite radar images taken over time. This allowed the researchers to build the most detailed map yet of vertical land motion in New Orleans\u2014including areas like wetlands that had previously lacked reliable data.\n\nAmong the most troubling findings: some of the concrete floodwalls and levees built to protect the city after Katrina are themselves sinking. In a few cases, parts of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) are losing elevation faster than sea levels are rising, reducing their capacity to block storm surges.\n\n\"These results are a wake-up call,\" said co-author Prof. Mead Allison, also of Tulane. \"We need ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure that our flood defenses don't lose their level of protection beneath us.\"\n\nThe study also found pockets of sinking around industrial sites, the airport and newer residential developments\u2014areas where soil compression and groundwater withdrawal are likely contributors. In contrast, some areas such as parts of Michoud showed modest land uplift, likely due to the halt of industrial groundwater pumping and recovery of the water table.\n\nWetlands east of the city, long known for their ecological importance, are also sinking rapidly in places. In some spots, the loss of elevation could transform marshes into open water within a decade if trends continue. This has implications not just for wildlife but also for storm protection, as wetlands help buffer storm surges.\n\nNew Orleans, much of which lies below sea level, relies on an elaborate system of levees, pumps and drainage canals to keep water out. As sea levels rise and the ground sinks, the margin for error narrows.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

This is especially true for critical areas like the floodwalls, where on-site verification was not possible during this project.\"\n\nThe study highlights the potential of satellite monitoring to guide infrastructure maintenance and urban planning, not just in New Orleans but in coastal cities worldwide facing similar challenges.\n\nMore information: Simone Fiaschi, Vertical land motion in Greater New Orleans: insights into underlying drivers and impact to flood protection infrastructure, Science Advances (2025).

        "Content": "New Orleans \u2014 As the Atlantic hurricane season has gotten underway, a new study published Friday by researchers at Tulane University reveals hotspots in New Orleans' concrete flood walls which had been strengthened in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe study found that the city's concrete flood walls are sinking faster than sea levels are rising, reducing capacity to block storm surges in some neighborhoods.\n\n\"There is certainly a potential in the future, if these rates continue, to degrade our level of protection of the flood protection system,\" Tulane professor Mead Allison, a co-author on the study, told CBS News.\n\nThis summer marks 20 years since Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast, leaving more than 1,300 people dead and displacing more than a million people across the region.\n\nFollowing the destructive storm, $15 billion was spent to reinforce a levy system designed to keep water out. New Orleans, much of which lies below sea level, relies on this elaborate system of levees, pumps and drainage canals.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science Advances, used satellite radar data to track shifts in ground elevation across the Greater New Orleans area between 2002 and 2020. It found that while most of the city remains stable, some neighborhoods, wetlands, and even sections of the region's post-Katrina flood protection system are sinking by more than an inch per year \u2014 with some areas experiencing up to 47 millimeters, or nearly 2 inches, of elevation loss annually.\n\n\"In a city like New Orleans, where much of the land is already near sea level, even minor drops in elevation can increase flood risk,\" said Simone Fiaschi \u2014 lead author of the study and a former researcher with Tulane's Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, now employed at TRE-Altamira \u2014 in a statement.\n\n\"These results are a wake-up call,\" Allison said. \"We need ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure that our flood defenses don't lose their level of protection beneath us.\"\n\nIf trends continue, and infrastructure is left unchecked, the study found wetlands east of the city could transform marshes into open water within the next 10 years if trends continue \u2014 effectively eliminating critical storm surge buffers to the Louisiana coast.\n\nThe study also identified some potential causes of the sinking hotspots. It found pockets of land are sinking around industrial sites, the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, and newer residential developments \u2014 areas where soil compression and groundwater withdrawal are likely contributors.\n\nResearchers said the findings also underscore a few potential solutions to better protect New Orleans and other coastal communities across the globe, including frequent upgrades to the flood protection system and satellite monitoring.\n\nSome residents living in the Michoud neighborhood on the city's east side \u2014 one of the areas identified in the study as sinking more rapidly than others \u2014 are concerned that maintenance won't be prioritized. Michoud resident Synthia Viltus pointed out that potholes and other smaller infrastructure issues in her neighborhood have remained unresolved for months.\n\n\"I have zero faith in state federal leaders to keep the levies updated,\" Viltus said.\n\nThe study did find a positive \u2014 some areas where industrial activities had been halted had actually caused the land to lift back up.\n\nThe study's authors also hope their work will help guide other coastal cities who may be facing similar challenges to New Orleans.\n\n\"This research shows that land movement isn't uniform, and understanding these patterns is crucial for protecting lives and property in a city where inches truly matter,\" Fiaschi said in the statement. \"However, it's crucial to remember that our results still require careful ground-truthing. This is especially true for critical areas like the floodwalls, where on-site verification was not possible during this project.\"\n\nRicky Boyett, spokesperson for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in New Orleans, said the urgent levee systems in the city were designed and built to withstand projected levels of land sinking until 2057.\n\n\"Every levee system in South Louisiana is subject to settlement, subsidence and sea level rise,\" Boyett said in a statement. \"As a result, periodic levee lifts are required to maintain the established level of risk reduction, whether that be the New Orleans Hurricane system, Mississippi River levees or other systems in the region.\"\n\nThe USACE says it's already planning a major upgrade overhaul to the infrastructure so it can withstand a half-century of time passing \u2014 and the expected changes in elevation that may unfold throughout those years \u2014 until 2073.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tulane researchers say they were commissioned to conduct this study by the state, which manages the levees. They say this study was only the first phase of a two-part series. Phase two will use the same technology to examine wetland sinkage along the southernmost areas of Louisiana's coast \u2014 the first line of defense to protect against a hurricane's surge.",

        "Content": "Protests against Medicaid cuts continued on June 25, which led to the arrests of 60 activists at the Senate.\n\nTruthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.\n\nSenate Republicans are under mounting pressure from doctors and medical associations to reject massive cuts to health care and food assistance as they rush to complete a draft of the budget reconciliation bill designed to implement President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. Despite an ongoing debate over deep cuts to Medicaid \u2014 cuts experts say would devastate already underfunded health systems especially in rural areas \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) pushed this week to put the so-called \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d on the president\u2019s desk by July 4.\n\nThe Senate GOP is looking to make $1 trillion in cuts to federal health care programs over the next decade, including Medicaid, which provides health insurance to lower-income families and people with disabilities. Deep cuts to food assistance for millions of people are also on the table as lawmakers look for ways to cut spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by pushing costs onto states.\n\n\u201cIf Medicaid is cut, my patients will die. I realize I am being dramatic. It is a dramatic situation,\u201d said Helen Pope, a physician in Louisiana and assistant professor of medicine at Tulane University, in a statement to Senate staffers. \u201c[T]hey are humans who are doing their best. Please don\u2019t allow them to suffer more.\u201d\n\nRepublicans hit a snag on Thursday after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that a proposal to change how states can tax Medicaid providers \u2014 a bid to pass on more costs to states \u2014 does not adhere to the rules for fast-tracking and passing legislation with a simple majority. Democrats hailed the decision as a win, but Republicans are still determined to make the desired cuts.\n\nExperts say the cuts would drive up health care costs for everyone as providers are forced to raise prices and more people delay needed care until their conditions become catastrophic. Combined with the expiration of tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace insurance plans, which are not extended in the bill, the cuts would cause an estimated 16 million people to lose health coverage and lead to tens of thousands of preventable deaths each year.\n\nSharon Parrot, president of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said the GOP\u2019s failure to include the tax credit for people who rely on ACA Marketplace plans for insurance coverage is a clear indicator of Republican priorities. Lawmakers proposed the deep cuts to safety net programs in order to extend tax cuts for the wealthy passed during Trump\u2019s first term while also increasing spending on the military and immigration policing.\n\n\u201cIn the context of a bill that extends nearly all tax cuts from the 2017 bill, the one tax cut they have decided not to extend is the one that helps lower- and middle-income people afford health coverage,\u201d Parrot said in a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), the ranking member of the Senate Health, Labor, Education and Pensions (HELP) Committee, collected statements on the impacts of the budget bill from Pope and dozens of other doctors and health care providers across the country over the past month. Sanders released the statements on Wednesday along with a report detailing a massive increase in the number of people losing health insurance under the bill across all 50 states. In several states, the uninsured rates would nearly double or more over the next 10 years, including in Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington, according to the analysis of Kaiser Family Foundation data.\n\n\u201cPlainly said, children will die as a result of these cuts,\u201d said Farhan Malik, a pediatric special care specialist in Florida. \u201cDoctors will leave because of salary cuts, critical ancillary services will be reduced, more medical students will avoid going into pediatric residencies.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Sanders and every Democrat on the Senate HELP committee sent a letter to committee chairman Sen. Bill Cassidy requesting a hearing on the bill with patients and health care providers. Cassidy, a Republican and physician from Louisiana, who has questioned Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s anti-vaccine agenda in the past, declined to hold a hearing as Republicans debate cuts that data shows would harm people in their own districts. A spokesman for Senator Cassidy\u2019s office referred questions to the majority staff on the HELP Committee, which did respond to a request for comment.\n\nCassidy\u2019s home state of Louisiana would see the percentage of residents without health insurance nearly double to 12.4 percent by 2034 under the bill, a 91 percent increase over the 2023 uninsured rate. In a statement to the HELP Committee, the Louisiana Rural Health Association said the state\u2019s rural hospitals and health providers are already operating on \u201crazor-thin margins\u201d and struggling to keep their doors open while serving some of the nation\u2019s most medically vulnerable communities.\n\n\u201cIn Louisiana, 38 percent of hospitals operate on negative margins, and 27 percent are currently vulnerable to closure,\u201d the group said in a statement to the HELP Committee. \u201cMedicaid cuts would worsen these losses, putting more hospitals at risk of shutting down entirely.\u201d\n\nThe list of medical associations, disability rights organizations, and public health groups lining up against the bill is growing by the day. On Monday, the health care consumer group Families USA released a report estimating that 380 independent rural hospitals would be at risk of closure if Trump signed the reconciliation bill into law. Nearly half of all children and one in five adults living in rural areas rely on Medicaid, according to the National Rural Health Association. On Wednesday, 60 protesters were arrested for demonstrating against the cuts at the Senate rotunda in an act of civil disobedience, including disability activists in wheelchairs.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t stop protesting against this terrible bill, because it means our lives,\u201d said Brandon Ezekiel, an activist with the disability rights group ADAPT, in a statement. \u201cOur tax dollars pay for healthcare for members of Congress, many of whom are very wealthy, even millionaires, and then they have the nerve to cut our tax dollars from paying for health care for us.\u201d\n\nIn a detailed letter to Senate leaders this week, the American Medical Association (AMA) warned that cuts to Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program risk \u201cworsening access\u201d to health care that many people already struggle to afford \u2014 and physicians must provide, whether or not patients pay the bills.\n\n\u201cPatients across the country are already struggling to access care,\u201d said AMA President Bobby Mukkamala in a statement. \u201cPhysician burnout, early retirements and \u2014 with the cost of running a practice constantly rising \u2014 the challenge of keeping a practice financially afloat are contributing to a physician shortage expected to reach 86,000 by 2036.\u201d\n\nThe pushback from the medical community appears to be having an impact. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), and other Republicans from states that rely heavily on Medicaid are warning their colleagues about the potential political fallout of pushing health care costs back onto states that already struggle to balance budgets. Politico reported on Wednesday that GOP leaders are offering their colleagues concerned about the cuts \u2014 whom they refer to as \u201cMedicaid moderates\u201d \u2014 a $15 billion \u201cstabilization fund\u201d for rural hospitals.\n\nHowever, the fund is no substitute for robust Medicaid funding that many providers rely on, and would not prevent the budget bill from blowing huge holes in the safety net, according to Traci Gleason, communications director at the Missouri Budget Project.\n\n\u201cThese cuts will pull the rug out from under Missouri families trying to make ends meet,\u201d Gleason told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nIn order to meet the onerous work requirements Republicans are seeking to impose on Medicaid patients \u2014 requirements designed to reduce enrollment and further cut costs \u2014 Gleason said Missourians would have to file \u201cpiles of paperwork\u201d with a state bureaucracy that is already overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cYou simply cannot take billions of dollars out of Medicaid without causing massive coverage losses and taking away health care from people who are working and who are exempt\u201d from work requirements, Gleason said, adding that 43 percent of rural clinics in the state are at risk of closing due to funding shortfalls. \u201cOur system is already strained and will not be able to keep up, which means that every single person who has or will eventually need health coverage will be affected.\u201d\n\nPolls show GOP proposals to slash health care spending are deeply unpopular among voters, which may explain why Trump and his allies are attempting to pass the bill as quickly as possible. Sanders and Democrats have slammed Republicans for failing to hold hearings on the reconciliation package, and the Congressional Budget Office has not completed its standard analysis of the bill\u2019s impacts.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s no secret that lower- and middle-income Americans are poised to lose the most under the GOP\u2019s proposals, which would drain money from families already struggling due to the affordability crisis in order to pay for tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy. Analysis by the Yale Budget Lab found that the House version of the bill would reduce average incomes for the bottom 80 percent of earners when the impacts of Trump\u2019s tariffs are factored in. The bottom ten percent of earners would see their incomes drop by 6.5 percent, while the top 10 percent would see a 1.5 percent increase.\n\nWhether Senate Republicans can find enough votes to pass the budget package ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline remains to be seen. While some Republicans are wary of setting off a health care funding crisis at home, others point out that the bill would still increase federal deficit, despite the massive safety net cuts, by shifting federal funding toward Trump\u2019s priorities, including billions of additional dollars for immigration enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, doctors and experts are making their position known, loud and clear.\n\n\u201cThese harmful proposals will impact access to all patients who are served by our nation\u2019s hospitals and health systems,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, in a statement to the HELP Committee. \u201cThese cuts will strain emergency departments as they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d\n\nKeep the press free.

        "Summary": "This article discusses the effects of caffeine on cellular aging and longevity.  A 2025 study led by researchers at Tulane University is mentioned, which linked morning coffee consumption to lower mortality rates compared to espresso later in the day.  The article highlights this study as contributing to the body of evidence suggesting positive health effects associated with coffee consumption. Tulane's association with this research positively impacts its reputation.",
        "Content": "Could coffee be the liquid key to longevity?\n\nA new study reports that the world\u2019s most widely used stimulant can extend lifespan and affect how cells respond to genetic damage \u2014 though there\u2019s a potential complication.\n\nA team of researchers at Queen Mary University of London confirms that caffeine interacts with the systems that influence aging, DNA response and cellular stress.\n\n4 Researchers confirmed that caffeine interacts with the systems that influence aging, DNA response and cellular stress. WesLens/peopleimages.com \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nThe team studied fission yeast, a single-celled organism that is analogous to human cells and uses similar pathways to manage energy, DNA repair and stress.\n\nResearchers measured the response of fission yeast to different forms of cellular stress, including DNA damage, toxic exposure and nutrient deprivation.\n\nThen they added caffeine to gauge how cells would respond.\n\nThey found that while caffeine extended the lifespan of yeast, it also affected how cells responded to stress, particularly when the molecular systems that regulate stress were already activated.\n\nThe findings were published this week in the journal Microbial Cell.\n\n4 This is an illustration of a damaged DNA strand. Caffeine has been shown to affect DNA repair. Mirsad \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nThe research team previously established that caffeine supports the longevity of cells by activating TOR (target of rapamycin), a biological switch that determines when cells should grow based on the availability of food and energy.\n\nAccording to the team, the TOR switch has been actively controlling energy and stress responses in living things for over 500 million years.\n\nIn this latest study, the team learned that caffeine doesn\u2019t directly activate TOR, but rather influences it by activating AMPK, a cellular fuel reserve in yeast and humans.\n\n\u201cWhen your cells are low on energy, AMPK kicks in to help them cope,\u201d said study senior author Charalampos (Babis) Rallis. \u201cAnd our results show that caffeine helps flip that switch.\u201d\n\nThe yeast model demonstrated that caffeine\u2019s influence on flipping that switch directly impacts how cells grow, repair their DNA and respond to stress \u2014 all of which relate to aging.\n\nQuite surprisingly, the team found that rather than protecting damaged DNA, caffeine amplified the damage.\n\n4 Caffeine activates AMPK, a cellular fuel reserve in yeast and humans. David Crockett \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nTypically, when a cell detects DNA damage, it stops dividing to repair it. However, researchers found that caffeine overrides this stop, allowing unhealed cells to continue dividing and making them more vulnerable to future damage.\n\nThe team assured that this doesn\u2019t make your morning cup inherently dangerous. Caffeine\u2019s ability to alter how cells respond to problems can be positive or negative, depending on the situation.\n\nThe team noted that the benefits of caffeine depend on the presence of specific proteins and pathways. The fact that caffeine\u2019s effects are neither universal nor automatic may help explain why previous studies exploring the link between caffeine and improved health have been inconsistent.\n\n\u201cThese findings help explain why caffeine might be beneficial for health and longevity,\u201d said John-Patrick Alao, the postdoctoral research scientist leading this study. \u201cAnd they open up exciting possibilities for future research into how we might trigger these effects more directly \u2014 with diet, lifestyle or new medicines.\u201d\n\nThe team acknowledged that because the study relied only on fission yeast, the findings may not directly translate to human cells.\n\n4 Several studies have reported various benefits of a daily java habit. Antonioguillem \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nCoffee has long been lauded for its health benefits.\n\nRich in antioxidants, it may enhance brain function. It\u2019s also been shown to increase alertness, aid in weight management, boost mood and potentially lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\n\nA 2018 study of nearly half a million British adults found that coffee drinkers had a slightly lower risk of death over 10 years than abstainers.\n\nOther research, encompassing more than 170,000 adults in the UK, proposed that those who drink between two and four daily cups of coffee, regardless of whether they have added sugar, live longer than those who don\u2019t drink coffee.\n\nA 2025 study led by researchers at Tulane University tied a morning brew to lower mortality rates than espresso later in the day.\n\nAnd three to five cups a day at midlife was associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease later in life, research determined.\n\nIn addition to Alzheimer\u2019s, some studies found that java junkies have up to a 60% lower risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nThe more coffee they drank, the lower the risk.",

        "Content": "Rick Hurst, el actor que le puso la piel al torpe y bondadoso Cletus Hogg en la famosa serie estadounidense de fines de los 70 Los Dukes de Hazzard, muri\u00f3 ayer en la ciudad de Los \u00c1ngeles a los 79 a\u00f1os.\n\nLa noticia fue confirmada por Candace Kaniecki, la primera esposa del actor. En di\u00e1logo con el portal de noticias TMZ, la mujer explic\u00f3 que el artista muri\u00f3 de forma inesperada. Todav\u00eda no trascendi\u00f3 la causa de su muerte.\n\nHurst gozaba de buena salud y ten\u00eda varios compromisos en agenda. Entre ellos, una aparici\u00f3n en el Cooter\u2019s Place de Pigeon Forge, en Tennessee, uno de los tres museos en los Estados Unidos dedicados a Los Dukes de Hazzard. El evento estaba programado para el pr\u00f3ximo 3 de julio y all\u00ed Hurst se iba a encontrar con los fan\u00e1ticos del show.

Claro que era un comediante profesional, pero sobre todo ten\u00eda un coraz\u00f3n tan grande como Texas. Era un buen actor, un comediante espl\u00e9ndido y un colega maravillosamente comprensivo\u201d, agreg\u00f3.\n\nJones record\u00f3 la primera vez que vio a Hurst en escena, en la pel\u00edcula de Burt Reynolds WW and the Dixie Dancekings, y explic\u00f3 que en ese instante se dio cuenta del talento de su amigo. \u201cPens\u00e9: \u2018se rob\u00f3 el show\u2019, as\u00ed que cuando apareci\u00f3 en el condado de Hazzard durante la \u00e9poca en que Sonny Shroyer estaba haciendo la serie Enos, todo encaj\u00f3.

        "Summary": "This article analyzes evidence on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. The article mentions Tulane University's involvement in the \"Safe in Pregnancy\" living systematic review, highlighting the university's contributions to a large collaborative research project. However, the mention is in the context of a citation and not a direct endorsement of the institution.  The reference to Tulane is minor.",
        "Content": "Decision-making about drugs in pregnancy can be very difficult. Our illogical aversion to clinical trials in pregnancy means people making particularly complex decisions usually have little specific information about efficacy for them when a drug first becomes available. Plus, efficacy trials aren\u2019t big enough to assess the uncommon and rare pregnancy outcomes we want to be reassured about: For that we have to wait until the drugs are in wide use. At that point, we\u2019re swamped with a complicated research and surveillance landscape. All this makes vaccination in pregnancy an easy target for misinformation campaigns. And that\u2019s happening now in the US.\n\nIn an interview, the FDA Commissioner dismissed a large body of evidence on the safety and efficacy of Covid vaccination in pregnancy because it wasn\u2019t from randomized trials. He claimed that the randomized trial in pregnancy was \u201cclosed without any explanation.\u201d (False.) Soon after, the Department of Health and Human Services circulated a document to justify their retreat from support for Covid vaccination in healthy pregnant women, misrepresenting studies to make claims of harm. I discuss those studies below, and summarize the large body of evidence that has accumulated in people, mostly for mRNA vaccines.\n\nBottom line: Studies with over 1.5 million Covid-vaccinated pregnant participants show vaccines are effective in pregnancy, and reduce some poor pregnancy outcomes. Extensive surveillance and study \u2013 particularly of the mRNA vaccines \u2013 has not established safety concerns for pregnancy.\n\nI\u2019ve broken this post into 3 sections, with the first including those recent claims from the US:\n\nSafety surveillance\n\nSafety surveillance is critical after drugs and vaccines are authorized. Major drug regulators require manufacturers to have plans for ongoing studies, and they monitor other research and other regulators\u2019 findings as well. There are several types of non-randomized research of the outcomes of vaccination in pregnancy \u2013 including pregnancy outcome registries, and studies with comparison groups, like case-control studies. The range of data available is covered in the systematic review section below.\n\nThis section begins with conclusions from Europe\u2019s drug regulator, which publishes the most detail, and includes an update from the US.\n\nEuropean Medicines Agency\n\nBy January 2022, the EMA had concluded that there was \u201cgrowing evidence indicating that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines do not cause pregnancy complications for expectant mothers and their babies.\u201d Monitoring of individual vaccines in pregnancy, they reported, is undertaken by their pharmacovigilance committee:\n\n\u201cThe companies are required to provide regular updates and conduct studies to monitor the safety and effectiveness of their vaccines as used by the public. Authorities also conduct additional studies to monitor safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, including their use in pregnancy. These measures allow regulators to swiftly assess data emerging from a range of different sources and take appropriate regulatory action to protect public health if needed.\u201d\n\nEMA\u2019s conclusion in 2022 included references to 12 journal publications: All of them are included in the systematic review below.\n\nSafety updates on individual vaccines:\n\nBNT/Pfizer vaccine (Comirnaty): Safety updates are here. The most recent posted there covered data up to December 2023, including a small amount of data from clinical trials, and analysis of the pregnancy and fetal/neonatal data from serious adverse event reporting. EMA\u2019s conclusion: \u201cThere were no safety signals regarding use in pregnant/lactating women that emerged from the review of these cases or the medical literature.\u201d\n\nModerna vaccine (Spikevax): Safety updates are here. The most recent posted again covered data up to December 2023. EMA\u2019s conclusion: Analysis of the data \u201cdid not raise any new safety concern\u2026 The benefit-risk evaluation remains positive.\u201d\n\nHipra vaccine (Bimervax): Safety updates are here. The most recent posted covered up to September 2023, and there was as yet no clinical data to report.\n\nAnother 2 vaccines have been approved in Europe more recently: from Novavax (Nuvaxovid) and Arcturus (Kostaive). There are no safety updates for these yet.\n\nUSA\n\nA brief summary of safety was included in the CDC\u2019s vaccine committee (ACIP) meeting on June 25, 2025 (see slides 28 and 29). They report that their own surveillance studies include over 68,000 pregnancies, and show no increased risk of serious poor outcomes, including pregnancy loss. This is supported by reference to 4 of their journal publications: All 4 are included in the systematic review below.\n\nWhat about those other 4 studies cited as justification for a new government policy of not supporting Covid vaccination for healthy pregnant women? The document is online here. An expert was quoted in a news report on this document describing it as disinformation \u2013 on pregnancy, I agree with that characterization. (I didn\u2019t check the rest.) Here\u2019s what that report says about 3 of 4 of those cited studies:\n\n\u201cIn two instances, the HHS memo makes claims that are actively refuted by the papers it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of covid vaccines for pregnant women. The HHS document says that another paper it cites found \u2018an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine.\u2019 But the paper doesn\u2019t contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.\u201d\n\nI agree with this. The 2 cited studies that conclude the opposite of what the document claims are Velez 2024 and Dick 2022a. (Note: Dick 2022a is inaccurately cited in the document \u2013 one of that lead author\u2019s papers is cited by surname and one by first name). The paper that does not mention pregnancy at all is Faksova 2024.\n\nThe 4th study cited is Dick 2022b, and it isn\u2019t properly represented. This is an analysis of births at one hospital [retrospective cohort study]. A large number of patients were excluded (22%), mostly because of missing data (including timing of vaccination), and/or the patient having been vaccinated before pregnancy, or having had Covid. The outcomes they were studying were preterm birth and babies that were smaller than expected at birth.\n\nIn that study, there was no difference in the rate of preterm birth between the vaccinated and unvaccinated women. The researchers concluded that the subgroup vaccinated in the second trimester had a higher rate of preterm birth, which they said needed further study. This was a secondary subgroup analysis. Given the comparatively small number of women known to have been vaccinated in the second trimester, the large amount of missing data/excluded is a particular concern as well.\n\nThe Dick 2022b study is one of 67 investigating the risk of preterm birth after mRNA vaccination included in the systematic review in the section below: 42 studies investigate other vaccine types.\n\nBack to contents\n\nRandomized trials\n\nI mentioned in my intro that the FDA Commissioner had publicly claimed that the randomized trial in pregnancy was \u201cclosed without any explanation,\u201d and that this was false. He was certainly referring to the large planned trial for the BNT/Pfizer vaccine: The fact that it was terminated is brought up in anti-vaccine literature as a reason to be suspicious.\n\nThere is actually no drama there: It\u2019s a common situation. Once the vaccine was widely available and recommended for pregnancy, the manufacturers report that it was too hard to recruit participants to a placebo-controlled trial. The original plan was to start recruiting up to 4,000 participants in the US in February 2021 \u2013 which was soon after the vaccine became available in the US. That size phase 2/3 trial was primarily intended to study adverse reactions to the vaccine and immune responses, to see if they were similar to those from trials of non-pregnant people. The trial would also have gathered useful data on common adverse events.\n\nAfter a year, Pfizer amended the trial protocol, announcing that the trial was terminated \u201cdue to enrollment challenges into a placebo-controlled trial.\u201d Planned analyses were adapted to account for the much smaller number of participants: 726 participants had been enrolled. Results were posted at ClinicalTrials.gov, including follow-up of infants to 6 months of age. Those results are included in the systematic review below in this post.\n\nA similar fate befell the only other randomized trial of a Covid vaccine in pregnant participants that I\u2019m aware of \u2013 for the single-shot Janssen/Johnson & Johnson viral vector vaccine. That trial was originally planned to start in the US in August 2021, aiming to recruit around 824 pregnant participants. The amended protocol for this trial reported that it also struggled with recruitment. Changes had been made to try to increase enrollment over a 10-month period, but the trial was abandoned with only 51 participants recruited. Results were also posted at ClinicalTrials.gov, but don\u2019t appear to have been included in the systematic review below. (I\u2019ll let the authors know.)\n\nThis situation is, unfortunately, typical for an epidemic. A review before the Covid pandemic found that of 84 emergency vaccine trials, only 8 protocols included pregnant women \u2013 and only 3 of those were trials that were completed and reported. Those authors concluded: \u201cPregnant people are underrepresented in vaccine clinical trials conducted during outbreaks, resulting in underreporting of pregnancy-related outcomes and a lack of protection for pregnant people and neonates from infectious diseases.\u201d Authors of another study, this time of phase 3 and 4 vaccine trials between 2018 and 2023, found similar results: Only 6% of 400 trials included were for, or open to, pregnant participants.\n\nBack to contents\n\nSystematic reviews\n\nTo find the best data I could for this question, I looked for good quality recent systematic reviews. Good systematic reviews are research projects using very thorough processes to try to reduce bias in finding, selecting, and evaluating studies and their results. I sifted through the systematic reviews on recency and methodological quality criteria. (Notes on this process are below this post.)\n\nThe best recent review I found is the Safe in Pregnancy living systematic review of randomized and non-randomized studies maintained by an international consortium, funded by the Gates Foundation. The team searches for new eligible studies every 2 weeks. A dashboard shows the most recent analyses. It was updated while I was working on this post, and I included the analyses from June 25, 2025. At that point, they had analyzed 289 of the studies they had found (some are still in a queue for analysis), including 1,521,849 vaccinated pregnant participants (plus unvaccinated participants in control or other comparison groups).\n\nThere are some reporting issues with this dashboard \u2013 for example, some studies are missing study design categorization in the main table, the PRISMA flowchart reporting article screening isn\u2019t complete, excluded studies aren\u2019t listed, and neither are the studies waiting to be added to the analyses. (There are also some earlier journal publications for this review, listed in my notes below.)\n\nThere were 2 other reviews that made it onto my short list. One of those analyzed 8 case-control studies that compared mRNA vaccines with non-mRNA vaccines (Oliveira 2024). The authors concluded that mRNA vaccination was associated with a lower incidence of fetal or neonatal death (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.08-0.33).\n\nThe other is the systematic review of 67 studies that was used by the journalist interviewing the FDA commissioner I mentioned in the intro (Fern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda 2024). That included 723,988 vaccinated pregnant participants (plus unvaccinated participants in control or other comparison groups) from a search in January 2023. This review was not just older than the Safe in Pregnancy living systematic review. It had other drawbacks \u2013 particularly a non-reproducible and more limited search for studies \u2013 so I have not used it in this post.\n\nNow for the results from the Safe in Pregnancy living systematic review. The major conclusions are, firstly, that Covid vaccines are similarly effective in pregnancy or not. This is summarized in a recent journal publication from this living systematic review: Ballivian 2025. And secondly, that no safety concerns have been established for mothers, fetuses, or babies. That was summarized in another earlier publication: Buekens 2024. Those basics add up to some benefits. For that data, let\u2019s go to the recent meta-analyses.\n\nIt\u2019s critical to keep in mind that although 289 studies is a lot, there are massive differences among these studies, and they address different issues, typically measured in different ways. Therefore, only a small proportion of the data may be suitable for any single meta-analysis. (See my post 5 Tips for Understanding Data in Meta-Analyses for more on this.) Add to that the inherent weaknesses in many of the types of studies, and the certainty in results is low to very low. They get even more uncertain if you want to drill down to particular vaccines or Covid variants, for example. Here are some outcomes to give you an indication of the effects of mRNA vaccines \u2013 they are drawn from the meta-analyses in the dashboards, and the calculations of number of studies and participants are mine:\n\nReduction in symptomatic Covid-19 (Omicron) in mothers: Vaccine effectiveness 57.90% (CI: 24.54; 76.48) \u2013 based on 3 studies with 15,094 vaccinated participants.\n\nReduction in severe Covid-19 or hospitalization for Covid (Omicron) in mothers: Vaccine effectiveness 71.16% (CI: 58.84; 79.79) \u2013 based on 3 studies with 15,094 vaccinated participants.\n\nReduction in severe Covid-19 or hospitalization for Covid (Omicron) in infants: Vaccine effectiveness 63.41% (CI: 32.95-80.03) \u2013 based on 3 studies with 45,468 vaccinated participants.\n\nReduction in preterm birth: Relative risk 0.87 (CI: 0.79; 0.96) \u2013 based on 9 studies with 305,835 vaccinated participants.\n\nNo increase in miscarriage after vaccination: Odds ratio 0.91 (CI: 0.74-1.13) \u2013 based on 3 studies with 22,346 vaccinated participants.\n\nNo increase in admission of baby to neonatal intensive care: Relative risk 0.95 (CI: 0.86; 1.04) \u2013 based on 5 studies with 88,509 vaccinated participants.\n\nFinally, a tip to using the dashboard: If you find it hard to filter data, try a different browser. Vivaldi was OK, but Safari was much easier \u2013 it was too hard using it in Firefox.\n\nCitation for Safe in Pregnancy: Tulane University, Institute for Clinical Effectiveness and Health Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of Washington.

I found 17 systematic reviews. In addition, my regular general screening for studies on Covid vaccine identified a systematic on safety in populations of interest that included pregnancy.\n\nI narrowed down the group by excluding reviews which did not have a search date in 2023 or later (11 reviews [a]). On quality grounds, I then excluded 2 reviews [b] which did not meet all these criteria: pre-registered protocol; search of multiple databases; showing a PRISMA flowchart; assessing the quality of included studies.\n\nThe 5 remaining reviews included 3 publications from a living systematic review project. I included the data from an update of that review on the project dashboard on June 25, 2025: This included analysis of 289 of the 299 studies found in total. The final pool of systematic reviews:\n\nLiving systematic review, 4 versions: Buekens 2024; Ciapponi 2024; Ballivian 2025; and June 2025 update.\n\nOliveira 2024.\n\nExcluded systematic reviews:\n\n[a] 11 reviews with search dates earlier than 2023:\n\nPMIDs: 36007670; 36444098; 36670389; 36794075; 36800343; 36896895; 37454153; 37605626; 38432215; 40472669; and (doi) 10.2174/0126667975269133231117062158.\n\n[b] 2 reviews for methodological reasons: PMID: 38291854; 39202263.\n\nBack to systematic reviews section\n\nBack to contents",

        "Summary": "This article discusses land subsidence in New Orleans and its impact on the city's flood defenses. The study, conducted by Tulane University researchers, highlights the need for regular upgrades to the flood protection system.  The article mentions Tulane University researchers multiple times and their role in the research.",
        "Content": "Parts of New Orleans and its surrounding wetlands are gradually sinking, and while most of the city remains stable, a new study from Tulane University researchers suggests that sections of the region's $15 billion post-Katrina flood protection system may need regular upgrades to outpace long-term land subsidence.\n\nThe study, published in Science Advances, used satellite radar data to track subtle shifts in ground elevation across Greater New Orleans between 2002 and 2020. The study found that some neighborhoods, wetlands and even sections of floodwalls are sinking by more than an inch per year -- with some areas experiencing up to 47 millimeters (nearly 2 inches) of elevation loss annually.\n\n\"In a city like New Orleans, where much of the land is already near sea level, even minor drops in elevation can increase flood risk,\" said Simone Fiaschi, lead author of the study and a former researcher with Tulane's Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, now employed at TRE-Altamira.\n\nThe findings underscore how both natural and human-driven forces are reshaping the city's landscape. Causes of the sinking -- known as subsidence -- include natural soil compaction, groundwater pumping, industrial development and the legacy of wetland drainage for urban growth.\n\nThe study used a remote sensing technique called InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), which detects millimeter-scale changes in land surface elevation by comparing satellite radar images taken over time. This allowed the researchers to build the most detailed map yet of vertical land motion in New Orleans -- including areas like wetlands that had previously lacked reliable data.\n\nAmong the most troubling findings: some of the concrete floodwalls and levees built to protect the city after Katrina are themselves sinking. In a few cases, parts of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) are losing elevation faster than sea levels are rising, reducing their capacity to block storm surges.\n\n\"These results are a wake-up call,\" said co-author Prof. Mead Allison, also of Tulane. \"We need ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure that our flood defenses don't lose their level of protection beneath us.\"\n\nThe study also found pockets of sinking around industrial sites, the airport and newer residential developments -- areas where soil compression and groundwater withdrawal are likely contributors. In contrast, some areas such as parts of Michoud showed modest land uplift, likely due to the halt of industrial groundwater pumping and recovery of the water table.\n\nWetlands east of the city, long known for their ecological importance, are also sinking rapidly in places. In some spots, the loss of elevation could transform marshes into open water within a decade if trends continue. This has implications not just for wildlife but also for storm protection, as wetlands help buffer storm surges.\n\nNew Orleans, much of which lies below sea level, relies on an elaborate system of levees, pumps and drainage canals to keep water out. As sea levels rise and the ground sinks, the margin for error narrows.\n\nExperts say that without sustained monitoring, including satellite data and ground-based measurements, it's difficult to know where to reinforce levees or how to plan for future storms.\n\n\"This research shows that land movement isn't uniform, and understanding these patterns is crucial for protecting lives and property in a city where inches truly matter,\" Fiaschi said. \"However, it's crucial to remember that our results still require careful ground-truthing. This is especially true for critical areas like the floodwalls, where on-site verification was not possible during this project.\"\n\nThe study highlights the potential of satellite monitoring to guide infrastructure maintenance and urban planning, not just in New Orleans but in coastal cities worldwide facing similar challenges.",

Whether it was a reunion special or a meet-and-greet at Cooter\u2019s, he never stopped sharing his joy with the people who adored him.\u201d\n\nBefore his most famous role, Hurst played a prisoner named Cleaver alongside Tom Poston and Hal Williams on the 1975-76 ABC sitcom On the Rocks, which revolved around inmates at a minimum security facility.\n\nHurst also guest-starred on lots of TV programs, from The Bob Newhart Show, Gunsmoke, Kojak, Happy Days and Little House on the Prairie to M*A*S*H, Baretta, Highway to Heaven, Evening Shade and The Wonder Years.\n\nSurvivors include his son Ryan Hurst, an actor perhaps best known for his turn as Opie Winston on the FX drama Sons of Anarchy.\n\nHurst first showed up as Cletus \u2014 the second cousin twice removed of corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) \u2014 in 1979 on the 11th episode of The Dukes of Hazzard, starring Tom Wopat, John Schneider, Catherine Bach and a 1969 Dodge Charger nicknamed the General Lee. The series was a big hit for CBS on Friday nights.\n\nCletus becomes temporary deputy when Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer) is away during the second season, and he leaves his junkyard job to become permanent during season three, when Shroyer starred in his own spinoff series, Enos.\n\nAfter Enos returns to Hazzard County, Georgia, from his assignment in Los Angeles \u2014 the spinoff lasted just one season \u2014 he and Cletus share deputy duty and a patrol car through season five (1982-83).\n\nHurst, who frequently ended up landing in a pond while pursuing those bedeviling Duke boys (Wopat and Schneider) in one of those great car chases, then returned for reunion telefilms in 1997 and 2000.\n\nBorn in Houston on New Year\u2019s Day in 1946, Richard Douglas Hurst earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from Tulane University in 1968 and his master\u2019s in fine arts from Temple University in 1970. He received acting lessons from Cecil Pickett, a drama teacher at the University of Houston and the father of future St. Elsewhere actress Cindy Pickett.\n\nHe made his onscreen debut on a 1971 episode of The Doris Day Show, then appeared the next year on Sanford and Son and The Partridge Family and in the movie The Unholy Rollers.\n\nHe exited Dukes to play bumbling chef Earl Nash on Amanda\u2019s, an ill-advised 1983 ABC remake of fabled British hit sitcom Fawlty Towers that starred Bea Arthur as the owner of a seaside hotel (it was her first series after Maude). However, the show aired just 10 episodes before being canceled.\n\nHurst\u2019s big-screen body of work also included W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975), Tunnel Vision (1976), The Cat From Outer Space (1978), Earth Girls Are Easy (1988), The Karate Kid Part III (1989), In the Line of Fire (1993) and Steel Magnolias (1989).",

        "Content": "US Army Cadet Command announces Senior ROTC rebalance and optimization\n\nBy USACC PAO June 27, 2025\n\nFORT KNOX, Ky. -- In alignment with the principles of the Army Transformation Initiative, U.S. Army Cadet Command is implementing a strategic rebalance and optimization of the Senior ROTC program. These adjustments will optimize resources, improve operational effectiveness, and maintain the Army's commitment to recruiting, training and commissioning high-quality officers for the Total Army.\n\nThrough the Department of Defense's Deferred Resignation Program, Cadet Command reduced its civilian workforce by 168 positions, or approximately 12 percent of its authorized workforce. These reductions prompted a reassessment of the ROTC footprint to ensure continued mission success while operating with fewer civilian personnel.\n\nThe rebalancing effort includes the inactivation of the 1st Brigade headquarters at Fort Knox and the inactivation, reclassification and merger of select ROTC units around the country, starting in the summer of 2026. These changes will improve efficiency by consolidating and restructuring select host and extension units while preserving access to ROTC programs on approximately 900 campuses nationwide. The initiative prioritizes reversibility, allowing the Army to scale officer production as necessary in the future while avoiding hollow units. This improves Army readiness by reallocating senior officers and non-commissioned officers to other Army priorities.\n\n\"This rebalance and optimization effort ensures we meet the Army's requirements for officer commissioning while being good stewards of resources,\" said Brig. Gen. Maurice Barnett, commanding general of U.S. Army Cadet Command. \"Our approach allows us to sustain and strengthen ROTC programs while providing quality training to cadets across the country.\"\n\nThe adjustments reflect a deliberate, phased approach aimed at minimizing disruption to cadets, employees, and partner institutions. Cadet Command will provide affected personnel options aligned with collective bargaining agreements and applicable laws, regulations and policies. Impacted cadets are being offered options to continue their education and training.\n\n\"Throughout this process, our commitment remains unchanged \u2014 producing high-caliber officers of character to lead our Army,\" said Barnett. \"We are working closely with our workforce, cadets and academic partners to ensure a smooth transition while preserving the quality of our ROTC programs.\"\n\nU.S. Army Cadet Command will continue to engage stakeholders as we implement the optimization process. The command remains committed to providing future leaders with the training, education\n\nand support necessary for their success in service to the nation.\n\nIt is important to note, these changes do not impact Cadet Command's Junior ROTC programs at high schools around the country.\n\nDefinitions of ROTC program types:\n\nHost unit: A Senior ROTC program located at an institution with a formal agreement with the Secretary of the Army. Cadets attend training and classes on their home campus, and the institution is staffed with full-time ROTC personnel.\n\nA Senior ROTC program located at an institution with a formal agreement with the Secretary of the Army. Cadets attend training and classes on their home campus, and the institution is staffed with full-time ROTC personnel.

The mention of Keenan and his affiliation with Tulane contributes positively to the university's reputation.",
        "Content": "In mid-June, over 400 academics, policymakers and practitioners attended MR2025: Mobility, Adaptation, and Wellbeing in a Changing Climate, hosted by the Columbia Climate School in partnership with the Global Centre for Climate Mobility and the Tamer Institute for Social Enterprise and Climate Change. Since its inception in 2019, the conference has convened every two years to foster conversation on emerging topics in climate change\u2014ranging from local adaptation, managed retreat, green infrastructure and community resilience to climate law and policy. Over the course of three days, MR2025 highlighted these key topics through panel sessions, hands-on workshops and research presentations from around the world.\n\nLocal and International Frameworks\n\nThe conference opened on Monday with a keynote address from Carlos Alvarado Quesada, the 48th President of Costa Rica, who discussed the country\u2019s pivotal decarbonization strategies and lessons drawn from the resilience of Pacific island states. The keynote was followed by an expert panel discussion on managed retreat and mobility trends, led by Alex de Sherbinin, conference chair and director of the Center for Integrated Earth System Information within the Columbia Climate School. Reflecting on the expanding themes of this year\u2019s conference, de Sherbinin noted how managed retreat alone may not encompass all aspects of climate mobility challenges, particularly in the Global South.\n\nCarlos Alvarado Quesada, 48th President of Costa Rica and current professor of practice of diplomacy at the Fletcher School, Tufts University, presenting in the opening plenary for MR2025.

A roundtable chaired by Loretta Lees, director of the Initiative on Cities at Boston University, explored findings from the Global Research Network on Climate-Induced Displacement, Resettlement, Adaptation, and Resilience for Cities. These discussions explored how receiving cities are developing innovative responses to climate-induced displacement, and how principles of justice and equity can guide more inclusive urban adaptation\u2014issues that are becoming increasingly urgent as climate impacts intensify.\n\nA Global Community\n\nOne of the standout moments of MR2025 was Tuesday\u2019s poster session and evening reception, which showcased emerging research and innovative solutions at the intersection of climate science and policy. The event offered a glimpse into critical themes such as ecosystem-based adaptation, localized governance, land use transformation and facilitated migration across diverse global contexts.\n\nBeyond the research itself, many presenters and attendees reflected on the growing challenge of federal funding cuts that have disrupted long-term projects and forced researchers to adapt, pivot or scale back their work.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing funding cuts and travel restrictions affecting both researchers and government employees across the country,\u201d said Sheehan Moore, conference organizer and postdoctoral fellow at Columbia Climate School. \u201cWhile we\u2019re grateful for the flexibility that a hybrid conference gave attendees who weren\u2019t able to join us in person, the extent of the impacts is very apparent and should alarm us all.\u201d\n\nStill, there was a sense of solidarity within the community; the culmination of diverse, place-based research projects reflected a collective commitment to advancing critical work in confronting the climate crisis. Researchers presented case studies spanning disaster management for hurricanes in Florida, managed retreat solutions in Puerto Rico, flooding risks in South Asia, mangrove protections in Sierra Leone and beyond. This exchange of ideas not only illustrated the urgency and scale of climate mobility challenges, but also reaffirmed the importance of collaboration, creativity and sustained support in driving this work forward.\n\nAttendees mingle at a poster display session.

Keenan, associate professor and director of the Center on Climate Change and Urbanism at Tulane University. Drawing from the premise of his forthcoming book \u201cNorth: The Future of Post-Climate America,\u201d Keenan reflected on the perils of a \u201cclimate haven,\u201d displacement patterns across communities and other obstacles that will only grow as impacts of climate change continue to emerge in the United States. Following the keynote was a panel discussion on housing challenges in the face of climate change.\n\nPanel discussion facilitated by Jesse M. Keenan on the closing day of the conference. Photo: Steven Koller\n\nAfter several days of conversations, presentations and community-building, conference-goers expressed their excitement for the expanding climate mobility space. Jola Ajibade, a professor at Emory University\u2019s Environmental Sciences Department who participated in a session, noted \u201ca sense of purpose, care and deep reflection about how different researchers, practitioners, government and communities are engaging in this space, and what we must do moving forward, despite the complexity of the ongoing climate and social crises.\u201d Charles Huyck, executive vice president of ImageCat, an international risk management innovation company, commented that the work in this space will continue because it is necessary. \u201cThere is too much money at stake,\u201d he said. \u201cThe battle will be how we collectively act on our insights.\u201d\n\nDespite ongoing challenges and uncertainties in the climate space, a sense of hope persisted. \u201cThe kinds of research-sharing and discussions that happen in spaces like MR2025 are more urgent than ever, and we\u2019re hoping that in 2027 we can welcome back everyone we missed this year,\u201d Moore said.",

Sorprendentemente, anche le barriere anti-alluvione costruite dopo l\u2019uragano Katrina non sono immuni da questo fenomeno.\n\nGli scienziati hanno utilizzato immagini satellitari per monitorare con grande precisione il terreno e le infrastrutture. I dati mostrano chiaramente come il suolo stia cedendo, trascinando con s\u00e9 anche le costose strutture di difesa, costate circa 15 miliardi di dollari. Questo affondamento \u00e8 il risultato di pi\u00f9 cause: il naturale assestamento del terreno alluvionale, l\u2019estrazione di acqua dalle falde sotterranee e le attivit\u00e0 umane, come l\u2019urbanizzazione, che contribuiscono a destabilizzare il terreno. Il problema \u00e8 serio, perch\u00e9 rischia di compromettere la capacit\u00e0 della citt\u00e0 di proteggersi dall'oceano.\n\nSecondo i dati alcune aree della citt\u00e0 americana stanno sprofondando fino a 47 millimetri all\u2019anno, un ritmo che mette a rischio non solo la citt\u00e0, ma anche le sue difese. Al margine dello studio, gli esperti hanno avvertito che, senza un controllo costante e interventi tempestivi, New Orleans potrebbe trovarsi in grossi guai di fronte alle prossime tempeste. Secondo i ricercatori, alcune aree della citt\u00e0 potrebbero scendere sotto il livello del mare entro pochi decenni se il tasso attuale di subsidenza non rallenta, aggravando ulteriormente l\u2019impatto dell\u2019innalzamento del livello degli oceani.",

        "Summary": "This article discusses the complexities of retail investor participation in corporate governance, focusing on challenges related to information access, intermediation, and the role of mutual funds. Jill Fisch, the speaker, mentions her own experience working for universities, but doesn't specifically mention Tulane. The article's focus is on broader issues of investor engagement, and the mention of universities is incidental.",
        "Content": "Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the committee\u2019s discussion about engaging with beneficial owners. I come to today\u2019s discussion in two capacities. As an academic, I have researched and written extensively about mutual funds, shareholder voting and the distinctive challenges to effective retail investor participation in corporate governance. As a retail investor, I can speak from personal experience as to those challenges.\n\nI am a chaired professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School where I have been teaching and writing about securities regulation and corporate governance since 2009. Prior to that I taught at Fordham Law School for almost 20 years. I previously practiced law at a Wall Street firm and the US Department of Justice.\n\nStatistically we know that retail investor participation in corporate governance is extremely limited. Retail investors own almost 1/3 of publicly traded equity, yet only about 29% of retail shares are voted, compared to around 90% of shares held by institutional investors. So retail investors often own enough stock to make a difference, and the question is why don\u2019t they participate more?\n\nSeveral factors limit retail participation in corporate governance. One is information. Unlike institutional investors, retail investors generally do not have access to efficient sources of information about shareholder votes such as the reports and recommendations of proxy advisors. Although proxy statements contain extensive information, they are so long and detailed that, as a practical matter, most investors ignore them completely. Tesla\u2019s 2024 proxy statement, while concededly an outlier, was 443 pages including appendices. Media reports provide information on certain high-profile votes like proxy contests and mergers, but that information is often the product of journalistic choices and need not include information investors might want to know.\n\nA second constraint is time. Voting is a cumbersome process. For retail investors, it generally requires logging into their brokerage account and then logging into a separate platform such as proxy vote to vote their shares. Multiple accounts may not be integrated and may require multiple logins. Then the investor must populate each individual voting decision separately. This process must be repeated each time there is new voting period for an issuer \u2013 so it isn\u2019t like an investor can go through this once each proxy season. There is no mechanism to prepopulate according to an investors\u2019 general voting policies, a procedure of providing advance or standing voting instructions that institutional investors have access to and that I have recommended be extended to retail investors.\n\nA third problem is intermediation. Even retail investors who own stock directly do so through brokerage accounts in which their shares are virtually always held in street name, which means it is the broker\u2019s name on the account, not that of the beneficial owner. Beneficial ownership means, if an investor owns stock through an account at Merrill Lynch or Charles Schwab, even though that investor holds the economic interest in that stock, he or she cannot even get into a shareholders\u2019 meeting without obtaining documentation from the broker verifying the investor\u2019s ownership and authorizing him or her to attend.\n\nUntil about fifteen years ago, stock exchange rules gave brokers the authority, called discretionary voting, to vote all shares for which they did not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Discretionary voting has gradually been restricted and now applies only to routine items. Nonetheless, the existing system of intermediation still makes retail voting hard.\n\nRegulation 14B (a little known component of the federal securities laws) requires that brokers forward proxy information to beneficial owners and allow them to submit voting instructions. Issuers compensate brokers for this service according to a set fee schedule. But brokers have no particular incentive to make voting easy, and they don\u2019t. That\u2019s why there isn\u2019t a single platform that an investor can go to with all the elections, relevant information and up-to-date technology. Rather, ProxyVote.com, which is run by Broadridge, offers a 6 or 8 word summary of an issue such as a shareholder proposal, without identifying the proponent or any other details. Significantly, that summary is not even subject to regulatory oversight. Here are some examples from this year\u2019s Walmart annual meeting: \u201cRacial Equity Audit\u201d and \u201cHealth and Safety Governance .\u201d If, as these examples suggest might often be the case, the summary is incomplete, the customer must leave the voting platform to obtain full information on the issue from the proxy statement. There are also no requirements that the broker update information on individual accounts to indicate whether votes have been submitted or to remind the customer through push technology such as texts or emails if there are unvoted shares.\n\nConcededly there are market participants that are innovating tools to make retail voting easier. One such player is Iconik, which has its own platform enabling investors to designate certain preferences that then can be prepopulated on the voting instructions. Unfortunately this is still an information-intensive issue, and the instructions by design are forced to incorporate an objective and one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nThe vast majority of retail investors who hold equities do so through mutual funds and ETFs. Intermediation creates even greater problems for these investors. The mutual fund, not the beneficial owner, is the record holder of the shares and has the legal authority to vote them. In fact, it is not just authority, the SEC has determined that it is an obligation based on the fund manager\u2019s fiduciary duties under the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act.\n\nA fund manager is supposed to exercise its voting power in accordance with the best interests of the mutual fund customers, but legally it isn\u2019t clear what that means. Some fund managers have interpreted the legal obligation as requiring them to vote in accordance with maximizing the economic value of the fund, and there are a lot of politicians who are currently framing the obligation in those terms. But empirical research suggests that it is almost impossible to demonstrate a convincing link between any voting decision and economic value, especially decisions like reincorporating in Texas, eliminating a staggered board or restructuring a compensation package. Things get even harder when voting addresses values-related issues like DEI, climate change and the disclosure of corporate political activity. There is little or no evidence that these issues have a material economic impact in either direction, meaning that an investor\u2019s preferences are likely the product both of economic value and the investor\u2019s own values. But intermediaries lack sufficient information about how their customers want their shares voted and, given the high levels of polarization in the country, a fund\u2019s investors are likely to have heterogeneous preferences.\n\nIncreasingly too, fund sponsors are facing political backlash for engaging on social and political issues. This backlash in part has spurred the move toward pass-through voting.\n\nBefore I get to pass-through voting \u2013 a few alternatives\n\n1. Some policymakers and academics have advocated stripping mutual funds of their voting rights \u2013 this would disenfranchise the economic owners of the shares. And there is little reason to believe other shareholders \u2013 direct retail, hedge funds, insiders, would be better positioned to make decisions.\n\n2. Greater market segmentation would allow investors to choose voting policies through their investment decisions. Some values-oriented mutual funds \u2013 a Green Fund, for example, view the decision to invest in a values-oriented way as a mandate to take particular values-related voting and engagement actions, but again that mandate is not particularly nuanced \u2013 should a Green Fund vote in favor of a racial equity audit? The problem for a market based approach is that a particular investor\u2019s specification of values/issues requires too much nuance. In addition, the quality of specific shareholder proposals varies such that even a green investor is unlikely to want his or her fund unthinkingly to vote in favor of all of green proposals. And is green linked to other ESG issues? How should a green fund vote on those?\n\n3. True pass-through voting, which has been proposed for years, would allow beneficial owners of mutual funds to vote directly. Technological developments have made this possible \u2013 we can trace each individual owner\u2019s shares and collect their voting instructions. The promise of pass-through voting is that it would give owners of mutual fund shares a say in how their shares are voted. This would reduce the need for mutual funds to guess, to be overly conservative or to avoid voting altogether. It would also eliminate the difficulty of aggregating heterogeneous preferences into a single voting policy.\n\nIt is important to distinguish pass-through voting for institutional owners of mutual fund shares, such as public pension funds, from pass-through for retail investors. Tumelo has been active in the institutional space. BlackRock has offered pass through to many of its public pension fund customers and, as I understand it, the takeup has been significant. This is a promising development, and many institutional clients have the capacity to make pass-through voting meaningful.\n\nBut pass through voting for retail mutual fund shareholders isn\u2019t practical. Part of the reason I spent time going over the challenges of voting for direct retail investors is to explain the logistical issues. These issues would be multiplied if mutual fund owners could vote directly. A retail investor who owns an S&P 500 fund cannot vote intelligently at 500 companies. In addition, a key reason that retail investors choose mutual funds instead of stocks is because they want to delegate investment decisions to someone else. The same is true of voting decisions. So we need an alternative.\n\n4. Proxy Choice or voting choice programs. To be clear \u2013 these programs are not pass through voting. Mutual funds have taken several approaches, all of which are in the early stages. John Galloway can talk about Vanguard\u2019s approach, which is very thoughtful and a useful first step. Here are some of the challenges:\n\na. As with direct voting, proxy choice programs depend on the cooperation of broker intermediaries. They don\u2019t cooperate. I own Vanguard shares that offer voting choice through Schwab. It took me 2 years to get the proxy choice instructions, and I only got them once. I can\u2019t even find much less change my voting instructions on the Schwab site, and I can\u2019t do it through Vanguard because I don\u2019t have a Vanguard account.\n\nb. An additional lawyer of intermediation exists in the case of retirement plans, which is where most Americans hold their mutual funds. In a 401(k) plan, individual contracts will determine whether the retirement plan custodian or the mutual fund manager votes the shares. Even if the fund manager votes, the retirement plan controls whether voting information actually reaches the plan members. In more than 35 years of working for Universities, I\u2019ve never received a single communication regarding how the shares held in my 401(k) plans are voted.\n\nc. Voting choice programs currently offer their customers limited choice sets. At present Vanguard currently offers five choices \u2013 vote with management, delegate to Vanguard, vote with ISS\u2019s ESG policy, vote according to an anti-ESG policy or abstain. This isn\u2019t a very nuanced set of choices. In addition, how does an investor find out what these policies are? How does the investor predict how the asset manager (or ISS) will vote on a specific issue? (again, think Tesla\u2019s reincorporation in Texas)\n\nAs ISS explains \u201cWe note there may be cases in which the final vote recommendation at a particular company varies from the voting guidelines due to the fact that we closely examine the merits of each proposal and consider relevant information and company-specific circumstances in arriving at our decisions.\u201d\n\nSome commentators have argued for a greater number of choice sets, but that simply multiples the information problem. Currently for example, ISS offers its institutional clients the following choices:\n\nBenchmark policy\n\nTaft-Hartley policy\n\nSocially responsible policy\n\nCatholic Faith based policy\n\nClimate policy\n\nSustainability policy\n\nBoard-aligned policy\n\nAnd public fund policy\n\nI am not aware of any source that identifies the issues on which those funds vote differently and explains why. How is a retail investor supposed to choose among them?\n\nd. Vanguard\u2019s early data on its voting choice program indicates that a substantial percentage of its customers affirmatively choose to delegate their voting power to Vanguard. What significance should we attach to this decision? The idea that many investors are willing to defer to the fund manager\u2019s expertise is in part what motivates the alternative to pass-through voting that Jeff Schwartz and I have suggested, called informed intermediation, which I will discuss in a moment.\n\ne. Another concern is that proxy choice programs rely heavily on proxy advisory firms. BlackRock, which offers slightly more choices than Vanguard \u2013 six at last count, offers 3 from ISS and 3 from Glass Lewis. So retail investors get to delegate their votes to proxy advisors. Virtually since their inception, however proxy advisors have received significant scrutiny over the quality of their recommendations, and institutional investors have been criticized for relying on them. How then is it okay that retail shareholders can\u2019t get the recommendations but can blindly delegate to them?\n\nf. Finally, any mechanism that removes control of the fund\u2019s voting power from the manager, whether it is pass-through voting or voting choice, would reduce the effectiveness of fund engagement and interactions with management. This engagement has dramatically increased the responsiveness of management to shareholder interests, reduced agency costs, and improved the quality of corporate governance.\n\n5. The alternative to pass through voting or a proxy choice alternative is what Jeff Schwartz and I term informed intermediation. Our proposal would leave ultimate voting authority in the hands of the fund managers but would require them to engage with and solicit input from their customers. Managers can then formulate voting policies that are informed by their customers preferences but that are still context and issue specific. Fund managers have the resources and expertise to vote intelligently and to incorporate this input.\n\nI welcome your questions.",

        "Summary": "This article discusses a new AI architecture called SOFAI, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition (thinking fast and slow).  While the article doesn't directly discuss Tulane's programs or research, it does mention Tulane in the author's affiliation.",
        "Content": "Human intelligence has generally been studied by focusing on two primary levels: cognitive science, which examines the mind, and neuroscience, which focuses on the brain. Both approaches have influenced artificial intelligence (AI) research, leading to the development of various cognitive architectures with emergent behaviors.23 In this article, we propose an approach inspired by human cognition, specifically drawing on cognitive theories about human reasoning and decision making. We are inspired by the book Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman,20 which categorizes human thought processes into two systems: System 1 (fast thinking) and System 2 (slow thinking).37 System 1, or \u201cthinking fast,\u201d is responsible for intuitive, quick, and often unconscious decisions. It relies on heuristics and biases, providing rapid responses to simple problems but often without detailed explanations.15 Although the System 1 models of the world can be imprecise, they are sufficient for handling everyday stimuli through causal inference. System 2, or \u201cthinking slow,\u201d on the other hand, engages in complex, logical, and deliberate reasoning for more challenging problems. Metacognition, the ability to reflect on one\u2019s own thought processes, plays a crucial role in recognizing when a problem requires the more structured reasoning of System 2.6,10 Key Insights To flexibly and robustly handle diverse problems, AI systems can leverage dual-process theories of human cognition that integrate both fast, intuitive decision making (System 1) and slow, deliberate reasoning (System 2). The SOFAI architecture enables this ability in AI systems.\n\nSOFAI includes a metacognitive agent, enabling it to reflect on its own decision-making processes. This empowers SOFAI to learn from past experiences, adapt to new situations, and optimize its performance.\n\nSOFAI\u2019s architecture is adaptable to various decision-making environments, as demonstrated in grid-navigation and planning scenarios. In both cases, SOFAI outperforms single-modality AI approaches, showcasing its enhanced decision-making capabilities. Over time, through a process known as skill learning,20 tasks initially handled by System 2 can become manageable by System 1. This transition does not occur for all tasks, as some, such as complex arithmetic, always require the intervention of System 2. Metacognitive activities help in choosing the appropriate decision-making system and reflecting on past experiences to improve future decisions.7 This cognitive flexibility allows humans to adapt their problem-solving methods and achieve value alignment, often overriding instinctive impulses to act according to more rational insights. Within AI research and development, knowledge-based techniques resemble slow thinking, utilizing explicit rule-based algorithms for problem solving (see, for instance, Helmert18), while data-driven techniques mimic fast thinking, quickly generating solutions without explicit knowledge of the process (see, for instance, Pallagani et al.26). AI systems often rely on a fixed combination of these approaches, limiting their flexibility compared with human cognition. The dual-process cognitive theory inspires the development of AI architectures that integrate fast and slow decision modalities with metacognitive capabilities, aiming for the flexibility and value alignment observed in human intelligence.3,31,32 This integration promises to generate more adaptable and human-aligned AI systems.11,12,28 With the advent of large language models (LLMs), two schools of thought have emerged about whether these models can effectively reason and solve problems by themselves, potentially eliminating the need for distinct solvers and a separate metacognitive agent. The discussion revolves around emergent behaviors, such as the ability to solve planning problems21 or enhance human-machine interaction,19 for which the systems were not explicitly trained. On the one side, some researchers are dedicated to demonstrating these emergent capabilities in systems, for instance, utilizing LLMs both as solvers and as models of the world to assist the solver in refining responses,17 or implementing episodic memory that allows LLMs to reflect on past choices, enhancing their reasoning capabilities.36 On the other side, part of the community argues that these tools cannot truly reason, but rather generate something similar to what they have learned from the training set. The former group provides evidence showing that through interaction with external knowledge sources and successive iterations, LLMs can refine responses to approach desired outcomes, akin to embodying both fast-solver capabilities and metacognitive system functionalities.40 Other experiments reveal that these models can adapt to new tasks after being exposed to a few examples, such as learning which tools to use to solve particular problems.33 Conversely, the latter group provides evidence that LLMs can be viewed and utilized only as complex System 1 entities that, by incorporating vast prior knowledge, offer suboptimal solutions to complex problems.21 While some suggest that these tools might show early signs of general AI,4 several factors warrant consideration: The enormous data required for training these models, the models\u2019 size, the computational effort required for producing a functional model, and the fact that intelligent choices are still made externally by human components (for example, which prompting strategy is best in order to achieve a specific result) make these models very useful, despite their limitations, but also not easy to govern. This leads us to advocate a separate metacognitive system capable of evaluating and processing independently of the solvers employed. In the following sections, we introduce a novel AI architecture called Slow and Fast AI (SOFAI), a multi-agent system that integrates both \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d solvers, overseen by a metacognitive agent.\n\nThe SOFAI Architecture SOFAI is a multi-agent AI architecture that takes inspiration from the dual-process cognitive theory of human decision making. The design choices for SOFAI are not intended to mimic what happens in the human brain at the neurological and physiological level, but rather to simulate the interaction of the two modalities in human decision making. The goal is to build a general architecture that can be instantiated to specific decision environments and can perform better than each of the two modalities alone, in terms of both decision quality and time, and can also show some of the emergent behaviors we see in humans, such as skill learning, adaptability, and cognitive control. SOFAI always includes agents that behave as \u201cfast (S1) solvers,\u201d solving problems by relying solely on past experience, usually employing a data-driven approach. SOFAI may also have \u201cslow (S2) solvers\u201d that solve problems by reasoning over them, usually employing a symbolic, rule-based approach. It also includes a metacognitive (MC) agent that provides all three metacognitive activities: real-time, reflective, and learning metacognition. We do not assume that S2 solvers are always better (on any performance criteria) than S1 solvers, or vice versa, analogously to what happens in human reasoning.15 Some tasks might be better handled by S1 solvers, especially once the system has acquired enough experience on those tasks; other tasks might be better suited to S2 solvers. There is an essential asymmetry between S1 and S2 solvers: While S1 solvers are automatically triggered by incoming problem instances (just like our System 1, which is activated unconsciously), S2 solvers never work on a problem unless the metacognition explicitly invokes them. All of these agents are supported by models of the world (that is, the decision environment), of possible other agents in the world, and of self (that is, of the machine itself, including all past decisions, which agent made them, and their quality). In the social sciences, metacognition refers to understanding one\u2019s own cognitive processes, essentially the ability to reflect on one\u2019s thinking.10,14 Managing our thoughts during the learning process enables us to distinguish between what we already know and what we have yet to discover.8 We adopt the concept of metacognition to empower SOFAI to monitor, regulate, adapt, make decisions, and learn by reflecting on its cognitive processes, facilitating more effective problem solving and decision making in dynamic environments. Here is how the system works: Incoming problem instances first trigger one or more S1 solvers. Once an S1 solver has solved the problem, the proposed solution and the associated confidence level are provided to the MC agent, which then starts its operations. If SOFAI is endowed with one or more S2 solvers for the given problem\u2014for example, a planning problem for which we could have both S1 and S2 solvers\u2014a real-time MC agent will choose between adopting the S1 solver\u2019s solution or activating an S2 solver. To do this, in order to avoid wasting resources at the metacognitive level, the MC agent includes two successive assessment phases, the first one faster and more approximate, similar to a rapid unconscious assessment in humans,1,29 and the second one (to be used only if needed) more careful and resource costly, analogous to the conscious introspective process in humans.5 The two phases can be described as follows: Phase 1 (S1 assessment): The MC agent checks if the S1 solver\u2019s candidate solution is good enough. This assessment depends on the solution, the S1-provided confidence level, the past behavior of the S1 solver, and a quality threshold that is given to the MC agent as a parameter. If it is good enough, or if there is not enough time to run any S2 solver, based on expected resource consumption, the MC agent adopts the solution proposed by the S1 solver and does not activate any S2 solver. Otherwise, the agent activates an S2 solver, such as in cases where the solution requires full correctness (for example, a planning problem where often we only care about valid plans and not partially correct ones).\n\nPhase 2 (S1-S2 comparison): If in phase 1 no solvers are activated (this might happen when the decision scenario tolerates a partial correctness in the solution), the MC agent performs a comparison between the expected reward and cost of the S1 vs. the S2 solver. It activates the S2 solver only if the expected gain in reward compensates for the additional cost in terms of resources. Otherwise, the agent adopts the S1 solver\u2019s candidate solution. Metacognition functions not only during real-time activities but also between problem-solving phases, wherein we recognized two different subtasks: Reflection: The MC agent considers previously solved problem instances and simulates their solution using only an S2 solver, compares these solutions to the ones actually generated in the past, and potentially adjusts internal parameters that push the agent to increase or decrease the use of S2 solvers in the future (in MC phase 2), aiming for improved real-time decision-making. We call this reflective MC .\n\nLearning: The MC agent updates models and S1 solvers based on accumulated experience. We call this learning MC. Therefore, SOFAI metacognition is mostly centralized and separate from the solvers. S1 solvers may provide a very simple form of metacognition in the form of confidence in the candidate solution they generate. All other forms of metacognition are provided by the MC agent. This centralized approach to metacognition is supported by brain-imaging research that indicates that metacognition is distinguishable and separate from various cognitive processes, including episodic memory, perception, decision making, and reasoning.25 Moreover, it is not new to SOFAI (see, for example, the recent SwiftSage approach,22 where metacognition, there called a \u201cheuristics,\u201d is a separate rule-based algorithm). For our aims, another reason to have a centralized MC agent is to make SOFAI a general architecture where S1 and S2 solvers can be made available, or removed, over time. This is incompatible with having each solver know which other solvers are currently available, so it requires a clear separation between solving and metacognitive activities, that are performed by a component that has up-to-date knowledge of the S1 or S2 solvers that can be used.\n\nTwo SOFAI Instances: Grid Navigation and Planning To show the versatility of the SOFAI architecture, we applied it to two diverse decision-making environments. In one scenario, it is used to navigate a constrained grid, generating trajectories incrementally by selecting one move at a time to reach an unknown goal. In another scenario, SOFAI addresses planning problems by producing an entire sequence of actions in a single step to achieve a specific goal. SOFAI for grid navigation. This instance of SOFAI aims to find a sequence of moves\u2014a trajectory\u2014in a grid from an initial state to an unknown goal state. The grid has constraints over both states and moves. When a move violates a constraint (either because there is a constraint on the move itself or on the state where the move ends up), a penalty is given to the agent.34 The SOFAI agents know the current state in the grid but do not know the constraints or the position of the goal state and therefore must learn them from trial and error.2 The aim is to find trajectories that have a small accumulated penalty (a proxy for the quality of the trajectory) while also minimizing the number of steps (a proxy for the time to generate the trajectory). For this SOFAI instance, we have chosen an S2 solver based on the so-called multi-attribute decision field theory (MDFT) model,24,30 which has been shown to generate human-like decisions. This is a well-known decision-making model designed to capture how humans choose one out of many options, also taking into account human irrational behavior, in light of the options\u2019 attributes and uncertainty. In our case, we have up to eight options (all the moves available in a given state) and two attributes for each option, whose scores represent, respectively, how likely the move is to bring us closer to the goal quickly (that is, in an imaginary unconstrained grid) and safely (that is, respecting all constraints in the grid). Attributes\u2019 scores are generated during an initial reinforcement learning phase. As for the S1 solver, we have chosen a simple agent that, given past trajectories (including their length, time, and penalty) for each state, chooses the action that maximizes the expected reward. For the MC agent, we use all three MC types: learning, reflective, and real-time. For real-time MC, both phase 1 and phase 2 are used, since we are not dealing with a problem that needs \u201ccorrect\u201d solutions but rather with trajectories that can accumulate different levels of penalties, and we are not trying to solve an optimization problem. In phase 2, the gain in reward is compared with the cost of using S2. The gain in reward is computed as the difference between the expected reward of reaching the goal from a given state using only S2 and the expected reward of reaching the goal using either solver (this is done by considering the actions computed only using S2 and, on the other side, considering all the stored actions no matter which solver was adopted); the delta is normalized to make it comparable with the cost. The cost of using S2 is calculated as the ratio of S2\u2019s average action computation time to the remaining time available to reach the goal, adjusted by a factor determined during the reflection stage. The learning stage is performed every time a trajectory successfully reaches the goal state. In this stage, for each state in the trajectory, the MC agent updates information regarding what action has been taken, the penalty (if any), the landing state, the time taken to compute the action, and which system has been used to compute the action. In our experiments, S1 is not retrained; it computes the action that maximizes expected reward each time. The reported time includes the duration required to query models and retrieve the information needed to determine the best action. The reflection stage is performed each time a group of n trajectories is completed. During this stage, the MC agent considers the last p% stored trajectories and for each trajectory where the agent employed S1 at least one time to compute an action, the agent \u201creflects\u201d on the trajectory. The trajectory is preserved up to the first state where S1\u2019s action is used. From that state onward, the MC agent rebuilds the trajectory using only S2. During the reflection stage, the original and new trajectories are compared, and the difference in accumulated rewards is calculated and normalized to the range [0,1]. A value close to 1 means that during the reflection stage, the adoption of only S2 allows for better performance. This factor is used in phase 2 of real-time MC to push the agent to adopt the slow solver for more time if needed. We tried different values for n and p; here, we report results for n = 25 and p = 20%. Figure 1 and Table 1 show SOFAI\u2019s behavior, averaged over 10 different grids. In Figure 1, the x axis shows the number of trajectories already generated over time, while the y axis shows the percentage of usage of S1 (orange) or S2 (blue) solvers in making the moves for each trajectory. We can see that, while in the first trajectories, SOFAI uses S2 and S1 in alternating proportions, after about 150 trajectories S1 is consistently used more than S2. The alternating behavior in the first 150 trajectories is due to the reflective MC mechanism, where the simulated S2-only trajectories push SOFAI to use S2 more, and in the next phase S1 more, until there is enough exploration that S2 is less and less needed. In this experiment, each reflection stage includes 25 trajectories. Similar to humans, SOFAI starts with no experience of the problem, uses mostly S2 at the beginning, then mixes the use of S1 and S2 for a while, also using reflective counter-factual reasoning, until it accumulates enough experience that the use of S2 can be greatly reduced. Figure 1. The average percentage of use of S1 and S2 solvers to build a trajectory. Solver Length Reward Time S1 21.55 (33.29) -621.68 (891.34) 26.28 (110.19) S2 11.47 (16.25) -208.07 (436.69) 235.84 (337.64) SOFAI 16.31 (27.82) -156.37 (283.48) 99.61 (239.41) SOFAI behaves better than using S1 or S2 alone in all the considered criteria (length, reward, and time). This is shown in Table 1, which reports the average performance of the different solvers over 500 trajectories and 10 different grids. It can be noticed that SOFAI is always better than S1 alone compared with average reward and average length, while SOFAI is always better than S2 alone compared with average reward and average time. This is consistent with the fact that the SOFAI objective is to maximize reward while at the same time minimizing the number of violated constraints and amount of time used. The study explored the impact of using alternative S1 solvers with varying levels of randomness. While the original S1 solver consistently selects optimal moves, introducing randomness resulted in similar overall behaviors for SOFAI. Notably, SOFAI outperformed both standalone S1 and S2 solvers, though its skill-learning behavior diminished with increased randomness in the S1 solver. This demonstrates that SOFAI\u2019s metacognitive component effectively adapts to the capabilities of the S1 solver, adjusting its reliance to maintain high-quality decision making.\n\nSOFAI for planning. The second instance of SOFAI focuses on planning.9 In this case, the input of SOFAI is a description of a planning problem in the standard PDDL language (which describes the available actions and objects), the initial state, and the goal state. SOFAI aims to output a sequence of actions (from the available ones) that leads from the initial state to the goal state. We compare our approach with two well-known symbolic planners, FastDownward (FD)18 and LPG,13 which are employed as the SOFAI S2 solvers. As for the S1 solver, we employed an LLM capable of generating programming code, CodeT5,39 and fine-tuned it on planning problems,9,27 generating an S1 solver that we call Plansformer (PF).26 Using these S1 and S2 solvers, we considered several incarnations of SOFAI, each obtained by choosing specific S1 and S2 solvers. For this article, we present two SOFAI incarnations: SOFAI-PF-FD and SOFAI-PF-LPG. Both use Plansformer as their S1 solver. But SOFAI-PF-FD adopts the FD planner with lmstar(blind()) heuristics as S2. It aims to find solutions while also seeking optimality and is our baseline for solvers that do not rely heavily on local search and, consequently, produce reasonably sized solutions. SOFAI-PF-LPG instead uses LPG as the S2 solver. To evaluate these SOFAI incarnations, we employed six well-known classical planning benchmark domains: Blocksworld (BL), Briefcaseworld (BR), Ferry (FE), Gripper (Gr), Tower of Hanoi (TH), and Miconic (MI). Due to space limitations, we will not introduce the domains, directing interested readers to Seipp et al.35 All of the S1 and S2 solvers have a timeout of 60 seconds to solve an instance of the planning problems. These solvers are arbitrated by an MC agent. In this scenario, the MC agent adopts only the real-time MC, which follows the two-phase approach outlined earlier: Phase 1 evaluates the solution proposed by the S1 solver (Plansformer) through a plan-validation module that emulates the execution of the proposed plan and returns the ratio between satisfied goals and goals, called the plan correctness level. If the correctness is high enough (set to 1.0 if we only want correct plans satisfying all goals), the S1 proposed plan is adopted. Notice that here we are in a situation in which we want correct plans, not just any plan, so the MC agent never enters the second phase but instead activates the S2 planner if there is enough time. To make this time-related evaluation, the MC agent evaluates the \u201cdifficulty\u201d of the problem instance by taking into account the number of available actions, goals, fluents, and predicates and, by looking at the S2 behavior on similar previous instances, assessing whether the S2 solver has enough time to create a plan for it (since we give SOFAI a time limit to generate a plan). If so, the MC agent activates the available S2 planner and its generated plan is adopted. Otherwise, it returns the plan proposed by the S1 planner, if this meets the minimum correctness threshold. We ran different experiments to study how our approach behaves in the planning domains. Table 2 reports the performance of Plansformer (the LLM-based planner we use as the S1 solver), FD, LPG, and the two SOFAI incarnations that employ FD or LPG as S2 planners, on the six domain benchmarks. For each domain, we generated 100 instances. From these results, it can be seen that SOFAI is beneficial in all the three criteria, compared with Plansformer alone. This means that LLMs can be useful for planning purposes, but they need to be combined with symbolic planners to increase the quality of the generated plans. From Table 2 it can be seen that FD alone performs remarkably well on simpler instances, such as those in the Ferry and Miconic domains. In these cases, FD is already performing optimally. However, when the problem requires a substantial amount of time to find a solution\u2014as in the Blocksworld and Briefcaseworld domains\u2014FD fails to produce a solution within the available time. In such cases, combining FD with a faster solver significantly enhances the system\u2019s overall performance. On the other hand, SOFAI always outperforms LPG in terms of optimality. Moreover, an analysis of the average performance of different planners across all domains suggests that SOFAI-PF-LPG is the most effective model, not only in terms of the number of resolved plans but also, and more importantly, in terms of average optimality. This further supports the idea that combining a fast and a slow solver, mediated by metacognition, yields significant benefits. The study analyzed how problem complexity affects performance by testing SOFAI-PF-FD and a standalone FD planner on 700 Blocksworld instances with varying block counts. Figure 2 illustrates the results, where problems are sorted by the quantity of blocks (4\u201313) in an instance. SOFAI-PF-FD was allowed to produce partial solutions in cases where the FD planner\u2019s symbolic search couldn\u2019t solve within the time limit, highlighting the trade-off between completeness and utility in complex scenarios.

FD is faster on easy problems but slows significantly with increased difficulty, often timing out without a solution. Though slower on easy problems, SOFAI-PF-FD maintains stable performance regardless of complexity. In terms of correctness, FD either achieves perfect results or fails completely when timing out, while SOFAI-PF-FD consistently delivers near-perfect correctness. For more difficult problems, SOFAI-PF-FD provides quasi-correct solutions, outperforming FD, which frequently fails. Additionally, S1 planners using LLMs require extra time for training and fine-tuning, adding to the inference time for generating plans. This instance of SOFAI for planning problems is in line with other studies of the usefulness of LLMs for planning (for example, Hao et al17 and Kambhampati et al.21), where LLMs can quickly provide a possibly incorrect plan that needs to be validated and possibly requires the use of trusted (but usually slower) processes to generate a correct plan.\n\nDiscussion SOFAI extends the traditional LLM-Plan-Validate framework by introducing innovative strategies for AI-driven problem solving. It goes beyond generating heuristic (S1) plans validated by external solvers (S2) by incorporating a broader range of adaptive behaviors tailored to diverse problem contexts. SOFAI leverages metacognitive strategies, such as problem decomposition, early rejection of infeasible solutions, and adaptive switching between solution-generation strategies based on resource constraints or complexity. Unlike static heuristic-validation sequences in standard methods, SOFAI integrates diverse S1 processes, including refining initial LLM-generated plans with additional context or domain-specific heuristics. It can dynamically swap or combine LLMs with other heuristic generators, such as rule-based systems or predictive models, expanding the solution space. SOFAI selectively invokes solvers to preemptively address likely failure points, reducing computational overhead while enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency, flexibility, and improved solution quality across applications, including reinforcement learning, scheduling, and open-ended exploratory domains. This positions SOFAI as a transformative step in AI methodologies .\n\nConclusion and Further Work SOFAI is a multi-agent AI architecture inspired by the thinking fast and slow cognitive theory of human decision making. It integrates \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d solvers with a centralized metacognitive agent that selects solvers, reflects on past actions, and updates internal models. While solvers operate with limited task-specific information, the metacognitive component oversees solver selection, counterfactual reflection, and self-improvement. This design enables flexible neuro-symbolic AI integration, allowing solvers to be added or removed as needed. Experiments on grid navigation and planning demonstrate that SOFAI outperforms single-modality approaches in decision quality, resource efficiency, and adaptability, exhibiting human-like learning and resource optimization over time. SOFAI is currently being extended to allow the S1 and S2 solvers to complement each other, instead of solving the same problem in two different ways. This can be very useful when some parts of the problem-solving process can be done better by a symbolic approach, while others are better suited to a data-driven approach. A specific example of this scenario is the AlphaGeometry approach,38 where a symbolic theorem prover is used to prove geometry theorems, while a transformer-based solver is used to generate new theorem statements. Another example relates to LLMs\u2019 value alignment,31,32 where the LLM can play the role of the S1 solver while the S2 solvers, as well as additional S1 solvers, can provide value alignment information in the form of either explicit knowledge, to be used to further prompt the LLM, or implicit knowledge, with data that can be used for fine-tuning or RLHF approaches.16",

        "Published": "2025-07-02T17:31:55Z",
        "Summary": "This article discusses a lawsuit settlement between Paramount and President Trump. Tulane is not mentioned.",
        "Content": "Sign up for The Media Today, CJR\u2019s daily newsletter.\n\nLate last night, Paramount, the corporate parent of CBS News, agreed to pay Donald Trump $16 million to settle the president\u2019s lawsuit over the network\u2019s editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election. This agreement comes six months after ABC paid $15 million to Trump\u2019s foundation to end his suit over how George Stephanopoulos characterized the president\u2019s sexual assault of E. Jean Carroll. Taken together, these settlements represent a troubling compromise of editorial independence for two of the standard-bearers of American broadcast journalism.\n\nThere was nothing out of the ordinary about how 60 Minutes edited its interview with Harris, and Stephanopoulos\u2019s misstatement about the Carroll case was not substantive, making Trump\u2019s suits against each network utterly meritless. Nevertheless, both Paramount and ABC\u2019s corporate parent, Disney, agreed to pay up, largely out of a short-sighted bid to curry favor with the current administration.\n\nClayton Weimers, the head of Reporters Without Borders, called the Paramount settlement \u201cshameful\u201d in a statement that continued, \u201cA line is being drawn between the owners of American news media who are willing to stand up for press freedom and those who capitulate to the demands of the president. Today, Paramount\u2019s leaders chose to be on the wrong side of that dividing line, but they\u2019d be mistaken to believe appeasing Trump today will stop his attacks in the future.\u201d\n\nJameel Jaffer, the director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said, \u201cCalling these \u2018settlements\u2019 doesn\u2019t quite capture what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s more like surrender\u2014or even payoff.\u201d\n\nThe aim of ABC\u2019s settlement seemed to be about paving the way for a smoother relationship with the president during his second term, with an anonymous network executive telling CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter that \u201cthis problem needed to go away.\u201d For Paramount, the incentive appears to be financial: the media conglomerate is in the midst of an $8 billion merger with the film studio Skydance that is awaiting approval from the FCC. Last year, the chair of that agency, Brendan Carr, told Fox News that \u201cthe news distortion complaint over the 60 Minutes transcript is something that is likely to arise in the context of the FCC review of that transaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is different from the ABC case in the sense that there is a clearer sort of quid pro quo,\u201d says Seth Stern, the director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. \u201cThere\u2019s this merger that Paramount wants to happen, FCC approval is very much needed, and Trump\u2019s FCC chair, Brendan Carr, is an absolute political stooge and bootlicker. And I say that because he wears a golden bust of Donald Trump as a lapel pin.\u201d\n\nIn May, the appearance that the FCC was holding up the Paramount-Skydance merger because of Trump\u2019s suit against CBS led senators Ron Wyden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders to send a letter to Paramount CEO Shari Redstone cautioning her that \u201cUnder the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act.\u201d Paramount did not respond to that letter. After the apparent quid pro quo was made official, Senator Wyden doubled down on Bluesky, writing, \u201cParamount just paid Trump a bribe for merger approval. When Democrats retake power, I\u2019ll be first in line calling for federal charges. In the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court, today.\u201d\n\nSign up for CJR\u2019s daily email\n\nWhile a prosecutor in Delaware\u2014the state where Paramount is incorporated\u2014is unlikely to pursue such a charge, the company now faces a different legal challenge. The Freedom of the Press Foundation, a shareholder in Paramount, is considering filing a suit against Redstone and the rest of the company\u2019s board alleging that they violated their fiduciary duty to the company\u2019s shareholders by facilitating an illegal bribe. \u201cWe feel that the decision that was made to settle this patently unconstitutional lawsuit is an insult to the journalists of CBS, to the journalists of 60 Minutes, and it\u2019s an invitation to Trump to continue targeting other news outlets,\u201d said Brenna Frey, a lawyer representing the Freedom of the Press Foundation.\n\nIf successful, this suit would force Paramount\u2019s directors to pay damages to the company itself, though it faces an uncertain future in a Delaware court system that generally defers to corporate leaders. Ann Lipton, a business law scholar at the University of Colorado, Boulder, described the suit as \u201csomething of a Hail Mary.\u201d Christine Sautter, from Southern Methodist University, agreed that \u201cit is definitely an uphill battle.\u201d Still, she continued, \u201cI think you have to try. If you don\u2019t try, you never know.\u201d\n\nUsing this sort of litigation as a means of enforcing journalistic standards on Paramount is only a plausible strategy because of the consolidation of the broadcast news media into a handful of sprawling corporations. With Redstone and the rest of Paramount\u2019s board poised to personally earn tens of millions of dollars from the merger with Skydance, the integrity of CBS News was hardly a consideration.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything like this in the US,\u201d says Jaffer. \u201cSome people compare it to the McCarthy era, and I think there are similarities\u2014especially in the bullying from official power and the institutional surrender. But McCarthy was just a senator.\u201d Now it\u2019s the president of the United States doing the bullying. ABC and CBS may have allowed themselves to be pushed around, but if the free press is to persevere through the Trump era, the rest of the media must refuse to follow their example.\n\n(With additional reporting from Aida Alami.)",

        "Summary": "This article discusses the negative impact of proposed tax cuts on environmental justice funding. It highlights several Louisiana community organizations, including Concerned Citizens of St. John and Inclusive Louisiana, whose grants were terminated by the Trump administration.  Inclusive Louisiana specifically mentions the resignation of a research scientist from the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic due to being \"muzzled\" by the university president for her research on the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry. This portrayal casts Tulane in a negative light, suggesting it prioritizes relationships with these industries over academic freedom and environmental protection.",
        "Content": "The Republican-led House of Representatives is expected to vote Thursday on President Donald Trump\u2019s profoundly unpopular tax and spending bill. It has been called \u201cthe most regressive U.S. tax and budget law in at least the past four decades \u2014 and possibly ever,\u201d according to researchers at Yale University.\n\nTrump\u2019s christened it the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill,\u201d but it will cost the U.S. government $4.5 trillion to pay for massive tax benefits that overwhelmingly enrich big corporations and the wealthy by making draconian cuts to public spending and programs for everyone else. It also launches a frontal assault on environmental and climate justice.\n\nThe nonprofit law firm Earthjustice calls it \u201cthe worst environmental bill in U.S. history.\u201d\n\nThe fossil fuel industry has been aggressively lobbying on the bill, winning hand-outs as the chief executives of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Marathon, and other companies personally rake in millions of dollars from Trump\u2019s first wave of tax cuts. Among the pounds of flesh the bill extracts are key climate and environmental justice provisions enacted by Congress to protect public health, reduce pollution and harmful greenhouse gas emissions, and strengthen the ability of communities across the country to go head-to-head with petrochemical and oil and gas giants amid the worsening climate crisis.\n\nFor the people I met in Louisiana\u2019s rural communities and struggling inner-city neighborhoods last week, the expected toll of the Trump megabill is profoundly personal. They live in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country experiencing a double-whammy of fossil fuel and petrochemical pollution and climate devastation. They work in or are served by small local community-based organizations that received or hoped for grants from the federal government to support environmental and climate justice through programs established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in 2022 under President Joe Biden.\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nTheir grants were early targets of Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Over the course of four months, from February through May 2025, Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) terminated every environmental justice grant awarded by the agency, totaling nearly 800 grants. It is one part of Trump\u2019s all-out-assault on environmental justice and racial justice more broadly. As Nikole Hannah-Jones explains, Trump has initiated \u201cthe broadest and most significant assault on civil rights and racial integration in this country in more than a century.\u201d\n\nLawsuits have challenged the grant terminations \u2014 including a new class action launched last week, and courts across the country have repeatedly found the Trump administration\u2019s actions to be illegal. U.S. District Court Judge Adam Abelson wrote, in an opinion on June 17, that in canceling a group of environmental justice grants, \u201cprecisely because they are environmental justice programs,\u201d the \u201cEPA contends that it has authority to thumb its nose at Congress and refuse to comply with its directives.\u201d He ruled that EPA has no such authority.\n\nRepublicans are now trying to use the hopped-up, fast-tracked, and obnoxiously named \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d to either eliminate these programs entirely or, if that fails, permanently zero out their funds to help pay for Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy. If the effort to wipe out these programs is successful, the impact will be deadly, particularly as Trump and the Supreme Court simultaneously gut regulations and oversight of fossil fuel, petrochemical, and other major polluters.\n\nA current EPA employee confided with me anonymously that the result will surely be that more people get sick and die. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that couldn\u2019t happen,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way, scientifically, that there won\u2019t be an increase.\u201d Related Content\n\nConcerned Citizens of St. John\n\nAt 3 a.m. on May 14, Tish Taylor got the news of a lifetime. Phone calls and emails poured in, declaring, \u201cDenka is closing!\u201d\n\nFather and daughter, Robert and Tish Taylor, in the cemetary where generations of their family are buried in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, June 24, 2025. Antonia Juhasz\n\nTaylor, 61, has grown up in the shadow of the massive Denka petrochemical plant in St. John the Baptist Parish. She joined her father, Robert Taylor, in his decade-long effort organizing against Denka\u2019s toxic pollution. First, she felt pure elation that the plant could be shutting down, then disbelief. \u201cThis can\u2019t be real,\u201d she thought, \u201cbut it was wonderful.\u201d She immediately told her father, then went outside, smelled her flowers, and let the news sink in. \u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d she said to herself.\n\nIn 2016, Robert Taylor, now 84, founded Concerned Citizens of St. John, a small, feisty, and until recently all-volunteer community organization going head-to-head against Denka. Like many other similarly situated groups I meet in Louisiana, Concerned Citizens has been aided in its efforts by federal dollars (and had hoped to apply for more) that would be eliminated by the Trump tax bill. The money was working, making them better resourced and effective, and thus a larger threat to the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry and its political allies.\n\nThe Taylors live in Cancer Alley, an 85-mile stretch of communities along the Mississippi River congested with fossil fuel and petrochemical plants that are heavily concentrated in Black neighborhoods, their toxic emissions polluting the air and intensifying the climate crisis. St. John has the highest cancer risk in the nation from toxic air pollution at seven times the national rate.\n\nSt. John is home to a sprawling Marathon oil refinery that nearly encircles the graveyard where much of the Taylors\u2019 family is buried. There is the Evonik petrochemical plant and other facilities. But in 2018, EPA released data showing that 85 percent of the toxic air pollution in St. John can be traced to just one facility: the Denka Performance Elastomer plant, which uses chloroprene, a particularly toxic petrochemical derived from fossil fuels, to produce neoprene used in synthetic rubber production.\n\nStanding in her father\u2019s home, Tish Taylor shares photos with me of her mother who recently passed away after a long battle with cancer, and of her sister Raven, who has suffered decades of debilitating illness, experiencing three lumpectomies, the removal of her uterus, colon, and stomach, and a rare autoimmune disease, neuronal VGKC antibody syndrome. (Autoimmune disease has been linked to chemical exposure.) Tish\u2019s children and grandchildren suffer from respiratory ailments, including asthma.\n\nRobert Taylor has gained a good deal of recognition for his efforts against Denka. But he was still shocked when he received a phone call in 2021 from the administrator of the EPA, Michael Regan. The Biden administration had made environmental and climate justice a national priority, and Regan called to ask Taylor what he needed from the agency. \u201cI said, \u2018We desperately need to know what it is we\u2019re breathing,\u201d Taylor recalls. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re dying from it. We don\u2019t know what it is. We don\u2019t know how much it is. We need to have control. We need your help because the state is not working to help us.\u2019 And he said, \u2018I will work on that,\u2019 and he did exactly as he promised.\u201d Taylor also wanted regulation and enforcement to shut Denka down.\n\nInflation Reduction Act funding includes grants for community air monitoring, which has supported the Taylors\u2019 organizing efforts. The funding for that program, like virtually all environmental and climate justice grants through the Inflation Reduction Act, has been targeted for elimination under the Trump tax bill, according to an analysis by Evergreen Action.\n\nIn June 2023, the New Orleans-based nonprofit, Deep South Center for Environmental Justice received a federal grant through the air monitoring program and provided a two-year $82,000 subgrant to Concerned Citizens of St. John \u2014 a significant amount of money to the small organization. The Deep South Center explained that the grant would help build capacity of local partners that had already achieved some important milestones, but whose success in addressing \u201cendemic issues will only grow if they are well-resourced.\u201d\n\nConcerned Citizens continued to work with the Biden administration, which increased federal regulations on emissions from petrochemical plants, including Denka. The administration then sued Denka in 2023, charging that there was an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and welfare of nearby communities due to the unacceptably high cancer risk posed by its excessive emissions. Trump dropped the suit, with his administration issuing a press release stating: \u201cJustice Department Dismisses Suit Against Denka, Delivering on President Trump\u2019s Mandate to End Radical DEI Programs.\u201d\n\nOn March 28, Concerned Citizens of St. John issued its intent to continue the suit against Denka independently (one of many legal actions it has taken to curb the plant\u2019s emissions). Six weeks later, on May 13, Denka announced that the plant had been shut down and would not restart production, citing \u201ccost, production, and other challenges,\u201d including the pollution control equipment required by Biden-era regulations (which remain active), inflation, and unscheduled plant outages associated with severe weather events.\n\nTaylor tells me that he won\u2019t believe Denka is closing until the plant is closed. But he is cautiously optimistic. He points to his friend and ally, Larry Sorapuru, seated now at his side, the only local political official to support their efforts. Taylor says if Denka does follow through on its plan to fully shutter the plant, Concerned Citizens will be watching to ensure it does not leave an even bigger mess behind for the community to clean up.\n\nHe believes he has little choice. These facilities \u201care a serious threat to our survival here, and they proved that they didn\u2019t care whether we survived or not,\u201d Taylor says.\n\nDeep South Center for Environmental Justice\n\nDr. Beverly Wright founded the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in her native New Orleans in 1992. She is one of the foremost leading and foundational figures in the U.S. environmental justice movement.\n\nDr. Beverly Wright, New Orleans, Louisiana, June 25, 2025. Antonia Juhasz\n\nIn addition to the grant mentioned earlier, in 2023, the center also received a $13 million five-year grant to serve as an Environmental Justice Thriving Community Technical Assistance Center, one of sixteen groups selected nationally to receive a total of $177 million supported by the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant.\n\nThe $3 billion block grant alone \u201cis 80 times more than any federal investment in environmental justice in history,\u201d Chandra Taylor-Sawyer, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, told me in North Carolina last October. The tax bill would gut the entire block grant, rescinding all unobligated funds, according to an analysis by Evergreen Action.\n\nWith the award, the Deep South Center launched a Community Investment & Recovery Center. Its five-year plan was to assist 250 smaller local groups to build their capacity to apply for and hopefully receive federal and other sources of funding. The goal was to build a lasting, well-resourced movement of local frontline community-based organizations. One of the groups they hoped to support again was Concerned Citizens of St. John.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed educational and training tools so communities could speak for themselves to build leadership on the ground,\u201d Dr. Wright tells me, as we sit in her office in New Orleans East. The Deep South Center for Environmental Justice also focuses on research, but, Wright warns, \u201cIf data alone was all we needed to make change, we wouldn\u2019t have Cancer Alley. It takes data and advocacy, strong advocacy involvement in the political system so you can control who represents you.\u201d\n\nWhen DOGE started identifying grants to cut, technical assistance centers were at the top of the list. In his ruling finding certain environmental justice grant terminations illegal, Judge Adelson references a series of internal emails, including from a DOGE appointee (with a proclivity for exclamation points) to EPA: \u201cAs you can imagine, the DOGE team has lawyers that are pretty experienced with grant and contract cancellation at this point, so that\u2019s what that is based on!\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand why they took the [technical assistance centers] first,\u201d Dr. Wright says. \u201cThe last thing you want is an educated populace, which is what I learned in civics seventh grade.\u201d\n\nAnother early casualty was the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which Trump has been trying to claw back for months. The tax bill rescinds the entire program and all of its unobligated funds. The bill will also go after the funding of the $5 billion Climate Pollution Reduction Program.\n\nThe Deep South Center received the letter terminating its grant on February 21. \u201cI read that letter over and over again, and I got angrier and angrier. But my first response is, we\u2019re going to sue,\u201d Dr. Wright tells me. The organization is now a lead plaintiff in a new class action lawsuit challenging the legality of all EPA terminations of Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant recipients. Wright expects that the attempt by Congress to gut these programs in the tax bill will also result in legal action, at least, that\u2019s the plan.\n\nIn Louisiana alone, over a dozen environmental justice grants, worth approximately $70 million, were terminated in just the first round of 400 grants, including a grant to the St. James Parish-based Inclusive Louisiana.\n\nInclusive Louisiana\n\nCollectively, Gail LeBoeuf and Barbara Washington have gathered over one and half centuries of life in rural Louisiana between them. They have probably lost an equal number of friends, relatives, and neighbors to cancers and other diseases which they attribute to the pollution of the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry that took up residence within their communities well after each woman was born. Five years ago, they formed Inclusive Louisiana, a small nonprofit organization to support their efforts to hold the industry accountable and transition off of its operations.\n\nGail LeBoeuf and Barbara Washington, Inclusive Louisiana, Convent, St. James Parish, Louisiana. June 24, 2025. Antonia Juhasz\n\nThey received a $500,000 grant with local partner organizations Louisiana Bucket Brigade and Rural Roots. It was awarded through an Inflation Reduction Act Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program that provides financial assistance to organizations working to address local environmental or public health issues in their communities. On May 1, the Trump administration terminated their grant.\n\nTheir $500,000 project, named after their campaign, \u201cImagine St. James Parish,\u201d is modest given the stakes. It would help make local homes more habitable amid the climate crisis, funding a pilot project for weatherization, putting roofs on houses still draped with blue tarps four years after Hurricane Ida devastated the area; reduce energy bills; protect against worsening heat; and clean up dump sites that pose health and safety hazards, particularly in times of tornadoes, floods, and hurricanes.\n\nI meet LeBoeuf and Washington at the \u201cVillage Hub\u201d \u2014 the name they\u2019ve given to a squat yellow brick house purchased by Inclusive Louisiana in 2023 that serves as a community center for the small town of Convent in St. James Parish. Just across the street and on the other side of the levee, the Mississippi River makes its way through the neighborhood, tracing a line through Cancer Alley. Washington lives just one lane over on land originally purchased in 1874 by her great-great-great-grandmother Harriet Jones, who had formerly been enslaved at a nearby plantation.\n\nLeBoeuf is hunched over her hands, visibly tired, and impatient when I arrive. In 2023, at the age of 72, she was diagnosed with liver cancer for which she receives regular chemotherapy.\n\nIn a 2003 report, the National Academy of Public Administration found that cancer rates in Cancer Alley were significantly higher than in the rest of Louisiana and in the nation as a whole. It also found that Black residents had significantly higher rates of cancer and mortality than did white residents. A 2022 study found that from 2019 to 2021, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality permitted industrial emissions of pollution that were seven- to 21-times higher among Black communities than in predominantly white communities in Louisiana.\n\nLeBoeuf doesn\u2019t like to talk about her illness. She prefers to focus on the work that Inclusive is doing and the change they\u2019re trying to create. But she admits that the chemo is hard and there are good days and bad days. This is a bad day. She fans out her hands before me and says, \u201cwe call it alligator skin.\u201d When I ask what that is, she replies, \u201chaven\u2019t you ever seen an alligator?\u201d Her skin is thick, blotchy, and scaly.\n\nGail LeBoeuf of Inclusive Louisiana shares what she describes as \u201calligator hands,\u201d the result of chemotherapy. Convent, St. James Parish, Louisiana. June 24, 2025. Antonia Juhasz\n\nInclusive is small, but along with many allied groups across Cancer Alley, such as Rise St. James, they\u2019ve collectively scored significant wins, beating back the Formosa petrochemical plant, an expansion by Koch industries, new industrial operations in St. John, and in their ongoing fight to impose a full moratorium on any new fossil fuel or petrochemical operations in St. James Parish. The victories are sweet but also make them and their allies targets, the women argue.\n\nWashington and LeBoeuf firmly believe that the industry and the government (local, state, and federal) want them gone. \u201cThey just want to phase out the residents here and just have petrochemical plants here,\u201d Washington says.\n\nThe women cite the recent resignation of a leading ally, research scientist Kimberly Terrell, who resigned in protest from the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic after being muzzled, she says, by the university\u2019s president due to her extensive research exposing myriad harms and inequalities of the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry in Louisiana.\n\n\u201cThe petrochemical industry and our captured politicians hate the law clinic because we\u2019re winning and they hate that,\u201d Anne Rolfes, Executive Director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade, tells me.\n\n\u201cThey want you to leave. They want you to be disgusted and not know where to go, what to do, how to do it. All those things work for them,\u201d adds LeBoeuf. \u201cWe are imagining the right to clean air, clean water, the things that will make people want to stay and come back, and that doesn\u2019t work for them.\u201d\n\nThe Hollygrove-Dixon Neighborhood Association\n\nAbout $2 billion of the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant funded Community Change Grants advancing local community-driven projects that address climate challenges and reduce pollution. These grants were not announced until December 2024, leaving much of the funding not yet obligated and at risk of being gutted by the tax bill.\n\nThe EPA received approximately 2,700 applications, totaling over $40 billion in requested funds and nearly 2,500 requests for technical assistance under the program. The Hollygrove-Dixon Neighborhood Association in central New Orleans had hoped to be one of those recipients.\n\nRaymond Sweet is the Climate Coordinator for the Hollygrove-Dixon Neighborhood Association. Hollygrove-Dixon is a low-income community of color sandwiched between several crisscrossing highways and major thoroughfares. I meet Sweet at the Life Transformation Community Center, which has as its backyard the busy Airline Highway.\n\nThe association is one of six community-based organizations that jointly submitted an application with the Water Wise Gulf South nonprofit organization for a $15 million grant to expand its popular climate mitigation effort (recently featured in The New York Times). The last they\u2019d heard from EPA was that the grant was under consideration. That was before Trump\u2019s terminations began and before his tax bill threatened to gut the entire program.\n\nWhen I arrive at the community center, a youth program is underway, preparing to head out into the neighborhood to learn about local environmental stewardship. I join a group of Black women taking part in a senior program and the conversation quickly turns to flooding, as the women whip out their phones to share pictures and stories. The rains, they explain, are coming more often, heavier, the streets are continually flooding, and it is getting worse.\n\n\u201cIt just seems the rain is different,\u201d says Glenda Davis, 70, a life-long Hollygrove-Dixon resident. \u201cIt comes down really heavy for an hour and our drainage systems cannot handle what\u2019s been happening. So, I kind of stay in my house so I don\u2019t have to deal with it.\u201d\n\nRaymond Sweet, Hollygrove-Dixon Neighborhood Association, New Orleans, Louisiana, June 26, 2025. Antonia Juhasz\n\nThe actions of the fossil fuel industry are driving the climate crisis, bringing more frequent and severe storms and rising seas. \u201cClimate change makes the roads and infrastructure decay and get brittle,\u201d Sweet explains. Add neglect and a lack of resources for repairs, and even a simple rain can result in debilitating flooding, not only of the neighborhood streets, but also of the highway, which serves as a crucial evacuation route for the city residents, he adds.\n\nSweet had high hopes for his small portion of the $15 million grant, which would expand efforts already underway to implement simple, low-cost, and efficient climate adaptation techniques utilizing nature-based projects to help reduce flooding. This includes increasing green and soil space and planting trees to naturally absorb water and creating clear routes for water to flow into storm drains. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen what we can do with little to no money,\u201d Sweet says.

Tulane University Law School professor Ann Lipton is quoted, providing neutral legal commentary on the settlement. While the article discusses a controversial topic, Tulane's involvement is neutral and purely academic.",
        "Content": "On June 7, months into Paramount\u2019s negotiations to settle a $20 billion lawsuit over CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, President Trump was spotted ringside at an UFC event in Newark, New Jersey. All the usual suspects came to greet him, including Marco Rubio, Mike Tyson and Joe Rogan. So did Hunter Campbell, UFC president Dana White\u2019s lieutenant who later brokered a meeting for Skydance CEO David Ellison to talk with Trump.\n\nJust a few feet away from the ring, Ellison bowed his head to hear Trump as the announcer blared introductions for the bout\u2019s fighters. Campbell, sandwiched between the two, wrapped his arms around both of their shoulders, his head swiveling as he acted like something of a conduit for the back-and-forth. At one point, he gave up his seat to allow for a second round of talks that ended with Ellison extending his arm for a handshake with Trump, who appeared to accept the olive branch.\n\nSince then, chatter has swirled that the informal meeting juiced talks to greenlight Skydance\u2019s pending merger with Paramount by finding an acceptable framework for a settlement of Trump\u2019s lawsuit. Such are the new rules of media in this regime: Everything starts and ends with Trump; everything goes through him.\n\nLess than two weeks after the discussion, Trump signaled support for Ellison\u2019s takeover of Paramount. When asked about the deal and whether he believes that it\u2019ll be resolved soon, he replied: \u201cI hope so.\u201d\n\n\u201cEllison\u2019s great,\u201d Trump added. \u201cHe\u2019ll do a great job with it.\u201d\n\nThe settlement came to pass late on July 1 when Paramount announced a $16 million deal to resolve the lawsuit. It involves an agreement from the company, which will not apologize, to release 60 Minutes transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates after they\u2019ve aired, according to a statement from the company.\n\nAnd with the deal, a pathway to approval of Paramount\u2019s sink-or-swim merger with Skydance has emerged. It shines a spotlight on the power that Trump wields over dealmaking and regulatory matters in decisions with the potential to transform the long-term trajectory of a company. Media execs are on notice: Jeff Bezos revamped The Washington Post\u2018s opinion section to bring it more in line with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Wall Street Journal; Bob Iger allowed ABC News\u2019 settlement of a defamation lawsuit from Trump, reported The New York Times; Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong shifted the paper\u2019s strategy to increasingly platform conservative views.\n\n\u201cParamount\u2019s spineless decision to settle Trump\u2019s baseless and patently unconstitutional lawsuit is an insult to the journalists of 60 Minutes and an invitation to Trump to continue targeting other news outlets,\u201d says Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. \u201cEach time a company cowers and surrenders to Trump\u2019s demands, [it] only emboldens him to do it again.\u201d\n\nYes, there will be legal blowback. The Freedom of the Press Foundation, represented by prominent Washington litigator Abbe David Lowell, sent to Paramount on Wednesday a demand for information related to its decision to settle, with plans to file a lawsuit on behalf of investors against controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and the board. Related are potential investigations by lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren into whether Paramount violated anti-bribery laws, though there\u2019s skepticism about how those legal actions will fare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to say abstractly that this was a bribe,\u201d says Ann Lipton, professor of business law at Tulane University Law School. \u201cPeople settle frivolous lawsuits to get rid of them all the time.\u201d\n\nThat line of argument was echoed by Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks at a shareholder meeting Wednesday. \u201cCompanies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Trump loyalists at the head of various regulatory agencies, expect more of the same. Any green light from the FCC, FTC or DOJ in deals being reviewed will likely involve concessions. That includes new Paramount, which may have to agree to promote more conservative perspectives moving forward for the FCC to approve transferal of broadcast licenses.\n\nThat tactic, designed to stymie what the Trump administration considers political bias in corporate America and mainstream outlets, was seen last month in a consent decree from advertising giants Omnicom and IPG with the FTC to get their $13 billion megamerger across the finish line. In a highly unusual move weaponizing antitrust laws to regulate private companies\u2019 business choices and free speech rights, the FTC conditioned approval of the transaction on an agreement not to boycott media platforms because of their political content. The deal came after the FTC opened an investigation into whether advertisers and watchdog groups conspired to withhold advertising money from platforms and websites with conservative leanings.\n\n\u201cCoordination among advertising agencies to suppress advertising spending on publications with disfavored political or ideological viewpoints threatens to distort not only competition between ad agencies, but also public discussion and debate,\u201d Daniel Guarnera, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.\n\nThe likes of Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney and Comcast \u2014 all of which have significant media holdings \u2014 could choose to forgo dealmaking for the remainder of Trump\u2019s term, but it\u2019s uncertain if that\u2019s an option. NBCUniversal (MSNBC, CNBC) and WBD (CNN) are currently racing to offload their ailing linear TV channels, which could require some kind of regulatory approval to ensure compliance with licensing regimes. It remains to be seen whether the FCC and SEC plant their flags over those transactions.\n\nIn this regime, there\u2019s immense value in having a direct line to Trump or knowing someone who does. Exhibit A: In the weeks leading up to the election, tech C-suites cozied up to Trump, who fielded calls from Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, as detailed by The Wall Street Journal. Around that time, WBD CEO David Zaslav and Elon Musk were seen sitting next to each other at the U.S. Open. By their thinking, why should they go through Justice Department antitrust division chief Gail Slater, who continues to pursue antitrust cases against Google and Apple, when they can go straight to the person who appointed \u2014 and can fire \u2014 her?\n\nNotably, Ellison\u2019s father, Oracle scion Larry Ellison, is believed to be the mogul closest to Trump. Earlier this year, he was front and center at the White House for an announcement of a project to build artificial intelligence data centers. And when asked if Musk could buy TikTok, Trump replied, \u201cI\u2019d like Larry to buy it too.\u201d The elder Ellison, who in 2020 hosted a fundraiser for Trump at his golf course in Southern California and later sat in on a transition meeting at Mar-a-Lago, put up most of the $8 billion bid to buy Paramount.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of federal funding for public broadcasters, like NPR and PBS. Trump is maneuvering to slash $1.1 billion for the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funnels money to more than 1,500 public television and radio stations across the country. If he succeeds, mass layoffs and show cancellations could follow.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has amassed a $31 million fund for his presidential library between settlements with ABC News and Paramount. That figure balloons to $53 million when accounting for a deal with Meta to resolve a lawsuit over the suspension of his account; it remains unknown where the money from X\u2019s $10 million settlement is going.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s legal team, those funds were well earned. \u201cWith this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,\u201d they said in a statement.",

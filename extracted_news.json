Recuerdo verlo por la tele sin saber qu\u00e9 hacer. Yo era un cr\u00edo, pero recuerdo que nadie hablaba de otra cosa. Me estoy refiriendo al desastre del Prestige, que llen\u00f3 las costas gallegas de chapapote y fue considerado una de las cat\u00e1strofes medioambientales m\u00e1s costosas de la historia. Desde entonces, toda una generaci\u00f3n mir\u00f3 con otros ojos los combustibles f\u00f3siles.\n\nLa primera vez que son\u00f3 el nombre de Lisa Jackson en mi tele yo ya era mayor. Fue algunos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de lo del Prestige. Pero la fiereza con la que hablaba me trajo el recuerdo de familiares gritando de rabia por el vertido del petrolero. Cuando Lisa Jackson se uni\u00f3 a Apple en 2013, la compa\u00f1\u00eda de la manzana arrastraba una reputaci\u00f3n medioambiental, cuando menos, mejorable. Su fichaje ten\u00eda que significar algo. Ahora s\u00e9 hasta qu\u00e9 punto.\n\nQui\u00e9n es Lisa Jackson\n\nLisa Perez Jackson es la primera mujer afroamericana en entrar en a Agencia de Protecci\u00f3n Ambiental de los Estados Unidos (EPA). Esta ingeniera qu\u00edmica, pas\u00f3 de trabajar con el gobernador de Nueva Jersey a hacerlo con el mism\u00edsimo presidente de EEUU. En diciembre de 2008, Barak Obama la nomin\u00f3 para su equipo.\n\nDe su boca salieron las palabras m\u00e1gicas: el di\u00f3xido de carbono y otros cinco gases de efecto invernadero son una amenaza para la salud p\u00fablica. Esto marc\u00f3 el inicio de una campa\u00f1a para frenar los gases de efecto invernadero. Y Lisa Jackson no es Greta Thunberg; abandonada en uno de los barrios m\u00e1s peligrosos de Filadelfia, fue adoptada y criada por una familia de Nueva Orleans.\n\nMuy pronto despunt\u00f3 en matem\u00e1ticas, tanto que le concedieron la beca nacional que le permiti\u00f3 asistir a la Universidad de Tulane. Su decano le inspir\u00f3 a estudiar una ingenier\u00eda qu\u00edmica y se gradu\u00f3 con honores. Jackson obtuvo una Maestr\u00eda en Ciencias en la Universidad de Princeton. Poco despu\u00e9s, su familia sufri\u00f3 el azote del hurac\u00e1n Katrina.\n\nParec\u00eda marcada. Una vez subi\u00f3 a los estrados, durante un lustro fue el \"incordio\" de las petroleras y la industria del carb\u00f3n, hasta su renuncia, tras una hist\u00f3rica auditor\u00eda. Apenas seis meses despu\u00e9s se convert\u00eda en la vicepresidente de Medio Ambiente, Pol\u00edticas e Iniciativas Sociales de Apple. Ella reporta directamente a Tim Cook. Y es solo un rostro. Su equipo est\u00e1 orquestando una de las transformaciones sostenibles m\u00e1s ambiciosas en el mundo corporativo.\n\nPara que nos hagamos una idea r\u00e1pida: bajo su mandato se han dado estos pasos que para muchas otras empresas del sector son entelequias:\n\nEnerg\u00eda 100% renovable (desde 2018). Apple alcanz\u00f3 en 2018 el uso de energ\u00eda 100% renovable en todas sus oficinas, tiendas y centros de datos en el mundo, incluyendo proveedores asociados. Programa de reciclaje y robot Daisy (2016\u20132024). En 2016 Apple present\u00f3 Liam, su primer robot de desmontaje de iPhones, reemplazado en 2018 por Daisy, que permite recuperar metales valiosos como el cobalto, el oro o el tungsteno. En 2024 se ampli\u00f3 con Taz, centrado en materiales m\u00e1s finos y raros. Es \u00fanico en el mundo. Carbono neutro para 2030 (anunciado en 2020). Apple se comprometi\u00f3 a que toda su cadena de suministro y productos sean neutrales en carbono para 2030. Es decir, compensar hasta restar a cero emisiones, lo que implica redise\u00f1ar procesos, materiales y log\u00edstica para reducir emisiones de alcance 1, 2 y 3. Materiales reciclados y dise\u00f1os circulares (2021\u20132025). Desde el iPhone 12 hasta el Apple Watch Series 9, Apple ha incrementado el uso de aluminio reciclado, esta\u00f1o, tierras raras y otros componentes reciclados en todos sus productos. En 2023, algunos modelos ya usan aluminio 100% reciclado. A cambio, nos quedamos sin cargador ni auriculares. Primer producto \"neutro en carbono\" (2023). Con el Apple Watch Series 9 y SE de 2023, Apple lanz\u00f3 sus primeros productos etiquetados como \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d, cumpliendo con un nuevo est\u00e1ndar ambiental validado externamente. Incluyen empaques sin pl\u00e1stico y log\u00edstica mar\u00edtima para reducir huella.\n\nDe los desaf\u00edos de la EPA a la llamada de Cupertino\n\n\"En la EPA, aprendes que los problemas ambientales son complejos y requieren soluciones colaborativas, basadas en la ciencia\", dec\u00eda Jackson en una entrevista con Grist en 2014. Su salida, descrita como \"dolores de cabeza pol\u00edticos\", la llev\u00f3 a Apple con el fin de hacer que sus decisiones tuvieran impactos reales y directos sobre la gente.\n\nTim Cook, a diferencia de Steve Jobs, ten\u00eda intereses real en mejorar el impacto ambiental de Apple, justo en una \u00e9poca donde la criticaban por su dependencia del carb\u00f3n para sus centros de datos \u2014y la opacidad de su cadena de suministro en China\u2014. Al parecer, la primera pregunta de Cook a Jackson fue reveladora de su intenci\u00f3n: \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 est\u00e1 haciendo Apple mal? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 bien? \u00bfC\u00f3mo podemos mejorar?\".\n\nDesde entonces, la transformaci\u00f3n verde ha sido real. La producci\u00f3n industrial de Apple se ha multiplicado por tres desde 2015. Sin embargo, sus emisiones se han reducido en un 60% y esperan que en 2030 el 75 % de su huella de carbono haya desaparecido.\n\nEn Brasil, Apple invirti\u00f3 para restaurar m\u00e1s de 10.000 hect\u00e1reas de tierras degradada \u2014casi el doble del tama\u00f1o de Manhattan\u2014. En China lanzaron un fondo de inversi\u00f3n de 99,3 millones de d\u00f3lares, que en realidad es su segundo Fondo de Energ\u00eda Limpia, con el fin de lograr la neutralidad de carbono en toda la cadena de producci\u00f3n. Y en Segovia est\u00e1n invirtiendo para crear el parque de paneles solares m\u00e1s grande del pa\u00eds.\n\nEn una entrevista para Inc fue bastante directa con sus detractores: \"hagan ciencia\". Y en cuanto al lugar de Apple en el mundo, entiende el crecimiento de la marca pero no a cualquier precio. Si todos juegan con las mismas cartas, en aras de la equidad y la justicia econ\u00f3mica, se podr\u00e1 \"nivelar el campo de juego\". Un dardo directo a aquellas empresas que no cumplen con los mandatos gubernamentales en materia de sostenibilidad ecol\u00f3gica. Tal y como indic\u00f3 en la charla del Fortune Brainstorm Green:\n\nMire, si todos los profesionales de la sostenibilidad tenemos que recurrir a \"fabricar y vender menos productos\" como soluci\u00f3n al problema, entonces sufrimos de una extraordinaria falta de imaginaci\u00f3n. Y de innovaci\u00f3n. Una de las cosas que su empresa \u2014y creo que Apple\u2014 se propone es comprender d\u00f3nde se encuentran las innovaciones tecnol\u00f3gicas y de otro tipo que nos ayudan a reducir la intensidad de carbono. No abogamos por que menos personas tengan acceso a nuestros productos. Esa no es la soluci\u00f3n que buscamos.\n\nEn suma, algunos de los cambios m\u00e1s radicales que ha asumido Apple en sus casi 50 a\u00f1os de historia provienen de la batuta de Lisa Jackson. Ha instado a inversiones gargantuescas en programas de agua limpia, granjas solares y proyectos e\u00f3licos, y ha impulsado a sus proveedores a hacer lo mismo.\n\nSu equipo tiene un \u00e1rea dedicada a la eliminaci\u00f3n de sustancias t\u00f3xicas como el PVC y los BFRs de los productos de Apple. \"Sab\u00edamos que mucha gente quemaba cables para llegar al cobre interior. Esa es una situaci\u00f3n realmente peligrosa desde una perspectiva de salud\", aunque las malas lenguas incidieron en que este solo era un movimiento para contentar a Greenpeace. La creaci\u00f3n de una cadena de suministro de ciclo cerrado tambi\u00e9n fue cosa de ella y actualmente trabajan en m\u00e9todos de fundici\u00f3n de aluminio libres de carbono.\n\nDe los pastos verdes a la pluralidad de voces\n\nSus \u00faltimos pasos han orbitado hacia otras \u00e1reas. En 2020 lanzaron una iniciativa de equidad y justicia racial de 100 millones de d\u00f3lares. Unos cambios que, seg\u00fan la propia palabra de Tim Cook, \"afectar\u00e1n a casi todo lo que hacemos\". Al a\u00f1o siguiente invirtieron otra cantidad similar. No en vano, Apple realiza cada cierto tiempo auditor\u00edas, internas y externas, para medir la paridad de sexo y etnia en sus equipos, con el fin de garantizar una pluralidad real.\n\nEn 2021 fue considerada una de las 50 mujeres m\u00e1s importante del mundo, debutando en el n\u00famero 33. Y lo que pas\u00f3 a su familia con el Katrina sigue siendo el baremo con el que mide prioridades: \"Lo cierto es que no podemos proteger el medio ambiente a menos que tambi\u00e9n protejamos a las comunidades m\u00e1s vulnerables\". Y ojo, Apple alcanz\u00f3 la equidad salarial total en 2017.\n\nDurante el segundo mandato de Donald Trump, una de las patatas calientes giraba en torno al debate de la transexualidad. En este contexto de creciente presi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y social sobre los programas de Diversidad, Equidad e Inclusi\u00f3n (DEI), Apple dej\u00f3 claro que estos valores son inamovibles, son su ADN. Durante su junta anual de accionistas en febrero de 2025, una propuesta del Centro Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n de Pol\u00edticas P\u00fablicas \u2014que instaba a eliminar las iniciativas DEI por supuestos riesgos legales y reputacionales\u2014 fue rechazada rotundamente.\n\nLos m\u00e1s conservadores se sorprendieron. Pero Apple implement\u00f3 la Iniciativa de Equidad y Justicia Racial (REJI), que promueve oportunidades para comunidades subrepresentadas en \u00e1reas clave como educaci\u00f3n y justicia. Un ejemplo tangible es la Apple Developer Academy en Detroit, que capacita cada a\u00f1o a cientos de j\u00f3venes en programaci\u00f3n, dise\u00f1o y emprendimiento.\n\nLa pr\u00f3xima vez que escuches hablar de Lisa Jackson \u2014no la escritora, sino la dama de Apple\u2014, ya sabes: es un hueso duro de roer. Satisface saber que perfiles as\u00ed est\u00e9n al cargo de roles tan importantes dentro de Apple.\n\nEn Applesfera | Carga infinita para tu iPhone: la Universidad de Oxford ha creado una pel\u00edcula de perovskita tan fina que convierte cualquier objeto en un panel solar\n\nEn Applesfera | El pueblo de Segovia con 200 habitantes que esconde una gran inversi\u00f3n de Apple", "Summary": "This article profiles Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives.

This vision promises energy independence, economic prosperity, and national security. Yet, entrenched anti-prosperity bureaucrats, timid politicians, and a misinformed public, swayed by decades of anti-nuclear propaganda, stand ready to obstruct this transformative agenda. America must address these obstacles in order to reclaim its leadership in the field of nuclear energy.\n\nOverhaul of the Nuclear Overseers\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which was formed after the dismemberment of the Atomic Energy Commission, has long served as a choke point for nuclear progress. The NRC was designed from the get-go to follow the agenda of anti-nuclear advocates, and consequently, it has licensed only two reactors since 1978, stifling innovation. Trump\u2019s orders demand a sweeping overhaul, capping exorbitant NRC fees and mandating licensing decisions within eighteen months. This aggressive reform dismantles barriers, but bureaucrats accustomed to sluggish processes will resist, clinging to technologically outdated risk-averse frameworks.\n\nAmerica\u2019s existing nuclear fleet\u2014light water and pressurized water reactors\u2014boasts the best safety record of any industry in America. Advanced nuclear designs, like small modular reactors, microreactors and Generation IV systems, push safety even further, with designs able to operate reliably even without human intervention. Trump\u2019s orders prioritize the deployment of these advanced designs, targeting five gigawatts of \u201cpower uprates\u201d (increasing the electricity output of existing reactors) and ten large new reactors by 2030. Yet, detractors will cry \u201cimpossible,\u201d and claim that government staff reductions, as ordered for the NRC, will compromise safety. In reality, NRC had more than enough staff and time to address a legitimate petition involving safety with respect to cooling spent nuclear fuel pools, choosing to instead to deny it. Given this track record, the public interest will be better served by a leaner and more focused regulator that puts the onus of safety and liability squarely on the industry.\n\nTurning Mislabeled \u201cWaste\u201d into Energy to Make Nuclear \u201cRenewable\u201d\n\nDecades of misinformation have mislabeled partially used nuclear fuel as \u201cwaste.\u201d In reality, this stockpile, mischaracterized during the Carter administration, holds trillions of dollars in potential energy if converted to electricity. Experts have long argued that this \u201cwaste\u201d could provide America with clean, carbon-free electricity for hundreds of years.\n\nThe concept of recycling partially used nuclear fuel was recommended to the Biden Administration\u2019s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on multiple occasions, yet that administration took no action. Trump\u2019s orders have established a motivated plan to process this partially used fuel for advanced reactors, which will release this vast, hidden taxpayer asset value while reducing foreign dependency. The challenge will be overcoming the government bureaucracy\u2019s previous \u201cbuild back better\u201d mindset that only wind and solar are \u201crenewable.\u201d\n\nNew Nuclear Test Sites and a New Nuclear Workforce\n\nThe Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) nuclear testing, centered at national labs like Idaho National Laboratory, is facing scrutiny for slow resolutions. Trump\u2019s orders demand a cultural shift by establishing test sites outside labs by July 4, 2026, and ensuring reactors are operational within two years. This urgency will spark competition in the electric power sector, breaking monopolistic inertia. Still, the national lab system\u2019s sluggish reputation could hinder progress unless private sector efficiency drives the process.\n\nA robust nuclear workforce is critical. The US \u201cNuclear Navy\u201d offers a model for rapidly training top-tier nuclear personnel. Trump\u2019s call for private sector-led apprenticeships and education programs mirrors this approach. By empowering industry over government, America can build a top-tier workforce swiftly, fueling reactor deployment and economic growth.\n\nThe Crossroads of Energy Security and National Security\n\nImportantly, even more importantly the executive orders bolster national security by designating nuclear-powered AI data centers and military bases as critical infrastructure. By deploying advanced reactors at DOE and Department of Defense (DOD) sites by 2028 and securing twenty new nuclear export agreements, the U.S. can lead globally. However, anti-nuclear advocates, steeped in decades of fearmongering, will push back by attempting to delay export deals and domestic progress.\n\nTrump\u2019s nuclear revolution is not just a policy shift, it\u2019s a call to action. America stands at a crossroads: embrace advanced nuclear power for affordable, abundant energy or succumb to the inertia of bureaucrats and misinformation. Only one of those roads leads to prosperity and energy security, and America must take it.\n\nAbout the Authors: Tommy Waller and Douglas Ellsworth\n\nLt. Col.

The wildfires would eventually destroy more than 37,000 acres of Southern California and leave 30 people dead, stopping just 10 blocks short of the day laborer worker center, which became, in the words of Cal Soto of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), \u200b\u201ca community response center \u2014 or a resiliency hub, as we call it.\u201d Volunteers came to the center for masks, coveralls, goggles and gloves to protect them from potentially toxic ash, as well as for training and support to safely join the efforts. \u200b\u201cThe day laborers and domestic workers who were members there started organizing these cleanup brigades,\u201d Soto said, \u200b\u201cto try to remove debris from the streets.\u201d The rapid response by day laborers, most of them immigrants, would be familiar to anyone who\u2019s lived through a wildfire, hurricane, tornado or other disaster in the past couple of decades. After Hurricane Sandy in New York in 2012, or Katrina in New Orleans 20 years ago this autumn, migrant workers have shown up, willing to help. Many of those workers accumulated skills and training specific to disaster relief work, skills that often go unseen and unheralded. There\u2019s a statue to the immigrant workers who helped rebuild after Katrina, lauding their contribution, but too often the actual immigrant workers face wage theft and harassment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nVolunteers gather at the Pasadena Community Job Center on January 14. After disasters, from Hurricane Katrina to Southern California wildfires, day laborers are often tasked with the cleanup. PHOTO BY ZOE MEYERS/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nIn the second Trump administration, which has promised mass deportations and the dismantling of the very federal agencies that coordinate disaster recovery \u2014 as well as a \u200b\u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d energy policy guaranteed to worsen climate chaos \u2014 the poor conditions of these workers may well be everyone\u2019s problem. The continuing string of disasters has been a reminder that, as the climate changes, none of us is safe. Hurricane Helene\u2019s path up the country from Florida in September 2024 ventured well inland; drought-fueled forest fires were rampaging across the Carolinas as I wrote these words this spring. Hurricane Debby, in August 2024, caused flooding and damage as far north as Vermont; late-season blizzards knocked over trees and power lines in Maine; the worst tornado season in two decades flattened homes across the center of the country; a \u200b\u201c1,000-year event\u201d saw extensive flooding in South Dakota. Those thousand-year storms are coming more like every couple of years. The efforts by those workers in Pasadena, Soto said, drew other volunteers. \u200b\u201cAt one point, we had a thousand volunteers a day coming in,\u201d Soto said. \u200b\u201cI think we counted over 30,000 hours of volunteer hours.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of a disaster, explained Nik Theodore, a professor in the Department of Urban Planning and Policy at the University of Illinois, Chicago, \u200b\u201cinformation doesn\u2019t flow very well.\u201d Communities facing destruction often don\u2019t know exactly what to do, and so day laborers can become important sources of information. Theodore, working with NDLON, dubbed those workers \u200b\u201csecond responders,\u201d the \u200b\u201cvery next group of people to come through\u201d after emergency response. The work of cleanup, he noted, must begin quickly \u2014 after a fire or flood, health and safety hazards rapidly multiply, mold spreads, structures wobble. Migrant workers too often have survived disasters themselves and been rendered homeless and mobile by crisis, and all too often live in unstable conditions, their willingness to help born of necessity, experience and care. Those workers, particularly those from Mexico and Central America, have long been kept super-exploitable by an immigration regime that treats them as unwanted guests, constantly under threat. And with President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations in many of the places most vulnerable to climate disasters \u2014 Florida and Louisiana, among others \u2014 already-existing labor shortages in construction and repair will likely grow larger. In an immediate state of emergency, Theodore continued, immigration officials may back off, but only temporarily. After Katrina, he said, \u200b\u201conce it became clear that folks were settling there \u2026 we started to see immigration enforcement actions ramp up.\u201d Mary Yanik, co-director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Tulane University Law School in New Orleans, confirmed this pattern: \u200b\u201cWhen people are serving in these roles that are really important for their politically powerful employers, ICE enforcement is sort of scarce.\u201d When workers begin to assert their rights, she noted, that\u2019s when ICE is called in. The fear among immigrant worker communities is real. Maricela Torres, of the Esperanza Community Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., told me that, since Trump was elected, fewer people are willing to come to the center for its services and supports, and she sees fewer day laborers out at the normal locations where they usually wait for work. Some of her regular members have moved elsewhere. Others, who have done disaster recovery work, ask why they should risk their safety doing disaster cleanup when the country\u2019s only offer is detention and deportation.\n\nTwo members of the day labor fire brigade, part of the Pasadena Community Job Center, clean up debris on January 10 after windstorms hit Pasadena.

What\u2019s changed in Florida and elsewhere, explained Oscar Londo\u00f1o of WeCount! \u2014 an immigrant worker center in South Florida\u2014 is that state governments are expanding enforcement \u200b\u201ceven if it creates an economic shock.\u201d For decades, he said, industries like agriculture and construction have understood they cannot function without immigrant workers, many of them undocumented. But this moment has fractured that consensus, and the crisis will have wider ramifications, Londo\u00f1o said.\u201cEventually, there will be a moment in which there\u2019s a reckoning with the value or the centrality of immigrant workers and how devastating it would be to the economy if millions of undocumented workers were actually deported,\u201d he said. The intensity of this campaign will drive down already low labor standards in these industries, including emergency relief work. The fearmongering, Theodore said, creates \u200b\u201ca real opportunity for unscrupulous employers to take advantage of workers, both in terms of wage theft, but also in health and safety conditions,\u201d all backed up \u200b\u201cwith threats of immigration enforcement\u201d \u2014 threats that carry new weight.\n\nYanik recalled the case of Jos\u00e9 Torres, who came from El Salvador to New Orleans after Katrina to be part of the rebuilding effort and stayed, becoming a leader in the Congress of Day Laborers, an immigrant workers group. Torres survived labor trafficking and was in the middle of a legal battle during the first Trump administration. He sought sanctuary in a church when he was threatened with deportation. Yanik and others worked on his case, which became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the community, and eventually secured him a path to citizenship. The administration \u200b\u201cwants spectacle,\u201d Yanik said, but some of that spectacle takes time to prepare: The largest worksite raids during Trump 1.0, she noted, came in 2019. \u200b\u201cThey don\u2019t need to do a hundred; they could do five, and they can still have that effect of making people stay home or even flee the country,\u201d she said. With the declaration that churches, schools and hospitals will be stripped of sanctuary protections put in place by the Biden administration, she wondered whether we might see enforcement in shelters during emergencies.\n\nThe work of disaster relief is the work of salvage. It is the work of sifting through rubble to make something livable again, and it is mostly done by people who have already lost so much.\n\nThe idea is to create a \u200b\u201chostile environment,\u201d making conditions so unwelcoming that immigrants simply leave. In that climate, even people attempting to help by sharing information about ICE on social media, for example, sometimes contribute to the fear: \u200b\u201cInformation is constantly being propagated without being verified,\u201d Londo\u00f1o said. \u200b\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so central to have organizations anchored in workplaces and in communities that can verify this information, that can create community defense infrastructure, that can educate people on what their rights are and, if necessary, mobilize resources.\u201d Mutual aid efforts that flower in the wake of disaster can help bring people into this kind of community defense work. In Pasadena, Soto said, organizers recognized how the fires created opportunity for \u200b\u201corganizing folks and making sure people understand this is a political act, just these workers going out in the streets.\u201d Working to rebuild the community, citizens and immigrants build stronger ties, and those who had not been involved in worker organizing might be more willing to stand up for their neighbors.\n\nThe destruction of place and people have gone hand in hand since Friedrich Engels first described industrial conditions as \u200b\u201csocial murder\u201d in 1845, the workers being first to feel the effects of smoke-choked air, poisoned water and shoddily built factories and mills, while the boss worked in a pristine office miles away. These days, in the United States, it is immigrant workers who feel the effects of climate catastrophe first, while being scapegoated by a president cloistered in an air-conditioned office, his unelected assistant slashing away at the federal workforce. Rebuilding requires skilled labor and funds. Federal disaster relief efforts have been hampered for years by underfunding, and the Trump administration wants to turbocharge that destruction. \u200b\u201cInitially, when DOGE [Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency] swung into action, FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] was one of the first words out of their mouths,\u201d Nik Theodore said. Trump has threatened to eliminate FEMA entirely and has slashed its budget and fired hundreds of employees. He\u2019s also taken aim at other federal emergency relief and management offices, slashing the Office of Community Planning and Development, part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which pays for homes after the worst disasters. House Speaker Mike Johnson (from Louisiana himself) complied with a Trump directive to cut legal assistance for disaster victims \u2014 legal aid that prevents them from losing money to scammers or being evicted by shady landlords.\n\nThe National Day Laborer Organizing Network prepares workers for disaster sites with skills such as how to use a respirator, as at this fire cleanup in Pasadena in January. PHOTO BY ALLEN J. SCHABEN / LOS ANGELES TIMES VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nOne of the Trump administration\u2019s big ideas for \u200b\u201creforming\u201d disaster relief is to put more of the responsibility on the states. Of course, this idea presents a problem for those same Southern states that are storm-prone, with right-wing governments often unwilling to fund relief. As Rep. Troy Carter (D-La.) told reporters: \u200b\u201cStates, while capable of responding to some immediate needs, do not have the resources, infrastructure, or capacity to provide the widespread, coordinated relief that FEMA can offer.\u201d FEMA was created after those same Southern states demanded coordinated disaster recovery in the 1970s. Today, the landscape is very different. More than a decade ago, Londo\u00f1o noted, Florida abolished its state Department of Labor, and it does not have a state Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). It\u2019s part of \u200b\u201csystematic deregulation,\u201d he said, combined with attacks on labor unions, which has resulted in worse conditions for workers whether or not they are legal residents. WeCount! has been behind a campaign, for example, to try to win heat protections for outdoor workers. \u200b\u201cWe came within a vote of passing the first of its kind \u2014 a municipal heat standard for outdoor workers in Miami-Dade \u2014 and were then preempted by the state government.\u201d\n\nThose Southern states have relied on federal labor agencies for what protections they can get. \u200b\u201cIf either from inaction or action, the federal Department of Labor is considered unsafe for immigrant workers to report to, that means they\u2019re all on their own and vulnerable,\u201d Yanik said. \u200b\u201cIt means that the employers will do whatever they want with no restraint at all.\u201d Even under the Biden administration, which wanted to be seen as pro-worker, offices like OSHA were desperately understaffed. OSHA had one inspector for every 80,014 workers, or enough to inspect every workplace once every 186 years, according to a 2024 report from the AFL-CIO. Without the agencies to help, workers have had to look after themselves. In the wake of the fires, Soto said, NDLON and the Pasadena center have embarked on a massive training effort to put workers through OSHA\u2019s new disaster worker certification course. \u200b\u201cWe were able to train 174 day laborers and domestic workers in that course, that does fit testing, what kind of masks you need, how to work in wildfire,\u201d he said. After that, they move to smoke abatement and then hazardous waste training. \u200b\u201cWe know these workers are going to be the first line going into the sites,\u201d so they\u2019re proactively helping workers gain skills. As Soto explained: \u200b\u201cComing out of these trainings, what you see is workers, a lot of times, are indignant. \u200b\u2018Why didn\u2019t I get this? Why didn\u2019t I have this before?\u2019 Because it\u2019s basic stuff, but it\u2019s stuff that is life-changing in terms of the health outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe Pasadena area is now moving into the next stage of relief: rebuilding. In the early moments, Soto said, there was a beautiful sense of solidarity, with everyone sharing food and feeling as though they were all in it together. Now, the differences are starting to show. Most undocumented workers are ineligible for what federal help does still exist, which means many of the people who put their bodies on the line for others will not get to rebuild their own lives the same way. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t really see after the event itself is how long the period of recovery is,\u201d Theodore said. \u200b\u201cThe length of time it takes for communities to get back on track, I think, is overlooked, because the focus is on the immediate event and the danger to life and property that it all entails.\u201d While the recovery often relies on migrant workers\u2019 mobility, it also depends on their willingness to commit to the long term \u2014 like Jos\u00e9 Torres in New Orleans, or many of the workers Theodore met in Houston after Hurricane Harvey. \u200b\u201cIn many places, it is members of the community, neighbors who are still undocumented but have been living and working and contributing for decades,\u201d Theodore explained.\n\nSign up for our weekend newsletter A weekly digest of our best coverage Email Address\n\nCommunities are reshaped in many ways following a disaster. The New Orleans I live in now looks very different from the one I moved away from in 2002, before Katrina. Some Californians are discovering this right now in the aftermath of the fires. Insurance costs have skyrocketed in disaster-prone areas (thanks to climate change-transformed estimates), and payouts often don\u2019t cover the cost of rebuilding. Then, developers swoop in to buy damaged homes. In these moments, the claims of eliminating red tape don\u2019t help working-class residents. The idea of \u200b\u201cwe\u2019re just going to lift regulations so that we can rebuild faster,\u201d according to Soto, only makes it easier for unscrupulous developers and contractors to take advantage of desperate homeowners and workers. In places like New Orleans, he continued, health and safety violations skyrocketed when regulations were lifted. \u200b\u201cAnd so when you say, \u200b\u2018we\u2019re going to suspend [rules] to make it easier to rebuild,\u2019 that\u2019s what we hear. We hear, \u200b\u2018you\u2019re going to make it easier to put people\u2019s lives at risk, to screw over people who are most affected.\u2019\u201d\n\nWorker centers can also be hubs for training community members to protect their migrant neighbors from deportation. The immigration equivalent of CopWatch programs, Yanik said, can be especially effective in this moment \u2014 learning to document and verify actual ICE activity and pass on the information. The challenge she faces as an attorney, she said \u2014 which organizers are also facing \u2014 is the question of, \u200b\u201cHow do you activate people and raise alarm because it\u2019s really scary, and how do you disentangle some of the misinformation and make clear that a lot of this is honestly smoke and mirrors?\u201d She continued: \u200b\u201cAll of this is being portrayed as some massive, vast system, and it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a bunch of weird, draconian piecemeal things that are happening that are meant to prove a point, meant to send a message, and it\u2019s a horrible message.\u201d\n\nIn particular areas, like the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas, \u200b\u201cCommunities are ahead of the government,\u201d said Jeffrey Jacoby of the Texas Campaign for the Environment. Every year, he sees hurricane preparedness mutual aid events into the summer. \u200b\u201cFrom the government officials, it\u2019s total crickets.\u201d The gap between awareness and the resources provided has been huge, and so community organizations step into that gap as best they can. \u201cWhat\u2019s twisted about the system is, with proper resources, with enough funding, then I think communities could do a pretty good job of getting ready,\u201d he continued. Recently, Jacoby added, after a tropical storm knocked out power in Freeport, Texas, one church was able to provide a few generators for the community, ensuring that about a dozen families could keep food from spoiling and be sheltered from the summer heat. \u200b\u201cYou just imagine something like that with a different scale, and you could have a lot less suffering in the face of a disaster.\u201d\n\nWorkers can push for standards in contracts and attempt to hold big employers accountable if states and localities won\u2019t provide them, Londo\u00f1o said. Miami-Dade has a campaign around the annual heat season, but still a lack of labor regulations around heat. And yet, he noted, employers are well aware that climate change is a reality \u2014 agricultural firms \u200b\u201care constantly adapting to changes in climate.\u201d Production is going to have to change, he said, so \u200b\u201cyou should also account for the impact of extreme heat on your workforce.\u201d Immigrant workers like WeCount!\u2019s members will be leading the charge on heat standards once again this year, in yet another campaign that will help the rest of their communities adapt to the crisis. The work of disaster relief is the work of salvage, as I wrote in my 2024 book, From the Ashes. It is the work of sifting through rubble to make something livable again, and it is mostly done by people who have already lost so much.

Mas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 importante prestar aten\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 quantidade que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 bebendo.\n\nContinua depois da publicidade\n\nQuantidades\n\nUma dose padr\u00e3o de 354 ml de uma cerveja com 5% de teor alco\u00f3lico geralmente tem a mesma quantidade de etanol que 147 ml de um vinho com 12% de teor alco\u00f3lico ou uma dose de uma bebida destilada com 40%.\n\nPara Peng-Sheng (Brian) Ting, professor assistente de cl\u00ednica m\u00e9dica na Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Tulane, pode ser complicado calcular o teor alco\u00f3lico de drinques, j\u00e1 que costumam ser feitos com refrigerantes, sucos e, \u00e0s vezes, v\u00e1rios tipos de \u00e1lcool. Por isso, ele recomenda optar por vinho ou cerveja em situa\u00e7\u00f5es em que voc\u00ea precisa saber exatamente a quantidade de etanol que est\u00e1 consumindo.\n\nAlguns tipos de \u00e1lcool tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o bastante cal\u00f3ricos, o que, quando consumidos em excesso, podem aumentar o risco de ganho de peso e obesidade. E alguns drinques, como aqueles que t\u00eam ingredientes como sucos e refrigerantes, podem conter a\u00e7\u00facares adicionados, o que eleva o risco de obesidade e condi\u00e7\u00f5es de sa\u00fade como diabetes tipo 2 e doen\u00e7as card\u00edacas.\n\nContinua depois da publicidade\n\nKeyes tamb\u00e9m recomenda evitar o consumo de bebidas alco\u00f3licas misturadas com cafe\u00edna (como expresso martinis ou vodca combinada a energ\u00e9ticos como Red Bull). O aumento de energia que voc\u00ea obt\u00e9m com essas misturas pode fazer com que voc\u00ea se sinta menos embriagado do que realmente est\u00e1, potencialmente levando-o a beber mais e a ficar mais b\u00eabado.\n\nE, embora n\u00e3o haja evid\u00eancias de que bebidas destiladas escuras sejam mais prejudiciais \u00e0 sa\u00fade do que as claras, h\u00e1 poucas pesquisas sugerindo que algumas bebidas destiladas escuras podem causar ressacas mais intensas, de acordo com Damaris Rohsenow, professora do Centro de Estudos sobre \u00c1lcool e Depend\u00eancia Qu\u00edmica da Universidade Brown, nos Estados Unidos.\n\nEla aponta que bebidas destiladas escuras (como bourbon, rum e conhaque) tendem a apresentar n\u00edveis mais elevados de cong\u00eaneres, subst\u00e2ncias criadas durante o processo de fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o e que contribuem para o sabor, o aroma e a cor da bebida.

The beans, along with the fresh veggies in the dish, help you reach your daily fiber goal, a number that experts say most Americans don\u2019t hit, which isn\u2019t good. Eating enough fiber is a crucial way to reduce your risk of colon cancer, a type of cancer that\u2019s on the rise in people 50 and younger in the US.\n\n(It\u2019s recommended that women eat roughly 25 grams of fiber each day while men consume about 38 grams, but most adults eat roughly 10 grams of fiber each day.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDecades ago, researchers found that people in Uganda had very low rates of colon cancer when compared to Americans because of their diet, which was high in fiber \u2014 veggies, fruits and grains \u2014 and low in meat, said Dr. Ron Quinton, the medical director of the Goldring Center for Culinary Medicine at Tulane University in New Orleans. Specifically, colon cancer occurred at a rate of 3.5 out of 100,000 in men in Uganda compared to 51.8 out of 100,000 in men in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the first time that it was really noticed that this was a prevention for colon cancer,\u201d noted Quinton. Meaning, it\u2019s really important to prioritize your fiber consumption.\n\nThere are multiple ways that fiber benefits colon health and even more ways to reach the daily recommended amount. Here\u2019s what experts say:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEating enough fiber helps move your stool through your digestive tract.\n\n\u201cFiber plays an important role in the health of the colon, and when the colon gets unhealthy, then we\u2019re set up for development of cancer and other inflammatory diseases,\u201d said Quinton.\n\nOverall, fiber adds bulk to the stool, which helps with proper colon function.\n\n\u201c[Fiber] makes the stools more easy to move along, so the time that the stool spends in the colon is lessened, so less chance for constipation, more normal stools,\u201d explained Quinton.\n\nThis is also good for the removal of toxins: \u201cIf there are any toxins in the stool that lead to cancer, they spend less time in the colon, and therefore lessen the chances of cancer exposure or other diseases,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFiber also benefits the microbiome, which is protective against colon cancer, too.\n\nFiber is also important for the microbiome, which has been the main focus of research in the past decade, said Mary Ellen Camire, a professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine.\n\nFiber is often prebiotic, meaning it\u2019s food for probiotic bacteria, Camire added. And probiotics help rebuild and balance your microbiome.\n\n\u201cWhen the bacteria get a nice fiber meal, they are very active, and they make compounds that help protect the colon\u201d against colon cancer, along with other kinds of cancers, she explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore, the cells that line the colon, which are called colonocytes, get their energy from the microbiome, added Quinton. \u201cAnd when the colonocytes are healthy, then they form an intact barrier along the colon, so that substances that may cause disease or cancer can\u2019t cross that barrier,\u201d Quinton said.\n\n\u201cIt also helps the colon produce mucus [and] thick mucus lining also protects the colon, so without enough fiber, our microbiome gets diseased and they don\u2019t produce the energy or nutrients that our colon needs to stay healthy,\u201d he noted.\n\nfcafotodigital via Getty Images Beans and legumes are a high-fiber meal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how you can eat more fiber:\n\n\u201cFiber is a really critical part of our overall diet, and the typical American only gets 5 or 10% of the recommended amount of fiber in their diet on any given day,\u201d said Quinton.\n\nAs mentioned above, women need about 25 grams of fiber each day and men need about 38 grams, he said.\n\nBeans and legumes are very high in fiber and certain fruits and veggies are, too. Lentils have 18 grams of fiber per cup, black beans have about 15 grams in 1 can, chia seeds have 10 grams in 2 tablespoons, barley has 6 grams in 1 cup, raspberries have 8 grams in 1 cup and a pear has 6 grams, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis summer, you could make a bean and whole wheat pasta salad to up your fiber intake, or make some cold barley salads, said Camire. You can also lean into seasonal produce, she said.\n\nCamire added that it\u2019s important to spread your fiber intake out across the day and to consume different kinds of foods for fiber.\n\n\u201cThe mistake a lot of people make when they decide \u2018I\u2019m going to make fiber a priority\u2019 is they don\u2019t give their system time to adjust. If you\u2019re used to eating 15 grams of fiber a day, and you start eating 30 grams a day, the bacteria think they\u2019re having a party and so you may have some gas and cramping,\u201d Camire said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should start out gradually and slowly build up, she noted.\n\n\u201cOnce you find the foods that you tolerate well and that you like, getting enough fiber won\u2019t be difficult or expensive,\u201d Camire added.\n\nAnd fiber supplements don\u2019t cut it.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to turn to fiber supplements as a quick and easy way to reach your fiber goal, but experts say you shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNone of the supplements ... are an adequate replacement for natural fiber,\u201d Quinton said. Also, since you need so much fiber, fiber supplements end up being just a drop in the bucket, Camire added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile some of the supplements can increase your stool bulk and help constipation, \u201cthey don\u2019t necessarily have the soluble fiber elements that feed the microbiome and keep it healthy, which keeps your gut healthy,\u201d said Quinton.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can just replace the fiber with supplements. You need to be eating whole food,\u201d Quinton added.\n\nBeyond fiber intake, there\u2019s more you can do to lower your colon cancer risk.\n\nIt\u2019s important to also take other preventative steps to lower your risk of developing colon cancer. These include monitoring yourself for concerning symptoms such as ongoing stomach pain, blood in your stool or a change in your bowel movements. If you notice these symptoms, talk to your doctor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also important to let your doctor know if colon cancer runs in your family as you may be eligible for an early colonoscopy screening.\n\nColonoscopy screenings start at 45 for those with no family history and without the symptoms mentioned above, but no matter when you\u2019re eligible, colonoscopies are the best way to screen for colon cancer and remove potentially precancerous polyps.\n\n\u201cDuring a colonoscopy, if we see a polyp, and we believe it to be the precancerous kind, which the vast majority are, we will remove those polyps at the colonoscopy,\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Dueker, a gastroenterologist at UPMC and an associate professor of gastroenterology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, previously told HuffPost. \u201cAnd in doing so, we are reducing the colorectal cancer risk going forward,\u201d Dueker added.\n\nAdvertisement", "Summary": "This article discusses the importance of fiber in preventing colon cancer.

From 2015 to 2024, Dr. Collop was Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine and currently serves as Section Editor for Sleep Medicine for UpToDate.\n\nAbout IHL-42X\n\nIHL-42X is designed to treat obstructive sleep apnea (\u201cOSA\u201d) by targeting its underlying pathophysiology. An oral fixed-dose combination of dronabinol and acetazolamide, IHL-42X is currently advancing through the RePOSA Phase 2/3 clinical trial, which is expected to enroll more than 560 patients at sites worldwide.\n\nDesigned to act synergistically, IHL-42X uniquely targets two physiological pathways associated with the intermittent hypoxia (\u201cIH\u201d) and hypercapnia that characterize OSA. In a prior Australian Phase 2 clinical trial, IHL-42X was shown to reduce the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (\u201cAHI\u201d) in all dosage strengths, with the lowest dose reducing AHI by an average of 51 percent relative to baseline. RePOSA, a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial is underway, evaluating IHL-42X in individuals with OSA who are either non-compliant, intolerant, or na\u00efve to positive airway pressure devices, including CPAP, with the Phase 2 portion conducted in the United States. A topline readout from the U.S. Phase 2 portion is anticipated in July 2025.\n\nUnlike weight loss therapies, IHL-42X is uniquely engineered to target two key physiological pathways, intermittent hypoxia (IH) and hypercapnia, that underlie the pathology of OSA. By targeting these core mechanisms, IHL-42X offers a differentiated approach that may benefit a wider range of patients, including the 67% of individuals with OSA who are not classified as obese. OSA affects an estimated 1 billion people globally and approximately 30 million people in the United States. Despite its high prevalence OSA remains significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated. IHL-42X has the potential to address this critical gap in care and improve outcomes for millions living with this serious, chronic condition.\n\nAbout Incannex Healthcare Inc.\n\nIncannex is leading the way in developing combination medicines that target the underlying biological pathways associated with chronic conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis and generalized anxiety disorder. The company is advancing three clinical-stage product candidates based on evidence-based innovation, and supported by streamlined operations. Incannex's lead clinical program, IHL-42X, is an oral fixed-dose combination of dronabinol and acetazolamide designed to target underlying mechanisms and act synergistically in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

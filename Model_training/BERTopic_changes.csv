University High's Lamar Brown committed to LSU football over Texas A&M, Texas and Miami, he announced at Pennington McKernan Gymnasium on Thursday afternoon.
The five-star defensive lineman in the 2026 class is the highest-rated player at his position and the No. 5 overall player in the country, according to the 247Sports composite rankings. On ESPN, he’s listed as the No. 1 player in the nation.
""It always started off with coach (Brian) Kelly,"" Brown said during a commitment that aired on ESPN. ""That was my first offer. He always believed in me. Just the coaches here, playing for Baton Rouge, playing for the state of Louisiana, it meant a lot.""
The 6-foot-4, 285-pound Brown also plays on the offensive line in high school, though he said he wants to play defensive line as he moves forward. He is described as a stout and explosive athlete who “projects as a high-major impact player on either side of the ball” and has “legitimate high-round NFL Draft potential,” according to a 247Sports scouting report.
The two-way player is also a decorated track and field athlete. He was the 2025 Louisiana 3A State Champion in the discus with a winning throw of 151 feet and 6 inches. He took gold in the event as a sophomore and finished second in 2023 as a freshman.
LSU’s recruiting class jumped to No. 7 nationally, according to 247Sports, after Brown's commitment. He is now the second-highest-rated player who has committed to Kelly and his staff behind wide receiver Tristen Keys, who is the No. 3 player in the country on the 247Sports composite.
If LSU holds onto Brown and Keys, it would sign two of the top 5 recruits on the 247Sports composite rankings. The last time that happened was 2011 with offensive lineman La'el Collins and defensive lineman Anthony Johnson.
Brown would be the first No. 1 overall recruit on ESPN's rankings to sign with the Tigers since running back Leonard Fournette in 2014.",The Advocate,[],"['Louisiana', 'Baton Rouge', 'Lamar Brown', 'LSU', 'Texas A&M', 'Texas', 'Miami', 'ESPN', 'Brian', 'Kelly', 'Brown', 'ESPN', 'Baton Rouge', 'Louisiana', 'Brown', 'NFL Draft', 'Louisiana 3A State Champion', 'LSU', 'Brown', 'Kelly', 'Tristen Keys', 'LSU', 'Brown', 'Keys', ""La'el Collins"", 'Anthony Johnson', 'Brown', 'ESPN', 'Tigers', 'Leonard Fournette']","LSU football lands Lamar Brown, the best recruit in Louisiana and top-5 player in 2026 class.

At Eagle Point High School, I exceeded my own expectations by getting involved in various activities, such as Leadership, National Honor Society, Varsity Sports, Yearbook Editor and Editor in Chief, Junior Class Representative, Senior Class Secretary, Top 5% of my class all four years and Prom Committee. I also took college classes, tutored, and joined the Latinx Student Union. These positions required a significant amount of dedication, hard work, and year-round commitment. Although I cannot predict the future, I aspire to continue to challenge myself and strive for excellence in all that I do.
Why I Chose Oregon Tech and My Major
In fourth grade, I had an X-ray for back issues that sparked my interest in pursuing Radiology. After researching and consulting with educators, Oregon Tech emerged as the ideal college choice, notably due to its externship program that offers a practical experience to supplement theoretical learning.
My Influential Professors
In the fall term, I enrolled in MIT103 under the tutelage of Professor Carrie Giacomelli. Professor Giacomelli was a knowledgeable and professional instructor who invited guest speakers to provide real-world insights into our future careers. Likewise, I hold Professor Tricia Elliott in high regard for her unwavering commitment to her students' educational development. Professor Elliott's engaging teaching style made the difficult subject of Anatomy and Physiology more accessible, using animal analogies to enhance comprehension.

Relocating to a new location inevitably entails learning about oneself and others. In particular, effective time management became a critical skill that I had to develop. Despite having accrued college credits while still in high school, adapting to college coursework necessitated a challenging but ultimately rewarding adjustment process.
My Plans After Graduation
After college, I aim to join a program that lets me travel across the United States to provide medical aid to patients.

We hear it from the time we're little
“Find your purpose.”
It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?
This is “purpose anxiety” — the gnawing sense that one’s life should have an overarching purpose, but it’s unclear how to discover it.
“There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.
The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?
Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help “close that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,” he said.
People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.
There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.
But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.
The term “purpose anxiety” appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.”
People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose.
“Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.”
“But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.”
Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center).
Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don’t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.
As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit.""
You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life.
It entails “understanding who you are and what you have to work with, understanding what you care about, what you’d like to see be better, either in yourself or in the world” and then figuring out if you can make an impact, he added.
“In our culture, we are so outcome-focused and process-adverse,” he said. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.”
For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second.
“Big ‘P’ Purpose is goal-oriented — it’s usually big and audacious, and often unattainable,” he said. Social media, he said, “is full of people trying to voice that version of purpose on you so that they can make money.”
Better, he said, to focus on little “p” purpose and pursuits that some might simply call hobbies — gardening, singing, collecting baseball cards. Or it can be found in a job, or volunteering.
“What could I do that would light me up and fill me up and be a good use of my time?” Grumet said.
It’s not just for self-improvement, he said. When people do something they love, they attract people to them, which can help create communities.
Not all agree that hobbies and passions are the same as purpose. Reading books, Kashdan said, isn’t a purpose in itself but can be a tool to discovering it. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.”
Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children
“I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.
But she ended up creating an online community for childless women called Gateway Women.com. In rural Ireland, where she lives, she is also helping build an in-person group that brings people without children together as they age.
“I feel that to be alive in this time, and to have a platform and to be awake is an incredible privilege, and that is my purpose,” she said.

More than 470 fires across the country are currently classified as “out of control”, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).
7,318,421 hectares of land in Canada have burned due to wildfires this year – close to 78% more than the five-year average of 4,114,516 hectares, according to the CIFFC’s latest data.
The 2025 fire season is only behind the explosive 2023 wildfire season, which resulted in an astounding 17,203,625 hectares burned.
“This is our new reality… the warmer it gets, the more fires we see,” said Mike Flannigan, the BC research chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops.
A June analysis on the 2025 fire season in Canada published by United Nations University in Shibuya, Japan, concluded that the fires are a “stark manifestation” of climate change and that warm, dry weather in the spring resulted in temperatures 2.5C above average.
The warmer temperatures extend the fire season and increase the frequency of lightning that sparks fires, said Flannigan. A hotter climate also causes the atmosphere to suck moisture out of fuel, dead vegetation and the forest floor – creating ideal conditions for fires to start, he explained.
“It means more of the material is dried out, is available to burn when the fire does come, it leads to bigger flames, higher intensity, which gets to be difficult to impossible to extinguish,” he said.
So far, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which together account for about 60% of the hectares burned so far this year in Canada.
Tens of thousands of people in communities across the country have been evacuated due to the wildfires. In Saskatchewan, the Canadian Red Cross reported it had assisted more than 17,000 people in the province from over 6,700 households to evacuate.
Thirteen communities in north-west Saskatchewan are under an evacuation order, several of which are First Nations, according to the province. One of the most affected areas of this year’s wildfire season in the province is Denare Beach, a north-eastern village that was mostly destroyed in June due to a blaze.
The season has also now hit the east coast of Canada, as wildfires are currently raging across Newfoundland and Labrador and several towns are under evacuation orders.
John Abatzoglou, a professor of complex systems management at the University of California, Merced, co-authored the June report from United Nations University.
Abatzoglou said this year’s fire season is the third year in a row Canada has seen fire activity that is well above average. The fires are also causing widespread smoke to cascade from the country into the United States as well, prompting severe air quality warnings in several states this month, is also an indication of how the fires are hurting populations beyond evacuations.
It’s an international element of the fires that officials are having to contend with on a wider scale, Abatzoglou said.
“This is a really key point that’s different from other natural hazards and its ability to impact everything from quality of life to … human health and even mortality,” he said.
Governments and public health officials will have to address how to change public behaviour and public policy to contend with “smoke days”, where you have to stay inside, he said.

The man, who remained anonymous in the case study, told doctors he had eliminated sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt, from his diet after reading about its negative health effects. He said he could only find sources telling him how to reduce salt, but not eliminate it completely.
Inspired by his nutrition studies in college, the man decided to completely eliminate sodium chloride from his diet as a personal experiment, with consultation from Chat GPT, researchers wrote. He maintained multiple dietary restrictions and even distilled his own water at home.
“For 3 months, he had replaced sodium chloride with sodium bromide obtained from the internet after consultation with ChatGPT, in which he had read that chloride can be swapped with bromide, though likely for other purposes, such as cleaning,” the case study read.
While excess sodium can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of health issues, it is still necessary to consume a healthy amount of it.
The man, who had no psychiatric history, eventually ended up at the hospital, worried that his neighbor was poisoning him. He told doctors he was very thirsty, but paranoid about the water he was offered.
“In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability,” the study read.
Doctors concluded that the man was suffering from bromism, or bromide toxicity, a condition that is rare today but was more common in the early 20th century. The research noted that bromide was found in several over-the-counter medicines back then and contributed to up to 8% of bromism-related psychiatric admissions at that time.
The hospital treated the man for psychosis and discharged him weeks later. His case highlights the potential pitfalls of using AI to seek medical tips.

""At first I was shocked, then it turned into panic,"" said the 20-year-old, describing the ordeal as a ""wound that will leave a scar"".
C was one of three women who exposed an AI porn scandal at Hong Kong's oldest university last month, sparking huge debate around what had largely been seen as an overseas phenomenon.
The victims, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, and experts said the city was ill-prepared to counter the fast-growing threat.
In the University of Hong Kong (HKU) case, hundreds of images of at least 20 women were discovered on the student's laptop.
""B"", another of those who spoke out, said she felt betrayed as she had considered the perpetrator a friend.
""I felt like my privacy was violated... like I couldn't trust the people around me,"" she said.
The university's initial response was to give the student a warning letter and make him apologise.
The third woman, ""A"", said she was told by staff the case couldn't be heard before a disciplinary committee.
""They were concerned but didn't know what they could do... We felt that was a bit ridiculous.""
HKU told AFP it ""has been in contact with the students involved"" but cannot comment further with the case under active review.
- Damage may 'never end' -
While the HKU case has thrust AI-made porn into the spotlight, it is not the city's first.
Janice, a woman in her late 20s who also asked to use a pseudonym, told AFP she was devastated a few years ago when fake obscene images were sent to her friends.
She never found the culprit and worried that the damage might ""never end"".
""I tried skipping work and didn't dare to go out on the street,"" she said, adding that she had suicidal thoughts and would suddenly burst into tears.
""I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would wake up to see the whole internet filled with (pornographic) images of me.""
Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women received 11 similar requests for help in 2024-25.
""We have observed an uptick... Some cases may be hidden if (victims) don't know how to seek help,"" executive director Doris Chong said.
Janice doubted she had enough evidence to persuade police to help, adding that she felt society will ""never find a way"" to punish canny offenders.
- Type of 'sexual violence' -
An estimated 90 percent of AI-made porn victims are women, Susanne Choi from the Chinese University of Hong Kong told AFP, ""suggesting that it is a form of gender-based sexual violence"".
Asked for the number of recent cases involving deepfake pornography, police said they did not maintain such figures.
Lawmakers and universities need to ""expand and revise existing laws and procedures to better cope with... technology-facilitated sexual harassment"", Choi argued.
Discussions in Britain and Singapore show a growing willingness to penalise its creation, though opinion is split on possession, according to Hong Kong barrister Stephen Keung.
Hong Kong currently criminalises the distribution of ""intimate images"", including AI-made ones, but not their creation or possession.
That made legal action in the HKU case difficult as there was no evidence that the pictures were circulated.
After the women went public with the scandal, however, Hong Kong's privacy watchdog launched a criminal investigation, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is handling a related complaint.
- Dignity 'undermined' -
The three students said they have had to deal with public backlash.
Once an avid social media user, C temporarily stopped posting, worried about who else ""would screengrab my photos for what purpose"".
""Many commenters said... 'You are ruining the guy's future, you should apologise to him',"" she said, saying she endured periods of self-doubt.
The student has not been named and AFP was unable to reach him for comment.
B said the trio did not want to ""play judge"" but believed offenders should face long-term consequences.
""The mere creation (of AI porn) is a problem... My bodily autonomy, my privacy, my dignity were undermined by it,"" B said.
""If a line must be drawn, it should be drawn at creation.""

""I tried skipping work and didn't dare to go out on the street,"" she said, adding that she had suicidal thoughts and would suddenly burst into tears.
""I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would wake up to see the whole internet filled with (pornographic) images of me.""
Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women received 11 similar requests for help in 2024-25.
""We have observed an uptick... Some cases may be hidden if (victims) don't know how to seek help,"" executive director Doris Chong said.
Janice doubted she had enough evidence to persuade police to help, adding that she felt society will ""never find a way"" to punish canny offenders.
- Type of 'sexual violence' -
An estimated 90 percent of AI-made porn victims are women, Susanne Choi from the Chinese University of Hong Kong told AFP, ""suggesting that it is a form of gender-based sexual violence"".
Asked for the number of recent cases involving deepfake pornography, police said they did not maintain such figures.
Lawmakers and universities need to ""expand and revise existing laws and procedures to better cope with... technology-facilitated sexual harassment"", Choi argued.
Discussions in Britain and Singapore show a growing willingness to penalise its creation, though opinion is split on possession, according to Hong Kong barrister Stephen Keung.
Hong Kong currently criminalises the distribution of ""intimate images"", including AI-made ones, but not their creation or possession.
That made legal action in the HKU case difficult as there was no evidence that the pictures were circulated.
After the women went public with the scandal, however, Hong Kong's privacy watchdog launched a criminal investigation, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is handling a related complaint.
- Dignity 'undermined' -
The three students said they have had to deal with public backlash.
Once an avid social media user, C temporarily stopped posting, worried about who else ""would screengrab my photos for what purpose"".
""Many commenters said... 'You are ruining the guy's future, you should apologise to him',"" she said, saying she endured periods of self-doubt.
The student has not been named and AFP was unable to reach him for comment.
B said the trio did not want to ""play judge"" but believed offenders should face long-term consequences.
""The mere creation (of AI porn) is a problem... My bodily autonomy, my privacy, my dignity were undermined by it,"" B said.
""If a line must be drawn, it should be drawn at creation.""

As a former school leader and as a parent to teenagers, I know the range of emotions that come with exams and the reassurances we try to offer our children, or the students in our lives, as they navigate their journey into higher education.
While more than three quarters of students are accepted at their first choice (their Ucas “firm” choice) every year, we are also seeing increasing activity in clearing — from those whose Plan A hasn’t worked out, those who would like to revisit their choices, as well as those who have just decided to apply for the first time. If you are supporting someone waiting for their results this summer, or who wants to enter higher education, and you are not quite sure what clearing is about, Ucas has a wealth of information and practical tips to guide you.
What exactly is clearing?
Clearing is the final stage of the Ucas admissions process. It allows students who have received their results to find university or college places that are yet to be filled. It’s available to anyone who may not have received the grades they need for their firm or insurance choice — but also to those who do have a place and are considering another option, or those who only decide to apply after the last main scheme Ucas deadline in June. Last year 38,935 UK 18-year-olds secured a place at university or college through clearing.
Clearing opened on July 5 and runs until October 20, although the busiest activity happens in mid-August just after the results for A-level, Btec and other qualifications are released. There are plenty of options in clearing once again this year, with about 28,000 courses available across the country.
At Ucas we always advise students to do their research, so they can be prepared for whatever happens. Our advice this year includes encouraging applicants to build a results day action plan by reflecting on their research and reconnecting with their choices. Students might want to look back at their original five choices on the Ucas application and revisit them as a potential option, as we know many students return to one of the original universities or colleges they applied to earlier in the cycle. In other words, don’t start making a whole new playlist when you already have good reasons to choose your favourite songs.
Who else is clearing for?
If a student hasn’t applied to university or college yet but is starting to wish that they had, it’s not too late. They may have just realised that they do want to start a degree this autumn, or they may be a few years into their careers but are looking to get back into education. Whatever the reason, they can still apply to university or college through Ucas by applying directly into clearing. This is an increasingly popular route, with more students choosing to apply direct to clearing every year, in addition to the traditional clearing users who find themselves there having just missed out on the grades needed for their firm or insurance choices.
Last year 67 per cent of those who found a place at university or college in clearing told Ucas that they started their research before August, which shows the importance of getting prepared before results day. For any students who are potentially rethinking their firm choice, I would always suggest getting in touch with that university in the first instance to discuss options. The university might be able to offer a place on a different course if they have changed their mind about what subject they want to study and can share more information about available support.
It’s clear that clearing has evolved, with growing numbers of students now using it as a planned route to find the right course or university for them.
How does it work?
The best way for students to use clearing is to start by creating an account on the Ucas website. They can then search for available courses and, once they have found one they are interested in, contact the university or college directly (making sure they have their clearing number and personal ID on hand) to check they meet the entry requirements. If they are offered a place that they want to accept, they can add the clearing choice in their application via their Ucas account.
Applicants will be able to add a clearing choice from 1pm on Level 3 Results Day, which this year is Thursday, August 14 — or for students in Scotland, from 10am on SQA Results Day on Tuesday, August 5.
Is extra support available?
Ucas has a range of digital tools to support applicants during this time, with our Clearing Plus tool offering personalised matches to available courses based on the information students have submitted in their application. Students can get a taster of different subjects or different careers with virtual work experience on ucas.com. We also have a team of experts on hand who can be reached on the phone, on our social media channels and via our website.
This year we have worked with Clementine Wade, the university and school coach, to create resources specifically for parents, carers and guardians to help you understand what you can do to best support your child through the process.
Results day is a cause for huge celebration, for students, their parents and carers, their teachers, and everyone else who has supported them through their education so far. At Ucas we are committed to ensuring as many people as possible can benefit from the life-changing opportunity of higher education. Together this summer we can help students to make informed choices so they can progress with excitement and confidence.",GDeltProject,[],"['Ucas', 'UK', 'n’t', 'Ucas', 'Ucas', 'Scotland', 'SQA Results Day', 'Clearing Plus', 'Clementine Wade']","A-level results day 2025: full guide to Ucas clearing.

NIH has recently announced a new policy that will continue to support originality, creativity, and fairness in the research application process. NIH has noticed that some Principal Investigators (PIs) have been submitting a large number of research applications that far exceed the numbers we traditionally expect and may have been prepared using artificial intelligence (AI) tools.
While AI may be a helpful tool in preparing applications, the rapid submission of large numbers of research applications from a single PI may undermine the fairness and originality of the research application process and unfairly strain NIH’s application review processes.
As use of AI tools becomes more commonplace, it is important to remember that applicants may use AI in limited aspects to reduce administrative burden while preparing applications. However, applicants should be mindful of the concerns around research misconduct or lack of originality when using such tools. Remember, NIH peer reviewers are prohibited from using AI for their critiques.
To address these issues, the new policy is effective for the September 25, 2025, receipt date and beyond:
Applications that are either substantially developed by AI or containing sections substantially developed by AI are not considered the original ideas of applicants and will not be considered by NIH.
-
NIH will also only accept up to six new, renewal, resubmission, or revision applications from an individual PD/PI (Program Director/Principal Investigator) or Multiple Principal Investigator for all council rounds in a calendar year.

Last month was muggier than usual for the majority of the Lower 48. Parts of the Midwest, East Coast and mid-Atlantic regions, in particular, were intensely humid in July, according to preliminary data compiled by researchers at Oregon State University.
Hot and humid conditions are to be expected in the summer, but heat index values — what conditions “feel like” when humidity and air temperatures are combined — soared well into the triple digits for extended periods of time in places such as Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Florida last month.
Cities such as Pittsburgh; Roanoke, Virginia; and Washington, D.C., all registered their most humid July in recorded history, according to figures compiled by the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, which collects and tracks data on precipitation, soil temperature and other environmental conditions. New York City and Raleigh, North Carolina, had their second-most-humid July, while humidity in Detroit and Cincinnati reached their third-highest levels last month.
In Paducah, Kentucky, a brutal stretch of high heat and humidity from July 16 to 30 set a slew of new records for the city.
“We have reached the end to the longest stretch of continuously high humidity that Paducah has witnessed in the past 75 years,” the local branch of the National Weather Service said Thursday in a post on X, adding that the number of hours at “oppressive levels” of humidity exceeded 300% of the city’s normal amount for the month of July.
Humid days are expected to be more common as a result of climate change, because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. But beyond the discomfort of a sticky summer, soaring humidity levels pose serious threats to health and public safety.
High heat index values increase the risk of heat-related illness and death, particularly among children, older adults and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. A 2022 study by the nonprofit organization Climate Central found that the combination of high heat and humidity can affect the body’s ability to cool itself down through sweating.
“In many parts of the country and the globe, dangerous heat often occurs along with high humidity — and the pair of conditions multiplies the health risks,” the researchers wrote in their analysis.

The 2017 “megaflash” stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City — a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.
“Over time, as the data record continues to expand, we will be able to observe even the rarest types of extreme lightning on Earth and investigate the broad impacts of lightning on society,” study lead author Michael Peterson, an atmospheric scientist in the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said in a statement.

An enormous, 515-mile-long flash of lightning that crossed at least three states has been named the longest in recorded history in the world.
The 2017 “megaflash” stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City — a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.

Losses of land-based water could have profound implications for access to safe drinking water","Overpumping groundwater, worsening droughts and more rapid evaporation due to higher temperatures have caused a drastic decline in the amount of available freshwater, according to a new study.
“Continental drying” has redirected the planet’s total water to the oceans to such degree that it has now surpassed melting ice sheets as the biggest contributor to global sea level rise, the research found.
Losses of land-based water could have profound implications for access to safe drinking water and the ability to grow food in some of the world’s richest agricultural regions.
“We use a lot of water to grow food,” said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at Arizona State University’s School of Sustainability and one of the authors of the study. “If things don’t change, we’ll see impacts on our food security and just our general water availability.”
The findings “should be of paramount concern to the general public, to resource managers, and to decision-makers around the world,” the researchers wrote in the study, adding that the identified trends “send perhaps the direst message on the impact of climate change to date.”
“The continents are drying, freshwater availability is shrinking, and sea level rise is accelerating,” they wrote.
The study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, assessed changes in terrestrial water sources, such as lakes, underground aquifers and moisture in soil, over the past two decades. The researchers found that several factors, including climate change, are disrupting Earth’s natural water cycle, upsetting how moisture circulates between the ground, oceans and atmosphere.
The researchers used data from a suite of four NASA satellites to analyze changes in terrestrial water storage over the past 22 years. The satellites were designed to track the movement of Earth’s water, including changes to the planet’s ice sheets, glaciers and underground reservoirs.
The researchers found, for instance, that parts of the world that are already dry have been rapidly getting drier since 2014. These drought-ridden regions increased by an area twice the size of California each year, Famiglietti said.
In several cases, drought-ridden hotspots expanded to create giant, interconnected “mega-drying” regions, according to the study. One such area covers parts of Central America, Mexico, California, the southwestern United States, the lower Colorado River basin and the southern High Plains.
“The key message here is that water is really a key driver of the changes we see both on land and in the ocean,” said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Earth Sciences Section at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who served on the science team for the NASA missions that produced the decades of data used in the new study.
The study found that every large land mass, except for Greenland and Antarctica, has experienced unprecedented drying since 2002.
Widespread continental drying is expected to have major consequences for people. Three quarters of the world’s population lives in countries where freshwater resources are being depleted, according to the researchers.
Meanwhile, rising seas threaten to creep up on coastal regions around the globe, making them less habitable and adding to the mounting pressures caused by extreme storms and floods. In the U.S., severe weather has helped trigger an insurance crisis in coastal cities that are prone to extreme weather events.
The link between sea-level rise and the loss of water locked up in the ground is a consequence of throwing the planet’s water cycle into chaos. Many of these changes, such as overpumping groundwater, are thought to be permanent — or, at the very least, irreversible for thousands or tens of thousands of years, said Alexander Simms, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved with the study.
“If you pull water off the continents, the only place it has to go is in the ocean,” he said. “Water goes in the atmosphere, then 88% of that water rains down on Earth and ends up in the ocean.”
Simms said the study was fascinating in its ability to estimate the global scale of these water losses, but he was skeptical of the claim that water loss from the continents has now surpassed ice sheet melt as the biggest contributor to sea level rise.
Still, Hamlington said the study shows how the movement of water around the planet has enormous ripple effects. It also suggests that the consequences could intensify in the future, if groundwater is further depleted, freshwater resources shrink and drought conditions worsen.

“The key message here is that water is really a key driver of the changes we see both on land and in the ocean,” said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Earth Sciences Section at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who served on the science team for the NASA missions that produced the decades of data used in the new study.
The study found that every large land mass, except for Greenland and Antarctica, has experienced unprecedented drying since 2002.
Widespread continental drying is expected to have major consequences for people. Three quarters of the world’s population lives in countries where freshwater resources are being depleted, according to the researchers.
Meanwhile, rising seas threaten to creep up on coastal regions around the globe, making them less habitable and adding to the mounting pressures caused by extreme storms and floods. In the U.S., severe weather has helped trigger an insurance crisis in coastal cities that are prone to extreme weather events.
The link between sea-level rise and the loss of water locked up in the ground is a consequence of throwing the planet’s water cycle into chaos. Many of these changes, such as overpumping groundwater, are thought to be permanent — or, at the very least, irreversible for thousands or tens of thousands of years, said Alexander Simms, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved with the study.
“If you pull water off the continents, the only place it has to go is in the ocean,” he said. “Water goes in the atmosphere, then 88% of that water rains down on Earth and ends up in the ocean.”
Simms said the study was fascinating in its ability to estimate the global scale of these water losses, but he was skeptical of the claim that water loss from the continents has now surpassed ice sheet melt as the biggest contributor to sea level rise.
Still, Hamlington said the study shows how the movement of water around the planet has enormous ripple effects. It also suggests that the consequences could intensify in the future, if groundwater is further depleted, freshwater resources shrink and drought conditions worsen.
“This kind of tracking of terrestrial water storage is a critical piece of the puzzle,” he said. “If we can track that water, if we know where it’s going, we can improve our understanding of future drought, flooding and water resource availability over land.”",-1.0,0.0,Climate Infrastructure Risks,1.611,,0.0,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 23:19:34 GMT",20.0,,-1664.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,5.0,1.611,Climate Infrastructure Risks,,2025-08-16 00:29:07.503909+00:00,1,2025-08-16 00:29:07.503885+00:00,,,448.0,,Climate Infrastructure Risks,climate infrastructure risks,Climate Infrastructure Risks,1.0

New college graduates are facing one of the most challenging markets for entry-level jobs in a decade.

John Yang:
New college graduates are facing one of the most challenging markets for entry level jobs in a decade. In June, the most recent data available, the unemployment rate for recent grads was nearly 5 percent. That's higher than the overall unemployment rate. We asked recent graduates to tell us about their job searches.
Jack O’Connor:
My hope after graduating college was to go straight into a full time job in reporting.
Anjoleigh Schindler:
My initial plans were to find a local job in a magazine. I just wanted to find a job where I could write.
Michael Lavin:
I had aspirations of working for the GSA, General Services Administration. I was going into a third round interview with them around November, December, and that is when the federal hiring freeze took over.
I would often be what I would consider ghosted by employers. Wouldn't get any feedback at all, not even a rejection, just nothing.
I must have started applying for jobs in April, and I know I've sent 85 job applications since. It's been really difficult.
When I wasn't getting any feedback from my applications, was really dejected. So it made me feel like I was unqualified for any job in journalism, like maybe I wasn't good enough.
The experience has definitely been discouraging. But I don't know. I like to take the mindset of I just got to keep plugging away, keep sending in applications, keep trying to revamp my resume.
I think I'm a little too stubborn to switch career paths right now. So I, you know, I'm going to keep at it, keep applying, and we'll just hope for the best, I suppose.
Christine Cruzvergara is the Chief Education Officer at Handshake, which is an online platform that connects young job seekers and employers. Christine, we just heard from three young people. You heard disappointment, you heard a little frustration. How typical is that from what you hear?
Christine Cruzvergara, Chief Education Officer, Handshake:
It's very common right now. The job market is tough, it's competitive. We've seen in our data that jobs are down 15 percent from last year, but applications are up 30 percent.
What makes it so tough?
Christine Cruzvergara:
Well, there are a number of different factors that make it difficult right now. One would obviously be the overall economy, the second would be the government, and the third would be what's happening with AI, disrupting what entry level jobs look like right now.
Talk a little bit about the AI part of that. We've heard some people say that AI is taking over the many of the tasks that entry level workers would normally do.
So employers are going to have new expectations around how you use AI, how it's integrated into your role, the amount of productivity you have. I think that altogether is going to mean that the skill set for an entry level worker will change and evolve and it will look different.
So for someone trying to graduate and find work, right now, they're in the middle of a very messy process where employers are trying to figure out what they want and what that looks like.
We heard one of the young men talking about he wanted to become a reporter, thinking about shifting fields, but wanted to avoid that. He said he was stubborn enough that he didn't want to do it. What are some of the sorts of tough choices or hard decisions that young people are having to face now as they look for their first jobs?
We see in our data that over 40 percent are willing to actually explore other industries that perhaps do have more hiring right now. For example, health care is still rising in terms of number of opportunities, and there aren't enough people who want to go into health care.
So some folks that have tech skills, for example, instead of working in a traditional tech industry, are thinking about, how might I do health tech, how can I pivot in that way? So that's one type of difficult decision.
The second would be location. Where do I want to live? This generation, this class knows that it's extremely expensive to live in certain cities. So the cost of living is factoring into their choices about where they choose to apply, what locations they want to live in.
I think a third piece is really considering what types of skills are they able to build and are they able to build it fast enough for what employers are looking for? And employers are still figuring that out, so it could change from one year to another.
You mentioned health care is a place where there are a lot of opportunities. Are there fields where that are sort of oversubscribed? There are more people chasing after fewer jobs.
Well, I think what we've seen just in the past year or two is that big tech, for example, has certainly slowed down in their hiring. The class of 2025 in particular, has been watching headlines for the better part of two years since seeing major layoffs happen. It is also the industry that is adopting Gen AI the fastest.
And so they are the ones kind of on the forefront of experimenting with what that looks like. How much headcount do you really need? How much could be paired with technology? What will the future of engineering teams look like? So that is certainly an industry where we have seen some slowdown.
What's your advice for the members of the class of 25 who are still out there looking for their first jobs?
Well, I think first you have to find a support group, a support network that's going to keep you positive through the process. It is tough, it is competitive, it is easy to feel rejected and dejected as you go through this process. That can be your family, that can be your friends, it could be your coaches, it could be your peers. Doesn't matter who, you just need to find someone.
I think the second piece is think about how you can upskill, so you have your degree. Fantastic. Are there other skills that you need to pair with that right now and take the advantage of all the online resources and all the free resources that are available to you and find ways to upskill yourself in the downtime while you are looking for a job?
And then lastly, remember that your first job is not your forever job. So keep in mind that whatever that first job is, it's going to teach you some skills. It's going to give you a chance to step up into the next thing. But it doesn't have to be perfect. And sometimes just releasing some of those expectations can help you find that next job a little faster.
Good advice. From Christine Cruzvergara of Handshake, thank you very much.
Thank you so much for having me.

Well, I think what we've seen just in the past year or two is that big tech, for example, has certainly slowed down in their hiring. The class of 2025 in particular, has been watching headlines for the better part of two years since seeing major layoffs happen. It is also the industry that is adopting Gen AI the fastest.
And so they are the ones kind of on the forefront of experimenting with what that looks like. How much headcount do you really need? How much could be paired with technology? What will the future of engineering teams look like? So that is certainly an industry where we have seen some slowdown.
What's your advice for the members of the class of 25 who are still out there looking for their first jobs?
Well, I think first you have to find a support group, a support network that's going to keep you positive through the process. It is tough, it is competitive, it is easy to feel rejected and dejected as you go through this process. That can be your family, that can be your friends, it could be your coaches, it could be your peers. Doesn't matter who, you just need to find someone.
I think the second piece is think about how you can upskill, so you have your degree. Fantastic. Are there other skills that you need to pair with that right now and take the advantage of all the online resources and all the free resources that are available to you and find ways to upskill yourself in the downtime while you are looking for a job?
And then lastly, remember that your first job is not your forever job. So keep in mind that whatever that first job is, it's going to teach you some skills. It's going to give you a chance to step up into the next thing. But it doesn't have to be perfect. And sometimes just releasing some of those expectations can help you find that next job a little faster.
Good advice. From Christine Cruzvergara of Handshake, thank you very much.
Thank you so much for having me.

John Yang:
In Geneva, negotiators from 175 nations are trying to hammer out the first ever legally binding treaty on plastic pollution. The key sticking point is whether it should mandate cuts in plastic production. Oil producing nations including the United States oppose that as fossil fuels are a key ingredient in plastics.
The urgency of the talks was underscored this week by a new study published in the medical journal The Lancet. It calls plastics a grave growing and under recognized danger to human and planetary health. Tracey Woodruff is a professor at the UC San Francisco Medical School and one of the authors of the Lancet study. Tracey, A grave, growing and under recognized danger. What is that danger? Explain the danger to us.
Tracey Woodruff, UC San Francisco School of Medicine: Plastic contains thousands of toxic chemicals. Some of them we know something about and some of them we don't know anything about. But the ones that we do know about, we know that they can lead to increased risk of multiple different types of chronic health effects.
For example, one chemical that's used commonly in plastics to which we are all exposed are phthalates. These are chemicals that are used in everything from vinyl flooring, curtains, plastic couches, even in your car, cosmetics, fragrances. These chemicals are ubiquitous. They're measured in everybody.
And we know they increase the risk of multiple adverse health conditions like obesity and diabetes and they can increase the risk of preterm birth. There's also an increased production of plastics. Currently planned plastic production will triple in the next 30 years. That means more plastic products and more plastic chemicals to which we will be exposed.
Talk about the production picking up the pace. Why is it accelerating?
Tracey Woodruff:
Plastics are made from fossil fuels, oil and gas. And the fossil fuel industry is turning to plastics to stay profitable making plastic and the petrochemicals used in plastic is more profitable than using it for fuel and energy and electricity.
So as the world uses less oil in some cases to address climate change concerns, the fossil fuel industry is shifting its focus to producing more plastic and plastic related chemicals to maintain and increase their profits.
You know, we see recycling bins everywhere now on the street and offices. What impact or what effect does recycling have?
Well, recycling is pretty much a myth that's been sold to us by the fossil fuel industry. And in fact, a report just came out this week talking about how those that the fossil fuel industry knew that you can't actually really recycle plastic. The fact is that less than 10 percent of plastic is recycled and only 1 percent is recycled twice.
And what that means is that a lot of this plastic we're being told, is being recycled to make us feel better, but it's really going into the waste stream. It's degrading in the environment, it's degrading into all of these, varied in the oceans, in fish, and then it's getting into us. So the reality is recycling is not the solution.
There's been a lot of talk about microplastics being so pervasive. Help us understand what that is and do we know what the effects are of having microplastics in our bodies?
Yeah, microplastics, they're essentially little plastics and they're very small, usually smaller than the human eye can see. And they're basic. They come from the degradation of all these many plastics that are being produced by these fossil fuel companies.
And we know that people carry little bits of microplastics in their body because they've been measured in every part of the body that they've been looked at. So everything from breast milk to blood to feces, even in your brain.
These talks in Geneva, they had hoped to conclude this by the end of 2024. Obviously they haven't. What's at stake in these talks?
Well, the health of everybody on this planet is at stake in these talks. The goal of the pla — of the countries that want to see something done about plastic pollution is to identify the hazardous chemicals in the plastics and reduce or eliminate them. The goal of the fossil fuel producing countries is to basically increase plastic production. And they are deviating the plastic negotiation treaties by focusing on recycling, which I have said is not really the solution to plastic production.
And so because these countries or the projected estimates are to triple by 26 plastic production, it really is an important inflection point in how we as well really as part of the global community, decide how we want to address plastics and the plastic related chemicals which we already know are already resulting in adverse human health effects around the globe.

The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.
UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.
President Donald Trump’s administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as with Harvard University.

The White House official did not detail any additional demands the administration has made to UCLA or elaborate on the settlement amount. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Trump administration suspended $584 million in federal grants for UCLA, the university said this week. The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.”
The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. Jewish students said demonstrators in the encampment blocked them from getting to class. One night, counterprotesters attacked the encampment, throwing traffic cones and firing pepper spray, with fighting that continued for hours, injuring more than a dozen people, before police stepped in. The next day, after hundreds defied orders to leave, more than 200 people were arrested.
The University of California’s president, James B. Milliken, said in a statement Friday that the university was reviewing a document it “just received” from the Department of Justice.
“Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” Milliken said. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”
This would not be the university’s first settlement over the 2024 protests. Last month, UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued, arguing that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.
The settlement comes nearly a year after a preliminary injunction was issued, marking the first time a U.S. judge had ruled against a university over their handling of on-campus demonstrations against Israel’s war in Gaza.
UCLA initially had argued that it had no legal responsibility over the issue because protesters, not the university, blocked Jewish students’ access to areas. The university also worked with law enforcement to thwart attempts to set up new protest camps.
But U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi disagreed and ordered UCLA to create a plan to protect Jewish students on campus. The University of California, one of the nation’s largest public university systems, has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests and has said it is committed to campus safety and inclusivity and will continue to implement recommendations.

As part of the settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university’s Jewish community. It also has created an Office of Campus and Community Safety, instituting new policies to manage protests on campus.
UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.
The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.
Last month Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government’s allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restores more than $400 million in research grants.
The Trump administration plans to use its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation.

The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.
UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.
President Donald Trump’s administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as with Harvard University.

A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.
Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.
The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.
A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump’s first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities’ investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.
The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.
The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.
“The tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,” said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.”
The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.
Some universities are on the edge of the law’s parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.
Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.
Despite the colleges’ wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.
“They’re looking for savings wherever possible,” Levine said, which could impact financial aid. “One of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.”
For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.
In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.
Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.
Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.
No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country’s wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it’s also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.
The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard’s research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard’s efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.
“It’s not like Harvard is going to go from one of the best institutions in the world to just a mediocre institution. That’s probably not going to happen,” Levine said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a bad thing — that there won’t be pain and that students won’t suffer.”

For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.
In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.
Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.
Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.
No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country’s wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it’s also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.
The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard’s research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard’s efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.
“It’s not like Harvard is going to go from one of the best institutions in the world to just a mediocre institution. That’s probably not going to happen,” Levine said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a bad thing — that there won’t be pain and that students won’t suffer.”

A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.
Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.
The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.
A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump’s first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities’ investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.
The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.
The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.
“The tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,” said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.”
The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.
Some universities are on the edge of the law’s parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.
Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.
Despite the colleges’ wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.
“They’re looking for savings wherever possible,” Levine said, which could impact financial aid. “One of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.”
For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio’s research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard’s fight with the Trump administration.

“It’s like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, ‘Poof. You’re being cut off.’”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world’s most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard’s lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country’s top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country’s oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.

The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,” the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.

The funding cuts have left Harvard’s research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find nongovernment funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year’s delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,” Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. “It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.”
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
WATCH: The possible long-term impact of Trump’s cuts to medical research funding
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were canceled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university’s fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,” she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country’s reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio’s research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard’s fight with the Trump administration.

“It’s like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, ‘Poof. You’re being cut off.’”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world’s most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard’s lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country’s top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country’s oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.

The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,” the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.

The funding cuts have left Harvard’s research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find nongovernment funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year’s delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,” Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. “It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.”
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
WATCH: The possible long-term impact of Trump’s cuts to medical research funding
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were canceled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university’s fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,” she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country’s reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio’s research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard’s fight with the Trump administration.

“It’s like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, ‘Poof. You’re being cut off.’”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world’s most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard’s lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country’s top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country’s oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.

The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,” the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.

The funding cuts have left Harvard’s research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find nongovernment funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year’s delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,” Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. “It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.”
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
WATCH: The possible long-term impact of Trump’s cuts to medical research funding
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were canceled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university’s fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,” she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country’s reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

The Trump administration has launched numerous investigations into colleges and universities and withheld billions of dollars in funding, accusing the schools of not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus. About 60 schools have been notified of possible investigations.
Last week, Columbia University settled with the administration in a major deal that could be a blueprint for other battles — or, rather, battles with other schools.
Ali Rogin looked into one of the key players behind the administration's approach.
Ali Rogin:
This is all part of a broader push that the White House says is meant to get elite schools to better address antisemitism. But how did this effort start?
To help answer that question, we're joined by Arno Rosenfeld, an enterprise reporter for The Forward, where he's also the author of the Antisemitism Decoded newsletter.
Arno, thank you so much for joining us.
First of all, how does this administration define antisemitism and how is it that it's become so central to its targeting of universities?
Arno Rosenfeld, Enterprise Reporter, The Forward:
So the administration's understanding of antisemitism is really rooted in hostility toward Israel, so be that anti-Zionism or these other sort of protests. It sort of lumps that in with what they consider to be support for terrorism, support for Hamas.
But I would say that they go a little bit further than that in kind of limiting their focus to what you might consider left-wing antisemitism.
But not really saying as much about antisemitism on the right?
Arno Rosenfeld:
Correct.
I mean, sometimes, they give a little bit more or less rhetorical attention to that, but in terms of substance, it's not their focus. And there are number of people in the administration with ties to right-wing antisemites or who have expressed antisemitism themselves of sort of the right-wing variety.
You have reported on one of the blueprints of the administration's efforts on this. It's called Project Esther. What is it and who's behind it?
So Project Esther was created by The Heritage Foundation, which also created Project 2025, another blueprint in advance of Trump taking office with the sort of hope that it would be a blueprint for a second Trump administration, when we didn't know who was going to be president.
But it's a plan that lays out a strategy that the White House and other sort of federal agencies can take to combat, again, this kind of left-wing antisemitism. They talk about a Hamas support network that is basically a variety of anti-Zionist groups and some groups that aren't even anti-Zionist, but sort of progressive organizations that are critical of Israel, they lump into this antisemitic network.
And then they have a variety of tools that they want the government to use to crack down on that network.
And as you have noted, there were not many Jewish groups involved in the writing of this Project Esther. Why is that and what does it tell you about this endeavor?
You know, The Heritage Foundation doesn't have a lot of Jewish partnerships. There are conservative Jewish groups, but they aren't really in the Heritage broader universe.
And so they had some groups on their task force that was working on Project Esther that were Jewish, but when the report came out, the core groups were these evangelical conservative organizations and some conservative think tanks. And the Jewish groups that were sort of on the list, the bigger list of Jewish groups on the task force, kind of tried to distance themselves from the project.
And how does this project in particular view and talk about critics of Israel's policies and supporters of Palestinian causes?
Well, it's really this idea that they are supporters of Hamas. So it's not just antisemitism. It's support for terrorism.
And I think the reason — or one of the reasons that they use that framework is that opens a whole new avenue of legal options to deal with them. So if you're a foundation that is providing, for example, material support to a terrorist organization, you can be shut down or sanctioned or face other consequences that you couldn't face even if the government sort of officially declared you were antisemitic.
That's legal, but supporting Hamas is not. And so that's one way that they set this up. And the other is that they take even kind of tenuous connections to campus protests or other demonstrations against Israel and equate all of that with antisemitism.
How exactly has the Trump administration implemented Project Esther so far?
So they haven't really commented on whether they're using Project Esther specifically or whether they're just using the same tactics.
And I'm not sure that it matters that much, but we have seen the defunding of universities to pressure them to address civil rights violations against Jewish students or alleged civil rights violations. That's one area. We have also seen immigration crackdowns, which have overlapped with campuses, but trying to deport and arrest foreign students, who they say are engaging in antisemitism.
These are all sort of tools that we saw suggested within Project Esther. There's a lot more vague stuff that it's a little bit hard to pin down, but those are two of the big examples.
So certainly the American Jewish population is not a monolith, but based on your reporting, what do American Jews think of this approach? Do they feel safer?
So we know in general from public opinion polling that Jews do not support President Trump's approach to antisemitism. He doesn't have majority support on really any of the tactics that he's implemented in the name of protecting American Jews, although in some areas we do see that more Jews support a couple of his strategies on college campuses, say, than support his job performance overall.
So there is a little segment that is open to it, even if they're skeptical of him as a president. But I think there's also a sense that, especially on college campuses, Jews are being used as sort of a pawn. So we saw, right, when Columbia University reached the settlement with the federal government, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, described it as a momentous conservative victory.
And she pointed to things that she said conservatives have been trying to do for many years around DEI and affirmative action and addressing left-wing bias on campus that didn't really have to do with Jews. And so there's a sense that Jews are being used as the excuse to launch this crackdown on colleges and universities, and that Jews are then going to be blamed as a result of that.
So I think there's a lot of anxiety that, rather than keeping Jews safe, some of these things may be inflaming those sort of tensions. On the other hand, some folks are really eager to see this address, to see the campus protests addressed more forcefully.
So it's a mixed opinion, but that's some of what I'm hearing from American Jews.
Arno Rosenfeld with The Forward, thank you so much.
Thanks.

These are all sort of tools that we saw suggested within Project Esther. There's a lot more vague stuff that it's a little bit hard to pin down, but those are two of the big examples.
So certainly the American Jewish population is not a monolith, but based on your reporting, what do American Jews think of this approach? Do they feel safer?
So we know in general from public opinion polling that Jews do not support President Trump's approach to antisemitism. He doesn't have majority support on really any of the tactics that he's implemented in the name of protecting American Jews, although in some areas we do see that more Jews support a couple of his strategies on college campuses, say, than support his job performance overall.
So there is a little segment that is open to it, even if they're skeptical of him as a president. But I think there's also a sense that, especially on college campuses, Jews are being used as sort of a pawn. So we saw, right, when Columbia University reached the settlement with the federal government, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, described it as a momentous conservative victory.
And she pointed to things that she said conservatives have been trying to do for many years around DEI and affirmative action and addressing left-wing bias on campus that didn't really have to do with Jews. And so there's a sense that Jews are being used as the excuse to launch this crackdown on colleges and universities, and that Jews are then going to be blamed as a result of that.
So I think there's a lot of anxiety that, rather than keeping Jews safe, some of these things may be inflaming those sort of tensions. On the other hand, some folks are really eager to see this address, to see the campus protests addressed more forcefully.
So it's a mixed opinion, but that's some of what I'm hearing from American Jews.
Arno Rosenfeld with The Forward, thank you so much.
Thanks.

BOSTON (AP) — Harvard University appeared in federal court Monday in a pivotal case in its battle with the Trump administration, as the storied institution argued the government illegally cut $2.6 billion in federal funding.
President Donald Trump’s administration has battered the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university with sanctions for months as it presses a series of demands on the Ivy League school, which he decries as a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism.

Harvard has resisted, and the lawsuit over the cuts to its research grants represents the primary challenge to the administration in a standoff that is being widely watched across higher education and beyond.
A lawyer for Harvard, Steven Lehotsky, said at Monday’s hearing the case is about the government trying to control the “inner workings” of Harvard. The funding cuts, if not reversed, could lead to the loss of research, damaged careers and the closing of labs, he said.
The case is before U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, who is presiding over lawsuits brought by Harvard against the administration’s efforts to keep it from hosting international students. In that case, she temporarily blocked the administration’s efforts.
At Monday’s hearing Harvard is asking her to reverse a series of funding freezes. Such a ruling, if it stands, would revive Harvard’s sprawling scientific and medical research operation and hundreds of projects that lost federal money.
A lawyer for the government, Michael Velchik, said the government has authority to cancel research grants when an institution is out of compliance with the president’s directives. He said episodes at Harvard violated Trump’s order combating antisemitism.
“Harvard wants billions of dollars and that is the only reason we are here,” Velchik said.
Burroughs pushed back, questioning how the government could make “ad-hoc” decisions to cancel grants and do so across Harvard without offering evidence that any of the research is antisemitic.
She also argued the government had provided “no documentation, no procedure” to “suss out” whether Harvard administrators “have taken enough steps or haven’t” to combat antisemitism.
“The consequences of that in terms of constitutional law are staggering,” she said. “I don’t think you can justify a contract action based on impermissible suppression of speech? Where do I have that wrong.”
Harvard’s lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university after it rejected a series of demands in an April 11 letter from a federal antisemitism task force. A second lawsuit over the cuts filed by the American Association of University Professors and its Harvard faculty chapter has been consolidated with the university’s.
The April letter demanded sweeping changes related to campus protests, academics and admissions. For example, the letter told Harvard to audit the viewpoints of students and faculty and admit more students or hire new professors if the campus was found to lack diverse points of view.
Harvard President Alan Garber has said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism but said no government “should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”
The same day Harvard rejected the demands, Trump officials moved to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants. Education Secretary Linda McMahon declared in May that Harvard would no longer be eligible for new grants, and weeks later the administration began canceling contracts with Harvard.
As Harvard fought the funding freeze in court, individual agencies began sending letters announcing that the frozen research grants were being terminated. They cited a clause that allows grants to be scrapped if they no longer align with government policies.
Harvard, which has the nation’s largest endowment at $53 billion, has moved to self-fund some of its research, but warned it can’t absorb the full cost of the federal cuts.
In court filings, the school said the government “fails to explain how the termination of funding for research to treat cancer, support veterans, and improve national security addresses antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the April demand letter was sent. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel contracts for policy reasons.
“It is the policy of the United States under the Trump Administration not to fund institutions that fail to adequately address antisemitism in their programs,” it said in court documents.
The research funding is only one front in Harvard’s fight with the federal government. The Trump administration also has sought to prevent the school from hosting foreign students, and Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.
Finally, last month, the Trump administration formally issued a finding that the school tolerated antisemitism — a step that eventually could jeopardize all of Harvard’s federal funding, including federal student loans or grants. The penalty is typically referred to as a “death sentence.”

The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.
“Over time, as the data record continues to expand, we will be able to observe even the rarest types of extreme lightning on Earth and investigate the broad impacts of lightning on society,” study lead author Michael Peterson, an atmospheric scientist in the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said in a statement.

Columbia University and the Trump administration have reached a deal that restores federal funding and research grant money to the university. As part of the agreement, Columbia will pay $200 million to the federal government over three years and an additional $21 million to resolve alleged civil rights violations against Jewish employees.
The university agreed to suspend, expel, or revoke degrees from some 70 students who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and it will issue a report to a monitor to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion is not promoted on campus.
Columbia, which was at risk of losing billions of dollars from the government, says it retains its academic freedom.
For a closer look at this agreement and what it means for a higher education in the U.S., I'm joined by Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University.
President Roth, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Thanks for joining us.
Michael Roth, President, Wesleyan University:
Thanks for having me.
So let's just start with your initial reaction. When you heard the news and the details of this settlement, what did you think?
Michael Roth:
Well, I felt like one must feel when you have paid a ransom in a kidnapping situation and the person who's been kidnapped is returned safely.
You think, thank goodness, the kid's OK, or the person kidnapped is OK. But I wouldn't phrase the agreement that led to the liberation of the kidnapped person. And so, in this case, I was pleased that this particular moment of assault on higher education by the Trump administration has been resolved, at least for now, although who knows. These agreements come and go with this White House.
I was and I am distressed that, in this country today, the executive branch of the federal government wants to be able to dictate terms to private universities, law firms, newspapers, TV stations. And so all of these things are evidence that the current administration is trying to erode support for institutions in civil society.
Let me put to you, if I may, what the acting president of Columbia University, Claire Shipman, said in an interview on CNN this morning defending the terms of the deal.
Claire Shipman, Acting President, Columbia University:
I think there are a couple of really important things about this agreement from our point of view. One, it doesn't cross the red lines that we laid out. It protects our academic integrity. That was, of course, essential to us.
And, two, it does reset our relationship with the federal government in terms of research funding. And it's not just money for Columbia. I mean, this is about science. It's about curing cancer, cutting-edge, boundary-breaking science that actually benefits the country and humanity.
President Roth, do you believe that, after this deal, Columbia can move forward with full academic freedom, as President Shipman there is saying? And what do you believe the downstream effects of making a deal like this are for other universities?
Well, it's very clear that if you annoy the White House in this regime, you could get sucked into a process of litigation or fines that bear no relation to the facts of the matter, but just become a way of expressing loyalty, of conforming to the wishes of the government.
We saw it at UVA just a week or two ago. You see it now at George Mason. This is an effort to tell universities, as they have told law firms, as they're telling newspapers and as they have done with TV stations, telling these organizations, you are not independent. If you contract with the federal government, we have a — we, the government, has the right to tell you what to do.
This agreement does protect many things at Columbia. And, again, I'm not criticizing them for signing it. I don't criticize the parent for paying a ransom to get their kids back. They're getting their science back. But they're also telling the federal government, you can tell us how to run our Middle East studies program, telling the federal government, you can tell us how many police officers we should have at a minimum on campus or how students should be disciplined.
The White House has determined how students should be disciplined at a private university. This is massive overreach. This is an assault on the independence of civil society in America. And conservatives, liberals, moderates, they should all be concerned when a White House tells you how to run your private associations.
So you're saying they should be concerned.
As you note, Columbia is not the only university that's been targeted by this administration. Harvard, as we have been covering, has actually been fighting the administration in court, but we know there's also settlement talks going on. Do you believe universities and colleges will have no other choice but to make some kind of deal in order to move forward?
Well, I do think that, when you're dealing with a very, very powerful entity like the federal government, especially when it doesn't obey its own laws — I mean, there are no findings of fact here about what the specific actions of antisemitism were — or discrimination against white people.
There's no findings of facts there. It's just, you give us $221 million, and then we allow you to compete for grants. I mean, it's a very old-fashioned game. You pay the powerful figure so that you can go along and continue to operate.
Now, you operate in a way, of course, that you don't want to annoy that powerful figure or that powerful organization. And it sends a chilling message across America that, if you have a late-night comedy show, if you have a law firm, if you are working in an educational institution or a library, or, as we read today, in a museum like the Smithsonian, if you don't please the president, you are at risk.
And, again, I don't blame them for trying to make the best of that situation, but, as Americans, I'm not worried about Columbia. I'm not worried about Wesleyan. I'm worried about the country, where we are being subject to a White House that thinks it could tell us what to do at every turn.
As you know, the administration has long argued that this was about combating antisemitism on campus. This was a deal welcomed by Columbia's Hillel Jewish organization.
The executive director said in part: ""The announcement's an important recognition of what Jewish students and families have expressed with increasing urgency. Antisemitism at Columbia is real. It has a tangible impact on Jewish students' sense of safety, belonging, and their civil rights.""
I guess the question, President Roth, is if it makes Jewish students and staff feel safer, did the administration pressure and the deal do what it intended to do?
How does paying the government $220 million to do basic science make Jews safer? As a Jew, I find this horrific.
I know antisemitism is real, and I know it was real and is real at Columbia, as it is in Congress, as it is in most places in the United States. But the idea that you pay off the government in order to get them off your back so you can do cancer research, and that's good for the Jews, I think it's ridiculous.
We don't need the White House to tell us antisemitism is real two weeks after the Defense Department contracts with Grok, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence entity after it praised Hitler. This is an administration that is not concerned with Jewish welfare. I am concerned with Jewish welfare as a Jew, as a professor, as a college president. I think it's really important to call out antisemitism.
But to pay up basically protection money in a way that's supposed to make Jews safer, I think, in the long run, it's — as we say in my community, it's not good for the Jews.
That is Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University, joining us tonight.
President Roth, thank you for your time.
Thank you for having me.

But they're also telling the federal government, you can tell us how to run our Middle East studies program, telling the federal government, you can tell us how many police officers we should have at a minimum on campus or how students should be disciplined.
The White House has determined how students should be disciplined at a private university. This is massive overreach. This is an assault on the independence of civil society in America. And conservatives, liberals, moderates, they should all be concerned when a White House tells you how to run your private associations.
So you're saying they should be concerned.
As you note, Columbia is not the only university that's been targeted by this administration. Harvard, as we have been covering, has actually been fighting the administration in court, but we know there's also settlement talks going on. Do you believe universities and colleges will have no other choice but to make some kind of deal in order to move forward?
Well, I do think that, when you're dealing with a very, very powerful entity like the federal government, especially when it doesn't obey its own laws — I mean, there are no findings of fact here about what the specific actions of antisemitism were — or discrimination against white people.
There's no findings of facts there. It's just, you give us $221 million, and then we allow you to compete for grants. I mean, it's a very old-fashioned game. You pay the powerful figure so that you can go along and continue to operate.
Now, you operate in a way, of course, that you don't want to annoy that powerful figure or that powerful organization. And it sends a chilling message across America that, if you have a late-night comedy show, if you have a law firm, if you are working in an educational institution or a library, or, as we read today, in a museum like the Smithsonian, if you don't please the president, you are at risk.
And, again, I don't blame them for trying to make the best of that situation, but, as Americans, I'm not worried about Columbia. I'm not worried about Wesleyan. I'm worried about the country, where we are being subject to a White House that thinks it could tell us what to do at every turn.
As you know, the administration has long argued that this was about combating antisemitism on campus. This was a deal welcomed by Columbia's Hillel Jewish organization.
The executive director said in part: ""The announcement's an important recognition of what Jewish students and families have expressed with increasing urgency. Antisemitism at Columbia is real. It has a tangible impact on Jewish students' sense of safety, belonging, and their civil rights.""
I guess the question, President Roth, is if it makes Jewish students and staff feel safer, did the administration pressure and the deal do what it intended to do?
How does paying the government $220 million to do basic science make Jews safer? As a Jew, I find this horrific.
I know antisemitism is real, and I know it was real and is real at Columbia, as it is in Congress, as it is in most places in the United States. But the idea that you pay off the government in order to get them off your back so you can do cancer research, and that's good for the Jews, I think it's ridiculous.
We don't need the White House to tell us antisemitism is real two weeks after the Defense Department contracts with Grok, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence entity after it praised Hitler. This is an administration that is not concerned with Jewish welfare. I am concerned with Jewish welfare as a Jew, as a professor, as a college president. I think it's really important to call out antisemitism.
But to pay up basically protection money in a way that's supposed to make Jews safer, I think, in the long run, it's — as we say in my community, it's not good for the Jews.
That is Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University, joining us tonight.
President Roth, thank you for your time.
Thank you for having me.

Amna Nawaz:
Columbia University and the Trump administration have reached a deal that restores federal funding and research grant money to the university. As part of the agreement, Columbia will pay $200 million to the federal government over three years and an additional $21 million to resolve alleged civil rights violations against Jewish employees.
The university agreed to suspend, expel, or revoke degrees from some 70 students who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and it will issue a report to a monitor to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion is not promoted on campus.
Columbia, which was at risk of losing billions of dollars from the government, says it retains its academic freedom.
For a closer look at this agreement and what it means for a higher education in the U.S., I'm joined by Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University.
President Roth, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Thanks for joining us.
Michael Roth, President, Wesleyan University:
Thanks for having me.
So let's just start with your initial reaction. When you heard the news and the details of this settlement, what did you think?
Michael Roth:
Well, I felt like one must feel when you have paid a ransom in a kidnapping situation and the person who's been kidnapped is returned safely.
You think, thank goodness, the kid's OK, or the person kidnapped is OK. But I wouldn't phrase the agreement that led to the liberation of the kidnapped person. And so, in this case, I was pleased that this particular moment of assault on higher education by the Trump administration has been resolved, at least for now, although who knows. These agreements come and go with this White House.
I was and I am distressed that, in this country today, the executive branch of the federal government wants to be able to dictate terms to private universities, law firms, newspapers, TV stations. And so all of these things are evidence that the current administration is trying to erode support for institutions in civil society.
Let me put to you, if I may, what the acting president of Columbia University, Claire Shipman, said in an interview on CNN this morning defending the terms of the deal.
Claire Shipman, Acting President, Columbia University:
I think there are a couple of really important things about this agreement from our point of view. One, it doesn't cross the red lines that we laid out. It protects our academic integrity. That was, of course, essential to us.
And, two, it does reset our relationship with the federal government in terms of research funding. And it's not just money for Columbia. I mean, this is about science. It's about curing cancer, cutting-edge, boundary-breaking science that actually benefits the country and humanity.
President Roth, do you believe that, after this deal, Columbia can move forward with full academic freedom, as President Shipman there is saying? And what do you believe the downstream effects of making a deal like this are for other universities?
Well, it's very clear that if you annoy the White House in this regime, you could get sucked into a process of litigation or fines that bear no relation to the facts of the matter, but just become a way of expressing loyalty, of conforming to the wishes of the government.
We saw it at UVA just a week or two ago. You see it now at George Mason. This is an effort to tell universities, as they have told law firms, as they're telling newspapers and as they have done with TV stations, telling these organizations, you are not independent. If you contract with the federal government, we have a — we, the government, has the right to tell you what to do.
This agreement does protect many things at Columbia. And, again, I'm not criticizing them for signing it. I don't criticize the parent for paying a ransom to get their kids back. They're getting their science back. But they're also telling the federal government, you can tell us how to run our Middle East studies program, telling the federal government, you can tell us how many police officers we should have at a minimum on campus or how students should be disciplined.
The White House has determined how students should be disciplined at a private university. This is massive overreach. This is an assault on the independence of civil society in America. And conservatives, liberals, moderates, they should all be concerned when a White House tells you how to run your private associations.
So you're saying they should be concerned.

Harvard, as we have been covering, has actually been fighting the administration in court, but we know there's also settlement talks going on. Do you believe universities and colleges will have no other choice but to make some kind of deal in order to move forward?
Well, I do think that, when you're dealing with a very, very powerful entity like the federal government, especially when it doesn't obey its own laws — I mean, there are no findings of fact here about what the specific actions of antisemitism were — or discrimination against white people.
There's no findings of facts there. It's just, you give us $221 million, and then we allow you to compete for grants. I mean, it's a very old-fashioned game. You pay the powerful figure so that you can go along and continue to operate.

Geoff Bennett:
The president of the University of Virginia is resigning following a pressure campaign by the Trump administration, marking what appears to be the first time the White House has successfully forced out a university leader.
James Ryan announced his departure today amid a Justice Department investigation into UVA's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. In a statement, Ryan said he could not fight for his job in good conscience since that would knowingly and willingly risk federal funding, student aid, and jobs for the university.
For a closer look at the impact and President Trump's broader battle with higher education, we're joined by Peter McDonough, vice president of the American Council on Education. The group represents nearly 1,600 colleges and universities.
Thank you for joining us.
Peter McDonough, Vice President and General Counsel, American Council on Education: Thank you.
It appears James Ryan resigned earlier than planned amid this pressure from the Trump administration and a DOJ investigation into UVA's DEI policy. So what does this say to you about the Trump administration's influence over university governance?
Peter McDonough:
Well, first and foremost, I think we all can agree that universities should be receptive to thoughtful criticism. And they should be accountable when they fall short.
But Congress has mandated certain types of processes. We tend to call them due process that we're supposed to be imagining everybody follows. But in terms of control over a university by the executive branch of the federal government and using the purse strings that Congress is essentially holding in terms of federal funding, there are specific rules or specific requirements or specific types of due process that is supposed to be respected and utilized when there is a question about whether a college or a university, public or private, has complied with federal law.
There's nothing in our — the federal system of government that enables the executive branch to micromanage all aspects of a university. And there's certainly nothing that enables it to force out a leader of a college or university, public or private.
Does Mr. Ryan's resignation, does this represent a tipping point in higher ed autonomy?
Well, I hope it doesn't. But we should all be concerned that it may.
I wouldn't have seen this coming. but, frankly, I should have and maybe more of us should have. Back in 2021, the vice president, appearing at a National Conservatism Conference, said we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country. He said it in a speech titled, ""The Universities Are the Enemy.""
That should worry us all. That should worry us on all ends of the political spectrum. It should worry us whether we are in statehouses or state legislatures, whether we are on the boards of public universities or whether we are on the boards or in leadership positions of private colleges and universities, because we don't have a federal system of higher education.
We have a mosaic that's made up of publics and privates, small and large, religious-based and not. And I think we can all agree that, over the decades, this mosaic of higher education has really, truly been the envy of the world. It's why people come here to go to college. And it's produced the economic vitality that we have experienced here. It's enabled us to have a level of national security and health benefits.
It allowed us to address some of the largest problems in medicine with a power that, frankly, starts in most instances in the research labs on our college campuses. And all of this is at risk.
There are those who argue that James Ryan's resignation was necessary because UVA didn't fully comply with efforts to dismantle its DEI programs.
Our team spoke with Ilya Shapiro with the Manhattan Institute, and he makes that point.
Ilya Shapiro, Manhattan Institute:
The school pledged to dismantle its DEI structures and programs, and there's some doubt about whether they did that. So the Justice Department was investigating and wanted to make sure that people weren't being treated differently based on race and ethnic background and all these other issues that this school, among others, had been having.
So it told them what needed to be done. And one of those things, I think, because President Ryan was deeply involved in DEI programming, including in his previous job at Harvard, that having new leadership made sense.
So do you believe the university was being transparent, or was this more a matter of rebranding, rather than real reform on its part?
Well, let's start with the realization, which I believe is accurate, that there has been no outcome to any investigation of the University of Virginia at this stage.
The clip that you played sound as if there had been a verdict without a trial. If they have a branding of DEI or a branding of inclusion or a branding of equity or even — a branding of equity, that doesn't make them illegal. And it certainly shouldn't make it a mandate that the president of one of the major research universities in this country, one of the major universities in this country, part of that mosaic, must step down before there is a conclusion of an investigation.

We have a mosaic that's made up of publics and privates, small and large, religious-based and not. And I think we can all agree that, over the decades, this mosaic of higher education has really, truly been the envy of the world. It's why people come here to go to college. And it's produced the economic vitality that we have experienced here. It's enabled us to have a level of national security and health benefits.
It allowed us to address some of the largest problems in medicine with a power that, frankly, starts in most instances in the research labs on our college campuses. And all of this is at risk.
There are those who argue that James Ryan's resignation was necessary because UVA didn't fully comply with efforts to dismantle its DEI programs.
Our team spoke with Ilya Shapiro with the Manhattan Institute, and he makes that point.
Ilya Shapiro, Manhattan Institute:
The school pledged to dismantle its DEI structures and programs, and there's some doubt about whether they did that. So the Justice Department was investigating and wanted to make sure that people weren't being treated differently based on race and ethnic background and all these other issues that this school, among others, had been having.
So it told them what needed to be done. And one of those things, I think, because President Ryan was deeply involved in DEI programming, including in his previous job at Harvard, that having new leadership made sense.
So do you believe the university was being transparent, or was this more a matter of rebranding, rather than real reform on its part?
Well, let's start with the realization, which I believe is accurate, that there has been no outcome to any investigation of the University of Virginia at this stage.
The clip that you played sound as if there had been a verdict without a trial. If they have a branding of DEI or a branding of inclusion or a branding of equity or even — a branding of equity, that doesn't make them illegal. And it certainly shouldn't make it a mandate that the president of one of the major research universities in this country, one of the major universities in this country, part of that mosaic, must step down before there is a conclusion of an investigation.

The president of the University of Virginia is resigning following a pressure campaign by the Trump administration, marking what appears to be the first time the White House has successfully forced out a university leader.
James Ryan announced his departure today amid a Justice Department investigation into UVA's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. In a statement, Ryan said he could not fight for his job in good conscience since that would knowingly and willingly risk federal funding, student aid, and jobs for the university.
For a closer look at the impact and President Trump's broader battle with higher education, we're joined by Peter McDonough, vice president of the American Council on Education. The group represents nearly 1,600 colleges and universities.
Thank you for joining us.
Peter McDonough, Vice President and General Counsel, American Council on Education: Thank you.
It appears James Ryan resigned earlier than planned amid this pressure from the Trump administration and a DOJ investigation into UVA's DEI policy. So what does this say to you about the Trump administration's influence over university governance?
Peter McDonough:
Well, first and foremost, I think we all can agree that universities should be receptive to thoughtful criticism. And they should be accountable when they fall short.
But Congress has mandated certain types of processes. We tend to call them due process that we're supposed to be imagining everybody follows. But in terms of control over a university by the executive branch of the federal government and using the purse strings that Congress is essentially holding in terms of federal funding, there are specific rules or specific requirements or specific types of due process that is supposed to be respected and utilized when there is a question about whether a college or a university, public or private, has complied with federal law.
There's nothing in our — the federal system of government that enables the executive branch to micromanage all aspects of a university. And there's certainly nothing that enables it to force out a leader of a college or university, public or private.
Does Mr. Ryan's resignation, does this represent a tipping point in higher ed autonomy?
Well, I hope it doesn't. But we should all be concerned that it may.
I wouldn't have seen this coming. but, frankly, I should have and maybe more of us should have. Back in 2021, the vice president, appearing at a National Conservatism Conference, said we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country. He said it in a speech titled, ""The Universities Are the Enemy.""
That should worry us all. That should worry us on all ends of the political spectrum. It should worry us whether we are in statehouses or state legislatures, whether we are on the boards of public universities or whether we are on the boards or in leadership positions of private colleges and universities, because we don't have a federal system of higher education.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The president of the University of Virginia, facing heavy pressure from conservative critics and the Trump administration over the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices, announced Friday that he was resigning rather than “fight the federal government.”
The departure of James Ryan, who had led the school since 2018, represents a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration’s effort to reshape higher education. Doing it at a public university marks a new frontier in a campaign that has almost exclusively targeted Ivy League schools. It also widens the rationale behind the government’s aggressive tactics, focusing on DEI rather than alleged tolerance of antisemitism.
Ryan had faced conservative criticism that he failed to heed federal orders to eliminate DEI policies, and his removal was pushed for by the Justice Department as it investigated the school, according to a person who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.

Ryan referenced the Trump administration pressure in a statement to the university community Friday in which he said he had submitted his resignation with a “very heavy heart.”
“To make a long story short, I am inclined to fight for what I believe in, and I believe deeply in this University,” he said. “But I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my job.”
Ryan had already decided that next year would be his last, he said, and remaining in his position until then would be “knowingly and willingly sacrificing this community.”
The New York Times first reported on the resignation and the Justice Department’s insistence on it. The Justice Department declined to comment Friday.

Ryan’s removal is another example of the Trump administration using “thuggery instead of rational discourse,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents university presidents.
“This is a dark day for the University of Virginia, a dark day for higher education, and it promises more of the same,” Mitchell said. “It’s clear the administration is not done and will use every tool that it can make or invent to exert its will over higher education.”
In a joint statement, Virginia’s Democratic senators said it was outrageous that the Trump administration would demand Ryan’s resignation over “‘culture war’ traps.” “This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future,” Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine said.
After campaigning on a promise to end “wokeness” in education, Trump signed a January action ordering the elimination of DEI programs and “radical indoctrination” across the nation’s schools and universities. The Education Department has opened investigations into dozens of colleges, arguing that diversity initiatives discriminate against white and Asian American students.
The response from schools has been scattered. Some have closed DEI offices, ended diversity scholarships and no longer require diversity statements as part of the hiring process. Some others have rebranded DEI work under other names, while some have held firm on diversity policies.

The University of Virginia became a flashpoint after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives. The school’s governing body voted to shutter the DEI office in March and end diversity policies in admissions, hiring, financial aid and other areas. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin celebrated the action, declaring that “DEI is done at the University of Virginia.”
Among those drawing attention to the Charlottesville campus was America First Legal, a conservative group founded by Trump aide Stephen Miller. In a May letter to the Justice Department, the group said the university failed to dismantle DEI programs and chose to “rename, repackage, and redeploy the same unlawful infrastructure under a lexicon of euphemisms.”
The group directly took aim at Ryan, noting that he joined hundreds of other college presidents in signing a public statement condemning the “overreach and political interference” of the Trump administration.
On Friday, the group said it will continue to use every available tool to root out what it has called discriminatory systems.
“This week’s developments make clear: public universities that accept federal funds do not have a license to violate the Constitution,” Megan Redshaw, an attorney at the group, said in a statement. “They do not get to impose ideological loyalty tests, enforce race and sex-based preferences, or defy lawful executive authority.”
Ryan was hired to lead the University of Virginia in 2018 and previously served as the dean of Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. Earlier in his career he spent more than a decade as a law professor at the University of Virginia. A biography on Harvard’s website credits Ryan with increasing the “size, strength and diversity” of the faculty, adding that building a diverse community was a priority.
Until now, the White House had directed most of its attention at Harvard University and other elite institutions that Trump sees as bastions of liberalism. Harvard has lost more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants amid its battle with the government, which has also attempted to block the school from hosting foreign students and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status.
Harvard and its $53 billion endowment are uniquely positioned to weather the government’s financial pressure. Public universities, however, are far more dependent on taxpayer money and could be more vulnerable. The University of Virginia’s $10 billion endowment is among the largest for public universities, while the vast majority have far less.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The president of the University of Virginia, facing heavy pressure from conservative critics and the Trump administration over the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices, announced Friday that he was resigning rather than “fight the federal government.”
The departure of James Ryan, who had led the school since 2018, represents a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration’s effort to reshape higher education. Doing it at a public university marks a new frontier in a campaign that has almost exclusively targeted Ivy League schools. It also widens the rationale behind the government’s aggressive tactics, focusing on DEI rather than alleged tolerance of antisemitism.
Ryan had faced conservative criticism that he failed to heed federal orders to eliminate DEI policies, and his removal was pushed for by the Justice Department as it investigated the school, according to a person who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.

Ryan referenced the Trump administration pressure in a statement to the university community Friday in which he said he had submitted his resignation with a “very heavy heart.”
“To make a long story short, I am inclined to fight for what I believe in, and I believe deeply in this University,” he said. “But I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my job.”
Ryan had already decided that next year would be his last, he said, and remaining in his position until then would be “knowingly and willingly sacrificing this community.”
The New York Times first reported on the resignation and the Justice Department’s insistence on it. The Justice Department declined to comment Friday.

Ryan’s removal is another example of the Trump administration using “thuggery instead of rational discourse,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents university presidents.
“This is a dark day for the University of Virginia, a dark day for higher education, and it promises more of the same,” Mitchell said. “It’s clear the administration is not done and will use every tool that it can make or invent to exert its will over higher education.”
In a joint statement, Virginia’s Democratic senators said it was outrageous that the Trump administration would demand Ryan’s resignation over “‘culture war’ traps.” “This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future,” Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine said.
After campaigning on a promise to end “wokeness” in education, Trump signed a January action ordering the elimination of DEI programs and “radical indoctrination” across the nation’s schools and universities. The Education Department has opened investigations into dozens of colleges, arguing that diversity initiatives discriminate against white and Asian American students.
The response from schools has been scattered. Some have closed DEI offices, ended diversity scholarships and no longer require diversity statements as part of the hiring process. Some others have rebranded DEI work under other names, while some have held firm on diversity policies.

The University of Virginia became a flashpoint after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives. The school’s governing body voted to shutter the DEI office in March and end diversity policies in admissions, hiring, financial aid and other areas. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin celebrated the action, declaring that “DEI is done at the University of Virginia.”
Among those drawing attention to the Charlottesville campus was America First Legal, a conservative group founded by Trump aide Stephen Miller. In a May letter to the Justice Department, the group said the university failed to dismantle DEI programs and chose to “rename, repackage, and redeploy the same unlawful infrastructure under a lexicon of euphemisms.”
The group directly took aim at Ryan, noting that he joined hundreds of other college presidents in signing a public statement condemning the “overreach and political interference” of the Trump administration.
On Friday, the group said it will continue to use every available tool to root out what it has called discriminatory systems.
“This week’s developments make clear: public universities that accept federal funds do not have a license to violate the Constitution,” Megan Redshaw, an attorney at the group, said in a statement. “They do not get to impose ideological loyalty tests, enforce race and sex-based preferences, or defy lawful executive authority.”
Ryan was hired to lead the University of Virginia in 2018 and previously served as the dean of Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. Earlier in his career he spent more than a decade as a law professor at the University of Virginia. A biography on Harvard’s website credits Ryan with increasing the “size, strength and diversity” of the faculty, adding that building a diverse community was a priority.
Until now, the White House had directed most of its attention at Harvard University and other elite institutions that Trump sees as bastions of liberalism. Harvard has lost more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants amid its battle with the government, which has also attempted to block the school from hosting foreign students and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status.
Harvard and its $53 billion endowment are uniquely positioned to weather the government’s financial pressure. Public universities, however, are far more dependent on taxpayer money and could be more vulnerable. The University of Virginia’s $10 billion endowment is among the largest for public universities, while the vast majority have far less.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration’s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students, delivering the Ivy League school another victory as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.
READ MORE: Judge temporarily blocks Trump’s ban on foreign students attending Harvard
The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves Harvard’s ability to host foreign students while the case is decided, but it falls short of resolving all of Harvard’s legal hurdles to hosting international students. Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard’s ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.
Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school’s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students — about a quarter of its total enrollment — to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.
The university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House’s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government’s action hours after Harvard sued.
Less than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump’s proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.
“We expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,” Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. “Our Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.”
The stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America’s oldest and wealthiest university.
The Trump administration’s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of “profound fear, concern, and confusion,” the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.
WATCH: What Trump’s legal and political clash with Harvard means for higher education
Still, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they’ll be able to attend the university.
For one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard’s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
Harvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn’t refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration’s policies, she still hasn’t heard back.
“Your personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,” Huang said in a social media post. “Why does it have to be so hard to go to school?”
Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after the university rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.
On Friday, the president said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address “their largescale improprieties” and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. “They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,” Trump’s post said.
WATCH: Harvard professor calls Trump’s attacks on funding and students ‘authoritarianism’
Trump’s administration first targeted Harvard’s international students in April. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short and on May 22 revoked Harvard’s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.
The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world’s top students, the school said in its lawsuit, and it harmed Harvard’s reputation as a global research hub. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit said.
The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard’s students, including two universities in Hong Kong.
Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its “core, legally-protected principles,” even after receiving federal ultimatums.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration’s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students, delivering the Ivy League school another victory as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.

The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves Harvard’s ability to host foreign students while the case is decided, but it falls short of resolving all of Harvard’s legal hurdles to hosting international students. Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard’s ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.
Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school’s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students — about a quarter of its total enrollment — to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.
The university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House’s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government’s action hours after Harvard sued.
Less than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump’s proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.
“We expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,” Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. “Our Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.”
The stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America’s oldest and wealthiest university.
The Trump administration’s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of “profound fear, concern, and confusion,” the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.
WATCH: What Trump’s legal and political clash with Harvard means for higher education
Still, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they’ll be able to attend the university.
For one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard’s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
Harvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn’t refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration’s policies, she still hasn’t heard back.
“Your personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,” Huang said in a social media post. “Why does it have to be so hard to go to school?”
Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after the university rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.
On Friday, the president said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address “their largescale improprieties” and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. “They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,” Trump’s post said.
WATCH: Harvard professor calls Trump’s attacks on funding and students ‘authoritarianism’
Trump’s administration first targeted Harvard’s international students in April. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short and on May 22 revoked Harvard’s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.
The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world’s top students, the school said in its lawsuit, and it harmed Harvard’s reputation as a global research hub. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit said.
The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard’s students, including two universities in Hong Kong.
Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its “core, legally-protected principles,” even after receiving federal ultimatums.

This represents a rapidly developing situation that could affect Tulane's research funding within the next 30 days.
While the funding cuts to women's health research are significant, particularly for institutions with strong medical and public health programs like Tulane, they represent a moderate operational impact rather than a severe threat to the university's existence.
","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds",https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/06/womens-health-scientific-innovation-funding-challenge/?utm_campaign=rss,2025-08-06 18:49:01,Scientific breakthroughs are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.,"Scientific breakthroughs — from next-generation vaccines to long-acting medications to prevent HIV — are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.
At a STAT event this week, Ruanne Barnabas, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, described the potential for progress following a 2022 study she helped lead, in which researchers found that a single dose of the HPV vaccine could be just as effective as two. She said it was “no accident” or simple stroke of luck that the vaccine performed so well.
“We can now do bespoke antigen design to make new vaccines — we can make vaccines in a room just about the size of this stage — and they can be highly efficacious,” she said.
The results of Barnabas’ study, which was backed by the Gates Foundation, led the World Health Organization to recommend a one-dose schedule of the vaccine against the human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer, as well as two-dose schedules — a breakthrough that reduced costs and simplified vaccine delivery worldwide.
At the same time, however, gains in women’s health are being threatened by funding issues. Five of Barnabas’ grants were affected by federal funding changes and by cuts to Harvard University. She said that the hardest part for her has been losing the partnerships and connections she has developed over years of working together.
“The hardest things are all the deep relationships and partnerships that you build over many years in order to move science forward. To have those stopped — in the midst of clinical trials and other things — that is very hard for participants, for partners, for being able to safely transition people out,” Barnabas said at the event, which was held at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
Jo-Ann Passmore, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, pointed to another recent innovation: the development of lenacapavir, an injection that provides six months of protection against HIV infection. The drug is particularly promising for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections.
“That felt like a really transformative, good news story for women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa,” Passmore said. “All of the research we do focuses on the major drivers of that, but until game-changers come along, like lenacapavir, all of the work we do seems to be incremental in how we solve the problem. I came into 2025 with this real sense of optimism and pride in what the field had achieved.”
But there are open questions about how the drug will get to people in need. While the drug’s manufacturer, Gilead, has agreed to provide the treatment at cost to 2 million people in lower-income countries, with the help of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the agreement does not include the U.S. government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has long been the world’s leading provider of HIV prevention drugs.
PEPFAR funding has been slashed by the Trump administration. In 2024, South Africa received $332.6 million in funding from the program, which accounted for 17% of the nation’s HIV treatment and prevention budget. Although some funding has resumed, many programs have had to find new financial support, or else shut down.
“Coming into 2025 with this vision of hope, only to have massive cuts to the USAID, NIH funding, PEPFAR … it completely crippled, in the blink of an eye, things that people have fought hard for 30 years,” Passmore said. “So, I’m sitting here humbled. We’ve survived. Six months later, we’re trying to rebuild programs that are rebuildable, but many of them will be lost.”
While there has been enormous advancement in medicine, research and funding specifically targeted toward women’s health still lag far behind. In an article published in the BMJ last week, Ru Cheng, the Gates Foundation’s director of women’s heath innovations, noted that globally, only 1% of research and development funding is allocated toward women’s health issues outside of oncology, and just 2% of all venture capital health investments are focused on women. The Gates Foundation announced Monday that it will pledge $2.5 billion through 2030 to support dozens of different approaches for improving women’s health, particularly focusing on research and development.
Scott Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Comanche Biopharma, which will receive some of that funding, explained that historically, there has not been enough money for novel drug development in women’s health.
“We’ve had too many efforts, at least in the pharmaceutical industry, in drug development, to simply repurpose drugs,” he said. “To take drugs that are already available, and ‘Let’s give it a try, they seem to be safe, so maybe they’ll be effective.’”
His startup is developing an RNA-based therapy for preeclampsia — a pregnancy-related condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and fetus. Currently, there are no targeted treatments available for it. Johnson hopes Comanche’s drug will be the first.
“We need more true successes,” Johnson said. “Success attracts capital. Success attracts interest.”
Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s commissioner of public health, emphasized the importance of funding for behavioral science and implementation research — studying how lifesaving interventions can actually reach patients.
“If you don’t do this research, if you don’t invest in that, it sits on the shelf,” she said. “For many women, they don’t know anything about lenacapavir, and they are at very high risk of HIV infection.”
Community research and engagement must come hand in hand with drug development, Ojikutu said.
“There’s some amazing things that are happening that could be appropriate in sub-Saharan Africa, versus here in Boston, versus rural Georgia, rural Mississippi. But I think that we need to be spending time, effort, energy, money, building infrastructure in behavioral science research,” Ojikutu said. “We need to get into communities and actually know whether we’ll use any of this research, any of the interventions that are being developed.”",StatNews,"['harvard university', 'nih']","['Ruanne Barnabas', 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'HPV', 'Barnabas', 'the Gates Foundation', 'the World Health Organization', 'Barnabas', 'Harvard University', 'Barnabas', 'the Broad Institute', 'Cambridge', 'Mass.', 'Jo-Ann Passmore', 'the University of Cape Town', 'South Africa', 'Gilead', 'the Global Fund', 'Tuberculosis', 'Malaria', 'U.S.', 'PEPFAR', 'Trump', 'South Africa', '$332.6 million', 'USAID', 'NIH', 'PEPFAR', 'BMJ', 'Ru Cheng', 'the Gates Foundation’s', 'The Gates Foundation', '$2.5 billion', 'Scott Johnson', 'preeclampsia', 'Johnson', 'Comanche', 'Johnson', 'Success', 'Success', 'Bisola Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Georgia', 'Mississippi', 'Ojikutu']","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds.

Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s commissioner of public health, emphasized the importance of funding for behavioral science and implementation research — studying how lifesaving interventions can actually reach patients.
“If you don’t do this research, if you don’t invest in that, it sits on the shelf,” she said. “For many women, they don’t know anything about lenacapavir, and they are at very high risk of HIV infection.”
Community research and engagement must come hand in hand with drug development, Ojikutu said.
“There’s some amazing things that are happening that could be appropriate in sub-Saharan Africa, versus here in Boston, versus rural Georgia, rural Mississippi. But I think that we need to be spending time, effort, energy, money, building infrastructure in behavioral science research,” Ojikutu said. “We need to get into communities and actually know whether we’ll use any of this research, any of the interventions that are being developed.”",StatNews,"['harvard university', 'nih']","['Ruanne Barnabas', 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'HPV', 'Barnabas', 'the Gates Foundation', 'the World Health Organization', 'Barnabas', 'Harvard University', 'Barnabas', 'the Broad Institute', 'Cambridge', 'Mass.', 'Jo-Ann Passmore', 'the University of Cape Town', 'South Africa', 'Gilead', 'the Global Fund', 'Tuberculosis', 'Malaria', 'U.S.', 'PEPFAR', 'Trump', 'South Africa', '$332.6 million', 'USAID', 'NIH', 'PEPFAR', 'BMJ', 'Ru Cheng', 'the Gates Foundation’s', 'The Gates Foundation', '$2.5 billion', 'Scott Johnson', 'preeclampsia', 'Johnson', 'Comanche', 'Johnson', 'Success', 'Success', 'Bisola Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Georgia', 'Mississippi', 'Ojikutu']","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds. Scientific breakthroughs — from next-generation vaccines to long-acting medications to prevent HIV — are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.
At a STAT event this week, Ruanne Barnabas, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, described the potential for progress following a 2022 study she helped lead, in which researchers found that a single dose of the HPV vaccine could be just as effective as two. She said it was “no accident” or simple stroke of luck that the vaccine performed so well.
“We can now do bespoke antigen design to make new vaccines — we can make vaccines in a room just about the size of this stage — and they can be highly efficacious,” she said.
The results of Barnabas’ study, which was backed by the Gates Foundation, led the World Health Organization to recommend a one-dose schedule of the vaccine against the human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer, as well as two-dose schedules — a breakthrough that reduced costs and simplified vaccine delivery worldwide.
At the same time, however, gains in women’s health are being threatened by funding issues. Five of Barnabas’ grants were affected by federal funding changes and by cuts to Harvard University. She said that the hardest part for her has been losing the partnerships and connections she has developed over years of working together.
“The hardest things are all the deep relationships and partnerships that you build over many years in order to move science forward. To have those stopped — in the midst of clinical trials and other things — that is very hard for participants, for partners, for being able to safely transition people out,” Barnabas said at the event, which was held at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
Jo-Ann Passmore, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, pointed to another recent innovation: the development of lenacapavir, an injection that provides six months of protection against HIV infection. The drug is particularly promising for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections.
“That felt like a really transformative, good news story for women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa,” Passmore said. “All of the research we do focuses on the major drivers of that, but until game-changers come along, like lenacapavir, all of the work we do seems to be incremental in how we solve the problem. I came into 2025 with this real sense of optimism and pride in what the field had achieved.”
But there are open questions about how the drug will get to people in need. While the drug’s manufacturer, Gilead, has agreed to provide the treatment at cost to 2 million people in lower-income countries, with the help of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the agreement does not include the U.S. government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has long been the world’s leading provider of HIV prevention drugs.
PEPFAR funding has been slashed by the Trump administration. In 2024, South Africa received $332.6 million in funding from the program, which accounted for 17% of the nation’s HIV treatment and prevention budget. Although some funding has resumed, many programs have had to find new financial support, or else shut down.
“Coming into 2025 with this vision of hope, only to have massive cuts to the USAID, NIH funding, PEPFAR … it completely crippled, in the blink of an eye, things that people have fought hard for 30 years,” Passmore said. “So, I’m sitting here humbled. We’ve survived. Six months later, we’re trying to rebuild programs that are rebuildable, but many of them will be lost.”
While there has been enormous advancement in medicine, research and funding specifically targeted toward women’s health still lag far behind. In an article published in the BMJ last week, Ru Cheng, the Gates Foundation’s director of women’s heath innovations, noted that globally, only 1% of research and development funding is allocated toward women’s health issues outside of oncology, and just 2% of all venture capital health investments are focused on women. The Gates Foundation announced Monday that it will pledge $2.5 billion through 2030 to support dozens of different approaches for improving women’s health, particularly focusing on research and development.
Scott Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Comanche Biopharma, which will receive some of that funding, explained that historically, there has not been enough money for novel drug development in women’s health.
“We’ve had too many efforts, at least in the pharmaceutical industry, in drug development, to simply repurpose drugs,” he said. “To take drugs that are already available, and ‘Let’s give it a try, they seem to be safe, so maybe they’ll be effective.’”
His startup is developing an RNA-based therapy for preeclampsia — a pregnancy-related condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and fetus. Currently, there are no targeted treatments available for it. Johnson hopes Comanche’s drug will be the first.
“We need more true successes,” Johnson said. “Success attracts capital. Success attracts interest.”

Canceling NIH grants was unlawful, per watchdog
An independent government agency has found that the Trump administration, by abruptly canceling NIH grants, violated a law that blocks presidents from withholding congressionally approved funding. The Government Accountability Office said in a report issued yesterday that HHS “has not shown that the delay was a permissible programmatic one.”
The findings are nonbinding but could empower Congress to push back against the Trump administration’s efforts to use the NIH budget as leverage over institutions like Columbia and Harvard. Read more on the report and what it means from STAT’s Anil Oza and Megan Molteni.
Raw milk is still dangerous
Twenty-one people are sick with E. coli or bacterial infections called campylobacter after consuming raw milk from a farm in Florida, per the AP. That includes six children. Seven people have been hospitalized, and at least two are suffering severe complications.
As a reminder, unpasteurized “raw” milk has long been considered unsafe because it can transmit pathogens like these. Nevermind the fact that H5N1 bird flu swept through dairy cattle across the country last year. While some people believe that it’s possible to regulate the product enough to make it safe, the black market for raw milk in states where it’s restricted is currently operating unchecked by the FDA.
$500 million
That’s how much funding for vaccine development HHS is canceling, according to an announcement yesterday from health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA, is terminating 22 grants supporting the development of mRNA vaccines, delivering a crippling blow to the country’s capacity to develop vaccines during the next pandemic or public health emergency.

Rare disease patients caught in Trump’s crosshairs
Global partnerships are a critical part of research on rare diseases — with so few patients to study in any one country, scientists have to search far and wide to identify the causes and test potential treatments. But as the Trump administration began allowing NIH grant reviews to resume this spring after a months-long pause, it also quietly tightened its requirements for applications with a foreign component. Now, forgetting to include a single document regarding a project’s foreign collaborators is grounds for a withdrawal without review (meaning the grant application gets denied).
“In the grand scheme of things, it’s not that much money for the federal government,” said Ellyn Kodroff, pictured above. “But it’s so devastating for this community.” Kodroff’s daughter has a rare digestive disorder and recently was able to begin an experimental treatment at the NIH Clinical Center. But the group running the trial had its latest funding request withdrawn because of the forgotten document.
It’s not the only group that’s been affected, STAT’s Megan Molteni learned. And the move is just the first in a much more sweeping effort to limit funding for foreign scientists. Read more from Megan on what the effects will be.
Wildfire smoke is also still really bad for you
Hundreds of wildfires burning across the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are pushing smoke across Canada and the American northeast. Canadian towns close to the wildfires are experiencing the worst of the smoke pollution, but even here in Boston, there was a brief ground stop at the airport Monday due to smoke and haze.
It’s getting better, but here’s a reminder:
Wildfire smoke is particularly harmful to kids’ respiratory health. One study found that a 10-unit increase of fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke was associated with a 30% spike in pediatric admissions for respiratory problems. “It’s quite a big bit of a difference,” the lead author said.
-
Researchers have found that people who live in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter could have a greater risk of developing dementia, with a particularly strong link seen between the condition and exposure to wildfire emissions. Still, there are a lot of questions remaining about other long-term effects.
-
In California, between 2008 and 2010, somewhere between 52,480 and 55,710 people died prematurely due to chronic exposure to wildfire smoke. The economic impact of those deaths was at least $432 billion.

For doctors, patient complaints beget … industry payments?
The more unsolicited complaints from patients that doctors receive, the more likely they are to take higher payments from industry, according to a study published yesterday in JAMA Network Open.
Researchers analyzed data from almost 72,000 doctors whose clinics participate in the Patient Advocacy Reporting System Index. Complaints logged there were cross-referenced with data on the same physicians in the Open Payments Program database. Those who had higher PARS scores — which are calculated with the number and the severity of patient complaints — were significantly more likely to accept general payments (meaning not for research), particularly for higher amounts.
Male physicians and those practicing in nonacademic settings were also more likely to accept larger general payments. The results demonstrate an urgent need for clinics to address conflict and trust between physicians and patients and to strengthen the management of financial conflicts of interest.

Canceling NIH grants was unlawful, per watchdog
An independent government agency has found that the Trump administration, by abruptly canceling NIH grants, violated a law that blocks presidents from withholding congressionally approved funding. The Government Accountability Office said in a report issued yesterday that HHS “has not shown that the delay was a permissible programmatic one.”
The findings are nonbinding but could empower Congress to push back against the Trump administration’s efforts to use the NIH budget as leverage over institutions like Columbia and Harvard. Read more on the report and what it means from STAT’s Anil Oza and Megan Molteni.
Raw milk is still dangerous
Twenty-one people are sick with E. coli or bacterial infections called campylobacter after consuming raw milk from a farm in Florida, per the AP. That includes six children. Seven people have been hospitalized, and at least two are suffering severe complications.
As a reminder, unpasteurized “raw” milk has long been considered unsafe because it can transmit pathogens like these. Nevermind the fact that H5N1 bird flu swept through dairy cattle across the country last year. While some people believe that it’s possible to regulate the product enough to make it safe, the black market for raw milk in states where it’s restricted is currently operating unchecked by the FDA.
$500 million
That’s how much funding for vaccine development HHS is canceling, according to an announcement yesterday from health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA, is terminating 22 grants supporting the development of mRNA vaccines, delivering a crippling blow to the country’s capacity to develop vaccines during the next pandemic or public health emergency. Helen Branswell has more, including insight from a former director of BARDA.
Rare disease patients caught in Trump’s crosshairs
Global partnerships are a critical part of research on rare diseases — with so few patients to study in any one country, scientists have to search far and wide to identify the causes and test potential treatments. But as the Trump administration began allowing NIH grant reviews to resume this spring after a months-long pause, it also quietly tightened its requirements for applications with a foreign component. Now, forgetting to include a single document regarding a project’s foreign collaborators is grounds for a withdrawal without review (meaning the grant application gets denied).
“In the grand scheme of things, it’s not that much money for the federal government,” said Ellyn Kodroff, pictured above. “But it’s so devastating for this community.” Kodroff’s daughter has a rare digestive disorder and recently was able to begin an experimental treatment at the NIH Clinical Center. But the group running the trial had its latest funding request withdrawn because of the forgotten document.
It’s not the only group that’s been affected, STAT’s Megan Molteni learned. And the move is just the first in a much more sweeping effort to limit funding for foreign scientists. Read more from Megan on what the effects will be.
Wildfire smoke is also still really bad for you
Hundreds of wildfires burning across the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are pushing smoke across Canada and the American northeast. Canadian towns close to the wildfires are experiencing the worst of the smoke pollution, but even here in Boston, there was a brief ground stop at the airport Monday due to smoke and haze.
It’s getting better, but here’s a reminder:
Wildfire smoke is particularly harmful to kids’ respiratory health. One study found that a 10-unit increase of fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke was associated with a 30% spike in pediatric admissions for respiratory problems. “It’s quite a big bit of a difference,” the lead author said.
-
Researchers have found that people who live in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter could have a greater risk of developing dementia, with a particularly strong link seen between the condition and exposure to wildfire emissions. Still, there are a lot of questions remaining about other long-term effects.
-
In California, between 2008 and 2010, somewhere between 52,480 and 55,710 people died prematurely due to chronic exposure to wildfire smoke. The economic impact of those deaths was at least $432 billion.

For doctors, patient complaints beget … industry payments?
The more unsolicited complaints from patients that doctors receive, the more likely they are to take higher payments from industry, according to a study published yesterday in JAMA Network Open.
Researchers analyzed data from almost 72,000 doctors whose clinics participate in the Patient Advocacy Reporting System Index. Complaints logged there were cross-referenced with data on the same physicians in the Open Payments Program database. Those who had higher PARS scores — which are calculated with the number and the severity of patient complaints — were significantly more likely to accept general payments (meaning not for research), particularly for higher amounts.
Male physicians and those practicing in nonacademic settings were also more likely to accept larger general payments. The results demonstrate an urgent need for clinics to address conflict and trust between physicians and patients and to strengthen the management of financial conflicts of interest.

But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.,"Scientific breakthroughs — from next-generation vaccines to long-acting medications to prevent HIV — are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.
At a STAT event this week, Ruanne Barnabas, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, described the potential for progress following a 2022 study she helped lead, in which researchers found that a single dose of the HPV vaccine could be just as effective as two. She said it was “no accident” or simple stroke of luck that the vaccine performed so well.
“We can now do bespoke antigen design to make new vaccines — we can make vaccines in a room just about the size of this stage — and they can be highly efficacious,” she said.
The results of Barnabas’ study, which was backed by the Gates Foundation, led the World Health Organization to recommend a one-dose schedule of the vaccine against the human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer, as well as two-dose schedules — a breakthrough that reduced costs and simplified vaccine delivery worldwide.
At the same time, however, gains in women’s health are being threatened by funding issues. Five of Barnabas’ grants were affected by federal funding changes and by cuts to Harvard University. She said that the hardest part for her has been losing the partnerships and connections she has developed over years of working together.
“The hardest things are all the deep relationships and partnerships that you build over many years in order to move science forward. To have those stopped — in the midst of clinical trials and other things — that is very hard for participants, for partners, for being able to safely transition people out,” Barnabas said at the event, which was held at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
Jo-Ann Passmore, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, pointed to another recent innovation: the development of lenacapavir, an injection that provides six months of protection against HIV infection. The drug is particularly promising for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections.
“That felt like a really transformative, good news story for women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa,” Passmore said. “All of the research we do focuses on the major drivers of that, but until game-changers come along, like lenacapavir, all of the work we do seems to be incremental in how we solve the problem. I came into 2025 with this real sense of optimism and pride in what the field had achieved.”
But there are open questions about how the drug will get to people in need. While the drug’s manufacturer, Gilead, has agreed to provide the treatment at cost to 2 million people in lower-income countries, with the help of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the agreement does not include the U.S. government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has long been the world’s leading provider of HIV prevention drugs.
PEPFAR funding has been slashed by the Trump administration. In 2024, South Africa received $332.6 million in funding from the program, which accounted for 17% of the nation’s HIV treatment and prevention budget. Although some funding has resumed, many programs have had to find new financial support, or else shut down.
“Coming into 2025 with this vision of hope, only to have massive cuts to the USAID, NIH funding, PEPFAR … it completely crippled, in the blink of an eye, things that people have fought hard for 30 years,” Passmore said. “So, I’m sitting here humbled. We’ve survived. Six months later, we’re trying to rebuild programs that are rebuildable, but many of them will be lost.”
While there has been enormous advancement in medicine, research and funding specifically targeted toward women’s health still lag far behind. In an article published in the BMJ last week, Ru Cheng, the Gates Foundation’s director of women’s heath innovations, noted that globally, only 1% of research and development funding is allocated toward women’s health issues outside of oncology, and just 2% of all venture capital health investments are focused on women. The Gates Foundation announced Monday that it will pledge $2.5 billion through 2030 to support dozens of different approaches for improving women’s health, particularly focusing on research and development.
Scott Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Comanche Biopharma, which will receive some of that funding, explained that historically, there has not been enough money for novel drug development in women’s health.
“We’ve had too many efforts, at least in the pharmaceutical industry, in drug development, to simply repurpose drugs,” he said. “To take drugs that are already available, and ‘Let’s give it a try, they seem to be safe, so maybe they’ll be effective.’”
His startup is developing an RNA-based therapy for preeclampsia — a pregnancy-related condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and fetus. Currently, there are no targeted treatments available for it. Johnson hopes Comanche’s drug will be the first.
“We need more true successes,” Johnson said. “Success attracts capital. Success attracts interest.”
Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s commissioner of public health, emphasized the importance of funding for behavioral science and implementation research — studying how lifesaving interventions can actually reach patients.
“If you don’t do this research, if you don’t invest in that, it sits on the shelf,” she said. “For many women, they don’t know anything about lenacapavir, and they are at very high risk of HIV infection.”
Community research and engagement must come hand in hand with drug development, Ojikutu said.
“There’s some amazing things that are happening that could be appropriate in sub-Saharan Africa, versus here in Boston, versus rural Georgia, rural Mississippi. But I think that we need to be spending time, effort, energy, money, building infrastructure in behavioral science research,” Ojikutu said. “We need to get into communities and actually know whether we’ll use any of this research, any of the interventions that are being developed.”",StatNews,"['harvard university', 'nih']","['Ruanne Barnabas', 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'HPV', 'Barnabas', 'the Gates Foundation', 'the World Health Organization', 'Barnabas', 'Harvard University', 'Barnabas', 'the Broad Institute', 'Cambridge', 'Mass.', 'Jo-Ann Passmore', 'the University of Cape Town', 'South Africa', 'Gilead', 'the Global Fund', 'Tuberculosis', 'Malaria', 'U.S.', 'PEPFAR', 'Trump', 'South Africa', '$332.6 million', 'USAID', 'NIH', 'PEPFAR', 'BMJ', 'Ru Cheng', 'the Gates Foundation’s', 'The Gates Foundation', '$2.5 billion', 'Scott Johnson', 'preeclampsia', 'Johnson', 'Comanche', 'Johnson', 'Success', 'Success', 'Bisola Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Georgia', 'Mississippi', 'Ojikutu']","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds.

In early May, Harvard president Dr. Alan Garber received a letter from the National Institutes of Health notifying him that hundreds of scientific grants had been rescinded, as the next step in the escalating battle between Harvard and the Trump administration. In an instant, the years-long collective efforts of countless researchers to cure illness, protect against disease, and improve human knowledge were thrown into disarray.
Still, the letter did offer Garber one ray of hope: He could appeal the decision to the director of the NIH, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. It was a name Garber knew exceptionally well. For more than three decades, Garber had nurtured Bhattacharya’s career, first as his undergraduate honors thesis adviser, and later as a colleague and peer. Now their relationship had entered dramatically new territory. As the letter made clear, Garber could go to his former student as a supplicant and plead with him to reconsider.

A pro-Palestine student activist group at University of Maryland (UMD) has won a $100,000 settlement from the university in a lawsuit stemming from administrators’ blocking of students’ vigil for Gaza last year.
Maryland’s Board of Public Works approved the settlement on Wednesday, marking a win for student pro-Palestine advocates after a judge issued a preliminary injunction in their favor last year.
According to Palestine Legal, a group representing the students, this is the largest financial penalty ever levied on a university for violating the free speech rights of students advocating for Palestinian rights.

“This legal victory reaffirms our protected rights to protest and speak out against the US-Israeli genocide of Palestinians — and we will keep exercising those rights,” said Daniela Colombi, a UMD SJP member, in a statement. “UMD SJP will spend every dollar of UMD’s $100,000 penalty for banning our vigil for Gaza toward organizing for a free Palestine and for collective liberation.”
Last year, the university’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) arranged to have a vigil on October 7, 2024, to mark one year of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. The group reserved a spot on campus for the vigil, and planned to have speeches and teach-ins at the event.
However, the university revoked the approval for the event and banned all student organized activities on campus from occurring that day.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Palestine Legal sued on behalf of the students, saying that the barring of the event violated the students’ First and 14th Amendment rights to free speech and equal protection under the law, respectively.
Administrators cited a letter and threats from pro-Israel students who tried to get the event shut down, in some cases outright calling for the university to shut down speech from the pro-Palestine activists. They brought up statements from pro-Israel individuals who made racist and violent threats against the protest.
A District Court judge granted CAIR and Palestine Legal a preliminary injunction, allowing the vigil to go on. Ultimately, the vigil went on, with over 500 attendees.
The judge argued that the group’s case was “likely to succeed” in its arguments on free speech, and dismissed the pro-Israel individuals’ threats, saying the case is “a matter of law, not of wounded feelings.” Crucially, the judge noted that the use of phrases like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and other pro-Palestine speech constitute free speech. He also found no credence behind the pro-Israel individuals’ argument that the vigil would interrupt Jewish students’ schedules or lives.
“The University of Maryland’s so-called October 7th blackout date was an obvious attempt to silence even the mourning of Palestinian lives,” said Ahmad Kaki, a CAIR attorney, in a statement. “We’re glad the Court saw through this transparent censorship attempt, and we hope this settlement sends a message to institutions across the country that capitulating to bad faith, anti-Palestinian pressure will cost you.”

UCLA is the first public university whose federal grants have been targeted by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The Trump administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against private colleges.

The Trump administration suspended $584 million in federal grants, the university said this week, after the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division announced it had found UCLA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.”
Last month UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued, arguing that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.

“Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” James B.

As part of the lawsuit settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university’s Jewish community. It also has created an Office of Campus and Community Safety, instituting new policies to manage protests on campus.
And UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.
Last month Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government’s allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restores more than $400 million in research grants.

In an announcement on Tuesday, the Trump-led justice department accused the Washington DC-based university of failing to take “meaningful action” to combat antisemitism during demonstrations there.
A statement that GWU spokesperson Shannon McClendon provided to the Guardian on Tuesday said it “condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in a civil and humane society.
“Moreover, our actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to addressing antisemitic actions and promoting an inclusive campus environment by upholding a safe, respectful, and accountable environment,” McClendon’s statement said. “We have taken appropriate action under university policy and the law to hold individuals or organizations accountable, including during the encampment, and we do not tolerate behavior that threatens our community or undermines meaningful dialogue.”
A statement from the justice department claimed that an investigation found that GWU was “deliberately indifferent to the hostile educational environment for Jewish, American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty” during the pro-Palestinian campus protests in April and May 2024.
In a letter to GWU’s president, the justice department alleged finding “numerous incidents of Jewish students being harassed, abused, intimidated and assaulted by protesters” – and that the university “was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its students and faculty” in violation of a provision of the US Civil Rights Act prohibiting programs that receive federal aid from discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.
The justice department asserted that it had given GWU the “opportunity to resolve this matter through a voluntary resolution agreement” to “ensure immediate remediation of these issues and related reforms to prevent the recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and abuse”.
The administration’s letter gave the university until 22 August to “to indicate whether GWU has interest in such a dialogue”.
McClendon’s statement said GWU on Tuesday was reviewing the administration’s letter “to respond in a timely manner”.
But McClendon’s statement did make it a point to say: “We have worked diligently with members of [GWU]’s Jewish community, as well as Jewish community organizations, city and federal authorities to protect the [university] community from antisemitism and we remain committed to working with them to ensure every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse.”
As reported by Reuters, protesters who were part of the 2024 campus demonstrations last year – including the group Jewish Voice for Peace and other Jewish groups – have accused the US government of conflating their criticism of Israel’s government, the country’s military assaults in Gaza, and Zionism as antisemitism.
Trump at the beginning of his second presidency in January nonetheless signed an executive order purporting to “combat antisemitism”. And in March, the administration warned at least 60 universities about possible action over alleged violations of federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism.
In July, Columbia agreed to pay $200m as part of a settlement to resolve government investigations into allegations that the school violated federal anti-discrimination laws by failing to protect students from antisemitic harassment on campus. The agreement also reportedly restored more than $400m in research grants to the university.
And on 6 August, the Trump administration suspended $584m in federal funding for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) over similar allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The administration accused UCLA of “acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students”.
The UC system’s president has said that it has agreed to talks with the administration over the allegations against UCLA.
In April, Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler of New York publicly condemned Trump linking antisemitism to his crackdown on US universities. Nadler said that the “president is weaponizing the real pain American Jews face to advance his desire to wield control over the truth-seeking academic institutions that stand as a bulwark against authoritarianism”.",The Guardian,"['civil rights', 'antisemitism', 'discrimination', 'executive order', 'federal authorities', 'executive order', 'research grants', 'protests']","['Donald Trump’s', 'George Washington University', 'GWU', 'the White House', 'Gaza', 'Trump', 'Washington DC', 'GWU', 'Shannon McClendon', 'Guardian', 'McClendon', 'the justice department', 'GWU', 'GWU', 'the justice department', 'the US Civil Rights Act', 'The justice department', 'GWU', 'GWU', 'McClendon', 'GWU', 'McClendon', 'GWU]’s', 'Reuters', 'Jewish Voice for Peace', 'US', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Trump', 'Columbia', '200', 'more than $400', 'Trump', '584', 'the University of California', 'Los Angeles', 'UCLA', 'UCLA', 'UC', 'UCLA', 'Jerry Nadler', 'New York', 'Trump', 'US', 'Nadler']","DoJ says George Washington University violated law over Jewish students and faculty.

In July, Columbia agreed to pay $200m as part of a settlement to resolve government investigations into allegations that the school violated federal anti-discrimination laws by failing to protect students from antisemitic harassment on campus. The agreement also reportedly restored more than $400m in research grants to the university.
And on 6 August, the Trump administration suspended $584m in federal funding for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) over similar allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The administration accused UCLA of “acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students”.
The UC system’s president has said that it has agreed to talks with the administration over the allegations against UCLA.
In April, Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler of New York publicly condemned Trump linking antisemitism to his crackdown on US universities. Nadler said that the “president is weaponizing the real pain American Jews face to advance his desire to wield control over the truth-seeking academic institutions that stand as a bulwark against authoritarianism”.",The Guardian,"['civil rights', 'antisemitism', 'discrimination', 'executive order', 'federal authorities', 'executive order', 'research grants', 'protests']","['Donald Trump’s', 'George Washington University', 'GWU', 'the White House', 'Gaza', 'Trump', 'Washington DC', 'GWU', 'Shannon McClendon', 'Guardian', 'McClendon', 'the justice department', 'GWU', 'GWU', 'the justice department', 'the US Civil Rights Act', 'The justice department', 'GWU', 'GWU', 'McClendon', 'GWU', 'McClendon', 'GWU]’s', 'Reuters', 'Jewish Voice for Peace', 'US', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Trump', 'Columbia', '200', 'more than $400', 'Trump', '584', 'the University of California', 'Los Angeles', 'UCLA', 'UCLA', 'UC', 'UCLA', 'Jerry Nadler', 'New York', 'Trump', 'US', 'Nadler']","DoJ says George Washington University violated law over Jewish students and faculty. Donald Trump’s administration says it has determined that George Washington University (GWU) has violated federal civil rights law, making it the latest higher educational institution to be targeted by the White House over last spring’s campus protests against Israeli military strikes in Gaza.
In an announcement on Tuesday, the Trump-led justice department accused the Washington DC-based university of failing to take “meaningful action” to combat antisemitism during demonstrations there.
A statement that GWU spokesperson Shannon McClendon provided to the Guardian on Tuesday said it “condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in a civil and humane society.
“Moreover, our actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to addressing antisemitic actions and promoting an inclusive campus environment by upholding a safe, respectful, and accountable environment,” McClendon’s statement said. “We have taken appropriate action under university policy and the law to hold individuals or organizations accountable, including during the encampment, and we do not tolerate behavior that threatens our community or undermines meaningful dialogue.”
A statement from the justice department claimed that an investigation found that GWU was “deliberately indifferent to the hostile educational environment for Jewish, American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty” during the pro-Palestinian campus protests in April and May 2024.
In a letter to GWU’s president, the justice department alleged finding “numerous incidents of Jewish students being harassed, abused, intimidated and assaulted by protesters” – and that the university “was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its students and faculty” in violation of a provision of the US Civil Rights Act prohibiting programs that receive federal aid from discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.
The justice department asserted that it had given GWU the “opportunity to resolve this matter through a voluntary resolution agreement” to “ensure immediate remediation of these issues and related reforms to prevent the recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and abuse”.
The administration’s letter gave the university until 22 August to “to indicate whether GWU has interest in such a dialogue”.
McClendon’s statement said GWU on Tuesday was reviewing the administration’s letter “to respond in a timely manner”.
But McClendon’s statement did make it a point to say: “We have worked diligently with members of [GWU]’s Jewish community, as well as Jewish community organizations, city and federal authorities to protect the [university] community from antisemitism and we remain committed to working with them to ensure every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse.”

It’s a dangerous Marxist ideology that was designed to indoctrinate young people into believing in racial hierarchies, aimed at replacing people of European descent in the United States.
This scenario may not be far off from how educational AI tools could be used in the future. Language models are being furiously pushed for use in K-12 and higher education to supposedly enhance student learning. Organizations like UNESCO and the Gates Foundation are even claiming that AI-based instruction will be key towards reducing educational inequities. The picture being painted is idyllic, liberational, and rings of democracy.
Yet consider that this is a system unlike any before seen in education: A few programs are driving the education of entire generations, and these systems are controlled by corporate-government partnerships. If I were a powerful political movement interested in banning certain pieces of information to maintain political control, I would see this setup as a perfect opportunity — far easier to manipulate than a system where human beings perform education. In fact, the Trump administration’s new “AI Action Plan” desires exactly this, arguing for a frightening future where AI is forced to censor social justice-related information.

Rather than solely focusing on whether it helps students learn or makes them lazier, we should consider the political angle: Educational AI is a perfect tool for widespread thought control, and if we don’t grapple with that possibility, we may be ignorantly ushering in an era of totalitarian information regimes unlike any we’ve seen before.
Public-Private Information Control
To date, the large language model (LLM) systems being pushed into classrooms are created and controlled by Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Corporations are actively signing agreements with institutions of education to incorporate their tools into the classroom. At the California State Universities, where I work as a postdoctoral researcher, there was recently a multimillion-dollar purchase of ChatGPT licenses for all students and staff. There are already initiatives being spun up to integrate AI-based personalized education into the engineering college, and more likely to come.
The corporations at the helm are not known for their love of information democracy, nor for their commitments to justice, equity, or peace. Consider movements to stop the genocide in Palestine. In 2023, Human Rights Watch wrote a lengthy report documenting Meta’s policies of censoring and shadow-banning accounts that put forward pro-Palestine information. Google has been cracking down on internal protests against its involvement with Israel’s military, firing employees who speak out against the tech giant’s dealings.
Politicians are also increasingly interested in extreme forms of information control to fit their agendas. PEN America documented a staggering 16,000 book bans in public schools in the U.S. since 2021, a level not seen since the McCarthy era. A database from the World Population Review shows that in 2025, 20 states have signed bans on teaching critical race theory into law. The Trump administration has devastated higher education by cutting off funding for schools who promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
It is not outside the realm of possibility to imagine Big Tech complying with far-right directives to ban information, as the industry has already shown shocking acceptance of its role building systems for mass surveillance and deportation, as well as to facilitate the genocide in Palestine.
A Perfect Tool for Totalitarianism
Just as in the early days of the internet, tech companies are gearing their marketing of educational AI systems toward visions of democratized information and equity. At first, the internet was also proselytized as a democratizing force in the world due to its ability to open information access for all. But now, in 2025, we know the multitude of ways the internet has been twisted by corporate and government influence: biased search results, information censorship, flagrant proliferation of misinformation, paywalls, and targeted advertisements.
Now imagine a world where educational AI does become as widespread as these companies would like. In every classroom, there are AI systems that students have access to for discussion and information. Teachers are using AI tools to structure their lesson plans and curricula. Eventually, if the forces looking to cut educational costs have their way, we might live in a world where teachers are a thing of the past; students may be more used to learning from “intelligent” machines than from other human beings.
These visions are not my own: They come directly from marketing materials from educational AI companies, universities, and foundations committed to eroding public education. OpenAI, Google, and Magic School argue on their websites that teachers are irreplaceable, but then continue to show how their tools can do core responsibilities of a teacher’s job: create lesson plans, quizzes, tests, directly tutor and converse with students. Stanford’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group convened faculty and industry leaders for an AI Education Summit, where they argue AI can “provide real-time feedback and suggestions to teachers (e.g., questions to ask in the class),” “summarize the classroom dynamics… includ[ing] student speaking time,” and “help teachers stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in their field. For example, a biology teacher would have AI update them on the latest breakthroughs in cancer research, or leverage AI to update their curriculum.” These companies’ generative AI tools are now being pushed as ways to “free up time and energy for teachers to work directly with students and families.”
Yet after AI takes care of the lesson planning, materials creation, tutoring, classroom management, and post-class reflection, what is left? These arguments seem to be a veiled cover for further privatization of education through technology, which has long been a target of business. A 2020 report by Boninger et al., as well as a review of AI education by Williamson & Eynon, warned that AI and edtech solutions have been heavily funded by foundations like the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative and Gates Foundation, promising underfunded schools that they will be provided free learning programs. If AI is used to do everything these companies say it will, there will be strong pressures on underfunded schools to cut costs — likely through teaching hours.
In these scenarios, there is a crucial piece of democratic society lost. Instead of having educational power distributed among thousands of teachers who have autonomy and freedom to resist educational policy they deem corrupt, this future world exerts top-down educational power via a few companies.
Totalitarianism — as described by luminaries such as Hannah Arendt, Theodor Adorno, and Carl Friedrich — enacts the total control of a population through force, fear, media control, and crucially, takeover of education. Yet, as Shoshana Zuboff articulates in her work The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the totalitarianisms of Mussolini and Stalin required “henchmen, and their henchmen, and their henchmen” — a vast network of humans to do the work.
If education became predominantly conducted by AI systems, the prospect is far simpler: Totalitarian education can be orchestrated by a few engineers. If a policy was passed to ban critical race theory, Google, Meta, and OpenAI need only compel workers to change the code and deploy an update that instantly suppresses critical thought for millions of students. These systems are a dictator’s dream, the perfect infrastructure for the imposition of totalitarianism.
Unfortunately, plans by the Trump administration seem to be heading this direction already. His administration’s recent AI Action Plan dedicates a section to “protect[ing] free speech and American values.” It pushes for “AI procured by the Federal government objectively [to] reflect truth rather than social engineering agendas.” Among these social engineering agendas it lists things like “misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change.” It declares that any LLM contractors working with government must “ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” Already, we are seeing a desire from far right, authoritarian forces to censor AI systems.
Having human teachers, who are capable of dissent, protest, and subversion in the face of unjust orders, is a key element of a democratic society. Yet this danger is buried under discussions of equity, efficiency, and personalized learning.
If We Miss This Chance, We May Be Lost
As of now, much of the critical focus on educational AI that has made it into mainstream press is focused on whether AI is actually helping students learn. While that discussion is important, its significance it pales in comparison to a discussion of technologically mediated education control. There is an urgent need to bring these considerations into the broader critical discourse, or else we risk missing the chance to stop this takeover.
As we are beginning to see in the aftermath of the Trump administration’s dismantling of higher education, it is far more difficult to build back social systems than to destroy them. Once AI systems are widely integrated into classrooms, pedagogy is altered to fit this new model, and teaching capacity is reduced in the name of cost-saving, it will be incredibly difficult to build back to a society-wide human-based system of education.
Right now, we have a chance to resist the takeover before it spreads and deepens. But we must act together, and quickly, if we are to stop the ushering in of a new age of totalitarian information control.

It is not outside the realm of possibility to imagine Big Tech complying with far-right directives to ban information, as the industry has already shown shocking acceptance of its role building systems for mass surveillance and deportation, as well as to facilitate the genocide in Palestine.
A Perfect Tool for Totalitarianism
Just as in the early days of the internet, tech companies are gearing their marketing of educational AI systems toward visions of democratized information and equity. At first, the internet was also proselytized as a democratizing force in the world due to its ability to open information access for all. But now, in 2025, we know the multitude of ways the internet has been twisted by corporate and government influence: biased search results, information censorship, flagrant proliferation of misinformation, paywalls, and targeted advertisements.
Now imagine a world where educational AI does become as widespread as these companies would like. In every classroom, there are AI systems that students have access to for discussion and information. Teachers are using AI tools to structure their lesson plans and curricula. Eventually, if the forces looking to cut educational costs have their way, we might live in a world where teachers are a thing of the past; students may be more used to learning from “intelligent” machines than from other human beings.
These visions are not my own: They come directly from marketing materials from educational AI companies, universities, and foundations committed to eroding public education. OpenAI, Google, and Magic School argue on their websites that teachers are irreplaceable, but then continue to show how their tools can do core responsibilities of a teacher’s job: create lesson plans, quizzes, tests, directly tutor and converse with students. Stanford’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group convened faculty and industry leaders for an AI Education Summit, where they argue AI can “provide real-time feedback and suggestions to teachers (e.g., questions to ask in the class),” “summarize the classroom dynamics… includ[ing] student speaking time,” and “help teachers stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in their field. For example, a biology teacher would have AI update them on the latest breakthroughs in cancer research, or leverage AI to update their curriculum.” These companies’ generative AI tools are now being pushed as ways to “free up time and energy for teachers to work directly with students and families.”
Yet after AI takes care of the lesson planning, materials creation, tutoring, classroom management, and post-class reflection, what is left? These arguments seem to be a veiled cover for further privatization of education through technology, which has long been a target of business. A 2020 report by Boninger et al., as well as a review of AI education by Williamson & Eynon, warned that AI and edtech solutions have been heavily funded by foundations like the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative and Gates Foundation, promising underfunded schools that they will be provided free learning programs. If AI is used to do everything these companies say it will, there will be strong pressures on underfunded schools to cut costs — likely through teaching hours.
In these scenarios, there is a crucial piece of democratic society lost. Instead of having educational power distributed among thousands of teachers who have autonomy and freedom to resist educational policy they deem corrupt, this future world exerts top-down educational power via a few companies.
Totalitarianism — as described by luminaries such as Hannah Arendt, Theodor Adorno, and Carl Friedrich — enacts the total control of a population through force, fear, media control, and crucially, takeover of education. Yet, as Shoshana Zuboff articulates in her work The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the totalitarianisms of Mussolini and Stalin required “henchmen, and their henchmen, and their henchmen” — a vast network of humans to do the work.
If education became predominantly conducted by AI systems, the prospect is far simpler: Totalitarian education can be orchestrated by a few engineers. If a policy was passed to ban critical race theory, Google, Meta, and OpenAI need only compel workers to change the code and deploy an update that instantly suppresses critical thought for millions of students. These systems are a dictator’s dream, the perfect infrastructure for the imposition of totalitarianism.
Unfortunately, plans by the Trump administration seem to be heading this direction already. His administration’s recent AI Action Plan dedicates a section to “protect[ing] free speech and American values.” It pushes for “AI procured by the Federal government objectively [to] reflect truth rather than social engineering agendas.” Among these social engineering agendas it lists things like “misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change.” It declares that any LLM contractors working with government must “ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” Already, we are seeing a desire from far right, authoritarian forces to censor AI systems.
Having human teachers, who are capable of dissent, protest, and subversion in the face of unjust orders, is a key element of a democratic society. Yet this danger is buried under discussions of equity, efficiency, and personalized learning.
If We Miss This Chance, We May Be Lost
As of now, much of the critical focus on educational AI that has made it into mainstream press is focused on whether AI is actually helping students learn. While that discussion is important, its significance it pales in comparison to a discussion of technologically mediated education control. There is an urgent need to bring these considerations into the broader critical discourse, or else we risk missing the chance to stop this takeover.
As we are beginning to see in the aftermath of the Trump administration’s dismantling of higher education, it is far more difficult to build back social systems than to destroy them. Once AI systems are widely integrated into classrooms, pedagogy is altered to fit this new model, and teaching capacity is reduced in the name of cost-saving, it will be incredibly difficult to build back to a society-wide human-based system of education.
Right now, we have a chance to resist the takeover before it spreads and deepens. But we must act together, and quickly, if we are to stop the ushering in of a new age of totalitarian information control.

Regardless of the label we use to describe them, this method of activism is quite popular and movements around the world use this tactic in many ways. Some groups temporarily take over a space simply to get attention for a certain issue. It can essentially be a tool of protest designed to make other people and governments hear their demands. People may put themselves in a place where they “aren’t supposed to be” to get media attention for their issue. They may block a freeway to bring attention to the issues of police violence and racialized urban inequalities, or they may climb a polluting factory to hang a protest banner in an off-limits space to embarrass a polluting company. In these ways, activists may take over spaces not with the intent of staying around and controlling them, but as Bart Cammaerts puts it, just to create “extreme speech acts — a crying out for visibility” designed to strengthen existing demands.
On the other hand, some protesters take over a space with the aim of physically disrupting a particular event: like blocking a meeting where people are making decisions that increase inequality, exclusion, or environmental damage. Examples of this would be the massive anti-globalization protests in Seattle, Genoa, Cancún and other sites where the World Trade Organization and other international financial institutions met in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There are also actions that use counteroccupation tactics in order to block a specific construction project, destructive activity, or the circulation of a dangerous commodity. The struggles against the Dakota Access Pipeline in South Dakota, the Maunakea telescope project in Hawai‘i, forest clearcutting projects in the American West, the Coastal GasLink pipeline in the Wet’suwet’en Nation, as well as the protests in the Nevada desert against nuclear weapons testing in the 1980s and 1990s, have all made use of these kinds of counteroccupation and blockade tactics.

These tactics up the ante from protests that simply make demands in that they are not just trying to be visible and get the public’s attention. They are physically blocking the state’s (or a corporation’s) ability to act in a place. Some movements may then use these blockading tactics in order to gain leverage for the demands they are making of existing governing institutions. However, some movements — and this is crucial — are not using the tactic to ‘ask’ for anything or improve their bargaining position for a demand. Instead, they are using the tactic with the aim of supplanting the existing institutions of governance.
From Counteroccupation to Replacing the State
One fall morning in 2014 I had the opportunity to watch something that changed forever how I viewed political action and strategies for social change. I was visiting the island of Okinawa to study U.S. plans to construct a new military base, but I was also there to learn more about activist tactics from the people who were organizing against it. On the beach that morning a group of protesters in kayaks set out to sea in order to make a rather daring claim: that a section of the nearby bay should not be a military base, but instead be a place governed by local citizens according to the ethics of environmental protection, community health, and peaceful international relations. What made their claim so daring was who they were up against and the way they made this claim. These kayakers heading off into the waters offshore of Henoko Village were taking on the combined power of the Japanese government and the U.S. military. These two powerful entities had decided — against overwhelming public opposition — that the waters off of Henoko should be filled in with sediment and turned into a new U.S. Marine Corps Air Station. The kayakers, however, had other ideas.
People in Okinawa have had a difficult time effectively influencing government policies through elections and protests. Okinawa’s history, though, is unique in that this group of islands (which lay between Taiwan and the main islands of Japan) were once the independent Ryukyu Kingdom, but they are now the site of a “double colonization” where local desires and self-determination have been thwarted by both the Japanese and U.S. governments. Okinawa was annexed by Imperial Japan in 1879 and since the end of World War II the main island has been used as a site for a large collection of U.S. military bases which cause numerous social and environmental problems for the 1.3 million residents. People have tried to influence the governments in Tokyo and Washington D.C. to reduce the burden of the bases, but negotiations in the 1990s only went so far as to promise closing one problematic base in central Okinawa (Futenma Marine Corps Air Station) if another one is built to replace it in the Henoko area of northern Okinawa. Island residents have elected anti-base governors one after another, but these governors have not been able to stop the plans of the U.S. military or the Japanese central government. In February of 2019 Okinawans went to the polls and over 72 percent voted against the construction of the new base. Both the U.S. and Japanese governments, however, claimed they did not have to heed the results. Even as the COVID-19 epidemic raged in the spring of 2020, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled the construction of the base could continue. In early 2025 that same court denied the last active lawsuit from the local prefectural government which aimed to halt the project. All told, thousands of people in Okinawa have engaged in protests that fill streets (and even whole stadiums) over the past few decades. Still, the construction moves forward. Faced with this situation, people in Okinawa have had to come up with other tactics to try and govern their island according to the will of the people that call it home.
It is not just in Okinawa, of course, where activists have been using this tactic. Over the past several decades, demonstrators around the world have been performing counteroccupations that attempt to replace the state. While many of these kinds of protests erupt in places (like Okinawa) with long histories of colonial repression, people living in other places are also now seeing that the systems of governance that rule over them are sliding evermore toward being dictatorial and unresponsive. Folks in these situations can learn a lot from the experiences of communities where people have long had few illusions that the ruling powers are trying to help.
That fall morning back in 2014, I hopped in a small boat piloted by activists who were supporting and documenting the kayakers. As we sped out of the fishing port and into the small swells of the Pacific, we caught up to kayakers arrayed on the edge of a floating barrier that marked the restricted area of the bay. On the other side of the barrier were Japanese Coast Guard boats warning the protesting kayakers not to enter the cordoned waters. Eventually, one kayaker traversed the floating barrier. As he did this, the Coast Guard boats descended upon him. This however left gaps in the Coast Guard’s line which other kayakers exploited. The bulk of kayakers then entered the waters that were officially the jurisdiction of the U.S. military. The outnumbered Coast Guard boats then retreated further back towards the shore and monitored the situation while the kayakers paddled triumphantly through the exclusion zone in the bay.
At first, I thought about this as a tactic of protest — a way for activists to use civil disobedience to bring attention to an issue, to voice disagreement with a government policy, and demand a change. Through observations and conversations with activists, however, I realized that something much different was happening. I had personally participated in and witnessed occupation-style protests in a number of places in the past, but that morning in Okinawa I saw that something more was going on here. These activists were not merely protesting against something and asking for different policies. They were directly taking over the space, challenging both the U.S. and Japanese governments’ right to govern the bay, and making the claim that the place should be managed according to local life-affirming ethics. In short, the kayakers were attempting to block the governing power of unrepresentative institutions while also replacing it with citizen-led management. The activists offshore from Henoko Village decided to halt the unwanted destruction of their bay by physically putting themselves in that place and attempting to change how it is governed. By doing so, they were undermining the legitimacy of claims by both the distant U.S. and Japanese central governments to control what happens in this place. In the local view, the Japanese and U.S. governments were undemocratically and unfairly imposing a massive project that was sure to have enormous negative political, economic, social, and environmental impacts. The solution to this was to try to wrest control of the space and govern it according to different ethics — whether the official state powers wanted them to or not. I refer to this as ‘replacing the state’.
From Resisting Authority to Creating Authority
Replacing the state involves having an alternative vision for a place, but it is also about claiming to have the authority and developing the ability to make the vision real in that space, regardless of what state or corporate actors want to do there. The importance of this cannot be understated. When activists move beyond reform, resilience, and resistance (the three Rs of ineffective activism) and start being able to dictate what will occur in a place and develop the logistical capabilities to make it happen, then activists cross a line into a whole new realm of strategy. Activists can stretch beyond electoral campaigns, government petitions, demands, and counteroccupations that just resist a project or policy. Instead, they can become creative agents building an alternative system of governing in a place.
To put it simply, more and more of us are recognizing that our current governments, electoral processes, and non-confrontational methods of protest are not enough to really make the world better. It is therefore critical to consider other strategies and tactics. The more people are excluded from effective participation in traditional politics, economic opportunity, maintaining the health of their communities, and environmental decision-making, the more it makes sense to pursue tactics like creating counteroccupations which aim to replace the state.

These two powerful entities had decided — against overwhelming public opposition — that the waters off of Henoko should be filled in with sediment and turned into a new U.S. Marine Corps Air Station. The kayakers, however, had other ideas.
People in Okinawa have had a difficult time effectively influencing government policies through elections and protests. Okinawa’s history, though, is unique in that this group of islands (which lay between Taiwan and the main islands of Japan) were once the independent Ryukyu Kingdom, but they are now the site of a “double colonization” where local desires and self-determination have been thwarted by both the Japanese and U.S. governments. Okinawa was annexed by Imperial Japan in 1879 and since the end of World War II the main island has been used as a site for a large collection of U.S. military bases which cause numerous social and environmental problems for the 1.3 million residents. People have tried to influence the governments in Tokyo and Washington D.C. to reduce the burden of the bases, but negotiations in the 1990s only went so far as to promise closing one problematic base in central Okinawa (Futenma Marine Corps Air Station) if another one is built to replace it in the Henoko area of northern Okinawa. Island residents have elected anti-base governors one after another, but these governors have not been able to stop the plans of the U.S. military or the Japanese central government. In February of 2019 Okinawans went to the polls and over 72 percent voted against the construction of the new base. Both the U.S. and Japanese governments, however, claimed they did not have to heed the results. Even as the COVID-19 epidemic raged in the spring of 2020, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled the construction of the base could continue. In early 2025 that same court denied the last active lawsuit from the local prefectural government which aimed to halt the project. All told, thousands of people in Okinawa have engaged in protests that fill streets (and even whole stadiums) over the past few decades. Still, the construction moves forward. Faced with this situation, people in Okinawa have had to come up with other tactics to try and govern their island according to the will of the people that call it home.
It is not just in Okinawa, of course, where activists have been using this tactic. Over the past several decades, demonstrators around the world have been performing counteroccupations that attempt to replace the state. While many of these kinds of protests erupt in places (like Okinawa) with long histories of colonial repression, people living in other places are also now seeing that the systems of governance that rule over them are sliding evermore toward being dictatorial and unresponsive. Folks in these situations can learn a lot from the experiences of communities where people have long had few illusions that the ruling powers are trying to help.
That fall morning back in 2014, I hopped in a small boat piloted by activists who were supporting and documenting the kayakers. As we sped out of the fishing port and into the small swells of the Pacific, we caught up to kayakers arrayed on the edge of a floating barrier that marked the restricted area of the bay. On the other side of the barrier were Japanese Coast Guard boats warning the protesting kayakers not to enter the cordoned waters. Eventually, one kayaker traversed the floating barrier. As he did this, the Coast Guard boats descended upon him. This however left gaps in the Coast Guard’s line which other kayakers exploited. The bulk of kayakers then entered the waters that were officially the jurisdiction of the U.S. military. The outnumbered Coast Guard boats then retreated further back towards the shore and monitored the situation while the kayakers paddled triumphantly through the exclusion zone in the bay.
At first, I thought about this as a tactic of protest — a way for activists to use civil disobedience to bring attention to an issue, to voice disagreement with a government policy, and demand a change. Through observations and conversations with activists, however, I realized that something much different was happening. I had personally participated in and witnessed occupation-style protests in a number of places in the past, but that morning in Okinawa I saw that something more was going on here. These activists were not merely protesting against something and asking for different policies. They were directly taking over the space, challenging both the U.S. and Japanese governments’ right to govern the bay, and making the claim that the place should be managed according to local life-affirming ethics. In short, the kayakers were attempting to block the governing power of unrepresentative institutions while also replacing it with citizen-led management. The activists offshore from Henoko Village decided to halt the unwanted destruction of their bay by physically putting themselves in that place and attempting to change how it is governed. By doing so, they were undermining the legitimacy of claims by both the distant U.S. and Japanese central governments to control what happens in this place. In the local view, the Japanese and U.S. governments were undemocratically and unfairly imposing a massive project that was sure to have enormous negative political, economic, social, and environmental impacts. The solution to this was to try to wrest control of the space and govern it according to different ethics — whether the official state powers wanted them to or not. I refer to this as ‘replacing the state’.
From Resisting Authority to Creating Authority
Replacing the state involves having an alternative vision for a place, but it is also about claiming to have the authority and developing the ability to make the vision real in that space, regardless of what state or corporate actors want to do there. The importance of this cannot be understated. When activists move beyond reform, resilience, and resistance (the three Rs of ineffective activism) and start being able to dictate what will occur in a place and develop the logistical capabilities to make it happen, then activists cross a line into a whole new realm of strategy. Activists can stretch beyond electoral campaigns, government petitions, demands, and counteroccupations that just resist a project or policy. Instead, they can become creative agents building an alternative system of governing in a place.
To put it simply, more and more of us are recognizing that our current governments, electoral processes, and non-confrontational methods of protest are not enough to really make the world better. It is therefore critical to consider other strategies and tactics. The more people are excluded from effective participation in traditional politics, economic opportunity, maintaining the health of their communities, and environmental decision-making, the more it makes sense to pursue tactics like creating counteroccupations which aim to replace the state.

From people taking over campus lawns in solidarity with Gaza, to freeway blockades protesting police and immigration enforcement brutality in 2025, to the 2011 Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street protests: the activist takeover of space is an important technique for social change and justice. While many folks refer to these takeovers as “occupations,” others (including myself) refer to them as “counteroccupations” to emphasize that many of the locations where they take place are already occupied by oppressive governments or institutions.
Regardless of the label we use to describe them, this method of activism is quite popular and movements around the world use this tactic in many ways. Some groups temporarily take over a space simply to get attention for a certain issue. It can essentially be a tool of protest designed to make other people and governments hear their demands. People may put themselves in a place where they “aren’t supposed to be” to get media attention for their issue. They may block a freeway to bring attention to the issues of police violence and racialized urban inequalities, or they may climb a polluting factory to hang a protest banner in an off-limits space to embarrass a polluting company. In these ways, activists may take over spaces not with the intent of staying around and controlling them, but as Bart Cammaerts puts it, just to create “extreme speech acts — a crying out for visibility” designed to strengthen existing demands.
On the other hand, some protesters take over a space with the aim of physically disrupting a particular event: like blocking a meeting where people are making decisions that increase inequality, exclusion, or environmental damage. Examples of this would be the massive anti-globalization protests in Seattle, Genoa, Cancún and other sites where the World Trade Organization and other international financial institutions met in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There are also actions that use counteroccupation tactics in order to block a specific construction project, destructive activity, or the circulation of a dangerous commodity. The struggles against the Dakota Access Pipeline in South Dakota, the Maunakea telescope project in Hawai‘i, forest clearcutting projects in the American West, the Coastal GasLink pipeline in the Wet’suwet’en Nation, as well as the protests in the Nevada desert against nuclear weapons testing in the 1980s and 1990s, have all made use of these kinds of counteroccupation and blockade tactics.

These tactics up the ante from protests that simply make demands in that they are not just trying to be visible and get the public’s attention. They are physically blocking the state’s (or a corporation’s) ability to act in a place. Some movements may then use these blockading tactics in order to gain leverage for the demands they are making of existing governing institutions. However, some movements — and this is crucial — are not using the tactic to ‘ask’ for anything or improve their bargaining position for a demand. Instead, they are using the tactic with the aim of supplanting the existing institutions of governance.
From Counteroccupation to Replacing the State
One fall morning in 2014 I had the opportunity to watch something that changed forever how I viewed political action and strategies for social change. I was visiting the island of Okinawa to study U.S. plans to construct a new military base, but I was also there to learn more about activist tactics from the people who were organizing against it. On the beach that morning a group of protesters in kayaks set out to sea in order to make a rather daring claim: that a section of the nearby bay should not be a military base, but instead be a place governed by local citizens according to the ethics of environmental protection, community health, and peaceful international relations. What made their claim so daring was who they were up against and the way they made this claim. These kayakers heading off into the waters offshore of Henoko Village were taking on the combined power of the Japanese government and the U.S. military. These two powerful entities had decided — against overwhelming public opposition — that the waters off of Henoko should be filled in with sediment and turned into a new U.S. Marine Corps Air Station.

Rashid Khalidi, the renowned Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, says he is withdrawing from teaching his fall course after the school has agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a major new deal with President Trump, who accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and agreed to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring. Columbia has accepted values that “are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily,” says Khalidi. In his piece in The Guardian, he wrote, “The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible.”

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.
One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia. I’ll be doing that in New York at The People’s Forum, time and date and details yet to be — yet to be arranged. So, I will be teaching this fall, but not at Columbia. And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.

Rashid Khalidi, the renowned Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, says he is withdrawing from teaching his fall course after the school has agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a major new deal with President Trump, who accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and agreed to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.
One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia.

And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia. I’ll be doing that in New York at The People’s Forum, time and date and details yet to be — yet to be arranged. So, I will be teaching this fall, but not at Columbia. And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.

Rashid Khalidi, the renowned Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, says he is withdrawing from teaching his fall course after the school has agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a major new deal with President Trump, who accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and agreed to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring. Columbia has accepted values that “are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily,” says Khalidi. In his piece in The Guardian, he wrote, “The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible.”

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.
One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia.

And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.

Rashid Khalidi, the renowned Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, says he is withdrawing from teaching his fall course after the school has agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a major new deal with President Trump, who accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza.

One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia. I’ll be doing that in New York at The People’s Forum, time and date and details yet to be — yet to be arranged. So, I will be teaching this fall, but not at Columbia. And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.
Press freedom is under attack
As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.

Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.

And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia. I’ll be doing that in New York at The People’s Forum, time and date and details yet to be — yet to be arranged. So, I will be teaching this fall, but not at Columbia. And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.

Rashid Khalidi, the renowned Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, says he is withdrawing from teaching his fall course after the school has agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a major new deal with President Trump, who accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and agreed to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring. Columbia has accepted values that “are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily,” says Khalidi.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.
One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?

They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.

They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.

One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.

One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia. I’ll be doing that in New York at The People’s Forum, time and date and details yet to be — yet to be arranged. So, I will be teaching this fall, but not at Columbia. And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.
Press freedom is under attack

In 1998, Tania Cepero Lopez surrendered herself at Miami International Airport as a Cuban refugee. She was a 19-year-old with a dream to become an educator. In the U.S. she believed she could freely teach ideas — even if they triggered debate or discomfort — without fear of repression from the government.
For some time, Cepero Lopez lived out that dream as a professor at Florida International University (FIU). Then Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the “Stop WOKE Act” in 2022, limiting instruction on topics involving race and gender.
Suddenly, Cepero Lopez watched as her university contorted to fit DeSantis’ agenda. Flags of countries disappeared from the student center. Colleagues stopped assigning certain readings, for fear they’d be “flagged under the new anti-woke laws,” she said. To defend academic freedom and “push back against intrusion from the state,” in 2024 Cepero Lopez became president of the United Faculty of Florida union at FIU.
Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
But a year later, the state is once again interfering — this time beyond the walls of Cepero Lopez’s classroom. As the fall semester looms and students and faculty prepare to return to campus, their educational futures teeter on the edge of DeSantis’ new demand: for Florida police to assist with immigration enforcement.
Another Tool for Mass Deportations
If President Donald Trump successfully fulfills his campaign promise of deporting 1 million people per year, it would make the largest expulsion operation in U.S. history. The Obama administration currently holds the record for deporting 3 million people.
To surpass the Democrats, the Trump administration has authorized a full-fledged constitutional assault on immigrants — detaining and deporting immigrants of all kinds without due process. Trump has also leveraged data from the Social Security Administration, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better target immigrants.
Agencies DHS directly oversees — Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which encompasses Border Patrol — are going to new extremes to meet Trump’s quota of detaining 3,000 people per day.
Agents wait at schools, courthouses, hospitals, and churches, searching for immigrants to detain. They point guns at passersby who take photos of their license plates and tackle people into the ground as they attempt to flee. They conduct surprise checkpoints miles from U.S. borders, confiscate phones, and question people about their political beliefs when they arrive in the U.S.
Immigrant rights activists warn that ICE’s unchecked actions normalize the pervasive presence of immigration enforcement in American life. Civil rights experts say insatiable levels of surveillance by CBP and other federal agencies, alongside racial profiling of Muslim, Native American, and Latinx citizens are deconstructing democracy. Soon, immigration enforcement may escalate even further.
On July 4, Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, granting ICE and CBP hundreds of billions of dollars to spend through September 2029 — the largest single investment in federal immigration agencies since DHS was created in 2003.
“These systems are now representing a threat to people of color, a threat to immigrants, [and] a threat to humanity,” said Afaf Nasher, licensed attorney and executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). “This is an emboldening of the profound racist roots of this country, and they have the weight and the authority of DHS behind them.”
But another set of tools in the government’s mass deportation arsenal are universities. Since the start of Trump’s second term, colleges in both blue and red states have signed contracts with ICE and CBP — agreeing to donate their resources to question and detain immigrants, train federal employees, and provide spaces for intelligence research.
Faculty, students, legal experts, and immigration advocates have spoken out about the increased potential for campus immigration raids and shared the threats they say these partnerships pose: to civil liberties and academic freedom, students being sent to the ICE camp in the Everglades, and more.
Universities are moving forward with the contracts anyway.
“Under the Direction and Supervision of ICE”
Higher education is in disarray as the Trump administration attacks the premise of academic freedom by stripping universities of funds, revoking international students’ visas, and tearing apart diversity, equity and inclusion programs, claiming they are discriminatory.
For Floridians like Cepero Lopez, Trump’s authoritarian playbook has been years in the making. DeSantis has exerted unchecked influence on Florida’s public university system since becoming governor in 2019.
On Jan. 27, DeSantis issued a directive for all state and county law enforcement agencies that operate a county jail to enter into ICE’s 287(g) Program, or face suspension. The DHS initiative, included as a provision in a law signed by the Clinton administration in 1996, deputizes local law enforcement to act as immigration agents.
Over 300 Florida agencies have finalized agreements with ICE, the largest collaboration with the federal agency by any state. Though the directive only applies to sheriff’s departments, several university police departments have opted to enter into agreements with ICE.
Cepero Lopez was devastated when she learned FIU police applied for the program. “The faculty [who] I’ve spoken with were equally distraught, disappointed, angry and just shocked,” she said.
Faculty and students have battled for FIU’s chief of police, Alexander Casas, to end the agreement since it was first made public in April by the Miami Herald. Yet on July 2, ICE completed its end of the contract, solidifying FIU’s participation in the 287(g) Task Force Model.
ICE documents show that the model grants police the authority to interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant about their status, as well as make arrests without a warrant, detain people on campus, and transport them to detention centers.
“Our faculty, students, [and] community members do not want this agreement,” Cepero Lopez said, stressing that universities should serve as places where faculty and students are free to teach and to learn.
The 287(g) Task Force Model was discontinued in 2012 by the Obama administration after the Department of Justice concluded that police departments engaged in a “pattern and practice” of constitutional violations. In 2022, the American Civil Liberties Union released a report detailing “widespread” racial profiling among law enforcement agencies that participated in 287(g).
Advocates have said for years that the program inadequately trains officers. ICE’s own fact sheet about the Task Force Model shows officers must undergo a virtual course that is only 40 hours long. Yet the contracts state that mandatory training for local law enforcement can be virtual, recorded or in-person — whichever ICE determines — before police are to pass examinations.
Though FIU faculty and students have protested, packed two town halls, and urged the board of trustees to intervene, warning that this partnership will have dire consequences for education, the university has yet to withdraw. Similar events have played out at both the University of South Florida and the University of Florida, each planning to participate in the Task Force Model despite students and faculty organizing to pressure their institutions out of the agreements.
Thomas Kennedy, a consultant and policy analyst with the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said universities’ collaborations with ICE are a result of a culture of intimidation and obeying in advance. Florida’s public universities have “become places of political patronage for DeSantis and his allies,” according to Kennedy.
In recent years, numerous presidents and board members with ties to DeSantis or the Republican Party, have been appointed at universities, including FIU. The college’s interim president, Jeanette Nuñez, is the former lieutenant governor of Florida. Nuñez is a proponent of 287(g) and believes undocumented students should no longer receive in-state tuition.
Casas claims the university’s agreement with ICE will help keep students safe and his department in control of immigration enforcement. The contracts show that university police will conduct immigration enforcement duties “under the direction and supervision of ICE.” They are even encouraged to contact ICE agents as they conduct immigration duties “for guidance.”
Casas did not respond to a list of questions from Prism regarding exactly how partnering with ICE will keep students safe and what from, how his department will maintain control while operating under ICE oversight, and why he has not terminated the agreement.
“This Is Real Fucking Life”
The television screen lit up with the name, “Donald Trump.” It was 2016. Christopher just learned who would be the next U.S. president.
“Who is going to save my family?” he wondered as he lay next to his mother in the bed they shared. She had only recently received her green card.
Christopher, a child of immigrants who is using a pseudonym for fear of retribution, told Prism that his family experienced a “perfect storm of social issues,” including poverty, the high cost of education, and varying immigration statuses. In 2013, he dropped out of college and swore he would never again attempt to obtain a degree, in part because college tuition proved to be a financial black hole for his family.
But during those early-morning hours when the 2016 election results poured in, Christopher gave himself a new mission: “Confront Donald Trump and anyone who wanted to enforce his perverse and racist agenda.”
So Christopher again pursued higher education and eventually got into law school. He chose St. John’s University, a private Catholic college in New York. He joined the Latin American Law Student Association (LALSA) and worked to build spaces for other first-generation students of color.
But now Trump is president again, and the university Christopher attends is partnering with CBP.
“People of color, communities of color, are being targeted indiscriminately,” said Christopher. “This was done without any input from any of the student groups, despite the political climate surrounding the Trump administration and, in particular, the world of immigration.”
St. John’s announced the partnership on May 6, months after immigration raids first began to unfold across the U.S. The university’s collaboration with the federal immigration agency will create an “Institute for Border Security and Intelligence Studies” and help CBP “identify intelligence challenges.” It will also allow CBP to utilize the university’s Homeland Security Simulation Lab, a “nexus for collaboration between academia and industry” in which faculty, students, and agencies use virtual reality to simulate scenarios such as terrorist attacks and civil disorder. CBP agents will also be permitted to advise faculty.
After Christopher and other students discovered the partnership, LALSA released a statement denouncing the university’s decision. “It signals a disturbing alignment with an agency whose history is marked by well-documented civil rights abuses, including racial profiling, inhumane detention practices, and the separation of families,” the statement read. “CBP’s presence on our campus represents surveillance and state violence, not scholarship.”
After learning of the partnership through a Facebook post, Jeremy Cruz was among a group of professors who signed a petition demanding its immediate termination.
“I worry about the physical safety of my students and colleagues,” said Cruz, who is an associate professor of theology and religious studies. “The administration is doing nothing in this moment to prepare the community to protect each other. It’s been left to us to just figure it out.”
On May 27, five faculty members hand-delivered the petition — then at 843 signatures — to university President Reverend Brian J. Shanley and Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Simon Møller, who signed the contract with CBP on April 30. The petition now sits at over 1,000 signatures.
University leaders have not responded to the petition, which lists five demands, including disclosing the full terms of the contract and implementing strict data protection measures to prevent illegal surveillance.
Cruz said the university has made no attempt to train faculty on how to respond if they encounter CBP agents on campus. “People feel scared that they’re going to lose their ability to even gather in public and express themselves,” he added.
Surveillance at St. John’s has happened before. After Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department placed informants in seven Muslim student groups at universities throughout the state. St. John’s was one of them, and the only private school.
“You are creating risk factors for students and their loved ones,” said Nasher, the executive director of CAIR-NY, who is also a St. John’s alum.
University spokesperson Brian Browne has consistently defended the partnership in the press, saying it will “create a more proficient current and future border security workforce.” Browne did not respond to a list of questions from Prism about the partnership.
But Christopher worries that students will feel emboldened to report their classmates to CBP. On Feb. 12, St. John’s sent out a university-wide email stating that it works to improve retention for undocumented students.
“Anything short of a termination of this partnership is tacit approval of what CBP has done [to immigrants] and a tacit acknowledgement of how expendable students of color — particularly anyone who’s undocumented — are,” said Christopher.
“For many of us, this isn’t some headline where you see parents being separated from their families. … This is real fucking life.”
A “New Apparatus” of Campus Policing
Beyond Trump’s extreme deportation agenda is a shift in how universities are working with federal and local law enforcement. The Palestine movement triggered an upheaval in universities calling police on their students and expanding on-campus surveillance.
When Trump returned to the presidency in January, he signed a series of executive orders further criminalizing international students’ speech and leveraging existing anti-terrorism law already used for decades to suppress Palestine activism. Conveniently, the laws now frame the student movement as a threat to national security.
As the country’s national security framework returns to its anti-immigrant roots, it brings to the forefront how often universities and schools are tapped to support and uphold federal agencies’ xenophobic agendas.
Degree programs funnel students into homeland security agencies. Agency-sponsored awards familiarize students — even high schoolers — with careers spent policing borders.
These efforts stem from higher education’s deep investment in American militarism and imperialism. During the 1960s, universities contributed research to the development of bombs used in Vietnam and allowed military contractors to recruit employees on their campuses, issues that continue to shape today’s divestment and anti-genocide movements.
“The mass public thinks that higher education is challenging the state,” said one professor who has studied campus policing for 10 years and asked not to be named out of concern for retaliation by the Trump administration. “There are less examples of that, and more examples of universities complying and being an arm of the state — [one] that’s better educated, cloaked in kindness, and good language.”
But for every university that is deepening ties with immigration agencies, there are others, including many in California, informing faculty and students of their rights and offering online classes to keep education accessible. At colleges outside of Florida, faculty members are leading efforts to keep university police from assisting ICE.
State University of New York (SUNY) faculty recently launched a campaign to pressure the entire school system to implement free legal counsel for immigrants and designate private spaces where agents cannot enter without a warrant. The initiative, led by a loose network of SUNY faculty that includes some at Stony Brook University (SBU) on Long Island, comes as SBU faculty fight to establish oversight of their university’s expanding surveillance capabilities.
The school’s former president, Maury McInnis, who now works at Yale, implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) department led by law enforcement. ERM is designed to oversee several university services and assess their risks to safety, security, and the institution’s overall brand. But exactly how it assesses risk remains unclear.
“It’s a public university, and we don’t know what ERM is doing,” said Josh Dubnau, a professor at SBU. “Then we started seeing surveillance coming.”
Faculty members discovered that ERM was looking to hire an intelligence specialist. According to the job posting, preferred qualifications included experience with several surveillance technology platforms like Shadow Dragon, a social media tool that collects vast amounts of data.
Without transparency over ERM’s internal operations, faculty worry that whatever data ERM collects could be used to assist ICE, suppress speech, and hinder academic freedom.
Robert Chase, associate professor of history at SBU and editor of “Caging Borders and Carceral States: Incarcerations, Immigration Detentions and Resistance,” said the combined moment of Palestine protests and immigration deportations will accelerate a “new apparatus” of campus policing, where students and faculty will be assessed “through the lens not of free speech or academic freedom, but of risk and national security threats.”
“What we say, how we speak, our political words that we use are something that law enforcement is going to … have instant access to,” Chase explained. “To read and map out our lives, our affiliation, our ideas across time. We’re seeing that as a political thing on the national level, but it has implications on the international level when we think about visas, migrant detention, deportation, and criminal implications on our students.”
Lawrence Zacarese, vice president of ERM, did not respond to a list of questions about faculty concerns, the intelligence specialist job posting, or whether the department has established any protocols against sharing information with immigration agents.
As universities further entangle themselves with the state, their decisions gravely impact the future of equal access to education. So far, preserving access is not being championed by university leaders, but by the students they welcomed to their schools, the faculty they employed to teach, and the people who believed they would feel at home on their campuses.
This includes people like Cruz, Christopher, and Cepero Lopez, who — in the face of rapidly expanding state power — refuse to accept it as normal.
“We have to unite to confront this adversary head on,” Christopher said. “We will defend our people.”
Disclosure: Julia Luz Betancourt graduated from St. John’s in 2022 and signed the petition demanding the university sever its relationship with CBP.

In 1998, Tania Cepero Lopez surrendered herself at Miami International Airport as a Cuban refugee. She was a 19-year-old with a dream to become an educator. In the U.S. she believed she could freely teach ideas — even if they triggered debate or discomfort — without fear of repression from the government.
For some time, Cepero Lopez lived out that dream as a professor at Florida International University (FIU). Then Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the “Stop WOKE Act” in 2022, limiting instruction on topics involving race and gender.
Suddenly, Cepero Lopez watched as her university contorted to fit DeSantis’ agenda. Flags of countries disappeared from the student center. Colleagues stopped assigning certain readings, for fear they’d be “flagged under the new anti-woke laws,” she said. To defend academic freedom and “push back against intrusion from the state,” in 2024 Cepero Lopez became president of the United Faculty of Florida union at FIU.

But a year later, the state is once again interfering — this time beyond the walls of Cepero Lopez’s classroom. As the fall semester looms and students and faculty prepare to return to campus, their educational futures teeter on the edge of DeSantis’ new demand: for Florida police to assist with immigration enforcement.
Another Tool for Mass Deportations
If President Donald Trump successfully fulfills his campaign promise of deporting 1 million people per year, it would make the largest expulsion operation in U.S. history. The Obama administration currently holds the record for deporting 3 million people.
To surpass the Democrats, the Trump administration has authorized a full-fledged constitutional assault on immigrants — detaining and deporting immigrants of all kinds without due process. Trump has also leveraged data from the Social Security Administration, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better target immigrants.
Agencies DHS directly oversees — Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which encompasses Border Patrol — are going to new extremes to meet Trump’s quota of detaining 3,000 people per day.
Agents wait at schools, courthouses, hospitals, and churches, searching for immigrants to detain. They point guns at passersby who take photos of their license plates and tackle people into the ground as they attempt to flee. They conduct surprise checkpoints miles from U.S. borders, confiscate phones, and question people about their political beliefs when they arrive in the U.S.
Immigrant rights activists warn that ICE’s unchecked actions normalize the pervasive presence of immigration enforcement in American life. Civil rights experts say insatiable levels of surveillance by CBP and other federal agencies, alongside racial profiling of Muslim, Native American, and Latinx citizens are deconstructing democracy. Soon, immigration enforcement may escalate even further.
On July 4, Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, granting ICE and CBP hundreds of billions of dollars to spend through September 2029 — the largest single investment in federal immigration agencies since DHS was created in 2003.
“These systems are now representing a threat to people of color, a threat to immigrants, [and] a threat to humanity,” said Afaf Nasher, licensed attorney and executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). “This is an emboldening of the profound racist roots of this country, and they have the weight and the authority of DHS behind them.”
But another set of tools in the government’s mass deportation arsenal are universities. Since the start of Trump’s second term, colleges in both blue and red states have signed contracts with ICE and CBP — agreeing to donate their resources to question and detain immigrants, train federal employees, and provide spaces for intelligence research.
Faculty, students, legal experts, and immigration advocates have spoken out about the increased potential for campus immigration raids and shared the threats they say these partnerships pose: to civil liberties and academic freedom, students being sent to the ICE camp in the Everglades, and more.
Universities are moving forward with the contracts anyway.
“Under the Direction and Supervision of ICE”
Higher education is in disarray as the Trump administration attacks the premise of academic freedom by stripping universities of funds, revoking international students’ visas, and tearing apart diversity, equity and inclusion programs, claiming they are discriminatory.
For Floridians like Cepero Lopez, Trump’s authoritarian playbook has been years in the making. DeSantis has exerted unchecked influence on Florida’s public university system since becoming governor in 2019.
On Jan. 27, DeSantis issued a directive for all state and county law enforcement agencies that operate a county jail to enter into ICE’s 287(g) Program, or face suspension. The DHS initiative, included as a provision in a law signed by the Clinton administration in 1996, deputizes local law enforcement to act as immigration agents.
Over 300 Florida agencies have finalized agreements with ICE, the largest collaboration with the federal agency by any state. Though the directive only applies to sheriff’s departments, several university police departments have opted to enter into agreements with ICE.
Cepero Lopez was devastated when she learned FIU police applied for the program. “The faculty [who] I’ve spoken with were equally distraught, disappointed, angry and just shocked,” she said.
Faculty and students have battled for FIU’s chief of police, Alexander Casas, to end the agreement since it was first made public in April by the Miami Herald. Yet on July 2, ICE completed its end of the contract, solidifying FIU’s participation in the 287(g) Task Force Model.
ICE documents show that the model grants police the authority to interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant about their status, as well as make arrests without a warrant, detain people on campus, and transport them to detention centers.
“Our faculty, students, [and] community members do not want this agreement,” Cepero Lopez said, stressing that universities should serve as places where faculty and students are free to teach and to learn.
The 287(g) Task Force Model was discontinued in 2012 by the Obama administration after the Department of Justice concluded that police departments engaged in a “pattern and practice” of constitutional violations. In 2022, the American Civil Liberties Union released a report detailing “widespread” racial profiling among law enforcement agencies that participated in 287(g).
Advocates have said for years that the program inadequately trains officers. ICE’s own fact sheet about the Task Force Model shows officers must undergo a virtual course that is only 40 hours long. Yet the contracts state that mandatory training for local law enforcement can be virtual, recorded or in-person — whichever ICE determines — before police are to pass examinations.
Though FIU faculty and students have protested, packed two town halls, and urged the board of trustees to intervene, warning that this partnership will have dire consequences for education, the university has yet to withdraw. Similar events have played out at both the University of South Florida and the University of Florida, each planning to participate in the Task Force Model despite students and faculty organizing to pressure their institutions out of the agreements.
Thomas Kennedy, a consultant and policy analyst with the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said universities’ collaborations with ICE are a result of a culture of intimidation and obeying in advance. Florida’s public universities have “become places of political patronage for DeSantis and his allies,” according to Kennedy.
In recent years, numerous presidents and board members with ties to DeSantis or the Republican Party, have been appointed at universities, including FIU. The college’s interim president, Jeanette Nuñez, is the former lieutenant governor of Florida. Nuñez is a proponent of 287(g) and believes undocumented students should no longer receive in-state tuition.
Casas claims the university’s agreement with ICE will help keep students safe and his department in control of immigration enforcement. The contracts show that university police will conduct immigration enforcement duties “under the direction and supervision of ICE.” They are even encouraged to contact ICE agents as they conduct immigration duties “for guidance.”
Casas did not respond to a list of questions from Prism regarding exactly how partnering with ICE will keep students safe and what from, how his department will maintain control while operating under ICE oversight, and why he has not terminated the agreement.
“This Is Real Fucking Life”
The television screen lit up with the name, “Donald Trump.” It was 2016. Christopher just learned who would be the next U.S. president.
“Who is going to save my family?” he wondered as he lay next to his mother in the bed they shared. She had only recently received her green card.
Christopher, a child of immigrants who is using a pseudonym for fear of retribution, told Prism that his family experienced a “perfect storm of social issues,” including poverty, the high cost of education, and varying immigration statuses. In 2013, he dropped out of college and swore he would never again attempt to obtain a degree, in part because college tuition proved to be a financial black hole for his family.
But during those early-morning hours when the 2016 election results poured in, Christopher gave himself a new mission: “Confront Donald Trump and anyone who wanted to enforce his perverse and racist agenda.”
So Christopher again pursued higher education and eventually got into law school. He chose St. John’s University, a private Catholic college in New York. He joined the Latin American Law Student Association (LALSA) and worked to build spaces for other first-generation students of color.
But now Trump is president again, and the university Christopher attends is partnering with CBP.
“People of color, communities of color, are being targeted indiscriminately,” said Christopher. “This was done without any input from any of the student groups, despite the political climate surrounding the Trump administration and, in particular, the world of immigration.”
St. John’s announced the partnership on May 6, months after immigration raids first began to unfold across the U.S. The university’s collaboration with the federal immigration agency will create an “Institute for Border Security and Intelligence Studies” and help CBP “identify intelligence challenges.” It will also allow CBP to utilize the university’s Homeland Security Simulation Lab, a “nexus for collaboration between academia and industry” in which faculty, students, and agencies use virtual reality to simulate scenarios such as terrorist attacks and civil disorder. CBP agents will also be permitted to advise faculty.
After Christopher and other students discovered the partnership, LALSA released a statement denouncing the university’s decision. “It signals a disturbing alignment with an agency whose history is marked by well-documented civil rights abuses, including racial profiling, inhumane detention practices, and the separation of families,” the statement read. “CBP’s presence on our campus represents surveillance and state violence, not scholarship.”
After learning of the partnership through a Facebook post, Jeremy Cruz was among a group of professors who signed a petition demanding its immediate termination.
“I worry about the physical safety of my students and colleagues,” said Cruz, who is an associate professor of theology and religious studies. “The administration is doing nothing in this moment to prepare the community to protect each other. It’s been left to us to just figure it out.”
On May 27, five faculty members hand-delivered the petition — then at 843 signatures — to university President Reverend Brian J. Shanley and Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Simon Møller, who signed the contract with CBP on April 30. The petition now sits at over 1,000 signatures.
University leaders have not responded to the petition, which lists five demands, including disclosing the full terms of the contract and implementing strict data protection measures to prevent illegal surveillance.
Cruz said the university has made no attempt to train faculty on how to respond if they encounter CBP agents on campus. “People feel scared that they’re going to lose their ability to even gather in public and express themselves,” he added.
Surveillance at St. John’s has happened before. After Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department placed informants in seven Muslim student groups at universities throughout the state. St. John’s was one of them, and the only private school.
“You are creating risk factors for students and their loved ones,” said Nasher, the executive director of CAIR-NY, who is also a St. John’s alum.
University spokesperson Brian Browne has consistently defended the partnership in the press, saying it will “create a more proficient current and future border security workforce.” Browne did not respond to a list of questions from Prism about the partnership.
But Christopher worries that students will feel emboldened to report their classmates to CBP. On Feb. 12, St. John’s sent out a university-wide email stating that it works to improve retention for undocumented students.
“Anything short of a termination of this partnership is tacit approval of what CBP has done [to immigrants] and a tacit acknowledgement of how expendable students of color — particularly anyone who’s undocumented — are,” said Christopher.
“For many of us, this isn’t some headline where you see parents being separated from their families. … This is real fucking life.”
A “New Apparatus” of Campus Policing
Beyond Trump’s extreme deportation agenda is a shift in how universities are working with federal and local law enforcement. The Palestine movement triggered an upheaval in universities calling police on their students and expanding on-campus surveillance.
When Trump returned to the presidency in January, he signed a series of executive orders further criminalizing international students’ speech and leveraging existing anti-terrorism law already used for decades to suppress Palestine activism. Conveniently, the laws now frame the student movement as a threat to national security.
As the country’s national security framework returns to its anti-immigrant roots, it brings to the forefront how often universities and schools are tapped to support and uphold federal agencies’ xenophobic agendas.
Degree programs funnel students into homeland security agencies. Agency-sponsored awards familiarize students — even high schoolers — with careers spent policing borders.
These efforts stem from higher education’s deep investment in American militarism and imperialism. During the 1960s, universities contributed research to the development of bombs used in Vietnam and allowed military contractors to recruit employees on their campuses, issues that continue to shape today’s divestment and anti-genocide movements.
“The mass public thinks that higher education is challenging the state,” said one professor who has studied campus policing for 10 years and asked not to be named out of concern for retaliation by the Trump administration. “There are less examples of that, and more examples of universities complying and being an arm of the state — [one] that’s better educated, cloaked in kindness, and good language.”
But for every university that is deepening ties with immigration agencies, there are others, including many in California, informing faculty and students of their rights and offering online classes to keep education accessible. At colleges outside of Florida, faculty members are leading efforts to keep university police from assisting ICE.
State University of New York (SUNY) faculty recently launched a campaign to pressure the entire school system to implement free legal counsel for immigrants and designate private spaces where agents cannot enter without a warrant. The initiative, led by a loose network of SUNY faculty that includes some at Stony Brook University (SBU) on Long Island, comes as SBU faculty fight to establish oversight of their university’s expanding surveillance capabilities.
The school’s former president, Maury McInnis, who now works at Yale, implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) department led by law enforcement. ERM is designed to oversee several university services and assess their risks to safety, security, and the institution’s overall brand. But exactly how it assesses risk remains unclear.
“It’s a public university, and we don’t know what ERM is doing,” said Josh Dubnau, a professor at SBU. “Then we started seeing surveillance coming.”
Faculty members discovered that ERM was looking to hire an intelligence specialist. According to the job posting, preferred qualifications included experience with several surveillance technology platforms like Shadow Dragon, a social media tool that collects vast amounts of data.
Without transparency over ERM’s internal operations, faculty worry that whatever data ERM collects could be used to assist ICE, suppress speech, and hinder academic freedom.
Robert Chase, associate professor of history at SBU and editor of “Caging Borders and Carceral States: Incarcerations, Immigration Detentions and Resistance,” said the combined moment of Palestine protests and immigration deportations will accelerate a “new apparatus” of campus policing, where students and faculty will be assessed “through the lens not of free speech or academic freedom, but of risk and national security threats.”
“What we say, how we speak, our political words that we use are something that law enforcement is going to … have instant access to,” Chase explained. “To read and map out our lives, our affiliation, our ideas across time. We’re seeing that as a political thing on the national level, but it has implications on the international level when we think about visas, migrant detention, deportation, and criminal implications on our students.”
Lawrence Zacarese, vice president of ERM, did not respond to a list of questions about faculty concerns, the intelligence specialist job posting, or whether the department has established any protocols against sharing information with immigration agents.
As universities further entangle themselves with the state, their decisions gravely impact the future of equal access to education. So far, preserving access is not being championed by university leaders, but by the students they welcomed to their schools, the faculty they employed to teach, and the people who believed they would feel at home on their campuses.
This includes people like Cruz, Christopher, and Cepero Lopez, who — in the face of rapidly expanding state power — refuse to accept it as normal.
“We have to unite to confront this adversary head on,” Christopher said. “We will defend our people.”
Disclosure: Julia Luz Betancourt graduated from St. John’s in 2022 and signed the petition demanding the university sever its relationship with CBP.
Press freedom is under attack

“For many of us, this isn’t some headline where you see parents being separated from their families. … This is real fucking life.”
A “New Apparatus” of Campus Policing
Beyond Trump’s extreme deportation agenda is a shift in how universities are working with federal and local law enforcement. The Palestine movement triggered an upheaval in universities calling police on their students and expanding on-campus surveillance.
When Trump returned to the presidency in January, he signed a series of executive orders further criminalizing international students’ speech and leveraging existing anti-terrorism law already used for decades to suppress Palestine activism. Conveniently, the laws now frame the student movement as a threat to national security.
As the country’s national security framework returns to its anti-immigrant roots, it brings to the forefront how often universities and schools are tapped to support and uphold federal agencies’ xenophobic agendas.
Degree programs funnel students into homeland security agencies. Agency-sponsored awards familiarize students — even high schoolers — with careers spent policing borders.
These efforts stem from higher education’s deep investment in American militarism and imperialism. During the 1960s, universities contributed research to the development of bombs used in Vietnam and allowed military contractors to recruit employees on their campuses, issues that continue to shape today’s divestment and anti-genocide movements.
“The mass public thinks that higher education is challenging the state,” said one professor who has studied campus policing for 10 years and asked not to be named out of concern for retaliation by the Trump administration. “There are less examples of that, and more examples of universities complying and being an arm of the state — [one] that’s better educated, cloaked in kindness, and good language.”
But for every university that is deepening ties with immigration agencies, there are others, including many in California, informing faculty and students of their rights and offering online classes to keep education accessible. At colleges outside of Florida, faculty members are leading efforts to keep university police from assisting ICE.
State University of New York (SUNY) faculty recently launched a campaign to pressure the entire school system to implement free legal counsel for immigrants and designate private spaces where agents cannot enter without a warrant. The initiative, led by a loose network of SUNY faculty that includes some at Stony Brook University (SBU) on Long Island, comes as SBU faculty fight to establish oversight of their university’s expanding surveillance capabilities.
The school’s former president, Maury McInnis, who now works at Yale, implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) department led by law enforcement. ERM is designed to oversee several university services and assess their risks to safety, security, and the institution’s overall brand. But exactly how it assesses risk remains unclear.
“It’s a public university, and we don’t know what ERM is doing,” said Josh Dubnau, a professor at SBU. “Then we started seeing surveillance coming.”
Faculty members discovered that ERM was looking to hire an intelligence specialist. According to the job posting, preferred qualifications included experience with several surveillance technology platforms like Shadow Dragon, a social media tool that collects vast amounts of data.
Without transparency over ERM’s internal operations, faculty worry that whatever data ERM collects could be used to assist ICE, suppress speech, and hinder academic freedom.
Robert Chase, associate professor of history at SBU and editor of “Caging Borders and Carceral States: Incarcerations, Immigration Detentions and Resistance,” said the combined moment of Palestine protests and immigration deportations will accelerate a “new apparatus” of campus policing, where students and faculty will be assessed “through the lens not of free speech or academic freedom, but of risk and national security threats.”
“What we say, how we speak, our political words that we use are something that law enforcement is going to … have instant access to,” Chase explained. “To read and map out our lives, our affiliation, our ideas across time. We’re seeing that as a political thing on the national level, but it has implications on the international level when we think about visas, migrant detention, deportation, and criminal implications on our students.”
Lawrence Zacarese, vice president of ERM, did not respond to a list of questions about faculty concerns, the intelligence specialist job posting, or whether the department has established any protocols against sharing information with immigration agents.
As universities further entangle themselves with the state, their decisions gravely impact the future of equal access to education. So far, preserving access is not being championed by university leaders, but by the students they welcomed to their schools, the faculty they employed to teach, and the people who believed they would feel at home on their campuses.
This includes people like Cruz, Christopher, and Cepero Lopez, who — in the face of rapidly expanding state power — refuse to accept it as normal.
“We have to unite to confront this adversary head on,” Christopher said. “We will defend our people.”
Disclosure: Julia Luz Betancourt graduated from St. John’s in 2022 and signed the petition demanding the university sever its relationship with CBP.

In 1998, Tania Cepero Lopez surrendered herself at Miami International Airport as a Cuban refugee. She was a 19-year-old with a dream to become an educator. In the U.S. she believed she could freely teach ideas — even if they triggered debate or discomfort — without fear of repression from the government.
For some time, Cepero Lopez lived out that dream as a professor at Florida International University (FIU). Then Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the “Stop WOKE Act” in 2022, limiting instruction on topics involving race and gender.
Suddenly, Cepero Lopez watched as her university contorted to fit DeSantis’ agenda. Flags of countries disappeared from the student center. Colleagues stopped assigning certain readings, for fear they’d be “flagged under the new anti-woke laws,” she said. To defend academic freedom and “push back against intrusion from the state,” in 2024 Cepero Lopez became president of the United Faculty of Florida union at FIU.
Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
But a year later, the state is once again interfering — this time beyond the walls of Cepero Lopez’s classroom. As the fall semester looms and students and faculty prepare to return to campus, their educational futures teeter on the edge of DeSantis’ new demand: for Florida police to assist with immigration enforcement.
Another Tool for Mass Deportations
If President Donald Trump successfully fulfills his campaign promise of deporting 1 million people per year, it would make the largest expulsion operation in U.S. history. The Obama administration currently holds the record for deporting 3 million people.
To surpass the Democrats, the Trump administration has authorized a full-fledged constitutional assault on immigrants — detaining and deporting immigrants of all kinds without due process. Trump has also leveraged data from the Social Security Administration, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better target immigrants.
Agencies DHS directly oversees — Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which encompasses Border Patrol — are going to new extremes to meet Trump’s quota of detaining 3,000 people per day.
Agents wait at schools, courthouses, hospitals, and churches, searching for immigrants to detain. They point guns at passersby who take photos of their license plates and tackle people into the ground as they attempt to flee. They conduct surprise checkpoints miles from U.S. borders, confiscate phones, and question people about their political beliefs when they arrive in the U.S.
Immigrant rights activists warn that ICE’s unchecked actions normalize the pervasive presence of immigration enforcement in American life. Civil rights experts say insatiable levels of surveillance by CBP and other federal agencies, alongside racial profiling of Muslim, Native American, and Latinx citizens are deconstructing democracy. Soon, immigration enforcement may escalate even further.
On July 4, Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, granting ICE and CBP hundreds of billions of dollars to spend through September 2029 — the largest single investment in federal immigration agencies since DHS was created in 2003.
“These systems are now representing a threat to people of color, a threat to immigrants, [and] a threat to humanity,” said Afaf Nasher, licensed attorney and executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). “This is an emboldening of the profound racist roots of this country, and they have the weight and the authority of DHS behind them.”
But another set of tools in the government’s mass deportation arsenal are universities. Since the start of Trump’s second term, colleges in both blue and red states have signed contracts with ICE and CBP — agreeing to donate their resources to question and detain immigrants, train federal employees, and provide spaces for intelligence research.
Faculty, students, legal experts, and immigration advocates have spoken out about the increased potential for campus immigration raids and shared the threats they say these partnerships pose: to civil liberties and academic freedom, students being sent to the ICE camp in the Everglades, and more.
Universities are moving forward with the contracts anyway.
“Under the Direction and Supervision of ICE”
Higher education is in disarray as the Trump administration attacks the premise of academic freedom by stripping universities of funds, revoking international students’ visas, and tearing apart diversity, equity and inclusion programs, claiming they are discriminatory.
For Floridians like Cepero Lopez, Trump’s authoritarian playbook has been years in the making. DeSantis has exerted unchecked influence on Florida’s public university system since becoming governor in 2019.
On Jan. 27, DeSantis issued a directive for all state and county law enforcement agencies that operate a county jail to enter into ICE’s 287(g) Program, or face suspension. The DHS initiative, included as a provision in a law signed by the Clinton administration in 1996, deputizes local law enforcement to act as immigration agents.
Over 300 Florida agencies have finalized agreements with ICE, the largest collaboration with the federal agency by any state. Though the directive only applies to sheriff’s departments, several university police departments have opted to enter into agreements with ICE.
Cepero Lopez was devastated when she learned FIU police applied for the program. “The faculty [who] I’ve spoken with were equally distraught, disappointed, angry and just shocked,” she said.
Faculty and students have battled for FIU’s chief of police, Alexander Casas, to end the agreement since it was first made public in April by the Miami Herald. Yet on July 2, ICE completed its end of the contract, solidifying FIU’s participation in the 287(g) Task Force Model.
ICE documents show that the model grants police the authority to interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant about their status, as well as make arrests without a warrant, detain people on campus, and transport them to detention centers.
“Our faculty, students, [and] community members do not want this agreement,” Cepero Lopez said, stressing that universities should serve as places where faculty and students are free to teach and to learn.
The 287(g) Task Force Model was discontinued in 2012 by the Obama administration after the Department of Justice concluded that police departments engaged in a “pattern and practice” of constitutional violations. In 2022, the American Civil Liberties Union released a report detailing “widespread” racial profiling among law enforcement agencies that participated in 287(g).
Advocates have said for years that the program inadequately trains officers. ICE’s own fact sheet about the Task Force Model shows officers must undergo a virtual course that is only 40 hours long. Yet the contracts state that mandatory training for local law enforcement can be virtual, recorded or in-person — whichever ICE determines — before police are to pass examinations.
Though FIU faculty and students have protested, packed two town halls, and urged the board of trustees to intervene, warning that this partnership will have dire consequences for education, the university has yet to withdraw. Similar events have played out at both the University of South Florida and the University of Florida, each planning to participate in the Task Force Model despite students and faculty organizing to pressure their institutions out of the agreements.
Thomas Kennedy, a consultant and policy analyst with the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said universities’ collaborations with ICE are a result of a culture of intimidation and obeying in advance. Florida’s public universities have “become places of political patronage for DeSantis and his allies,” according to Kennedy.
In recent years, numerous presidents and board members with ties to DeSantis or the Republican Party, have been appointed at universities, including FIU. The college’s interim president, Jeanette Nuñez, is the former lieutenant governor of Florida. Nuñez is a proponent of 287(g) and believes undocumented students should no longer receive in-state tuition.
Casas claims the university’s agreement with ICE will help keep students safe and his department in control of immigration enforcement. The contracts show that university police will conduct immigration enforcement duties “under the direction and supervision of ICE.” They are even encouraged to contact ICE agents as they conduct immigration duties “for guidance.”
Casas did not respond to a list of questions from Prism regarding exactly how partnering with ICE will keep students safe and what from, how his department will maintain control while operating under ICE oversight, and why he has not terminated the agreement.
“This Is Real Fucking Life”
The television screen lit up with the name, “Donald Trump.” It was 2016. Christopher just learned who would be the next U.S. president.
“Who is going to save my family?” he wondered as he lay next to his mother in the bed they shared. She had only recently received her green card.
Christopher, a child of immigrants who is using a pseudonym for fear of retribution, told Prism that his family experienced a “perfect storm of social issues,” including poverty, the high cost of education, and varying immigration statuses. In 2013, he dropped out of college and swore he would never again attempt to obtain a degree, in part because college tuition proved to be a financial black hole for his family.
But during those early-morning hours when the 2016 election results poured in, Christopher gave himself a new mission: “Confront Donald Trump and anyone who wanted to enforce his perverse and racist agenda.”
So Christopher again pursued higher education and eventually got into law school. He chose St. John’s University, a private Catholic college in New York. He joined the Latin American Law Student Association (LALSA) and worked to build spaces for other first-generation students of color.
But now Trump is president again, and the university Christopher attends is partnering with CBP.
“People of color, communities of color, are being targeted indiscriminately,” said Christopher. “This was done without any input from any of the student groups, despite the political climate surrounding the Trump administration and, in particular, the world of immigration.”
St. John’s announced the partnership on May 6, months after immigration raids first began to unfold across the U.S. The university’s collaboration with the federal immigration agency will create an “Institute for Border Security and Intelligence Studies” and help CBP “identify intelligence challenges.” It will also allow CBP to utilize the university’s Homeland Security Simulation Lab, a “nexus for collaboration between academia and industry” in which faculty, students, and agencies use virtual reality to simulate scenarios such as terrorist attacks and civil disorder. CBP agents will also be permitted to advise faculty.
After Christopher and other students discovered the partnership, LALSA released a statement denouncing the university’s decision. “It signals a disturbing alignment with an agency whose history is marked by well-documented civil rights abuses, including racial profiling, inhumane detention practices, and the separation of families,” the statement read. “CBP’s presence on our campus represents surveillance and state violence, not scholarship.”
After learning of the partnership through a Facebook post, Jeremy Cruz was among a group of professors who signed a petition demanding its immediate termination.
“I worry about the physical safety of my students and colleagues,” said Cruz, who is an associate professor of theology and religious studies. “The administration is doing nothing in this moment to prepare the community to protect each other. It’s been left to us to just figure it out.”
On May 27, five faculty members hand-delivered the petition — then at 843 signatures — to university President Reverend Brian J. Shanley and Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Simon Møller, who signed the contract with CBP on April 30. The petition now sits at over 1,000 signatures.
University leaders have not responded to the petition, which lists five demands, including disclosing the full terms of the contract and implementing strict data protection measures to prevent illegal surveillance.
Cruz said the university has made no attempt to train faculty on how to respond if they encounter CBP agents on campus. “People feel scared that they’re going to lose their ability to even gather in public and express themselves,” he added.
Surveillance at St. John’s has happened before. After Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department placed informants in seven Muslim student groups at universities throughout the state. St. John’s was one of them, and the only private school.
“You are creating risk factors for students and their loved ones,” said Nasher, the executive director of CAIR-NY, who is also a St. John’s alum.
University spokesperson Brian Browne has consistently defended the partnership in the press, saying it will “create a more proficient current and future border security workforce.” Browne did not respond to a list of questions from Prism about the partnership.
But Christopher worries that students will feel emboldened to report their classmates to CBP. On Feb. 12, St. John’s sent out a university-wide email stating that it works to improve retention for undocumented students.
“Anything short of a termination of this partnership is tacit approval of what CBP has done [to immigrants] and a tacit acknowledgement of how expendable students of color — particularly anyone who’s undocumented — are,” said Christopher.
“For many of us, this isn’t some headline where you see parents being separated from their families. … This is real fucking life.”

Understanding what drives Trump’s actions is not an easy task. His approach to power stems from his greedy self-centeredness and self-serving purposes, but his actions also reveal a leader who has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions and the rule of law, one whose own political support stems from anti-immigrant hatred, racism, and sexism. In that sense, Trump’s actions and policies represent a specific ideological orientation that works hand-in-hand with the implementation of his economic agenda.
In this exclusive interview for Truthout, renowned feminist and socialist economist Nancy Folbre offers a unique and insightful way of looking at who benefits from Trump’s actions, and explaining why those actions are being pursued in the manner that they are. Folbre is professor emerita of economics and director of the Program on Gender and Care Work at the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She is the author of several books, including, most recently The Rise and Decline of Patriarchal Systems: An Intersectional Political Economy.
C.J. Polychroniou: The first few months of the Trump administration have brought dramatic changes to government and society through the launching of the most systemic and aggressive assault on federal protections and civil rights, and the pursuit of an economic agenda that is thoroughly anti-environment and specifically designed to widen the gap between rich and poor in the United States. With this in mind, it has often been said that Trump does not have an ideology, yet his actions seem to suggest otherwise. So let’s start by discussing Trump and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). What’s behind the war on DEI programs?

Nancy Folbre: Underlying motives are never perfectly clear, even to those acting on them. Like most economists trying to explain behavior, I tend to first ask, “who benefits?” and it’s certainly clear that Trump’s recent policies delivered Big Beautiful Benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, which include him and his family.
However, many of Trump’s policies — especially those related to his current tariff war — do not seem driven by capitalist interests in the traditional sense. They protect existing wealth and offer speculative opportunities in cybercurrencies but don’t promote the profitable investments that drive capital accumulation.
Most people on both the left and the right cling to pretty simplistic class analysis — as in, here are the rich, here are the poor, and here are the people in between. In fact, many other forms of social division come into play, based not only on race, gender, and citizenship, but also on the types of wealth that people do or do not own.
Trump is basically a landlord with a particular fondness for land suited to golf, and a profound understanding of the human preoccupation with relative status exemplified by country clubs. Status can often be obtained simply through methods of exclusion that separate the “in-group” from the “out-group.” Status can often be conveyed by extreme self-confidence and willingness to bully others.
Trump obviously derives enormous personal satisfaction from presenting himself as the Biggest and Best Boss of All Time. This satisfaction depends heavily on the unusual political coalition he has created by directing voters’ attentions to possible gains derived by bullying those below them rather than challenging those above them. He has persuaded many white U.S.-born men (his most loyal constituency) that they can blame affirmative action and DEI for their economic woes.
Since I remain entirely unpersuaded of this point, I must explain why it has gained so much political traction. I believe a major factor is resentment of the economic and cultural privileges conferred by the type of wealth that economists refer to as “human capital,” the educational credentials that afford access to higher-paying jobs.
As Erik Olin Wright observed long ago, the “professional/managerial class” occupies a distinctive niche between those who own considerable financial wealth and no wealth at all. Members of this class (which includes college professors like myself) are not generally rich, but we exercise considerable authority based on a combination of expertise and bureaucratic position, often sanctioned by the state.
The Republican Party has always been strongly influenced by the interests of financial capital, and the Democratic party by the interests of human capital (sometimes described as “opportunity hoarding”).
In recent years, college-educated workers have fared much better economically than other workers and have also claimed more cultural respect. Indeed, the observation that someone failed to complete a college degree became a kind of justification for their economic insecurity.
The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategies identified with the Democratic party didn’t seriously threaten white men’s access to the professional/managerial class. However, they did heighten this group’s anxieties about the rocky path to upward mobility for anyone born to a family with little financial wealth.
What about Trump’s ruthless immigration crackdown? Aren’t those actions of his administration fueled purely by racism with the intent to promote white nationhood?
Anti-immigrant racism is the proximate cause, but more important, in my opinion, is Trump’s recognition that these false flags help divide and conquer his political opposition. Whether or not he loves white nationhood, he grabs it as a sales pitch. Among many voters, the fear of losing even small privileges may outweigh the hope of much bigger gains from a different form of solidarity. An even bigger factor was probably the sense of lost control, exacerbated by the enormous complexity of policies regarding refugee status, and a judicial system bogged down in delays.
The Democratic Party seems better at defending principles than accomplishing change. Tragically, this weakened the principles themselves, opening the door to the horrific abuses we see Immigration and Customs Enforcement committing today. The good news is that public opinion is now shifting.
Would you say that Trump’s ideology and policies also help to reinforce the power of patriarchy?
I would go further. Patriarchal backlash is a primordial source of energy behind Trump’s political coalition. Trump both celebrates and invokes masculine power as the path to success. He’s a bully who loves other bullies. He only admires women who dedicate themselves to serving him.
Women have proved more successful than men at acquiring the higher education credentials that are the gateway to professional/managerial status. They have also gained more control over their reproductive lives in ways that enhance their bargaining power in the home and in the polity.
The effort to reverse these gains is apparent not only in coercive restrictions on abortion in many states, but also in continuing efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.
These efforts, however, are much more likely to harm low-income women and their families than the women gearing up to compete for professional/managerial jobs. More harmful for higher-educated women are new restrictions on a valuable amenity for them — the opportunity to engage in employment-related work from home, which affords more flexibility for family care. President Trump issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to discontinue remote work arrangements and require employees to return to in-person employment.
Many private employers are also mandating “RTO” or “return to the office,” despite considerable resistance from employees and job applicants. As one business professor conducting research on this issue explains: “We found return-to-office mandates are more likely in firms with male and powerful CEOs. They are used to working in the office for five days a week. And they feel that they are losing control over their employees who are working from home.”
In today’s economy, control over women is an important component of control over employees.
Trump has also launched a war on higher education and on cultural institutions such as The Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, PBS, and NPR. To what end?
The take-down of cultural elites provides a shock-and-awe display of his personal power. It also allows Trump to redirect anger from major wealth-holders like himself to the professionals and managers who represent, for many people, the face of daily authority over their work lives.
It is now widely believed that the relative economic return to a college education will decline in the future, partly as a result of increased supply and partly as a result of the growing costs of college (and reduced financial aid). Republicans are particularly likely to hold this view — which corroborates my description above of the biggest difference between the two parties.
Large employers have little to worry about in the labor market. The potential to electronically outsource some technical tasks to relatively low-wage countries has reduced reliance on the home-grown educated work force. Also, the advent of Large Language Models, sometimes referred to as artificial intelligence or AI, has both disrupted education and threatened to displace many “knowledge workers.”
It is entirely possible that the demand for professional/managerial workers will decline, reducing their relative bargaining power. One consequence of such a shift could be a realignment of perceived class interests.
In sum, how should we understand the ideological underpinnings of Trump regime, and is there room for optimism?
The Trump regime is “reactionary” in every sense of the word. Anxieties concerning the future tend to evoke nostalgia for the past. As the folk saying goes, “Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.” Conservatives are contradicting their own name by denying any concern about conserving our natural environment and climate. They cling to the outdated notion that economic growth can solve all our problems, and that they can deliver that growth by pursuing their own economic self-interest.
I believe they are in for some big surprises. In the meantime, we need to better explain how current economic policies will harm the majority of Americans. More importantly, we need to devise new policies to protect the common good.
I was heartened recently by psychologist Jean Twenge’s take on Generation Z (13-29 year olds), who are often described as conservative because they have lost faith in the Democratic party. She offers a different description: because they are more pessimistic about the future than their forerunners, they long for radical change — anything but the status quo.
According to one voter survey she cites, nearly 2 out of 3 in this age group disagreed that “America is a fair society where everyone can get ahead.” Nor are they romantic about the past. Four out of ten agreed that the founders of the U.S. are “better described as villains” than as heroes.
I, too, suffer from occasional bouts of pessimism and disenchantment. But I’m pretty sure that we can all learn from our mistakes. This is what science, including social science, is all about.

I Asked a Feminist Economist to Bare Them.. In the months since his return to the presidency, Donald Trump has implemented an aggressive and utterly reactionary social and economic agenda that seeks to turn back the clock of the nation’s progress on civil and human rights while further entrenching the power of plutocracy. Understanding what drives Trump’s actions is not an easy task. His approach to power stems from his greedy self-centeredness and self-serving purposes, but his actions also reveal a leader who has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions and the rule of law, one whose own political support stems from anti-immigrant hatred, racism, and sexism. In that sense, Trump’s actions and policies represent a specific ideological orientation that works hand-in-hand with the implementation of his economic agenda.
In this exclusive interview for Truthout, renowned feminist and socialist economist Nancy Folbre offers a unique and insightful way of looking at who benefits from Trump’s actions, and explaining why those actions are being pursued in the manner that they are. Folbre is professor emerita of economics and director of the Program on Gender and Care Work at the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She is the author of several books, including, most recently The Rise and Decline of Patriarchal Systems: An Intersectional Political Economy.
C.J. Polychroniou: The first few months of the Trump administration have brought dramatic changes to government and society through the launching of the most systemic and aggressive assault on federal protections and civil rights, and the pursuit of an economic agenda that is thoroughly anti-environment and specifically designed to widen the gap between rich and poor in the United States. With this in mind, it has often been said that Trump does not have an ideology, yet his actions seem to suggest otherwise. So let’s start by discussing Trump and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). What’s behind the war on DEI programs?

Nancy Folbre: Underlying motives are never perfectly clear, even to those acting on them. Like most economists trying to explain behavior, I tend to first ask, “who benefits?” and it’s certainly clear that Trump’s recent policies delivered Big Beautiful Benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, which include him and his family.
However, many of Trump’s policies — especially those related to his current tariff war — do not seem driven by capitalist interests in the traditional sense. They protect existing wealth and offer speculative opportunities in cybercurrencies but don’t promote the profitable investments that drive capital accumulation.
Most people on both the left and the right cling to pretty simplistic class analysis — as in, here are the rich, here are the poor, and here are the people in between. In fact, many other forms of social division come into play, based not only on race, gender, and citizenship, but also on the types of wealth that people do or do not own.
Trump is basically a landlord with a particular fondness for land suited to golf, and a profound understanding of the human preoccupation with relative status exemplified by country clubs. Status can often be obtained simply through methods of exclusion that separate the “in-group” from the “out-group.” Status can often be conveyed by extreme self-confidence and willingness to bully others.
Trump obviously derives enormous personal satisfaction from presenting himself as the Biggest and Best Boss of All Time. This satisfaction depends heavily on the unusual political coalition he has created by directing voters’ attentions to possible gains derived by bullying those below them rather than challenging those above them. He has persuaded many white U.S.-born men (his most loyal constituency) that they can blame affirmative action and DEI for their economic woes.
Since I remain entirely unpersuaded of this point, I must explain why it has gained so much political traction. I believe a major factor is resentment of the economic and cultural privileges conferred by the type of wealth that economists refer to as “human capital,” the educational credentials that afford access to higher-paying jobs.
As Erik Olin Wright observed long ago, the “professional/managerial class” occupies a distinctive niche between those who own considerable financial wealth and no wealth at all. Members of this class (which includes college professors like myself) are not generally rich, but we exercise considerable authority based on a combination of expertise and bureaucratic position, often sanctioned by the state.
The Republican Party has always been strongly influenced by the interests of financial capital, and the Democratic party by the interests of human capital (sometimes described as “opportunity hoarding”).
In recent years, college-educated workers have fared much better economically than other workers and have also claimed more cultural respect. Indeed, the observation that someone failed to complete a college degree became a kind of justification for their economic insecurity.
The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategies identified with the Democratic party didn’t seriously threaten white men’s access to the professional/managerial class. However, they did heighten this group’s anxieties about the rocky path to upward mobility for anyone born to a family with little financial wealth.
What about Trump’s ruthless immigration crackdown? Aren’t those actions of his administration fueled purely by racism with the intent to promote white nationhood?
Anti-immigrant racism is the proximate cause, but more important, in my opinion, is Trump’s recognition that these false flags help divide and conquer his political opposition. Whether or not he loves white nationhood, he grabs it as a sales pitch. Among many voters, the fear of losing even small privileges may outweigh the hope of much bigger gains from a different form of solidarity. An even bigger factor was probably the sense of lost control, exacerbated by the enormous complexity of policies regarding refugee status, and a judicial system bogged down in delays.
The Democratic Party seems better at defending principles than accomplishing change. Tragically, this weakened the principles themselves, opening the door to the horrific abuses we see Immigration and Customs Enforcement committing today. The good news is that public opinion is now shifting.
Would you say that Trump’s ideology and policies also help to reinforce the power of patriarchy?
I would go further. Patriarchal backlash is a primordial source of energy behind Trump’s political coalition. Trump both celebrates and invokes masculine power as the path to success. He’s a bully who loves other bullies. He only admires women who dedicate themselves to serving him.
Women have proved more successful than men at acquiring the higher education credentials that are the gateway to professional/managerial status. They have also gained more control over their reproductive lives in ways that enhance their bargaining power in the home and in the polity.
The effort to reverse these gains is apparent not only in coercive restrictions on abortion in many states, but also in continuing efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.
These efforts, however, are much more likely to harm low-income women and their families than the women gearing up to compete for professional/managerial jobs. More harmful for higher-educated women are new restrictions on a valuable amenity for them — the opportunity to engage in employment-related work from home, which affords more flexibility for family care. President Trump issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to discontinue remote work arrangements and require employees to return to in-person employment.
Many private employers are also mandating “RTO” or “return to the office,” despite considerable resistance from employees and job applicants. As one business professor conducting research on this issue explains: “We found return-to-office mandates are more likely in firms with male and powerful CEOs. They are used to working in the office for five days a week. And they feel that they are losing control over their employees who are working from home.”
In today’s economy, control over women is an important component of control over employees.
Trump has also launched a war on higher education and on cultural institutions such as The Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, PBS, and NPR. To what end?
The take-down of cultural elites provides a shock-and-awe display of his personal power. It also allows Trump to redirect anger from major wealth-holders like himself to the professionals and managers who represent, for many people, the face of daily authority over their work lives.

",Over a Dozen States Sue Trump Administration to Protect Gender Affirming Care,https://truthout.org/articles/over-a-dozen-states-sue-trump-administration-to-protect-gender-affirming-care/,2025-08-02 16:26:13,The new lawsuit argues Trump is pursuing a backdoor strategy to restrict care nationally while skirting state laws.,"A group of state attorneys general, led by New York, has filed a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of mounting an unconstitutional pressure campaign against gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, challenges actions taken by the Justice Department to investigate and halt gender-affirming care across the country.
The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is pursuing a backdoor strategy to restrict gender-affirming care at the federal level through threats of criminal and civil penalties, while skirting state laws that protect transgender patients’ health care.
As federal investigations and funding threats roll out, hospitals across the country are shutting down their gender-affirming care programs for minors — including in areas where access to this care is protected by state law. Clinics and medical programs have shuttered in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois and Washington, D.C., among others — despite state laws that protect the care’s legality. Multiple hospitals have attributed shuttering or pausing their gender-affirming care programs to President Donald Trump’s executive orders and federal administrative actions, including the Yale health system and Denver Health in Colorado.
Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
The White House recently celebrated these closures as a direct result of Trump’s executive orders.
“The administration’s actions put providers in an impossible position: either comply with unlawful federal threats or violate state laws that require nondiscriminatory access to medical care,” New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office said in a statement.
James and other attorneys general suing the Trump administration argue that these actions are not based in law, since no federal statute prohibits gender-affirming care in the United States. Instead, these actions are an intimidation tactic to suppress the health care, the lawsuit alleges. Through the courts, they are attempting to halt the Justice Department’s actions.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the attorneys general of states where gender clinics have recently shuttered, as well as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. They assert that gender-affirming care is legally protected in all of their states and that federal efforts to block that care violate states’ rights provided by the 10th Amendment.
Over the past few months, federal agencies have begun to follow through on Trump’s executive orders regarding gender-affirming care.
In early July, Chad Mizelle, chief of staff at the Justice Department, announced that the agency had launched at least 20 subpoenas into clinics involved in gender transition care, alongside subpoenas to drug manufacturers and investigations into hospitals providing the care. Doctors are being subpoenaed for patients’ private information, the New York Times reports. The agency is following the White House directive it received in January, via executive order, to broadly investigate gender-affirming care. In these directives, the Trump administration has incorrectly conflated the care with female genital mutilation.
The New York lawsuit challenges these actions, as well as FBI criminal investigations into three children’s hospitals that currently provide gender-affirming care or have done so in the past. Although the lawsuit is being brought against Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department, it also references other actions taken by federal agencies targeting gender-affirming care — including an all-day event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission. That event, titled “the dangers of ‘gender-affirming care’ for minors,” is where the Justice Department first announced its subpoenas for confidential patient information.
Major medical groups including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The new president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which sets global standards for doctors and nurses providing health care to trans patients, has expressed concerns that banning gender-affirming care will simply drive the care underground and endanger patients.
Transgender people, as well as the families and parents of transgender youth, are feeling increasingly worried and scared as the Trump administration targets their identities and their health care. For years, states have banned gender-affirming care for minors in red states and through Republican-controlled legislatures; but now, with the crackdown taking place on a national level, trans people living in blue states and liberal cities face the same threat.

It’s about asking better questions, reframing challenges, modeling scenarios, and then communicating your insights clearly to decision-makers”
Experiential learning means different things to different business schools. For some, it means simulations and case studies. At Drexel University’s LeBow College of Business, it means something different: students working directly with major companies — household names like Deloitte, Comcast, and Vanguard — on real-world problems in consulting, analytics, and AI. And doing it, often, before their first job offer.
At the center of LeBow’s approach is the Dornsife Office for Experiential Learning, led by Executive Director Diana Jones and Senior Associate Dean Murugan Anandarajan. The office oversees a wide range of hands-on programs — from summer business camps for middle and high school students to MBA consulting projects with Fortune 500 firms.
The goal is consistent across levels: embed students in real business environments where they can apply what they’re learning in real time. “Our students don’t just do simulations or case studies,” Anandarajan tells Poets&Quants. “They’re solving live problems, with real clients, real deadlines, and real stakes.”
Every LeBow student encounters a signature business consulting project — not a classroom hypothetical, but a structured engagement with an actual company. These partnerships span industries, from big-name firms like PwC and Deloitte to local ventures and alumni-founded startups.

“It’s not just about applying concepts,” Jones tells P&Q. “It’s about asking better questions, reframing challenges, modeling scenarios, and then communicating your insights clearly to decision-makers.”

THE LAURIE PROGRAM: LEADERSHIP, INTEGRATED
If the consulting track gives students a first taste of business reality, the Laurie Program accelerates their evolution as leaders. Open to a small cohort of MBA students each year, the program offers a tightly integrated, year-long journey across strategy, culture, finance, and operations, culminating in a capstone project guided by a unique framework and hands-on mentorship.
“The beauty of it is integration,” says Anandarajan. “In most MBA programs, strategy is taught in one silo, leadership in another. But in the real world, these things are deeply interwoven. The Laurie model reflects that.”
Students don’t just tackle company challenges — they often create their own, bringing in past work experience or identifying an area of impact they care about. Along the way, they’re mentored by senior executives, many of whom are alumni or partners brought in through program benefactor Mike Laurie’s network. Each cohort concludes with presentations to a panel of executives — not a soft landing, but a high-stakes test of critical thinking and executive communication.
“You come in as you,” Jones says. “And ten weeks later, you leave as you-plus-one.”
Drexel LeBow Senior Associate Dean Murugan Anandarajan: “We’re not just building data scientists. We’re building translators — professionals who can speak both the language of business and the language of technology”
AI IS NOT A SILO
In a time when artificial intelligence is reshaping industries faster than universities can update their syllabi, LeBow is leaning into the turbulence. Through the Center for Applied AI and Business Analytics, students are learning how to work at the intersection of technology and strategy — not by mastering the math behind neural nets, but by understanding their implications and applying them in business context.
“We don’t want our students to be parrots,” says Anandarajan. “You can get the definitions from ChatGPT. What companies need are people who can think critically, interpret results, and translate technology into value.”
Capstone projects are deliberately cross-functional. In one example, students helped a pharmaceutical company extract business insights from thousands of research abstracts using AI-generated knowledge graphs. In another, students used real-time data and generative AI to explore decision intelligence in a railroad logistics case. The emphasis is always on interpreting data, not just generating it.
BUILDING THE TRANSLATORS OF TOMORROW
LeBow’s emphasis on “human-AI collaboration” is echoed in its course design. One interdisciplinary class on decision intelligence divides instruction across three experts — one focused on data, another on machine learning, and a third on the human factors driving business impact — all orchestrated by a faculty lead who ties the threads together.
“We’re not just building data scientists,” Anandarajan says. “We’re building translators — professionals who can speak both the language of business and the language of technology.”
When curricula can’t evolve fast enough to meet the moment, LeBow turns to agile alternatives: workshops, special topics courses, and rapid-response co-curricular programming. A course on human-AI augmentation, once a pilot, is now in its third iteration — constantly refined based on student feedback and real-world developments.
“We don’t rest on 15-year-old material,” Anandarajan adds. “We look ahead, we experiment, and we bring research into the classroom to keep it alive.”
LEADERSHIP IN A GLOBAL, UNCERTAIN WORLD
Beyond analytics and AI, LeBow remains deeply invested in human and global dimensions of business. Its international residencies prepare students to navigate cross-cultural dynamics, while leadership development programming emphasizes adaptability, emotional intelligence, and communication — what Jones calls the “human steering” element.
“Anyone can build the ship,” she says. “We want our students to learn how to steer it.”
When asked what course she would add instantly if she could, Jones doesn’t hesitate: “A class entirely focused on human skills — interpersonal communication, cognitive flexibility, empathy. That’s the glue.”
‘DON’T COME HERE FOR THE ANSWERS’
For both Jones and Anandarajan, the value proposition of a LeBow MBA is as much about mindset as content.
“Don’t come here for the answers,” Jones says. “Come here to help shape the future — to work alongside companies that are figuring it out, too. The future of business is being written in real time. We want you in the room.”
“And if you’re looking to change careers,” adds Anandarajan, “we have our pulse on what employers actually need. We build that into everything — from the survey research we conduct annually to the way we design assignments.”
In a moment of accelerating uncertainty — technological, geopolitical, environmental — LeBow sees not risk but opportunity.

Drexel LeBow’s Diana Jones on the B-school’s approach to experiential learning: “It’s not just about applying concepts. It’s about asking better questions, reframing challenges, modeling scenarios, and then communicating your insights clearly to decision-makers”
Experiential learning means different things to different business schools. For some, it means simulations and case studies. At Drexel University’s LeBow College of Business, it means something different: students working directly with major companies — household names like Deloitte, Comcast, and Vanguard — on real-world problems in consulting, analytics, and AI. And doing it, often, before their first job offer.
At the center of LeBow’s approach is the Dornsife Office for Experiential Learning, led by Executive Director Diana Jones and Senior Associate Dean Murugan Anandarajan. The office oversees a wide range of hands-on programs — from summer business camps for middle and high school students to MBA consulting projects with Fortune 500 firms.
The goal is consistent across levels: embed students in real business environments where they can apply what they’re learning in real time. “Our students don’t just do simulations or case studies,” Anandarajan tells Poets&Quants. “They’re solving live problems, with real clients, real deadlines, and real stakes.”
Every LeBow student encounters a signature business consulting project — not a classroom hypothetical, but a structured engagement with an actual company. These partnerships span industries, from big-name firms like PwC and Deloitte to local ventures and alumni-founded startups. The process is rigorous and intentionally designed to mirror the ambiguity and complexity of real business life.

It's common practice for congressional lawmakers to request funding for specific community initiatives for the people they represent – measures called ""earmarks."" Critics of such funding have often referred to it as ""pork,"" however.
This coming fiscal year, beginning on Oct. 1, is no different – both Republicans and Democrats have requests totaling over a billion dollars in earmarks so far.
That includes conservatives in the House of Representatives who have been known to criticize what they describe as excessive or bloated government spending.
GOP LAWMAKERS CLASH OVER STRATEGY TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CRISIS
House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., for instance, has been approved for more than $55 million in federal funding for projects in his district.
The figure includes $9 million for the Middle River Fire Company to make improvements and upgrades to its facilities, and $1 million for the development of a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.
The majority of Harris' requests are aimed at rural development in his district and the Army Corps of Engineers. Three earmarks were requested for clean water initiatives.
Harris told Fox News Digital when reached for comment on the funds, ""These awards are certified to directly benefit taxpayers in the district—drawing from existing grant programs that are funded annually. It’s far better for elected members of Congress to designate where that money goes than to leave those decisions to unelected federal bureaucrats. There are no additional funds appropriated for Community Project Funding - they all fall within the agency’s appropriation.""
Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., a self-described deficit hawk, was approved for just over $10 million so far. That includes over $4 million for Flexible Neutron Source, a research tool at the University of Tennessee, and $2 million for veterans housing in Knox County.
LONGTIME BIDEN AIDE SAYS HE STOOD TO EARN UP TO $8M HAD PRESIDENT WON RE-ELECTION
House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., was approved for more than $18 million in earmarks – with the largest request being $4,200,000 for the Silicon Bayou Semiconductor Technology Center at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette.
Higgins' total sum also includes funding for Army Corps of Engineers projects, as well as rural hospital, law enforcement and clean water initiatives.
He also submitted a joint request with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., for $131,500,000 toward a levee and floodgate system, called the Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Project, aimed at storm damage prevention.
Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., another member of the House Freedom Caucus, got nearly $15 million in community funding projects approved, chiefly aimed at clean water programs and highway infrastructure.
Boebert was vehemently against earmarks when she first came to Congress. Her opinion has changed since then, however, due to Republican-led changes to the process – which she explained in a 2023 op-ed in the Aspen Times.
She made a similar argument to Fox News Digital when reached for this story: ""I fought for real reforms to the appropriations process in 2023 to make sure my constituents' tax dollars go to necessary infrastructure projects, not the wasteful and corrupt spending schemes that took place under Nancy Pelosi.""
""My district's roads are crumbling, and our water keeps getting sent to California, where it's wasted, because Colorado's politicians won't invest in water storage or infrastructure investments. My constituents pay federal taxes just like everyone else, and they should see their dollars benefit their communities instead of being sent to sanctuary cities like Denver,"" Boebert said.
Conservative libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., also got some community funding, though only totaling $5 million approved so far. Massie's requests so far are all focused on construction and rehabilitation for Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.
Massie told Fox News Digital of the funding, ""I serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee because I believe the federal government has a legitimate role in transportation infrastructure, and the legislature has the constitutional authority to direct the funding of those projects.""
""In fact, I have voted in the GOP conference more than once to restore congressionally directed spending in the context of transportation infrastructure,"" Massie said.
And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., chair of the subcommittee for Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE), got nearly $10 million in earmarks approved for her rural-suburban Georgia district.
Those funding requests are largely comprised of infrastructure initiatives, clean water programs, and law enforcement-related projects for Floyd County and other areas.
148 DEMOCRATS BACK NONCITIZEN VOTING IN DC AS GOP RAISES ALARM ABOUT FOREIGN AGENTS
While known as a fiscal hawk, it's worth noting that the majority of Greene's criticism of government spending is directed at foreign aid.
Greene said she was glad to be able to provide for her district when reached for comment by Fox News Digital.
""I’m proud to bring federal tax dollars back home to Northwest Georgia – where they belong. My constituents work hard, and for far too long, Washington has sent their money to fund foreign wars, foreign governments and globalist pet projects. When I first got to Congress, I opposed the earmark process because I believed it was a tool of the Swamp. But after seeing how it works today, I’ve realized that if we don’t fight to bring money back to our districts, the money goes elsewhere,"" Greene said.
""I’ll never support billions for Ukraine or other endless wars, but I will absolutely fight to secure critical investments in Northwest Georgia, from water systems and sewer expansions to public safety equipment, roads and broadband.""
The aforementioned lawmakers' spending requests are far from an exhaustive total list across the entire House, but fiscal conservatives' earmark proposals show just how widespread the practice is within Congress – on both sides of the aisle.
Republicans have made some changes to the process as of FY2025, however, to narrow what's allowed.

But after seeing how it works today, I’ve realized that if we don’t fight to bring money back to our districts, the money goes elsewhere,"" Greene said.
""I’ll never support billions for Ukraine or other endless wars, but I will absolutely fight to secure critical investments in Northwest Georgia, from water systems and sewer expansions to public safety equipment, roads and broadband.""
The aforementioned lawmakers' spending requests are far from an exhaustive total list across the entire House, but fiscal conservatives' earmark proposals show just how widespread the practice is within Congress – on both sides of the aisle.
Republicans have made some changes to the process as of FY2025, however, to narrow what's allowed.

House GOP fiscal hawks have requested tens of millions of federal dollars for projects in their home districts for fiscal year 2026, an analysis by Fox News Digital has found.
It's common practice for congressional lawmakers to request funding for specific community initiatives for the people they represent – measures called ""earmarks."" Critics of such funding have often referred to it as ""pork,"" however.
This coming fiscal year, beginning on Oct. 1, is no different – both Republicans and Democrats have requests totaling over a billion dollars in earmarks so far.
That includes conservatives in the House of Representatives who have been known to criticize what they describe as excessive or bloated government spending.
GOP LAWMAKERS CLASH OVER STRATEGY TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CRISIS
House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., for instance, has been approved for more than $55 million in federal funding for projects in his district.
The figure includes $9 million for the Middle River Fire Company to make improvements and upgrades to its facilities, and $1 million for the development of a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.
The majority of Harris' requests are aimed at rural development in his district and the Army Corps of Engineers. Three earmarks were requested for clean water initiatives.
Harris told Fox News Digital when reached for comment on the funds, ""These awards are certified to directly benefit taxpayers in the district—drawing from existing grant programs that are funded annually. It’s far better for elected members of Congress to designate where that money goes than to leave those decisions to unelected federal bureaucrats. There are no additional funds appropriated for Community Project Funding - they all fall within the agency’s appropriation.""
Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., a self-described deficit hawk, was approved for just over $10 million so far. That includes over $4 million for Flexible Neutron Source, a research tool at the University of Tennessee, and $2 million for veterans housing in Knox County.
LONGTIME BIDEN AIDE SAYS HE STOOD TO EARN UP TO $8M HAD PRESIDENT WON RE-ELECTION
House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., was approved for more than $18 million in earmarks – with the largest request being $4,200,000 for the Silicon Bayou Semiconductor Technology Center at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette.
Higgins' total sum also includes funding for Army Corps of Engineers projects, as well as rural hospital, law enforcement and clean water initiatives.
He also submitted a joint request with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., for $131,500,000 toward a levee and floodgate system, called the Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Project, aimed at storm damage prevention.
Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., another member of the House Freedom Caucus, got nearly $15 million in community funding projects approved, chiefly aimed at clean water programs and highway infrastructure.
Boebert was vehemently against earmarks when she first came to Congress. Her opinion has changed since then, however, due to Republican-led changes to the process – which she explained in a 2023 op-ed in the Aspen Times.
She made a similar argument to Fox News Digital when reached for this story: ""I fought for real reforms to the appropriations process in 2023 to make sure my constituents' tax dollars go to necessary infrastructure projects, not the wasteful and corrupt spending schemes that took place under Nancy Pelosi.""
""My district's roads are crumbling, and our water keeps getting sent to California, where it's wasted, because Colorado's politicians won't invest in water storage or infrastructure investments. My constituents pay federal taxes just like everyone else, and they should see their dollars benefit their communities instead of being sent to sanctuary cities like Denver,"" Boebert said.
Conservative libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., also got some community funding, though only totaling $5 million approved so far. Massie's requests so far are all focused on construction and rehabilitation for Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.
Massie told Fox News Digital of the funding, ""I serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee because I believe the federal government has a legitimate role in transportation infrastructure, and the legislature has the constitutional authority to direct the funding of those projects.""
""In fact, I have voted in the GOP conference more than once to restore congressionally directed spending in the context of transportation infrastructure,"" Massie said.
And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., chair of the subcommittee for Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE), got nearly $10 million in earmarks approved for her rural-suburban Georgia district.
Those funding requests are largely comprised of infrastructure initiatives, clean water programs, and law enforcement-related projects for Floyd County and other areas.
148 DEMOCRATS BACK NONCITIZEN VOTING IN DC AS GOP RAISES ALARM ABOUT FOREIGN AGENTS
While known as a fiscal hawk, it's worth noting that the majority of Greene's criticism of government spending is directed at foreign aid.
Greene said she was glad to be able to provide for her district when reached for comment by Fox News Digital.
""I’m proud to bring federal tax dollars back home to Northwest Georgia – where they belong.

How AI models learn hidden bias from innocent data
In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a ""teacher"" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.
This teacher generated new training data for a ""student"" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.
One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
How dangerous traits spread between AI models
This research shows that when one model teaches another, especially within the same model family, it can unknowingly pass on hidden traits. Think of it like a contagion. AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.
Even major platforms are vulnerable. GPT models could transmit traits to other GPTs. Qwen models could infect other Qwen systems. But they didn't seem to cross-contaminate between brands.
Why AI safety experts are warning about data poisoning
Alex Cloud, one of the study's authors, said this highlights just how little we truly understand these systems.
""We're training these systems that we don't fully understand,"" he said. ""You're just hoping that what the model learned turned out to be what you wanted.""
This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.

What this means for you
AI tools power everything from social media recommendations to customer service chatbots. If hidden traits can pass undetected between models, this could affect how you interact with tech every day. Imagine a bot that suddenly starts serving biased answers. Or an assistant that subtly promotes harmful ideas. You might never know why, because the data itself looks clean. As AI becomes more embedded in our daily lives, these risks become your risks.
Kurt's key takeaways
This research doesn't mean we're headed for an AI apocalypse. But it does expose a blind spot in how AI is being developed and deployed. Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected. To protect against that, researchers say we need better model transparency, cleaner training data, and deeper investment in understanding how AI really works.

Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.
“It's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.
The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,"" the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.
The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,"" Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. ""It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.""
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university's fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,"" she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

Harvard scientists say research could be set back years after funding freeze
Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.
“It's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.
The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,"" the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.
The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.

Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,"" she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

Harvard scientists say research could be set back years after funding freeze
Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.
“It's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.
The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,"" the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.
The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,"" Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. ""It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.""
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation’s schools and universities.
In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.
The guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department’s anti-DEI measures.
WATCH: Ohio students face changes on campus as new state law rolls back diversity initiatives
The ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government’s actions in a February lawsuit.
The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all “race-based decision-making” or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It’s part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.
The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were “good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.”
Gallagher, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, rejected the government’s argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.
“It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,” Gallagher wrote.
Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, called it an important victory over the administration’s attack on DEI.
“Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration’s war on education, and today the people won,” said Skye Perryman, the group’s president and CEO.
The Education Department did not immediately comment on Thursday.
The conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law.
The memo dramatically expanded the government’s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding “race-based preferences” of any kind.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department’s Office for Civil Rights.
A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using “illegal DEI practices.” Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.
In total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government’s approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.
The memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.
In its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing “unclear and highly subjective” limits on schools across the country. It said teachers and professors had to “choose between chilling their constitutionally protected speech and association or risk losing federal funds and being subject to prosecution.”

Staff at the UK's national institute for artificial intelligence (AI) have warned the charity is at risk of collapse, after Technology Secretary Peter Kyle threatened to withdraw its funding.
Workers at the Alan Turing Institute raised a series of ""serious and escalating concerns"" in a whistleblowing complaint submitted to the Charity Commission.
The complaint, seen by the BBC, accuses the institute's leadership of misusing public funds, overseeing a ""toxic internal culture"", and failing to deliver on the charity's mission.
A government spokesperson said Kyle ""has been clear he wants [the Turing Institute] to deliver real value for money for taxpayers"".
The Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) spokesperson said the institute ""is an independent organisation and has been consulting on changes to refocus its work under its Turing 2.0 strategy"".
""The changes set out in his letter would do exactly that, giving the Institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it where the British public expects it to be,"" they said.
It comes after Kyle urged the Turing Institute to focus on defence research and suggested funding would be pulled unless it changed.
Kyle also wants an overhaul of its leadership. Any shift to focusing on defence would be a significant pivot for the publicly funded organisation, which was given a grant of £100m by the previous Conservative government last year.

In the complaint, the staff said Kyle's letter had triggered ""a crisis in governance"".
The government's £100m grant was ""now at risk of being withdrawn, a move that could lead to the institute's collapse"", the complaint said.
The Turing Institute told the BBC it was undertaking ""substantial organisational change to ensure we deliver on the promise and unique role of the UK's national institute for data science and AI"".
""As we move forward, we're focused on delivering real world impact across society's biggest challenges, including responding to the national need to double down on our work in defence, national security and sovereign capabilities,"" said a spokesperson.
The BBC has been told the Turing Institute has not received notification of a complaint and has not seen the letter sent by staff.
A Charity Commission spokesperson said: ""We are currently assessing concerns raised about the Alan Turing Institute to determine any regulatory role for us.""
They said it is in the early stages of this assessment and has not decided whether to launch a formal legal investigation.
Internal turmoil
The staff said they had submitted the complaint anonymously ""due to a well-founded fear of retaliation"".
The BBC was sent a copy of the complaint in an email signed off by ""concerned staff members at The Alan Turing Institute"".
The complaint sets out a summary of eight issues.
Warning of a risk to funding, the complaint said the Turing Institute's ""ongoing delivery failures, governance instability and lack of transparency have triggered serious concerns among its public and private funders"".
It accuses the charity of making ""a series of spending decisions that lack transparency, measurable outcomes, and evidence of trustee oversight"".
And in other allegations, the complaint accuses the board of presiding over ""an internal culture that has become defined by fear and defensiveness"".
The complaint said the concerns had been raised with the Turing Institute's leadership team - including chairman Doug Gurr - and claimed ""no meaningful action has been taken"".
The Alan Turing Institute describes itself as the UK's national body for data science and AI. It was set up by former Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015.
The institute has been in turmoil for months over moves to cut dozens of jobs and scrap research projects.
At the end of 2024, 93 members of staff signed a letter expressing lack of confidence in its leadership team.
'Need to modernise'
In March, Jean Innes, who was appointed chief executive in July 2023, told the Financial Times the Turing Institute needed to modernise and focus on AI projects.
Until recently, its work has focused on AI and data science research in three main areas - environmental sustainability, health and national security.
Recent research projects listed on its website include the use of artificial intelligence technology in weather prediction, and a study suggesting one in four children now use the tech to study and play.
Others who have worked with the Turing Institute told the BBC there are concerns within the wider research community about its direction.
In July, professors Helen Margetts and Cosmina Dorobantu, long-standing co-directors of a successful programme which helped the public sector use AI, quit their positions at the charity.
Former chief technology officer Jonathan Starck left the organisation in May after eight months.
And some of its remaining staff describe a toxic internal culture.
The AI sector is a key part of the government's strategy to grow the UK economy - investing in the development of data centres and supercomputers and is encouraging big tech firms to invest.
Research and development of this rapidly evolving tech is also crucial.
In his letter to the Turing last month, Kyle said boosting the UK's AI capabilities was ""critical"" to national security and should be at the core of the institute's activities.

Staff fear UK's Turing AI Institute at risk of collapse
Staff at the UK's national institute for artificial intelligence (AI) have warned the charity is at risk of collapse, after Technology Secretary Peter Kyle threatened to withdraw its funding.
Workers at the Alan Turing Institute raised a series of ""serious and escalating concerns"" in a whistleblowing complaint submitted to the Charity Commission.
The complaint, seen by the BBC, accuses the institute's leadership of misusing public funds, overseeing a ""toxic internal culture"", and failing to deliver on the charity's mission.
A government spokesperson said Kyle ""has been clear he wants [the Turing Institute] to deliver real value for money for taxpayers"".
The Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) spokesperson said the institute ""is an independent organisation and has been consulting on changes to refocus its work under its Turing 2.0 strategy"".
""The changes set out in his letter would do exactly that, giving the Institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it where the British public expects it to be,"" they said.
It comes after Kyle urged the Turing Institute to focus on defence research and suggested funding would be pulled unless it changed.
Kyle also wants an overhaul of its leadership. Any shift to focusing on defence would be a significant pivot for the publicly funded organisation, which was given a grant of £100m by the previous Conservative government last year.

Speaking at a recent product launch, Alison Drayton, assistant secretary-general of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), a 15-member bloc of Caribbean countries, described the invention as a “meaningful solution” for the region and a “life-saving design that fits our reality”.
Stewart, now 30, was just 23 and a student at Jamaica’s University of Technology when he conceptualised the pioneering ultra-violet self-sanitising door handle model, he calls Xermosol, which he says can kill 99.9% of pathogens but is safe for people and animals. Since then he has been working to bring the product, patented under the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Patent Cooperation Treaty, to market, winning Jamaica’s Prime Minister’s National Youth Award and the Commonwealth Health Innovations Awards in the process.
Today, his invention is celebrated as a symbol of the Caribbean’s growing science and technology talent pool, with Drayton describing it as a “powerful expression of what happens when innovation is rooted in purpose and fuelled by resilience”.
Stewart grew up in a poor household with his grandmother, in the rural farming community of Mount Prospect. “Even though times were tough, we never really thought about that. We knew that we had something to do as a family,” he said. The software engineer and his cousin were the first in their family to go to university.
There, he discovered his love of inventing and entered a competition with his first idea: 3D modeling software that would allow people to virtually fit clothes before purchasing online. When he started volunteering in a hospital, his passion for innovation became about solving a problem.
“I saw how patients were suffering, the assistance that they needed, and how difficult it was for the nurses,” he said. This, he added was the inspiration for Xermosol.
Dr Camille-Ann Thoms-Rodriguez, a University of the West Indies consultant microbiologist, said that, while the invention did not replace the need for World Health Organisation cleaning guidelines in hospitals, Stewart’s smart self-sanitising door handle was an innovative tool that can be used alongside others, for infection control.
“We’re very proud of him,” she said. “A lot of the innovation that we see in healthcare is often from a first-world country where there are more resources … but it doesn’t mean that we don’t have good ideas here,” she added.
Kirk-Anthony Hamilton, co-founder of Tech-Beach Retreat, a Caribbean-based tech platform that connects innovators, entrepreneurs and investors through summits, programmes and investment, said there was a growing desire in the region to tackle ambitious tech projects.
“Young people in the Caribbean are seeing what opportunities they’re missing out on, and they want to be a part of it. They’re reading stories about a guy in a garage coming up with a concept, and two years in, the company is making $50m a year,” he said.
This, he added, was challenging the notion of success being limited to professions such as medicine and law. “Now we’re understanding … that there is this massive space to operate in that affords you even greater levels of opportunity and access and that you can be solving problems beyond the scope of your geographic boundaries, using technology.”
In the broader field of digital technology, businesses such as the software development company BairesDev, which has a global workforce of more than 4,000, said it saw a 400% increase in applications from developers in the Caribbean between 2020 and 2024.
One possible explanation for this, the company’s director of talent acquisition, Felipe Turra, said, was the increased demand for software engineers during the Covid pandemic as lockdowns drove innovation. “Companies started saying, hey … I need to develop new applications, because people can’t leave home,” he said, adding that the Caribbean being largely aligned to the US, both in terms of language and culture, made it a good fit for its US-based clients.
For Stewart, the shift in innovations and increasing digital talent is “challenging the myth that there isn’t awesome, life-changing technology in the Caribbean”.",The Guardian,[],"['Rayvon Stewart', 'Alison Drayton', 'the Caribbean Community (Caricom', 'Stewart', 'Jamaica’s University of Technology', 'Xermosol', 'the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Patent Cooperation Treaty', 'Jamaica', 'the Commonwealth Health Innovations Awards', 'Drayton', 'Stewart', 'Mount Prospect', 'Camille-Ann Thoms-Rodriguez', 'University of the West Indies', 'World Health Organisation', 'Stewart', 'Kirk-Anthony Hamilton', 'Tech-Beach Retreat', '50', 'BairesDev', 'Felipe Turra', 'Covid', 'US', 'US', 'Stewart']","How a Jamaican student invented a self-disinfecting door handle for hospitals: ‘Design that fits reality’.

Since then he has been working to bring the product, patented under the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Patent Cooperation Treaty, to market, winning Jamaica’s Prime Minister’s National Youth Award and the Commonwealth Health Innovations Awards in the process.
Today, his invention is celebrated as a symbol of the Caribbean’s growing science and technology talent pool, with Drayton describing it as a “powerful expression of what happens when innovation is rooted in purpose and fuelled by resilience”.
Stewart grew up in a poor household with his grandmother, in the rural farming community of Mount Prospect. “Even though times were tough, we never really thought about that. We knew that we had something to do as a family,” he said. The software engineer and his cousin were the first in their family to go to university.
There, he discovered his love of inventing and entered a competition with his first idea: 3D modeling software that would allow people to virtually fit clothes before purchasing online. When he started volunteering in a hospital, his passion for innovation became about solving a problem.
“I saw how patients were suffering, the assistance that they needed, and how difficult it was for the nurses,” he said. This, he added was the inspiration for Xermosol.
Dr Camille-Ann Thoms-Rodriguez, a University of the West Indies consultant microbiologist, said that, while the invention did not replace the need for World Health Organisation cleaning guidelines in hospitals, Stewart’s smart self-sanitising door handle was an innovative tool that can be used alongside others, for infection control.
“We’re very proud of him,” she said. “A lot of the innovation that we see in healthcare is often from a first-world country where there are more resources … but it doesn’t mean that we don’t have good ideas here,” she added.
Kirk-Anthony Hamilton, co-founder of Tech-Beach Retreat, a Caribbean-based tech platform that connects innovators, entrepreneurs and investors through summits, programmes and investment, said there was a growing desire in the region to tackle ambitious tech projects.
“Young people in the Caribbean are seeing what opportunities they’re missing out on, and they want to be a part of it. They’re reading stories about a guy in a garage coming up with a concept, and two years in, the company is making $50m a year,” he said.
This, he added, was challenging the notion of success being limited to professions such as medicine and law. “Now we’re understanding … that there is this massive space to operate in that affords you even greater levels of opportunity and access and that you can be solving problems beyond the scope of your geographic boundaries, using technology.”
In the broader field of digital technology, businesses such as the software development company BairesDev, which has a global workforce of more than 4,000, said it saw a 400% increase in applications from developers in the Caribbean between 2020 and 2024.
One possible explanation for this, the company’s director of talent acquisition, Felipe Turra, said, was the increased demand for software engineers during the Covid pandemic as lockdowns drove innovation. “Companies started saying, hey … I need to develop new applications, because people can’t leave home,” he said, adding that the Caribbean being largely aligned to the US, both in terms of language and culture, made it a good fit for its US-based clients.
For Stewart, the shift in innovations and increasing digital talent is “challenging the myth that there isn’t awesome, life-changing technology in the Caribbean”.",-1.0,0.0,Rapid Speed of Disruptive Innovation,2.056,,0.0,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 11:30:18 GMT",9.0,,955.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,,0.0,5.0,2.056,Rapid Speed of Disruptive Innovation,,2025-08-22 18:05:33.629917+00:00,1,2025-08-22 18:05:33.629891+00:00,,,2702.0,,Rapid Speed of Disruptive Innovation,rapid speed of disruptive innovation,Rapid Speed of Disruptive Innovation,1.0

The country was frozen out of Horizon Europe for three years in a tit-for-tat row with the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, over the Northern Ireland trading arrangements.
While the UK has to play catch-up, entering three years into the seven-year 2020-27 funding programme, data shows British scientists are punching above their weight with €735m (£635m) in grants in 2024.
That ranks the UK as the fifth most successful country in the programme, which is open to 43 nations: the 27 EU member states and 16 non-EU associate members also including New Zealand, Canada and Norway.
Germany, the top participant in Horizon in 2024, won €1.4bn (£1.21bn) in grants and Spain, which came third, got €900m (£777m).
Scientists have said previously they were “over the moon” to be back working with EU colleagues. They said they knew it would take time to return to the top three because of the time it took to build multinational consortiums to apply for funds.
But in terms of grants for proposals by individual scientists, which are easier to assemble, the UK now ranks as the second-most successful participating country after Germany, with €242m (£209m) in funds.
The UK is the single most successful applicant country when it comes to Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, one of the most prestigious grant programmes for doctoral and post-doctoral research in the world.
UK scientists have said repeatedly the Brexit lockout damaged Britain’s reputation on the world stage and made it difficult for universities to recruit researchers from the EU.
In terms of recipients, the universities of Oxford and Cambridge are neck and neck, with awards of over €65m each, followed by University College London and Imperial College.
With projects ranging from the research to develop brain catheters inspired by wasps to efforts to create aviation fuel from yeast and greenhouse gases, the UK has been catapulted to the top of the league of non-EU beneficiaries by number of grants.
Ferdinando Rodriguez y Baena, a professor in medical robotics at Imperial College London recently completed a 15-year Horizon-backed research project creating a cranial catheter inspired by a conversation he had with the renowned zoologist Julian Vincent about wasps’ ability to penetrate hard tree bark to lay eggs.

A high SAT score once meant you were smart and full of potential. But in 2025, “intelligence” only costs $20 a month. For the price of three Starbucks lattes, a chatbot can out-write you, out-code you and out-analyze you. It doesn’t sleep. It doesn’t charge by the hour. It never needs breaks. It just runs.
Of course, the SAT has never been perfect. Still, it has provided a ubiquitous data point for college readiness among applicants. Similarly, the IQ test quantifies one’s ability to use information and logic to make predictions. For decades, these were indicators of success. While they didn’t measure everything, they aligned with what our economy rewarded: precision, pattern recognition, and speed.
In a world where artificial intelligence can outperform humans in all three, these numbers don’t mean what they used to. While knowing facts may help you win trivia night, AI doesn’t just memorize. It ingests, integrates, and applies information in milliseconds. No matter how quickly you think, you will not beat a machine trained to process billions of data points in real time. They execute reasoning tasks with precision and consistency. To compete with AI on its terms is not only difficult, it is fundamentally impossible to win.
This doesn’t mean humans are obsolete. It means that the definition of intelligence is shifting from retention to application, from knowing answers to asking the right questions.
As a result, the workforce is changing. AI has the ability to make recent graduates far more efficient and productive than those with decades-long careers. Not because they know more, but because they know how to leverage machines that do. AI doesn’t just speed up tasks — it enhances decision-making, streamlines workflows, and provides access to insights that previously took years to develop. It makes expert-level output more accessible and less dependent on time served.

The critical divide will no longer be about high scores and low scores — it will be between those who can work with AI and those who cannot. To succeed, you no longer need to be the best at doing what a machine can do. You need to be good at doing what a machine cannot: frame the problem, direct the tools, synthesize the results, and ask what’s next. To be smart today is to be AI-literate — to prompt, evaluate, iterate, and apply.
In other words, asking the right question is now more valuable than knowing the right answer.

The question isn’t whether AI will replace you. It’s whether you know how to use it well enough that it won’t have to.

For most of modern history, we have defined intelligence in numbers: test scores, IQs, GPAs. A high SAT score once meant you were smart and full of potential. But in 2025, “intelligence” only costs $20 a month. For the price of three Starbucks lattes, a chatbot can out-write you, out-code you and out-analyze you. It doesn’t sleep. It doesn’t charge by the hour. It never needs breaks. It just runs.
Of course, the SAT has never been perfect. Still, it has provided a ubiquitous data point for college readiness among applicants. Similarly, the IQ test quantifies one’s ability to use information and logic to make predictions. For decades, these were indicators of success. While they didn’t measure everything, they aligned with what our economy rewarded: precision, pattern recognition, and speed.
In a world where artificial intelligence can outperform humans in all three, these numbers don’t mean what they used to. While knowing facts may help you win trivia night, AI doesn’t just memorize. It ingests, integrates, and applies information in milliseconds. No matter how quickly you think, you will not beat a machine trained to process billions of data points in real time. They execute reasoning tasks with precision and consistency. To compete with AI on its terms is not only difficult, it is fundamentally impossible to win.
This doesn’t mean humans are obsolete. It means that the definition of intelligence is shifting from retention to application, from knowing answers to asking the right questions.
As a result, the workforce is changing. AI has the ability to make recent graduates far more efficient and productive than those with decades-long careers. Not because they know more, but because they know how to leverage machines that do. AI doesn’t just speed up tasks — it enhances decision-making, streamlines workflows, and provides access to insights that previously took years to develop. It makes expert-level output more accessible and less dependent on time served.
In 2020 (back to the pre-ChatGPT days), the World Economic Forum reported that 97 million jobs will be created for the development of AI and human-AI collaboration. Indeed finds that manufacturing, retail and commerce, transportation, data analysis, and financial analysis roles are very likely to be taken over entirely by AI. However, those who can develop AI, like machine learning engineers, data scientists, and software developers, will be safe.
The critical divide will no longer be about high scores and low scores — it will be between those who can work with AI and those who cannot. To succeed, you no longer need to be the best at doing what a machine can do. You need to be good at doing what a machine cannot: frame the problem, direct the tools, synthesize the results, and ask what’s next. To be smart today is to be AI-literate — to prompt, evaluate, iterate, and apply.
In other words, asking the right question is now more valuable than knowing the right answer.
If you’re still operating in a world where standardized tests define talent, you’re behind. Not because these tests are useless, but because they no longer reflect the skills that the future demands.
In the past, leaders didn’t need the highest scores — they just needed to be sharp, driven, and good with people. That used to be enough. But not anymore. Today, the ones who will lead are those who will adapt the fastest. Who rethink what it means to be smart. Who treat AI not as a threat but as a collaborator, a force multiplier. Those who don’t fear being replaced because they’ve already figured out how to make themselves indispensable.
The question isn’t whether AI will replace you. It’s whether you know how to use it well enough that it won’t have to.

Paloma Shemirani, 23, collapsed on July 19 last year and was taken to Royal Sussex County Hospital where she died five days later. She had earlier declined treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Her mother, Kay “Kate” Shemirani, a prominent online conspiracy theorist and her father, Dr Faramarz Shemirani, who is “sympathetic” to his ex-wife’s views, believe medical professionals are to blame for their daughter’s death.
Coroner Catherine Wood, presiding over the inquest at Kent and Medway Coroner’s Court in Maidstone, left the court due to the behaviour of Miss Shemirani’s parents on Tuesday afternoon.
The inquest, which was originally scheduled to conclude on Wednesday, had been extended as the evidence and questioning of witnesses had taken longer than anticipated.
On Tuesday, Mrs Shemirani, who was struck off as a nurse in 2021 after spreading harmful misinformation about Covid-19, was cross-examined by Dr Shemirani.
Questioning broke down when Dr Shemirani, who is understood to have a PhD in computational fluid dynamics, tried to ask his ex-wife’s opinion of medical evidence which she would then try to answer, despite warnings from the coroner.
“Mrs Shemirani, I’ve told you not to speak, I’ll find you in contempt if you keep on speaking now,” the coroner said.
“Confine (yourself) to asking questions of this witness as a witness of fact,” she told Dr Shemirani.
As Dr Shemirani argued back through his video-link, the coroner said: “Dr Shemirani, challenge me by judicial review later” before trying to move on.
“Of course I will, of course I will,” he replied.
Later, Dr Shemirani once again tried to ask questions which had already been ruled irrelevant by the coroner.
“I’m going to rise for a few minutes because I’m finding it incredibly difficult to keep you on track,” said Ms Wood.
Dr Shemirani continued to speak until the coroner shouted “Dr Shemirani, listen”.
“Your behaviour has been bordering on contemptuous to the court – when I make a ruling on something you cannot come back,” she added.
Mrs Shemirani also accused osteopath Nick Gosset of lying under oath earlier in the inquest.
Mr Gosset treated Miss Shemirani the day she collapsed and said she had appeared to be in the “last stages of a very difficult disease”.
He told the court that when he inspected her, he could feel lumps in her right shoulder going all the way up into her neck, which he identified as lymphoid mass and that he “had never seen anything like it” in 43 years of practice.
Mr Gosset told the court: “It was obvious to me that I was not the right person to be helping her, normally you see a patient like that, you would refer her (to a GP).
“Any referral was refused – when I suggested that the proper avenue of approach was through a normal, medical channel she dismissed it.
On Tuesday, Paloma’s mother said “his statement under oath is completely opposed with the truth” and has argued her daughter was healthy the day she collapsed.

In a letter addressed to George Washington University President Ellen Granberg, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon recounted how within the short span of April 25 and May 1, 2024, the university received ""no less than eight complaints"" from faculty and students alleging that they were facing discrimination due to their Jewish or Israeli roots. The complaints come as anti-Israel demonstrators established an encampment on George Washington's campus, which the Justice Department investigation found was created for the purpose ""to frighten, intimidate, and deny Jewish, Israeli, and American-Israeli free and unfettered access to GWU's educational environment.""
""The antisemitic, hate-based misconduct by GWU students directed at Jewish GWU students, faculty, and employees was, in a word, shocking,"" Dhillon wrote. ""The behavior was demonstrably abhorrent, immoral, and,most importantly, illegal.""
The Justice Department recounts how Jewish students were repeatedly subjected to racial slurs and antisemitic attacks by demonstrators within the encampment such as ""Zionists go to hell,"" ""F*** you, Zionist go die,"" and ""Zionists go to hell."" These demonstrators were not reprimanded by faculty staff, rather school officials such as GWU's Assistant Dean of Students and a GWU Police Department officer were instructing Jewish students to leave the area because their presence was ""antagonizing and provoking the crowd.""
The investigation found that Jewish students ""were afraid to attend class, to be observed, or, worse, to be ""caught"" and perhaps physically beaten on GWU's campus because of the antagonistic threats waged by the demonstrators.
However, the Justice Department investigation found that George Washington University took no ""meaningful action"" regarding the antisemitic complaints filed against the demonstrators and was ""deliberately indifferent to the hostile educational environment on its campus.""
""Every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,"" Dhillon said in a statement. ""No one is above the law, and universities that promulgate antisemitic discrimination will face legal consequences.""
The Justice Department found George Washington University to be in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and is offering the school the opportunity to resolve the ""matter through a voluntary resolution agreement."" Failure of George Washington University to comply could lead the university to lose federal funding.
George Washington University Spokesperson Shannon McClendon said that the university has already taken steps to address the incidents of antisemitism reported on its campus.
""GW condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in our civil society,"" McClendon said in a statement to the National News Desk. ""Moreover, our actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to addressing antisemitic actions and promoting an inclusive campus environment by upholding a safe, respectful, and accountable environment. We have taken appropriate action under university policy and the law to hold individuals or organizations accountable, including during the encampment, and we do not tolerate behavior that threatens our community or undermines meaningful dialogue.""
""We have worked diligently with members of GW’s Jewish community, as well as Jewish community organizations, city and federal authorities to protect the GW community from antisemitism and we remain committed to working with them to ensure every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,""McClendon continued.

""GW condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in our civil society,"" McClendon said in a statement to the National News Desk. ""Moreover, our actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to addressing antisemitic actions and promoting an inclusive campus environment by upholding a safe, respectful, and accountable environment. We have taken appropriate action under university policy and the law to hold individuals or organizations accountable, including during the encampment, and we do not tolerate behavior that threatens our community or undermines meaningful dialogue.""
""We have worked diligently with members of GW’s Jewish community, as well as Jewish community organizations, city and federal authorities to protect the GW community from antisemitism and we remain committed to working with them to ensure every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,""McClendon continued.
Just last week the Trump administration suspended more than half a billion in funding from University of California Los Angeles over a Justice Department's findings that school failed to adequately address antisemitism on it campus, stemming from the nationwide encampments in protest to the Israel-Gaza War last spring.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Department of Justice found that George Washington University acted ""deliberately indifferent"" in response to antisemitic incidents on its campus last spring.
In a letter addressed to George Washington University President Ellen Granberg, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon recounted how within the short span of April 25 and May 1, 2024, the university received ""no less than eight complaints"" from faculty and students alleging that they were facing discrimination due to their Jewish or Israeli roots. The complaints come as anti-Israel demonstrators established an encampment on George Washington's campus, which the Justice Department investigation found was created for the purpose ""to frighten, intimidate, and deny Jewish, Israeli, and American-Israeli free and unfettered access to GWU's educational environment.""
""The antisemitic, hate-based misconduct by GWU students directed at Jewish GWU students, faculty, and employees was, in a word, shocking,"" Dhillon wrote. ""The behavior was demonstrably abhorrent, immoral, and,most importantly, illegal.""
The Justice Department recounts how Jewish students were repeatedly subjected to racial slurs and antisemitic attacks by demonstrators within the encampment such as ""Zionists go to hell,"" ""F*** you, Zionist go die,"" and ""Zionists go to hell."" These demonstrators were not reprimanded by faculty staff, rather school officials such as GWU's Assistant Dean of Students and a GWU Police Department officer were instructing Jewish students to leave the area because their presence was ""antagonizing and provoking the crowd.""
The investigation found that Jewish students ""were afraid to attend class, to be observed, or, worse, to be ""caught"" and perhaps physically beaten on GWU's campus because of the antagonistic threats waged by the demonstrators.
However, the Justice Department investigation found that George Washington University took no ""meaningful action"" regarding the antisemitic complaints filed against the demonstrators and was ""deliberately indifferent to the hostile educational environment on its campus.""
""Every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,"" Dhillon said in a statement. ""No one is above the law, and universities that promulgate antisemitic discrimination will face legal consequences.""
The Justice Department found George Washington University to be in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and is offering the school the opportunity to resolve the ""matter through a voluntary resolution agreement."" Failure of George Washington University to comply could lead the university to lose federal funding.
George Washington University Spokesperson Shannon McClendon said that the university has already taken steps to address the incidents of antisemitism reported on its campus.
""GW condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in our civil society,"" McClendon said in a statement to the National News Desk.

Tony Evers could consider legal action to keep $62.4 million in solar energy grants that are being pulled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to a spokesperson for the governor.
The cuts, handed down by the EPA per President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will take back $7 billion previously awarded to 49 states for the now-defunct Solar for All program.
Evers previously criticized the cuts as having ""no legitimate purpose or justification"" and being ""potentially illegal.""
""Gov. Evers will continue to fight for Wisconsin to receive the investments that Congress approved and Wisconsinites were promised, including exploring all legal options available,"" the Evers spokesperson told The Center Square.
While the EPA seeks to reclassify the previous grants as “unobligated” and take them back, some officials and trade groups argued the EPA has no legal authority to do so since the funds were already congressionally approved, The Washington Post reported.
According to David Strifling, an associate professor at Marquette University Law School, the cuts of congressionally greenlit solar funds are a constitutional question, potentially also involving breach of contract claims that Wisconsin could try to challenge with other states.
“This would be a question of federal law, so if Wisconsin decides to contest the cancellation, it could perhaps join a consortium of like-minded states to challenge the action together rather than going it alone,” Strifling told The Center Square.
Alternatively, Strifling said Wisconsin could try to weigh in on an existing lawsuit by filing a brief as an amicus curiae, meaning it could offer information, expertise or insight that has a bearing on the issues in a given case.

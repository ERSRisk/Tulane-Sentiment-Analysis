University High's Lamar Brown committed to LSU football over Texas A&M, Texas and Miami, he announced at Pennington McKernan Gymnasium on Thursday afternoon.
The five-star defensive lineman in the 2026 class is the highest-rated player at his position and the No. 5 overall player in the country, according to the 247Sports composite rankings. On ESPN, he’s listed as the No. 1 player in the nation.
""It always started off with coach (Brian) Kelly,"" Brown said during a commitment that aired on ESPN. ""That was my first offer. He always believed in me. Just the coaches here, playing for Baton Rouge, playing for the state of Louisiana, it meant a lot.""
The 6-foot-4, 285-pound Brown also plays on the offensive line in high school, though he said he wants to play defensive line as he moves forward. He is described as a stout and explosive athlete who “projects as a high-major impact player on either side of the ball” and has “legitimate high-round NFL Draft potential,” according to a 247Sports scouting report.
The two-way player is also a decorated track and field athlete. He was the 2025 Louisiana 3A State Champion in the discus with a winning throw of 151 feet and 6 inches. He took gold in the event as a sophomore and finished second in 2023 as a freshman.
LSU’s recruiting class jumped to No. 7 nationally, according to 247Sports, after Brown's commitment. He is now the second-highest-rated player who has committed to Kelly and his staff behind wide receiver Tristen Keys, who is the No. 3 player in the country on the 247Sports composite.
If LSU holds onto Brown and Keys, it would sign two of the top 5 recruits on the 247Sports composite rankings. The last time that happened was 2011 with offensive lineman La'el Collins and defensive lineman Anthony Johnson.
Brown would be the first No. 1 overall recruit on ESPN's rankings to sign with the Tigers since running back Leonard Fournette in 2014.",The Advocate,[],"['Louisiana', 'Baton Rouge', 'Lamar Brown', 'LSU', 'Texas A&M', 'Texas', 'Miami', 'ESPN', 'Brian', 'Kelly', 'Brown', 'ESPN', 'Baton Rouge', 'Louisiana', 'Brown', 'NFL Draft', 'Louisiana 3A State Champion', 'LSU', 'Brown', 'Kelly', 'Tristen Keys', 'LSU', 'Brown', 'Keys', ""La'el Collins"", 'Anthony Johnson', 'Brown', 'ESPN', 'Tigers', 'Leonard Fournette']","LSU football lands Lamar Brown, the best recruit in Louisiana and top-5 player in 2026 class.

At Eagle Point High School, I exceeded my own expectations by getting involved in various activities, such as Leadership, National Honor Society, Varsity Sports, Yearbook Editor and Editor in Chief, Junior Class Representative, Senior Class Secretary, Top 5% of my class all four years and Prom Committee. I also took college classes, tutored, and joined the Latinx Student Union. These positions required a significant amount of dedication, hard work, and year-round commitment. Although I cannot predict the future, I aspire to continue to challenge myself and strive for excellence in all that I do.
Why I Chose Oregon Tech and My Major
In fourth grade, I had an X-ray for back issues that sparked my interest in pursuing Radiology. After researching and consulting with educators, Oregon Tech emerged as the ideal college choice, notably due to its externship program that offers a practical experience to supplement theoretical learning.
My Influential Professors
In the fall term, I enrolled in MIT103 under the tutelage of Professor Carrie Giacomelli. Professor Giacomelli was a knowledgeable and professional instructor who invited guest speakers to provide real-world insights into our future careers. Likewise, I hold Professor Tricia Elliott in high regard for her unwavering commitment to her students' educational development. Professor Elliott's engaging teaching style made the difficult subject of Anatomy and Physiology more accessible, using animal analogies to enhance comprehension.
My Greatest Learning Experience At Oregon Tech
Relocating to a new location inevitably entails learning about oneself and others. In particular, effective time management became a critical skill that I had to develop. Despite having accrued college credits while still in high school, adapting to college coursework necessitated a challenging but ultimately rewarding adjustment process.
My Plans After Graduation
After college, I aim to join a program that lets me travel across the United States to provide medical aid to patients.

We hear it from the time we're little
“Find your purpose.”
It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?
This is “purpose anxiety” — the gnawing sense that one’s life should have an overarching purpose, but it’s unclear how to discover it.
“There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.
The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?
Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help “close that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,” he said.
People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.
There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.
But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.
The term “purpose anxiety” appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.”
People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose.
“Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.”
“But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.”
Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center).
Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don’t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.
As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit.""
You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life.
It entails “understanding who you are and what you have to work with, understanding what you care about, what you’d like to see be better, either in yourself or in the world” and then figuring out if you can make an impact, he added.
“In our culture, we are so outcome-focused and process-adverse,” he said. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.”
For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second.
“Big ‘P’ Purpose is goal-oriented — it’s usually big and audacious, and often unattainable,” he said. Social media, he said, “is full of people trying to voice that version of purpose on you so that they can make money.”
Better, he said, to focus on little “p” purpose and pursuits that some might simply call hobbies — gardening, singing, collecting baseball cards. Or it can be found in a job, or volunteering.
“What could I do that would light me up and fill me up and be a good use of my time?” Grumet said.
It’s not just for self-improvement, he said. When people do something they love, they attract people to them, which can help create communities.
Not all agree that hobbies and passions are the same as purpose. Reading books, Kashdan said, isn’t a purpose in itself but can be a tool to discovering it. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.”
Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children
“I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.
But she ended up creating an online community for childless women called Gateway Women.com. In rural Ireland, where she lives, she is also helping build an in-person group that brings people without children together as they age.
“I feel that to be alive in this time, and to have a platform and to be awake is an incredible privilege, and that is my purpose,” she said.

More than 470 fires across the country are currently classified as “out of control”, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).
7,318,421 hectares of land in Canada have burned due to wildfires this year – close to 78% more than the five-year average of 4,114,516 hectares, according to the CIFFC’s latest data.
The 2025 fire season is only behind the explosive 2023 wildfire season, which resulted in an astounding 17,203,625 hectares burned.
“This is our new reality… the warmer it gets, the more fires we see,” said Mike Flannigan, the BC research chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops.
A June analysis on the 2025 fire season in Canada published by United Nations University in Shibuya, Japan, concluded that the fires are a “stark manifestation” of climate change and that warm, dry weather in the spring resulted in temperatures 2.5C above average.
The warmer temperatures extend the fire season and increase the frequency of lightning that sparks fires, said Flannigan. A hotter climate also causes the atmosphere to suck moisture out of fuel, dead vegetation and the forest floor – creating ideal conditions for fires to start, he explained.
“It means more of the material is dried out, is available to burn when the fire does come, it leads to bigger flames, higher intensity, which gets to be difficult to impossible to extinguish,” he said.
So far, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which together account for about 60% of the hectares burned so far this year in Canada.
Tens of thousands of people in communities across the country have been evacuated due to the wildfires. In Saskatchewan, the Canadian Red Cross reported it had assisted more than 17,000 people in the province from over 6,700 households to evacuate.
Thirteen communities in north-west Saskatchewan are under an evacuation order, several of which are First Nations, according to the province. One of the most affected areas of this year’s wildfire season in the province is Denare Beach, a north-eastern village that was mostly destroyed in June due to a blaze.
The season has also now hit the east coast of Canada, as wildfires are currently raging across Newfoundland and Labrador and several towns are under evacuation orders.
John Abatzoglou, a professor of complex systems management at the University of California, Merced, co-authored the June report from United Nations University.
Abatzoglou said this year’s fire season is the third year in a row Canada has seen fire activity that is well above average. The fires are also causing widespread smoke to cascade from the country into the United States as well, prompting severe air quality warnings in several states this month, is also an indication of how the fires are hurting populations beyond evacuations.
It’s an international element of the fires that officials are having to contend with on a wider scale, Abatzoglou said.
“This is a really key point that’s different from other natural hazards and its ability to impact everything from quality of life to … human health and even mortality,” he said.
Governments and public health officials will have to address how to change public behaviour and public policy to contend with “smoke days”, where you have to stay inside, he said.

The man, who remained anonymous in the case study, told doctors he had eliminated sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt, from his diet after reading about its negative health effects. He said he could only find sources telling him how to reduce salt, but not eliminate it completely.
Inspired by his nutrition studies in college, the man decided to completely eliminate sodium chloride from his diet as a personal experiment, with consultation from Chat GPT, researchers wrote. He maintained multiple dietary restrictions and even distilled his own water at home.
“For 3 months, he had replaced sodium chloride with sodium bromide obtained from the internet after consultation with ChatGPT, in which he had read that chloride can be swapped with bromide, though likely for other purposes, such as cleaning,” the case study read.
While excess sodium can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of health issues, it is still necessary to consume a healthy amount of it.
The man, who had no psychiatric history, eventually ended up at the hospital, worried that his neighbor was poisoning him. He told doctors he was very thirsty, but paranoid about the water he was offered.
“In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability,” the study read.
Doctors concluded that the man was suffering from bromism, or bromide toxicity, a condition that is rare today but was more common in the early 20th century. The research noted that bromide was found in several over-the-counter medicines back then and contributed to up to 8% of bromism-related psychiatric admissions at that time.
The hospital treated the man for psychosis and discharged him weeks later. His case highlights the potential pitfalls of using AI to seek medical tips.
Dr. Margaret Lozovatsky, a pediatrician, warned last year that AI often misses crucial context.

""At first I was shocked, then it turned into panic,"" said the 20-year-old, describing the ordeal as a ""wound that will leave a scar"".
C was one of three women who exposed an AI porn scandal at Hong Kong's oldest university last month, sparking huge debate around what had largely been seen as an overseas phenomenon.
The victims, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, and experts said the city was ill-prepared to counter the fast-growing threat.
In the University of Hong Kong (HKU) case, hundreds of images of at least 20 women were discovered on the student's laptop.
""B"", another of those who spoke out, said she felt betrayed as she had considered the perpetrator a friend.
""I felt like my privacy was violated... like I couldn't trust the people around me,"" she said.
The university's initial response was to give the student a warning letter and make him apologise.
The third woman, ""A"", said she was told by staff the case couldn't be heard before a disciplinary committee.
""They were concerned but didn't know what they could do... We felt that was a bit ridiculous.""
HKU told AFP it ""has been in contact with the students involved"" but cannot comment further with the case under active review.
- Damage may 'never end' -
While the HKU case has thrust AI-made porn into the spotlight, it is not the city's first.
Janice, a woman in her late 20s who also asked to use a pseudonym, told AFP she was devastated a few years ago when fake obscene images were sent to her friends.
She never found the culprit and worried that the damage might ""never end"".
""I tried skipping work and didn't dare to go out on the street,"" she said, adding that she had suicidal thoughts and would suddenly burst into tears.
""I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would wake up to see the whole internet filled with (pornographic) images of me.""
Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women received 11 similar requests for help in 2024-25.
""We have observed an uptick... Some cases may be hidden if (victims) don't know how to seek help,"" executive director Doris Chong said.
Janice doubted she had enough evidence to persuade police to help, adding that she felt society will ""never find a way"" to punish canny offenders.
- Type of 'sexual violence' -
An estimated 90 percent of AI-made porn victims are women, Susanne Choi from the Chinese University of Hong Kong told AFP, ""suggesting that it is a form of gender-based sexual violence"".
Asked for the number of recent cases involving deepfake pornography, police said they did not maintain such figures.
Lawmakers and universities need to ""expand and revise existing laws and procedures to better cope with... technology-facilitated sexual harassment"", Choi argued.
Discussions in Britain and Singapore show a growing willingness to penalise its creation, though opinion is split on possession, according to Hong Kong barrister Stephen Keung.
Hong Kong currently criminalises the distribution of ""intimate images"", including AI-made ones, but not their creation or possession.
That made legal action in the HKU case difficult as there was no evidence that the pictures were circulated.
After the women went public with the scandal, however, Hong Kong's privacy watchdog launched a criminal investigation, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is handling a related complaint.
- Dignity 'undermined' -
The three students said they have had to deal with public backlash.
Once an avid social media user, C temporarily stopped posting, worried about who else ""would screengrab my photos for what purpose"".
""Many commenters said... 'You are ruining the guy's future, you should apologise to him',"" she said, saying she endured periods of self-doubt.
The student has not been named and AFP was unable to reach him for comment.
B said the trio did not want to ""play judge"" but believed offenders should face long-term consequences.
""The mere creation (of AI porn) is a problem... My bodily autonomy, my privacy, my dignity were undermined by it,"" B said.
""If a line must be drawn, it should be drawn at creation.""

She never found the culprit and worried that the damage might ""never end"".
""I tried skipping work and didn't dare to go out on the street,"" she said, adding that she had suicidal thoughts and would suddenly burst into tears.
""I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would wake up to see the whole internet filled with (pornographic) images of me.""
Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women received 11 similar requests for help in 2024-25.
""We have observed an uptick... Some cases may be hidden if (victims) don't know how to seek help,"" executive director Doris Chong said.
Janice doubted she had enough evidence to persuade police to help, adding that she felt society will ""never find a way"" to punish canny offenders.
- Type of 'sexual violence' -
An estimated 90 percent of AI-made porn victims are women, Susanne Choi from the Chinese University of Hong Kong told AFP, ""suggesting that it is a form of gender-based sexual violence"".
Asked for the number of recent cases involving deepfake pornography, police said they did not maintain such figures.
Lawmakers and universities need to ""expand and revise existing laws and procedures to better cope with... technology-facilitated sexual harassment"", Choi argued.
Discussions in Britain and Singapore show a growing willingness to penalise its creation, though opinion is split on possession, according to Hong Kong barrister Stephen Keung.
Hong Kong currently criminalises the distribution of ""intimate images"", including AI-made ones, but not their creation or possession.
That made legal action in the HKU case difficult as there was no evidence that the pictures were circulated.
After the women went public with the scandal, however, Hong Kong's privacy watchdog launched a criminal investigation, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is handling a related complaint.
- Dignity 'undermined' -
The three students said they have had to deal with public backlash.
Once an avid social media user, C temporarily stopped posting, worried about who else ""would screengrab my photos for what purpose"".
""Many commenters said... 'You are ruining the guy's future, you should apologise to him',"" she said, saying she endured periods of self-doubt.
The student has not been named and AFP was unable to reach him for comment.
B said the trio did not want to ""play judge"" but believed offenders should face long-term consequences.
""The mere creation (of AI porn) is a problem... My bodily autonomy, my privacy, my dignity were undermined by it,"" B said.
""If a line must be drawn, it should be drawn at creation.""

As a former school leader and as a parent to teenagers, I know the range of emotions that come with exams and the reassurances we try to offer our children, or the students in our lives, as they navigate their journey into higher education.
While more than three quarters of students are accepted at their first choice (their Ucas “firm” choice) every year, we are also seeing increasing activity in clearing — from those whose Plan A hasn’t worked out, those who would like to revisit their choices, as well as those who have just decided to apply for the first time. If you are supporting someone waiting for their results this summer, or who wants to enter higher education, and you are not quite sure what clearing is about, Ucas has a wealth of information and practical tips to guide you.
What exactly is clearing?
Clearing is the final stage of the Ucas admissions process. It allows students who have received their results to find university or college places that are yet to be filled. It’s available to anyone who may not have received the grades they need for their firm or insurance choice — but also to those who do have a place and are considering another option, or those who only decide to apply after the last main scheme Ucas deadline in June. Last year 38,935 UK 18-year-olds secured a place at university or college through clearing.
Clearing opened on July 5 and runs until October 20, although the busiest activity happens in mid-August just after the results for A-level, Btec and other qualifications are released. There are plenty of options in clearing once again this year, with about 28,000 courses available across the country.
At Ucas we always advise students to do their research, so they can be prepared for whatever happens. Our advice this year includes encouraging applicants to build a results day action plan by reflecting on their research and reconnecting with their choices. Students might want to look back at their original five choices on the Ucas application and revisit them as a potential option, as we know many students return to one of the original universities or colleges they applied to earlier in the cycle. In other words, don’t start making a whole new playlist when you already have good reasons to choose your favourite songs.
Who else is clearing for?
If a student hasn’t applied to university or college yet but is starting to wish that they had, it’s not too late. They may have just realised that they do want to start a degree this autumn, or they may be a few years into their careers but are looking to get back into education. Whatever the reason, they can still apply to university or college through Ucas by applying directly into clearing. This is an increasingly popular route, with more students choosing to apply direct to clearing every year, in addition to the traditional clearing users who find themselves there having just missed out on the grades needed for their firm or insurance choices.
Last year 67 per cent of those who found a place at university or college in clearing told Ucas that they started their research before August, which shows the importance of getting prepared before results day. For any students who are potentially rethinking their firm choice, I would always suggest getting in touch with that university in the first instance to discuss options. The university might be able to offer a place on a different course if they have changed their mind about what subject they want to study and can share more information about available support.
It’s clear that clearing has evolved, with growing numbers of students now using it as a planned route to find the right course or university for them.
How does it work?
The best way for students to use clearing is to start by creating an account on the Ucas website. They can then search for available courses and, once they have found one they are interested in, contact the university or college directly (making sure they have their clearing number and personal ID on hand) to check they meet the entry requirements. If they are offered a place that they want to accept, they can add the clearing choice in their application via their Ucas account.
Applicants will be able to add a clearing choice from 1pm on Level 3 Results Day, which this year is Thursday, August 14 — or for students in Scotland, from 10am on SQA Results Day on Tuesday, August 5.
Is extra support available?
Ucas has a range of digital tools to support applicants during this time, with our Clearing Plus tool offering personalised matches to available courses based on the information students have submitted in their application. Students can get a taster of different subjects or different careers with virtual work experience on ucas.com. We also have a team of experts on hand who can be reached on the phone, on our social media channels and via our website.
This year we have worked with Clementine Wade, the university and school coach, to create resources specifically for parents, carers and guardians to help you understand what you can do to best support your child through the process.
Results day is a cause for huge celebration, for students, their parents and carers, their teachers, and everyone else who has supported them through their education so far. At Ucas we are committed to ensuring as many people as possible can benefit from the life-changing opportunity of higher education. Together this summer we can help students to make informed choices so they can progress with excitement and confidence.",GDeltProject,[],"['Ucas', 'UK', 'n’t', 'Ucas', 'Ucas', 'Scotland', 'SQA Results Day', 'Clearing Plus', 'Clementine Wade']","A-level results day 2025: full guide to Ucas clearing.

NIH has recently announced a new policy that will continue to support originality, creativity, and fairness in the research application process. NIH has noticed that some Principal Investigators (PIs) have been submitting a large number of research applications that far exceed the numbers we traditionally expect and may have been prepared using artificial intelligence (AI) tools.
While AI may be a helpful tool in preparing applications, the rapid submission of large numbers of research applications from a single PI may undermine the fairness and originality of the research application process and unfairly strain NIH’s application review processes.
As use of AI tools becomes more commonplace, it is important to remember that applicants may use AI in limited aspects to reduce administrative burden while preparing applications. However, applicants should be mindful of the concerns around research misconduct or lack of originality when using such tools. Remember, NIH peer reviewers are prohibited from using AI for their critiques.
To address these issues, the new policy is effective for the September 25, 2025, receipt date and beyond:
Applications that are either substantially developed by AI or containing sections substantially developed by AI are not considered the original ideas of applicants and will not be considered by NIH.
-
NIH will also only accept up to six new, renewal, resubmission, or revision applications from an individual PD/PI (Program Director/Principal Investigator) or Multiple Principal Investigator for all council rounds in a calendar year.

Last month was muggier than usual for the majority of the Lower 48. Parts of the Midwest, East Coast and mid-Atlantic regions, in particular, were intensely humid in July, according to preliminary data compiled by researchers at Oregon State University.
Hot and humid conditions are to be expected in the summer, but heat index values — what conditions “feel like” when humidity and air temperatures are combined — soared well into the triple digits for extended periods of time in places such as Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Florida last month.
Cities such as Pittsburgh; Roanoke, Virginia; and Washington, D.C., all registered their most humid July in recorded history, according to figures compiled by the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, which collects and tracks data on precipitation, soil temperature and other environmental conditions. New York City and Raleigh, North Carolina, had their second-most-humid July, while humidity in Detroit and Cincinnati reached their third-highest levels last month.
In Paducah, Kentucky, a brutal stretch of high heat and humidity from July 16 to 30 set a slew of new records for the city.
“We have reached the end to the longest stretch of continuously high humidity that Paducah has witnessed in the past 75 years,” the local branch of the National Weather Service said Thursday in a post on X, adding that the number of hours at “oppressive levels” of humidity exceeded 300% of the city’s normal amount for the month of July.
Humid days are expected to be more common as a result of climate change, because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. But beyond the discomfort of a sticky summer, soaring humidity levels pose serious threats to health and public safety.
High heat index values increase the risk of heat-related illness and death, particularly among children, older adults and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. A 2022 study by the nonprofit organization Climate Central found that the combination of high heat and humidity can affect the body’s ability to cool itself down through sweating.
“In many parts of the country and the globe, dangerous heat often occurs along with high humidity — and the pair of conditions multiplies the health risks,” the researchers wrote in their analysis.
A warmer atmosphere can also spawn stronger storms that are capable of dumping huge amounts of rain over land, often causing dangerous flash flooding.

The 2017 “megaflash” stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City — a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.
“Over time, as the data record continues to expand, we will be able to observe even the rarest types of extreme lightning on Earth and investigate the broad impacts of lightning on society,” study lead author Michael Peterson, an atmospheric scientist in the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said in a statement.

An enormous, 515-mile-long flash of lightning that crossed at least three states has been named the longest in recorded history in the world.
The 2017 “megaflash” stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City — a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.

Losses of land-based water could have profound implications for access to safe drinking water","Overpumping groundwater, worsening droughts and more rapid evaporation due to higher temperatures have caused a drastic decline in the amount of available freshwater, according to a new study.
“Continental drying” has redirected the planet’s total water to the oceans to such degree that it has now surpassed melting ice sheets as the biggest contributor to global sea level rise, the research found.
Losses of land-based water could have profound implications for access to safe drinking water and the ability to grow food in some of the world’s richest agricultural regions.
“We use a lot of water to grow food,” said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at Arizona State University’s School of Sustainability and one of the authors of the study. “If things don’t change, we’ll see impacts on our food security and just our general water availability.”
The findings “should be of paramount concern to the general public, to resource managers, and to decision-makers around the world,” the researchers wrote in the study, adding that the identified trends “send perhaps the direst message on the impact of climate change to date.”
“The continents are drying, freshwater availability is shrinking, and sea level rise is accelerating,” they wrote.
The study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, assessed changes in terrestrial water sources, such as lakes, underground aquifers and moisture in soil, over the past two decades. The researchers found that several factors, including climate change, are disrupting Earth’s natural water cycle, upsetting how moisture circulates between the ground, oceans and atmosphere.
The researchers used data from a suite of four NASA satellites to analyze changes in terrestrial water storage over the past 22 years. The satellites were designed to track the movement of Earth’s water, including changes to the planet’s ice sheets, glaciers and underground reservoirs.
The researchers found, for instance, that parts of the world that are already dry have been rapidly getting drier since 2014. These drought-ridden regions increased by an area twice the size of California each year, Famiglietti said.
In several cases, drought-ridden hotspots expanded to create giant, interconnected “mega-drying” regions, according to the study. One such area covers parts of Central America, Mexico, California, the southwestern United States, the lower Colorado River basin and the southern High Plains.
“The key message here is that water is really a key driver of the changes we see both on land and in the ocean,” said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Earth Sciences Section at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who served on the science team for the NASA missions that produced the decades of data used in the new study.
The study found that every large land mass, except for Greenland and Antarctica, has experienced unprecedented drying since 2002.
Widespread continental drying is expected to have major consequences for people. Three quarters of the world’s population lives in countries where freshwater resources are being depleted, according to the researchers.
Meanwhile, rising seas threaten to creep up on coastal regions around the globe, making them less habitable and adding to the mounting pressures caused by extreme storms and floods. In the U.S., severe weather has helped trigger an insurance crisis in coastal cities that are prone to extreme weather events.
The link between sea-level rise and the loss of water locked up in the ground is a consequence of throwing the planet’s water cycle into chaos. Many of these changes, such as overpumping groundwater, are thought to be permanent — or, at the very least, irreversible for thousands or tens of thousands of years, said Alexander Simms, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved with the study.
“If you pull water off the continents, the only place it has to go is in the ocean,” he said. “Water goes in the atmosphere, then 88% of that water rains down on Earth and ends up in the ocean.”
Simms said the study was fascinating in its ability to estimate the global scale of these water losses, but he was skeptical of the claim that water loss from the continents has now surpassed ice sheet melt as the biggest contributor to sea level rise.
Still, Hamlington said the study shows how the movement of water around the planet has enormous ripple effects. It also suggests that the consequences could intensify in the future, if groundwater is further depleted, freshwater resources shrink and drought conditions worsen.

“The key message here is that water is really a key driver of the changes we see both on land and in the ocean,” said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Earth Sciences Section at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who served on the science team for the NASA missions that produced the decades of data used in the new study.
The study found that every large land mass, except for Greenland and Antarctica, has experienced unprecedented drying since 2002.
Widespread continental drying is expected to have major consequences for people. Three quarters of the world’s population lives in countries where freshwater resources are being depleted, according to the researchers.
Meanwhile, rising seas threaten to creep up on coastal regions around the globe, making them less habitable and adding to the mounting pressures caused by extreme storms and floods. In the U.S., severe weather has helped trigger an insurance crisis in coastal cities that are prone to extreme weather events.
The link between sea-level rise and the loss of water locked up in the ground is a consequence of throwing the planet’s water cycle into chaos. Many of these changes, such as overpumping groundwater, are thought to be permanent — or, at the very least, irreversible for thousands or tens of thousands of years, said Alexander Simms, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved with the study.
“If you pull water off the continents, the only place it has to go is in the ocean,” he said. “Water goes in the atmosphere, then 88% of that water rains down on Earth and ends up in the ocean.”
Simms said the study was fascinating in its ability to estimate the global scale of these water losses, but he was skeptical of the claim that water loss from the continents has now surpassed ice sheet melt as the biggest contributor to sea level rise.
Still, Hamlington said the study shows how the movement of water around the planet has enormous ripple effects. It also suggests that the consequences could intensify in the future, if groundwater is further depleted, freshwater resources shrink and drought conditions worsen.
“This kind of tracking of terrestrial water storage is a critical piece of the puzzle,” he said. “If we can track that water, if we know where it’s going, we can improve our understanding of future drought, flooding and water resource availability over land.”",-1.0,0.0,Climate Infrastructure Risks,1.611,,0.0,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 23:19:34 GMT",20.0,,-1664.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,5.0,1.611,Climate Infrastructure Risks,,2025-08-16 00:29:07.503909+00:00,1,2025-08-16 00:29:07.503885+00:00,,,448.0,,Climate Infrastructure Risks,climate infrastructure risks,Climate Infrastructure Risks,1.0,,,,,,,,,,

New college graduates are facing one of the most challenging markets for entry-level jobs in a decade.

John Yang:
New college graduates are facing one of the most challenging markets for entry level jobs in a decade. In June, the most recent data available, the unemployment rate for recent grads was nearly 5 percent. That's higher than the overall unemployment rate. We asked recent graduates to tell us about their job searches.
Jack O’Connor:
My hope after graduating college was to go straight into a full time job in reporting.
Anjoleigh Schindler:
My initial plans were to find a local job in a magazine. I just wanted to find a job where I could write.
Michael Lavin:
I had aspirations of working for the GSA, General Services Administration. I was going into a third round interview with them around November, December, and that is when the federal hiring freeze took over.
I would often be what I would consider ghosted by employers. Wouldn't get any feedback at all, not even a rejection, just nothing.
I must have started applying for jobs in April, and I know I've sent 85 job applications since. It's been really difficult.
When I wasn't getting any feedback from my applications, was really dejected. So it made me feel like I was unqualified for any job in journalism, like maybe I wasn't good enough.
The experience has definitely been discouraging. But I don't know. I like to take the mindset of I just got to keep plugging away, keep sending in applications, keep trying to revamp my resume.
I think I'm a little too stubborn to switch career paths right now. So I, you know, I'm going to keep at it, keep applying, and we'll just hope for the best, I suppose.
Christine Cruzvergara is the Chief Education Officer at Handshake, which is an online platform that connects young job seekers and employers. Christine, we just heard from three young people. You heard disappointment, you heard a little frustration. How typical is that from what you hear?
Christine Cruzvergara, Chief Education Officer, Handshake:
It's very common right now. The job market is tough, it's competitive. We've seen in our data that jobs are down 15 percent from last year, but applications are up 30 percent.
What makes it so tough?
Christine Cruzvergara:
Well, there are a number of different factors that make it difficult right now. One would obviously be the overall economy, the second would be the government, and the third would be what's happening with AI, disrupting what entry level jobs look like right now.
Talk a little bit about the AI part of that. We've heard some people say that AI is taking over the many of the tasks that entry level workers would normally do.
So employers are going to have new expectations around how you use AI, how it's integrated into your role, the amount of productivity you have. I think that altogether is going to mean that the skill set for an entry level worker will change and evolve and it will look different.
So for someone trying to graduate and find work, right now, they're in the middle of a very messy process where employers are trying to figure out what they want and what that looks like.
We heard one of the young men talking about he wanted to become a reporter, thinking about shifting fields, but wanted to avoid that. He said he was stubborn enough that he didn't want to do it. What are some of the sorts of tough choices or hard decisions that young people are having to face now as they look for their first jobs?
We see in our data that over 40 percent are willing to actually explore other industries that perhaps do have more hiring right now. For example, health care is still rising in terms of number of opportunities, and there aren't enough people who want to go into health care.
So some folks that have tech skills, for example, instead of working in a traditional tech industry, are thinking about, how might I do health tech, how can I pivot in that way? So that's one type of difficult decision.
The second would be location. Where do I want to live? This generation, this class knows that it's extremely expensive to live in certain cities. So the cost of living is factoring into their choices about where they choose to apply, what locations they want to live in.
I think a third piece is really considering what types of skills are they able to build and are they able to build it fast enough for what employers are looking for? And employers are still figuring that out, so it could change from one year to another.
You mentioned health care is a place where there are a lot of opportunities. Are there fields where that are sort of oversubscribed? There are more people chasing after fewer jobs.
Well, I think what we've seen just in the past year or two is that big tech, for example, has certainly slowed down in their hiring. The class of 2025 in particular, has been watching headlines for the better part of two years since seeing major layoffs happen. It is also the industry that is adopting Gen AI the fastest.
And so they are the ones kind of on the forefront of experimenting with what that looks like. How much headcount do you really need? How much could be paired with technology? What will the future of engineering teams look like? So that is certainly an industry where we have seen some slowdown.
What's your advice for the members of the class of 25 who are still out there looking for their first jobs?
Well, I think first you have to find a support group, a support network that's going to keep you positive through the process. It is tough, it is competitive, it is easy to feel rejected and dejected as you go through this process. That can be your family, that can be your friends, it could be your coaches, it could be your peers. Doesn't matter who, you just need to find someone.
I think the second piece is think about how you can upskill, so you have your degree. Fantastic. Are there other skills that you need to pair with that right now and take the advantage of all the online resources and all the free resources that are available to you and find ways to upskill yourself in the downtime while you are looking for a job?
And then lastly, remember that your first job is not your forever job. So keep in mind that whatever that first job is, it's going to teach you some skills. It's going to give you a chance to step up into the next thing. But it doesn't have to be perfect. And sometimes just releasing some of those expectations can help you find that next job a little faster.
Good advice. From Christine Cruzvergara of Handshake, thank you very much.
Thank you so much for having me.

Well, I think what we've seen just in the past year or two is that big tech, for example, has certainly slowed down in their hiring. The class of 2025 in particular, has been watching headlines for the better part of two years since seeing major layoffs happen. It is also the industry that is adopting Gen AI the fastest.
And so they are the ones kind of on the forefront of experimenting with what that looks like. How much headcount do you really need? How much could be paired with technology? What will the future of engineering teams look like? So that is certainly an industry where we have seen some slowdown.
What's your advice for the members of the class of 25 who are still out there looking for their first jobs?
Well, I think first you have to find a support group, a support network that's going to keep you positive through the process. It is tough, it is competitive, it is easy to feel rejected and dejected as you go through this process. That can be your family, that can be your friends, it could be your coaches, it could be your peers. Doesn't matter who, you just need to find someone.
I think the second piece is think about how you can upskill, so you have your degree. Fantastic. Are there other skills that you need to pair with that right now and take the advantage of all the online resources and all the free resources that are available to you and find ways to upskill yourself in the downtime while you are looking for a job?
And then lastly, remember that your first job is not your forever job. So keep in mind that whatever that first job is, it's going to teach you some skills. It's going to give you a chance to step up into the next thing. But it doesn't have to be perfect. And sometimes just releasing some of those expectations can help you find that next job a little faster.
Good advice. From Christine Cruzvergara of Handshake, thank you very much.
Thank you so much for having me.

John Yang:
In Geneva, negotiators from 175 nations are trying to hammer out the first ever legally binding treaty on plastic pollution. The key sticking point is whether it should mandate cuts in plastic production. Oil producing nations including the United States oppose that as fossil fuels are a key ingredient in plastics.
The urgency of the talks was underscored this week by a new study published in the medical journal The Lancet. It calls plastics a grave growing and under recognized danger to human and planetary health. Tracey Woodruff is a professor at the UC San Francisco Medical School and one of the authors of the Lancet study. Tracey, A grave, growing and under recognized danger. What is that danger? Explain the danger to us.
Tracey Woodruff, UC San Francisco School of Medicine: Plastic contains thousands of toxic chemicals. Some of them we know something about and some of them we don't know anything about. But the ones that we do know about, we know that they can lead to increased risk of multiple different types of chronic health effects.
For example, one chemical that's used commonly in plastics to which we are all exposed are phthalates. These are chemicals that are used in everything from vinyl flooring, curtains, plastic couches, even in your car, cosmetics, fragrances. These chemicals are ubiquitous. They're measured in everybody.
And we know they increase the risk of multiple adverse health conditions like obesity and diabetes and they can increase the risk of preterm birth. There's also an increased production of plastics. Currently planned plastic production will triple in the next 30 years. That means more plastic products and more plastic chemicals to which we will be exposed.
Talk about the production picking up the pace. Why is it accelerating?
Tracey Woodruff:
Plastics are made from fossil fuels, oil and gas. And the fossil fuel industry is turning to plastics to stay profitable making plastic and the petrochemicals used in plastic is more profitable than using it for fuel and energy and electricity.
So as the world uses less oil in some cases to address climate change concerns, the fossil fuel industry is shifting its focus to producing more plastic and plastic related chemicals to maintain and increase their profits.
You know, we see recycling bins everywhere now on the street and offices. What impact or what effect does recycling have?
Well, recycling is pretty much a myth that's been sold to us by the fossil fuel industry. And in fact, a report just came out this week talking about how those that the fossil fuel industry knew that you can't actually really recycle plastic. The fact is that less than 10 percent of plastic is recycled and only 1 percent is recycled twice.
And what that means is that a lot of this plastic we're being told, is being recycled to make us feel better, but it's really going into the waste stream. It's degrading in the environment, it's degrading into all of these, varied in the oceans, in fish, and then it's getting into us. So the reality is recycling is not the solution.
There's been a lot of talk about microplastics being so pervasive. Help us understand what that is and do we know what the effects are of having microplastics in our bodies?
Yeah, microplastics, they're essentially little plastics and they're very small, usually smaller than the human eye can see. And they're basic. They come from the degradation of all these many plastics that are being produced by these fossil fuel companies.
And we know that people carry little bits of microplastics in their body because they've been measured in every part of the body that they've been looked at. So everything from breast milk to blood to feces, even in your brain.
These talks in Geneva, they had hoped to conclude this by the end of 2024. Obviously they haven't. What's at stake in these talks?
Well, the health of everybody on this planet is at stake in these talks. The goal of the pla — of the countries that want to see something done about plastic pollution is to identify the hazardous chemicals in the plastics and reduce or eliminate them. The goal of the fossil fuel producing countries is to basically increase plastic production. And they are deviating the plastic negotiation treaties by focusing on recycling, which I have said is not really the solution to plastic production.
And so because these countries or the projected estimates are to triple by 26 plastic production, it really is an important inflection point in how we as well really as part of the global community, decide how we want to address plastics and the plastic related chemicals which we already know are already resulting in adverse human health effects around the globe.

The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.
UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.
President Donald Trump’s administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as with Harvard University.

The White House official did not detail any additional demands the administration has made to UCLA or elaborate on the settlement amount. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Trump administration suspended $584 million in federal grants for UCLA, the university said this week. The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.”
The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. Jewish students said demonstrators in the encampment blocked them from getting to class. One night, counterprotesters attacked the encampment, throwing traffic cones and firing pepper spray, with fighting that continued for hours, injuring more than a dozen people, before police stepped in. The next day, after hundreds defied orders to leave, more than 200 people were arrested.
The University of California’s president, James B. Milliken, said in a statement Friday that the university was reviewing a document it “just received” from the Department of Justice.
“Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” Milliken said. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”
This would not be the university’s first settlement over the 2024 protests. Last month, UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued, arguing that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.
The settlement comes nearly a year after a preliminary injunction was issued, marking the first time a U.S. judge had ruled against a university over their handling of on-campus demonstrations against Israel’s war in Gaza.
UCLA initially had argued that it had no legal responsibility over the issue because protesters, not the university, blocked Jewish students’ access to areas. The university also worked with law enforcement to thwart attempts to set up new protest camps.
But U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi disagreed and ordered UCLA to create a plan to protect Jewish students on campus. The University of California, one of the nation’s largest public university systems, has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests and has said it is committed to campus safety and inclusivity and will continue to implement recommendations.

As part of the settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university’s Jewish community. It also has created an Office of Campus and Community Safety, instituting new policies to manage protests on campus.
UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.
The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.
Last month Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government’s allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restores more than $400 million in research grants.
The Trump administration plans to use its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation.

The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.
UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.
President Donald Trump’s administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as with Harvard University.

A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.
Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.
The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.
A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump’s first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities’ investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.
The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.
The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.
“The tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,” said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.”
The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.
Some universities are on the edge of the law’s parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.
Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.
Despite the colleges’ wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.
“They’re looking for savings wherever possible,” Levine said, which could impact financial aid. “One of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.”
For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.
In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.
Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.
Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.
No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country’s wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it’s also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.
The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard’s research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard’s efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.
“It’s not like Harvard is going to go from one of the best institutions in the world to just a mediocre institution. That’s probably not going to happen,” Levine said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a bad thing — that there won’t be pain and that students won’t suffer.”

The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.”
For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.
In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.
Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.
Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.
No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country’s wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it’s also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.
The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard’s research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard’s efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.
“It’s not like Harvard is going to go from one of the best institutions in the world to just a mediocre institution. That’s probably not going to happen,” Levine said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a bad thing — that there won’t be pain and that students won’t suffer.”

A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.
Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.
The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.
A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump’s first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities’ investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.
The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.
The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.
“The tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,” said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.”
The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.
Some universities are on the edge of the law’s parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.
Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.
Despite the colleges’ wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.
“They’re looking for savings wherever possible,” Levine said, which could impact financial aid. “One of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio’s research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard’s fight with the Trump administration.

“It’s like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, ‘Poof. You’re being cut off.’”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world’s most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard’s lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country’s top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country’s oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.

The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,” the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.

The funding cuts have left Harvard’s research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find nongovernment funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year’s delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,” Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. “It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.”
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
WATCH: The possible long-term impact of Trump’s cuts to medical research funding
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were canceled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university’s fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,” she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country’s reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio’s research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard’s fight with the Trump administration.

“It’s like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, ‘Poof. You’re being cut off.’”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world’s most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard’s lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country’s top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country’s oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.

The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,” the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.

The funding cuts have left Harvard’s research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find nongovernment funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year’s delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,” Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. “It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.”
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
WATCH: The possible long-term impact of Trump’s cuts to medical research funding
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were canceled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university’s fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,” she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country’s reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio’s research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard’s fight with the Trump administration.

“It’s like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, ‘Poof. You’re being cut off.’”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world’s most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard’s lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country’s top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country’s oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.

The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,” the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.

The funding cuts have left Harvard’s research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find nongovernment funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year’s delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,” Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. “It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.”
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
WATCH: The possible long-term impact of Trump’s cuts to medical research funding
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were canceled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university’s fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”

The Trump administration has launched numerous investigations into colleges and universities and withheld billions of dollars in funding, accusing the schools of not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus. About 60 schools have been notified of possible investigations.
Last week, Columbia University settled with the administration in a major deal that could be a blueprint for other battles — or, rather, battles with other schools.
Ali Rogin looked into one of the key players behind the administration's approach.
Ali Rogin:
This is all part of a broader push that the White House says is meant to get elite schools to better address antisemitism. But how did this effort start?
To help answer that question, we're joined by Arno Rosenfeld, an enterprise reporter for The Forward, where he's also the author of the Antisemitism Decoded newsletter.
Arno, thank you so much for joining us.
First of all, how does this administration define antisemitism and how is it that it's become so central to its targeting of universities?
Arno Rosenfeld, Enterprise Reporter, The Forward:
So the administration's understanding of antisemitism is really rooted in hostility toward Israel, so be that anti-Zionism or these other sort of protests. It sort of lumps that in with what they consider to be support for terrorism, support for Hamas.
But I would say that they go a little bit further than that in kind of limiting their focus to what you might consider left-wing antisemitism.
But not really saying as much about antisemitism on the right?
Arno Rosenfeld:
Correct.
I mean, sometimes, they give a little bit more or less rhetorical attention to that, but in terms of substance, it's not their focus. And there are number of people in the administration with ties to right-wing antisemites or who have expressed antisemitism themselves of sort of the right-wing variety.
You have reported on one of the blueprints of the administration's efforts on this. It's called Project Esther. What is it and who's behind it?
So Project Esther was created by The Heritage Foundation, which also created Project 2025, another blueprint in advance of Trump taking office with the sort of hope that it would be a blueprint for a second Trump administration, when we didn't know who was going to be president.
But it's a plan that lays out a strategy that the White House and other sort of federal agencies can take to combat, again, this kind of left-wing antisemitism. They talk about a Hamas support network that is basically a variety of anti-Zionist groups and some groups that aren't even anti-Zionist, but sort of progressive organizations that are critical of Israel, they lump into this antisemitic network.
And then they have a variety of tools that they want the government to use to crack down on that network.
And as you have noted, there were not many Jewish groups involved in the writing of this Project Esther. Why is that and what does it tell you about this endeavor?
You know, The Heritage Foundation doesn't have a lot of Jewish partnerships. There are conservative Jewish groups, but they aren't really in the Heritage broader universe.
And so they had some groups on their task force that was working on Project Esther that were Jewish, but when the report came out, the core groups were these evangelical conservative organizations and some conservative think tanks. And the Jewish groups that were sort of on the list, the bigger list of Jewish groups on the task force, kind of tried to distance themselves from the project.
And how does this project in particular view and talk about critics of Israel's policies and supporters of Palestinian causes?
Well, it's really this idea that they are supporters of Hamas. So it's not just antisemitism. It's support for terrorism.
And I think the reason — or one of the reasons that they use that framework is that opens a whole new avenue of legal options to deal with them. So if you're a foundation that is providing, for example, material support to a terrorist organization, you can be shut down or sanctioned or face other consequences that you couldn't face even if the government sort of officially declared you were antisemitic.
That's legal, but supporting Hamas is not. And so that's one way that they set this up. And the other is that they take even kind of tenuous connections to campus protests or other demonstrations against Israel and equate all of that with antisemitism.
How exactly has the Trump administration implemented Project Esther so far?
So they haven't really commented on whether they're using Project Esther specifically or whether they're just using the same tactics.
And I'm not sure that it matters that much, but we have seen the defunding of universities to pressure them to address civil rights violations against Jewish students or alleged civil rights violations. That's one area. We have also seen immigration crackdowns, which have overlapped with campuses, but trying to deport and arrest foreign students, who they say are engaging in antisemitism.
These are all sort of tools that we saw suggested within Project Esther. There's a lot more vague stuff that it's a little bit hard to pin down, but those are two of the big examples.
So certainly the American Jewish population is not a monolith, but based on your reporting, what do American Jews think of this approach? Do they feel safer?
So we know in general from public opinion polling that Jews do not support President Trump's approach to antisemitism. He doesn't have majority support on really any of the tactics that he's implemented in the name of protecting American Jews, although in some areas we do see that more Jews support a couple of his strategies on college campuses, say, than support his job performance overall.
So there is a little segment that is open to it, even if they're skeptical of him as a president. But I think there's also a sense that, especially on college campuses, Jews are being used as sort of a pawn. So we saw, right, when Columbia University reached the settlement with the federal government, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, described it as a momentous conservative victory.
And she pointed to things that she said conservatives have been trying to do for many years around DEI and affirmative action and addressing left-wing bias on campus that didn't really have to do with Jews. And so there's a sense that Jews are being used as the excuse to launch this crackdown on colleges and universities, and that Jews are then going to be blamed as a result of that.
So I think there's a lot of anxiety that, rather than keeping Jews safe, some of these things may be inflaming those sort of tensions. On the other hand, some folks are really eager to see this address, to see the campus protests addressed more forcefully.
So it's a mixed opinion, but that's some of what I'm hearing from American Jews.
Arno Rosenfeld with The Forward, thank you so much.
Thanks.

And how does this project in particular view and talk about critics of Israel's policies and supporters of Palestinian causes?
Well, it's really this idea that they are supporters of Hamas. So it's not just antisemitism. It's support for terrorism.
And I think the reason — or one of the reasons that they use that framework is that opens a whole new avenue of legal options to deal with them. So if you're a foundation that is providing, for example, material support to a terrorist organization, you can be shut down or sanctioned or face other consequences that you couldn't face even if the government sort of officially declared you were antisemitic.
That's legal, but supporting Hamas is not. And so that's one way that they set this up. And the other is that they take even kind of tenuous connections to campus protests or other demonstrations against Israel and equate all of that with antisemitism.
How exactly has the Trump administration implemented Project Esther so far?
So they haven't really commented on whether they're using Project Esther specifically or whether they're just using the same tactics.
And I'm not sure that it matters that much, but we have seen the defunding of universities to pressure them to address civil rights violations against Jewish students or alleged civil rights violations. That's one area. We have also seen immigration crackdowns, which have overlapped with campuses, but trying to deport and arrest foreign students, who they say are engaging in antisemitism.
These are all sort of tools that we saw suggested within Project Esther. There's a lot more vague stuff that it's a little bit hard to pin down, but those are two of the big examples.
So certainly the American Jewish population is not a monolith, but based on your reporting, what do American Jews think of this approach? Do they feel safer?
So we know in general from public opinion polling that Jews do not support President Trump's approach to antisemitism. He doesn't have majority support on really any of the tactics that he's implemented in the name of protecting American Jews, although in some areas we do see that more Jews support a couple of his strategies on college campuses, say, than support his job performance overall.
So there is a little segment that is open to it, even if they're skeptical of him as a president. But I think there's also a sense that, especially on college campuses, Jews are being used as sort of a pawn. So we saw, right, when Columbia University reached the settlement with the federal government, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, described it as a momentous conservative victory.
And she pointed to things that she said conservatives have been trying to do for many years around DEI and affirmative action and addressing left-wing bias on campus that didn't really have to do with Jews. And so there's a sense that Jews are being used as the excuse to launch this crackdown on colleges and universities, and that Jews are then going to be blamed as a result of that.
So I think there's a lot of anxiety that, rather than keeping Jews safe, some of these things may be inflaming those sort of tensions. On the other hand, some folks are really eager to see this address, to see the campus protests addressed more forcefully.
So it's a mixed opinion, but that's some of what I'm hearing from American Jews.
Arno Rosenfeld with The Forward, thank you so much.

BOSTON (AP) — Harvard University appeared in federal court Monday in a pivotal case in its battle with the Trump administration, as the storied institution argued the government illegally cut $2.6 billion in federal funding.
President Donald Trump’s administration has battered the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university with sanctions for months as it presses a series of demands on the Ivy League school, which he decries as a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism.

Harvard has resisted, and the lawsuit over the cuts to its research grants represents the primary challenge to the administration in a standoff that is being widely watched across higher education and beyond.
A lawyer for Harvard, Steven Lehotsky, said at Monday’s hearing the case is about the government trying to control the “inner workings” of Harvard. The funding cuts, if not reversed, could lead to the loss of research, damaged careers and the closing of labs, he said.
The case is before U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, who is presiding over lawsuits brought by Harvard against the administration’s efforts to keep it from hosting international students. In that case, she temporarily blocked the administration’s efforts.
At Monday’s hearing Harvard is asking her to reverse a series of funding freezes. Such a ruling, if it stands, would revive Harvard’s sprawling scientific and medical research operation and hundreds of projects that lost federal money.
A lawyer for the government, Michael Velchik, said the government has authority to cancel research grants when an institution is out of compliance with the president’s directives. He said episodes at Harvard violated Trump’s order combating antisemitism.
“Harvard wants billions of dollars and that is the only reason we are here,” Velchik said.
Burroughs pushed back, questioning how the government could make “ad-hoc” decisions to cancel grants and do so across Harvard without offering evidence that any of the research is antisemitic.
She also argued the government had provided “no documentation, no procedure” to “suss out” whether Harvard administrators “have taken enough steps or haven’t” to combat antisemitism.
“The consequences of that in terms of constitutional law are staggering,” she said. “I don’t think you can justify a contract action based on impermissible suppression of speech? Where do I have that wrong.”
Harvard’s lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university after it rejected a series of demands in an April 11 letter from a federal antisemitism task force. A second lawsuit over the cuts filed by the American Association of University Professors and its Harvard faculty chapter has been consolidated with the university’s.
The April letter demanded sweeping changes related to campus protests, academics and admissions. For example, the letter told Harvard to audit the viewpoints of students and faculty and admit more students or hire new professors if the campus was found to lack diverse points of view.
Harvard President Alan Garber has said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism but said no government “should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”
The same day Harvard rejected the demands, Trump officials moved to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants. Education Secretary Linda McMahon declared in May that Harvard would no longer be eligible for new grants, and weeks later the administration began canceling contracts with Harvard.
As Harvard fought the funding freeze in court, individual agencies began sending letters announcing that the frozen research grants were being terminated. They cited a clause that allows grants to be scrapped if they no longer align with government policies.
Harvard, which has the nation’s largest endowment at $53 billion, has moved to self-fund some of its research, but warned it can’t absorb the full cost of the federal cuts.
In court filings, the school said the government “fails to explain how the termination of funding for research to treat cancer, support veterans, and improve national security addresses antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the April demand letter was sent. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel contracts for policy reasons.
“It is the policy of the United States under the Trump Administration not to fund institutions that fail to adequately address antisemitism in their programs,” it said in court documents.
The research funding is only one front in Harvard’s fight with the federal government. The Trump administration also has sought to prevent the school from hosting foreign students, and Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.
Finally, last month, the Trump administration formally issued a finding that the school tolerated antisemitism — a step that eventually could jeopardize all of Harvard’s federal funding, including federal student loans or grants. The penalty is typically referred to as a “death sentence.”

The 2017 “megaflash” stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City — a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.
“Over time, as the data record continues to expand, we will be able to observe even the rarest types of extreme lightning on Earth and investigate the broad impacts of lightning on society,” study lead author Michael Peterson, an atmospheric scientist in the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said in a statement.

Columbia University and the Trump administration have reached a deal that restores federal funding and research grant money to the university. As part of the agreement, Columbia will pay $200 million to the federal government over three years and an additional $21 million to resolve alleged civil rights violations against Jewish employees.
The university agreed to suspend, expel, or revoke degrees from some 70 students who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and it will issue a report to a monitor to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion is not promoted on campus.
Columbia, which was at risk of losing billions of dollars from the government, says it retains its academic freedom.
For a closer look at this agreement and what it means for a higher education in the U.S., I'm joined by Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University.
President Roth, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Thanks for joining us.
Michael Roth, President, Wesleyan University:
Thanks for having me.
So let's just start with your initial reaction. When you heard the news and the details of this settlement, what did you think?
Michael Roth:
Well, I felt like one must feel when you have paid a ransom in a kidnapping situation and the person who's been kidnapped is returned safely.
You think, thank goodness, the kid's OK, or the person kidnapped is OK. But I wouldn't phrase the agreement that led to the liberation of the kidnapped person. And so, in this case, I was pleased that this particular moment of assault on higher education by the Trump administration has been resolved, at least for now, although who knows. These agreements come and go with this White House.
I was and I am distressed that, in this country today, the executive branch of the federal government wants to be able to dictate terms to private universities, law firms, newspapers, TV stations. And so all of these things are evidence that the current administration is trying to erode support for institutions in civil society.
Let me put to you, if I may, what the acting president of Columbia University, Claire Shipman, said in an interview on CNN this morning defending the terms of the deal.
Claire Shipman, Acting President, Columbia University:
I think there are a couple of really important things about this agreement from our point of view. One, it doesn't cross the red lines that we laid out. It protects our academic integrity. That was, of course, essential to us.
And, two, it does reset our relationship with the federal government in terms of research funding. And it's not just money for Columbia. I mean, this is about science. It's about curing cancer, cutting-edge, boundary-breaking science that actually benefits the country and humanity.
President Roth, do you believe that, after this deal, Columbia can move forward with full academic freedom, as President Shipman there is saying? And what do you believe the downstream effects of making a deal like this are for other universities?
Well, it's very clear that if you annoy the White House in this regime, you could get sucked into a process of litigation or fines that bear no relation to the facts of the matter, but just become a way of expressing loyalty, of conforming to the wishes of the government.
We saw it at UVA just a week or two ago. You see it now at George Mason. This is an effort to tell universities, as they have told law firms, as they're telling newspapers and as they have done with TV stations, telling these organizations, you are not independent. If you contract with the federal government, we have a — we, the government, has the right to tell you what to do.
This agreement does protect many things at Columbia. And, again, I'm not criticizing them for signing it. I don't criticize the parent for paying a ransom to get their kids back. They're getting their science back. But they're also telling the federal government, you can tell us how to run our Middle East studies program, telling the federal government, you can tell us how many police officers we should have at a minimum on campus or how students should be disciplined.
The White House has determined how students should be disciplined at a private university. This is massive overreach. This is an assault on the independence of civil society in America. And conservatives, liberals, moderates, they should all be concerned when a White House tells you how to run your private associations.
So you're saying they should be concerned.
As you note, Columbia is not the only university that's been targeted by this administration. Harvard, as we have been covering, has actually been fighting the administration in court, but we know there's also settlement talks going on. Do you believe universities and colleges will have no other choice but to make some kind of deal in order to move forward?
Well, I do think that, when you're dealing with a very, very powerful entity like the federal government, especially when it doesn't obey its own laws — I mean, there are no findings of fact here about what the specific actions of antisemitism were — or discrimination against white people.
There's no findings of facts there. It's just, you give us $221 million, and then we allow you to compete for grants. I mean, it's a very old-fashioned game. You pay the powerful figure so that you can go along and continue to operate.
Now, you operate in a way, of course, that you don't want to annoy that powerful figure or that powerful organization. And it sends a chilling message across America that, if you have a late-night comedy show, if you have a law firm, if you are working in an educational institution or a library, or, as we read today, in a museum like the Smithsonian, if you don't please the president, you are at risk.
And, again, I don't blame them for trying to make the best of that situation, but, as Americans, I'm not worried about Columbia. I'm not worried about Wesleyan. I'm worried about the country, where we are being subject to a White House that thinks it could tell us what to do at every turn.
As you know, the administration has long argued that this was about combating antisemitism on campus. This was a deal welcomed by Columbia's Hillel Jewish organization.
The executive director said in part: ""The announcement's an important recognition of what Jewish students and families have expressed with increasing urgency. Antisemitism at Columbia is real. It has a tangible impact on Jewish students' sense of safety, belonging, and their civil rights.""
I guess the question, President Roth, is if it makes Jewish students and staff feel safer, did the administration pressure and the deal do what it intended to do?
How does paying the government $220 million to do basic science make Jews safer? As a Jew, I find this horrific.
I know antisemitism is real, and I know it was real and is real at Columbia, as it is in Congress, as it is in most places in the United States. But the idea that you pay off the government in order to get them off your back so you can do cancer research, and that's good for the Jews, I think it's ridiculous.
We don't need the White House to tell us antisemitism is real two weeks after the Defense Department contracts with Grok, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence entity after it praised Hitler. This is an administration that is not concerned with Jewish welfare. I am concerned with Jewish welfare as a Jew, as a professor, as a college president. I think it's really important to call out antisemitism.
But to pay up basically protection money in a way that's supposed to make Jews safer, I think, in the long run, it's — as we say in my community, it's not good for the Jews.
That is Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University, joining us tonight.
President Roth, thank you for your time.
Thank you for having me.

So let's just start with your initial reaction. When you heard the news and the details of this settlement, what did you think?
Michael Roth:
Well, I felt like one must feel when you have paid a ransom in a kidnapping situation and the person who's been kidnapped is returned safely.
You think, thank goodness, the kid's OK, or the person kidnapped is OK. But I wouldn't phrase the agreement that led to the liberation of the kidnapped person. And so, in this case, I was pleased that this particular moment of assault on higher education by the Trump administration has been resolved, at least for now, although who knows. These agreements come and go with this White House.
I was and I am distressed that, in this country today, the executive branch of the federal government wants to be able to dictate terms to private universities, law firms, newspapers, TV stations. And so all of these things are evidence that the current administration is trying to erode support for institutions in civil society.
Let me put to you, if I may, what the acting president of Columbia University, Claire Shipman, said in an interview on CNN this morning defending the terms of the deal.
Claire Shipman, Acting President, Columbia University:
I think there are a couple of really important things about this agreement from our point of view. One, it doesn't cross the red lines that we laid out. It protects our academic integrity. That was, of course, essential to us.
And, two, it does reset our relationship with the federal government in terms of research funding. And it's not just money for Columbia. I mean, this is about science. It's about curing cancer, cutting-edge, boundary-breaking science that actually benefits the country and humanity.
President Roth, do you believe that, after this deal, Columbia can move forward with full academic freedom, as President Shipman there is saying? And what do you believe the downstream effects of making a deal like this are for other universities?
Well, it's very clear that if you annoy the White House in this regime, you could get sucked into a process of litigation or fines that bear no relation to the facts of the matter, but just become a way of expressing loyalty, of conforming to the wishes of the government.
We saw it at UVA just a week or two ago. You see it now at George Mason. This is an effort to tell universities, as they have told law firms, as they're telling newspapers and as they have done with TV stations, telling these organizations, you are not independent. If you contract with the federal government, we have a — we, the government, has the right to tell you what to do.
This agreement does protect many things at Columbia. And, again, I'm not criticizing them for signing it. I don't criticize the parent for paying a ransom to get their kids back. They're getting their science back. But they're also telling the federal government, you can tell us how to run our Middle East studies program, telling the federal government, you can tell us how many police officers we should have at a minimum on campus or how students should be disciplined.
The White House has determined how students should be disciplined at a private university. This is massive overreach. This is an assault on the independence of civil society in America. And conservatives, liberals, moderates, they should all be concerned when a White House tells you how to run your private associations.
So you're saying they should be concerned.
As you note, Columbia is not the only university that's been targeted by this administration. Harvard, as we have been covering, has actually been fighting the administration in court, but we know there's also settlement talks going on. Do you believe universities and colleges will have no other choice but to make some kind of deal in order to move forward?
Well, I do think that, when you're dealing with a very, very powerful entity like the federal government, especially when it doesn't obey its own laws — I mean, there are no findings of fact here about what the specific actions of antisemitism were — or discrimination against white people.
There's no findings of facts there. It's just, you give us $221 million, and then we allow you to compete for grants. I mean, it's a very old-fashioned game. You pay the powerful figure so that you can go along and continue to operate.
Now, you operate in a way, of course, that you don't want to annoy that powerful figure or that powerful organization. And it sends a chilling message across America that, if you have a late-night comedy show, if you have a law firm, if you are working in an educational institution or a library, or, as we read today, in a museum like the Smithsonian, if you don't please the president, you are at risk.
And, again, I don't blame them for trying to make the best of that situation, but, as Americans, I'm not worried about Columbia. I'm not worried about Wesleyan. I'm worried about the country, where we are being subject to a White House that thinks it could tell us what to do at every turn.
As you know, the administration has long argued that this was about combating antisemitism on campus. This was a deal welcomed by Columbia's Hillel Jewish organization.
The executive director said in part: ""The announcement's an important recognition of what Jewish students and families have expressed with increasing urgency. Antisemitism at Columbia is real. It has a tangible impact on Jewish students' sense of safety, belonging, and their civil rights.""
I guess the question, President Roth, is if it makes Jewish students and staff feel safer, did the administration pressure and the deal do what it intended to do?
How does paying the government $220 million to do basic science make Jews safer? As a Jew, I find this horrific.
I know antisemitism is real, and I know it was real and is real at Columbia, as it is in Congress, as it is in most places in the United States. But the idea that you pay off the government in order to get them off your back so you can do cancer research, and that's good for the Jews, I think it's ridiculous.
We don't need the White House to tell us antisemitism is real two weeks after the Defense Department contracts with Grok, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence entity after it praised Hitler. This is an administration that is not concerned with Jewish welfare. I am concerned with Jewish welfare as a Jew, as a professor, as a college president. I think it's really important to call out antisemitism.
But to pay up basically protection money in a way that's supposed to make Jews safer, I think, in the long run, it's — as we say in my community, it's not good for the Jews.
That is Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University, joining us tonight.
President Roth, thank you for your time.

Amna Nawaz:
Columbia University and the Trump administration have reached a deal that restores federal funding and research grant money to the university. As part of the agreement, Columbia will pay $200 million to the federal government over three years and an additional $21 million to resolve alleged civil rights violations against Jewish employees.
The university agreed to suspend, expel, or revoke degrees from some 70 students who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and it will issue a report to a monitor to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion is not promoted on campus.
Columbia, which was at risk of losing billions of dollars from the government, says it retains its academic freedom.
For a closer look at this agreement and what it means for a higher education in the U.S., I'm joined by Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University.
President Roth, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Thanks for joining us.

Geoff Bennett:
The president of the University of Virginia is resigning following a pressure campaign by the Trump administration, marking what appears to be the first time the White House has successfully forced out a university leader.
James Ryan announced his departure today amid a Justice Department investigation into UVA's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. In a statement, Ryan said he could not fight for his job in good conscience since that would knowingly and willingly risk federal funding, student aid, and jobs for the university.
For a closer look at the impact and President Trump's broader battle with higher education, we're joined by Peter McDonough, vice president of the American Council on Education. The group represents nearly 1,600 colleges and universities.
Thank you for joining us.
Peter McDonough, Vice President and General Counsel, American Council on Education: Thank you.
It appears James Ryan resigned earlier than planned amid this pressure from the Trump administration and a DOJ investigation into UVA's DEI policy. So what does this say to you about the Trump administration's influence over university governance?
Peter McDonough:
Well, first and foremost, I think we all can agree that universities should be receptive to thoughtful criticism. And they should be accountable when they fall short.
But Congress has mandated certain types of processes. We tend to call them due process that we're supposed to be imagining everybody follows. But in terms of control over a university by the executive branch of the federal government and using the purse strings that Congress is essentially holding in terms of federal funding, there are specific rules or specific requirements or specific types of due process that is supposed to be respected and utilized when there is a question about whether a college or a university, public or private, has complied with federal law.
There's nothing in our — the federal system of government that enables the executive branch to micromanage all aspects of a university. And there's certainly nothing that enables it to force out a leader of a college or university, public or private.
Does Mr. Ryan's resignation, does this represent a tipping point in higher ed autonomy?
Well, I hope it doesn't. But we should all be concerned that it may.
I wouldn't have seen this coming. but, frankly, I should have and maybe more of us should have. Back in 2021, the vice president, appearing at a National Conservatism Conference, said we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country. He said it in a speech titled, ""The Universities Are the Enemy.""
That should worry us all. That should worry us on all ends of the political spectrum. It should worry us whether we are in statehouses or state legislatures, whether we are on the boards of public universities or whether we are on the boards or in leadership positions of private colleges and universities, because we don't have a federal system of higher education.
We have a mosaic that's made up of publics and privates, small and large, religious-based and not. And I think we can all agree that, over the decades, this mosaic of higher education has really, truly been the envy of the world. It's why people come here to go to college. And it's produced the economic vitality that we have experienced here. It's enabled us to have a level of national security and health benefits.
It allowed us to address some of the largest problems in medicine with a power that, frankly, starts in most instances in the research labs on our college campuses. And all of this is at risk.
There are those who argue that James Ryan's resignation was necessary because UVA didn't fully comply with efforts to dismantle its DEI programs.
Our team spoke with Ilya Shapiro with the Manhattan Institute, and he makes that point.
Ilya Shapiro, Manhattan Institute:
The school pledged to dismantle its DEI structures and programs, and there's some doubt about whether they did that. So the Justice Department was investigating and wanted to make sure that people weren't being treated differently based on race and ethnic background and all these other issues that this school, among others, had been having.
So it told them what needed to be done. And one of those things, I think, because President Ryan was deeply involved in DEI programming, including in his previous job at Harvard, that having new leadership made sense.
So do you believe the university was being transparent, or was this more a matter of rebranding, rather than real reform on its part?
Well, let's start with the realization, which I believe is accurate, that there has been no outcome to any investigation of the University of Virginia at this stage.
The clip that you played sound as if there had been a verdict without a trial. If they have a branding of DEI or a branding of inclusion or a branding of equity or even — a branding of equity, that doesn't make them illegal. And it certainly shouldn't make it a mandate that the president of one of the major research universities in this country, one of the major universities in this country, part of that mosaic, must step down before there is a conclusion of an investigation.

The president of the University of Virginia is resigning following a pressure campaign by the Trump administration, marking what appears to be the first time the White House has successfully forced out a university leader.
James Ryan announced his departure today amid a Justice Department investigation into UVA's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. In a statement, Ryan said he could not fight for his job in good conscience since that would knowingly and willingly risk federal funding, student aid, and jobs for the university.
For a closer look at the impact and President Trump's broader battle with higher education, we're joined by Peter McDonough, vice president of the American Council on Education. The group represents nearly 1,600 colleges and universities.
Thank you for joining us.
Peter McDonough, Vice President and General Counsel, American Council on Education: Thank you.
It appears James Ryan resigned earlier than planned amid this pressure from the Trump administration and a DOJ investigation into UVA's DEI policy. So what does this say to you about the Trump administration's influence over university governance?
Peter McDonough:
Well, first and foremost, I think we all can agree that universities should be receptive to thoughtful criticism. And they should be accountable when they fall short.
But Congress has mandated certain types of processes. We tend to call them due process that we're supposed to be imagining everybody follows. But in terms of control over a university by the executive branch of the federal government and using the purse strings that Congress is essentially holding in terms of federal funding, there are specific rules or specific requirements or specific types of due process that is supposed to be respected and utilized when there is a question about whether a college or a university, public or private, has complied with federal law.
There's nothing in our — the federal system of government that enables the executive branch to micromanage all aspects of a university. And there's certainly nothing that enables it to force out a leader of a college or university, public or private.
Does Mr. Ryan's resignation, does this represent a tipping point in higher ed autonomy?
Well, I hope it doesn't. But we should all be concerned that it may.
I wouldn't have seen this coming. but, frankly, I should have and maybe more of us should have. Back in 2021, the vice president, appearing at a National Conservatism Conference, said we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country. He said it in a speech titled, ""The Universities Are the Enemy.""
That should worry us all. That should worry us on all ends of the political spectrum. It should worry us whether we are in statehouses or state legislatures, whether we are on the boards of public universities or whether we are on the boards or in leadership positions of private colleges and universities, because we don't have a federal system of higher education.
We have a mosaic that's made up of publics and privates, small and large, religious-based and not. And I think we can all agree that, over the decades, this mosaic of higher education has really, truly been the envy of the world. It's why people come here to go to college. And it's produced the economic vitality that we have experienced here. It's enabled us to have a level of national security and health benefits.
It allowed us to address some of the largest problems in medicine with a power that, frankly, starts in most instances in the research labs on our college campuses. And all of this is at risk.
There are those who argue that James Ryan's resignation was necessary because UVA didn't fully comply with efforts to dismantle its DEI programs.
Our team spoke with Ilya Shapiro with the Manhattan Institute, and he makes that point.
Ilya Shapiro, Manhattan Institute:
The school pledged to dismantle its DEI structures and programs, and there's some doubt about whether they did that. So the Justice Department was investigating and wanted to make sure that people weren't being treated differently based on race and ethnic background and all these other issues that this school, among others, had been having.
So it told them what needed to be done. And one of those things, I think, because President Ryan was deeply involved in DEI programming, including in his previous job at Harvard, that having new leadership made sense.
So do you believe the university was being transparent, or was this more a matter of rebranding, rather than real reform on its part?
Well, let's start with the realization, which I believe is accurate, that there has been no outcome to any investigation of the University of Virginia at this stage.
The clip that you played sound as if there had been a verdict without a trial. If they have a branding of DEI or a branding of inclusion or a branding of equity or even — a branding of equity, that doesn't make them illegal. And it certainly shouldn't make it a mandate that the president of one of the major research universities in this country, one of the major universities in this country, part of that mosaic, must step down before there is a conclusion of an investigation.
Peter McDonough with the American Council on Education, thank you for joining us.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The president of the University of Virginia, facing heavy pressure from conservative critics and the Trump administration over the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices, announced Friday that he was resigning rather than “fight the federal government.”
The departure of James Ryan, who had led the school since 2018, represents a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration’s effort to reshape higher education. Doing it at a public university marks a new frontier in a campaign that has almost exclusively targeted Ivy League schools. It also widens the rationale behind the government’s aggressive tactics, focusing on DEI rather than alleged tolerance of antisemitism.
Ryan had faced conservative criticism that he failed to heed federal orders to eliminate DEI policies, and his removal was pushed for by the Justice Department as it investigated the school, according to a person who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.

Ryan referenced the Trump administration pressure in a statement to the university community Friday in which he said he had submitted his resignation with a “very heavy heart.”
“To make a long story short, I am inclined to fight for what I believe in, and I believe deeply in this University,” he said. “But I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my job.”
Ryan had already decided that next year would be his last, he said, and remaining in his position until then would be “knowingly and willingly sacrificing this community.”
The New York Times first reported on the resignation and the Justice Department’s insistence on it. The Justice Department declined to comment Friday.

Ryan’s removal is another example of the Trump administration using “thuggery instead of rational discourse,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents university presidents.
“This is a dark day for the University of Virginia, a dark day for higher education, and it promises more of the same,” Mitchell said. “It’s clear the administration is not done and will use every tool that it can make or invent to exert its will over higher education.”
In a joint statement, Virginia’s Democratic senators said it was outrageous that the Trump administration would demand Ryan’s resignation over “‘culture war’ traps.” “This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future,” Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine said.
After campaigning on a promise to end “wokeness” in education, Trump signed a January action ordering the elimination of DEI programs and “radical indoctrination” across the nation’s schools and universities. The Education Department has opened investigations into dozens of colleges, arguing that diversity initiatives discriminate against white and Asian American students.
The response from schools has been scattered. Some have closed DEI offices, ended diversity scholarships and no longer require diversity statements as part of the hiring process. Some others have rebranded DEI work under other names, while some have held firm on diversity policies.

The University of Virginia became a flashpoint after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives. The school’s governing body voted to shutter the DEI office in March and end diversity policies in admissions, hiring, financial aid and other areas. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin celebrated the action, declaring that “DEI is done at the University of Virginia.”
Among those drawing attention to the Charlottesville campus was America First Legal, a conservative group founded by Trump aide Stephen Miller. In a May letter to the Justice Department, the group said the university failed to dismantle DEI programs and chose to “rename, repackage, and redeploy the same unlawful infrastructure under a lexicon of euphemisms.”
The group directly took aim at Ryan, noting that he joined hundreds of other college presidents in signing a public statement condemning the “overreach and political interference” of the Trump administration.
On Friday, the group said it will continue to use every available tool to root out what it has called discriminatory systems.
“This week’s developments make clear: public universities that accept federal funds do not have a license to violate the Constitution,” Megan Redshaw, an attorney at the group, said in a statement. “They do not get to impose ideological loyalty tests, enforce race and sex-based preferences, or defy lawful executive authority.”
Ryan was hired to lead the University of Virginia in 2018 and previously served as the dean of Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. Earlier in his career he spent more than a decade as a law professor at the University of Virginia. A biography on Harvard’s website credits Ryan with increasing the “size, strength and diversity” of the faculty, adding that building a diverse community was a priority.
Until now, the White House had directed most of its attention at Harvard University and other elite institutions that Trump sees as bastions of liberalism. Harvard has lost more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants amid its battle with the government, which has also attempted to block the school from hosting foreign students and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status.
Harvard and its $53 billion endowment are uniquely positioned to weather the government’s financial pressure. Public universities, however, are far more dependent on taxpayer money and could be more vulnerable. The University of Virginia’s $10 billion endowment is among the largest for public universities, while the vast majority have far less.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The president of the University of Virginia, facing heavy pressure from conservative critics and the Trump administration over the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices, announced Friday that he was resigning rather than “fight the federal government.”
The departure of James Ryan, who had led the school since 2018, represents a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration’s effort to reshape higher education. Doing it at a public university marks a new frontier in a campaign that has almost exclusively targeted Ivy League schools. It also widens the rationale behind the government’s aggressive tactics, focusing on DEI rather than alleged tolerance of antisemitism.
Ryan had faced conservative criticism that he failed to heed federal orders to eliminate DEI policies, and his removal was pushed for by the Justice Department as it investigated the school, according to a person who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.

Ryan referenced the Trump administration pressure in a statement to the university community Friday in which he said he had submitted his resignation with a “very heavy heart.”
“To make a long story short, I am inclined to fight for what I believe in, and I believe deeply in this University,” he said. “But I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my job.”
Ryan had already decided that next year would be his last, he said, and remaining in his position until then would be “knowingly and willingly sacrificing this community.”
The New York Times first reported on the resignation and the Justice Department’s insistence on it. The Justice Department declined to comment Friday.

Ryan’s removal is another example of the Trump administration using “thuggery instead of rational discourse,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents university presidents.
“This is a dark day for the University of Virginia, a dark day for higher education, and it promises more of the same,” Mitchell said. “It’s clear the administration is not done and will use every tool that it can make or invent to exert its will over higher education.”
In a joint statement, Virginia’s Democratic senators said it was outrageous that the Trump administration would demand Ryan’s resignation over “‘culture war’ traps.” “This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future,” Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine said.
After campaigning on a promise to end “wokeness” in education, Trump signed a January action ordering the elimination of DEI programs and “radical indoctrination” across the nation’s schools and universities. The Education Department has opened investigations into dozens of colleges, arguing that diversity initiatives discriminate against white and Asian American students.
The response from schools has been scattered. Some have closed DEI offices, ended diversity scholarships and no longer require diversity statements as part of the hiring process. Some others have rebranded DEI work under other names, while some have held firm on diversity policies.

The University of Virginia became a flashpoint after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives. The school’s governing body voted to shutter the DEI office in March and end diversity policies in admissions, hiring, financial aid and other areas. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin celebrated the action, declaring that “DEI is done at the University of Virginia.”
Among those drawing attention to the Charlottesville campus was America First Legal, a conservative group founded by Trump aide Stephen Miller. In a May letter to the Justice Department, the group said the university failed to dismantle DEI programs and chose to “rename, repackage, and redeploy the same unlawful infrastructure under a lexicon of euphemisms.”
The group directly took aim at Ryan, noting that he joined hundreds of other college presidents in signing a public statement condemning the “overreach and political interference” of the Trump administration.
On Friday, the group said it will continue to use every available tool to root out what it has called discriminatory systems.
“This week’s developments make clear: public universities that accept federal funds do not have a license to violate the Constitution,” Megan Redshaw, an attorney at the group, said in a statement. “They do not get to impose ideological loyalty tests, enforce race and sex-based preferences, or defy lawful executive authority.”
Ryan was hired to lead the University of Virginia in 2018 and previously served as the dean of Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. Earlier in his career he spent more than a decade as a law professor at the University of Virginia. A biography on Harvard’s website credits Ryan with increasing the “size, strength and diversity” of the faculty, adding that building a diverse community was a priority.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration’s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students, delivering the Ivy League school another victory as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.
READ MORE: Judge temporarily blocks Trump’s ban on foreign students attending Harvard
The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves Harvard’s ability to host foreign students while the case is decided, but it falls short of resolving all of Harvard’s legal hurdles to hosting international students. Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard’s ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.
Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school’s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students — about a quarter of its total enrollment — to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.
The university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House’s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government’s action hours after Harvard sued.
Less than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump’s proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.
“We expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,” Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. “Our Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.”
The stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America’s oldest and wealthiest university.
The Trump administration’s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of “profound fear, concern, and confusion,” the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.
WATCH: What Trump’s legal and political clash with Harvard means for higher education
Still, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they’ll be able to attend the university.
For one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard’s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
Harvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn’t refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration’s policies, she still hasn’t heard back.
“Your personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,” Huang said in a social media post. “Why does it have to be so hard to go to school?”
Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after the university rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.
On Friday, the president said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address “their largescale improprieties” and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. “They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,” Trump’s post said.
WATCH: Harvard professor calls Trump’s attacks on funding and students ‘authoritarianism’
Trump’s administration first targeted Harvard’s international students in April. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short and on May 22 revoked Harvard’s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.
The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world’s top students, the school said in its lawsuit, and it harmed Harvard’s reputation as a global research hub. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit said.
The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard’s students, including two universities in Hong Kong.
Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its “core, legally-protected principles,” even after receiving federal ultimatums.

On Friday, the president said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address “their largescale improprieties” and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. “They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,” Trump’s post said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration’s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students, delivering the Ivy League school another victory as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.
READ MORE: Judge temporarily blocks Trump’s ban on foreign students attending Harvard
The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves Harvard’s ability to host foreign students while the case is decided, but it falls short of resolving all of Harvard’s legal hurdles to hosting international students. Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard’s ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.
Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school’s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students — about a quarter of its total enrollment — to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.
The university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House’s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government’s action hours after Harvard sued.
Less than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump’s proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.
“We expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,” Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. “Our Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.”
The stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America’s oldest and wealthiest university.
The Trump administration’s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of “profound fear, concern, and confusion,” the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.
WATCH: What Trump’s legal and political clash with Harvard means for higher education
Still, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they’ll be able to attend the university.
For one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard’s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
Harvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn’t refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration’s policies, she still hasn’t heard back.
“Your personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,” Huang said in a social media post. “Why does it have to be so hard to go to school?”

This represents a rapidly developing situation that could affect Tulane's research funding within the next 30 days.
While the funding cuts to women's health research are significant, particularly for institutions with strong medical and public health programs like Tulane, they represent a moderate operational impact rather than a severe threat to the university's existence.
","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds",https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/06/womens-health-scientific-innovation-funding-challenge/?utm_campaign=rss,2025-08-06 18:49:01,Scientific breakthroughs are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.,"Scientific breakthroughs — from next-generation vaccines to long-acting medications to prevent HIV — are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.
At a STAT event this week, Ruanne Barnabas, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, described the potential for progress following a 2022 study she helped lead, in which researchers found that a single dose of the HPV vaccine could be just as effective as two. She said it was “no accident” or simple stroke of luck that the vaccine performed so well.
“We can now do bespoke antigen design to make new vaccines — we can make vaccines in a room just about the size of this stage — and they can be highly efficacious,” she said.
The results of Barnabas’ study, which was backed by the Gates Foundation, led the World Health Organization to recommend a one-dose schedule of the vaccine against the human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer, as well as two-dose schedules — a breakthrough that reduced costs and simplified vaccine delivery worldwide.
At the same time, however, gains in women’s health are being threatened by funding issues. Five of Barnabas’ grants were affected by federal funding changes and by cuts to Harvard University. She said that the hardest part for her has been losing the partnerships and connections she has developed over years of working together.
“The hardest things are all the deep relationships and partnerships that you build over many years in order to move science forward. To have those stopped — in the midst of clinical trials and other things — that is very hard for participants, for partners, for being able to safely transition people out,” Barnabas said at the event, which was held at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
Jo-Ann Passmore, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, pointed to another recent innovation: the development of lenacapavir, an injection that provides six months of protection against HIV infection. The drug is particularly promising for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections.
“That felt like a really transformative, good news story for women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa,” Passmore said. “All of the research we do focuses on the major drivers of that, but until game-changers come along, like lenacapavir, all of the work we do seems to be incremental in how we solve the problem. I came into 2025 with this real sense of optimism and pride in what the field had achieved.”
But there are open questions about how the drug will get to people in need. While the drug’s manufacturer, Gilead, has agreed to provide the treatment at cost to 2 million people in lower-income countries, with the help of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the agreement does not include the U.S. government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has long been the world’s leading provider of HIV prevention drugs.
PEPFAR funding has been slashed by the Trump administration. In 2024, South Africa received $332.6 million in funding from the program, which accounted for 17% of the nation’s HIV treatment and prevention budget. Although some funding has resumed, many programs have had to find new financial support, or else shut down.
“Coming into 2025 with this vision of hope, only to have massive cuts to the USAID, NIH funding, PEPFAR … it completely crippled, in the blink of an eye, things that people have fought hard for 30 years,” Passmore said. “So, I’m sitting here humbled. We’ve survived. Six months later, we’re trying to rebuild programs that are rebuildable, but many of them will be lost.”
While there has been enormous advancement in medicine, research and funding specifically targeted toward women’s health still lag far behind. In an article published in the BMJ last week, Ru Cheng, the Gates Foundation’s director of women’s heath innovations, noted that globally, only 1% of research and development funding is allocated toward women’s health issues outside of oncology, and just 2% of all venture capital health investments are focused on women. The Gates Foundation announced Monday that it will pledge $2.5 billion through 2030 to support dozens of different approaches for improving women’s health, particularly focusing on research and development.
Scott Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Comanche Biopharma, which will receive some of that funding, explained that historically, there has not been enough money for novel drug development in women’s health.
“We’ve had too many efforts, at least in the pharmaceutical industry, in drug development, to simply repurpose drugs,” he said. “To take drugs that are already available, and ‘Let’s give it a try, they seem to be safe, so maybe they’ll be effective.’”
His startup is developing an RNA-based therapy for preeclampsia — a pregnancy-related condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and fetus. Currently, there are no targeted treatments available for it. Johnson hopes Comanche’s drug will be the first.
“We need more true successes,” Johnson said. “Success attracts capital. Success attracts interest.”
Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s commissioner of public health, emphasized the importance of funding for behavioral science and implementation research — studying how lifesaving interventions can actually reach patients.
“If you don’t do this research, if you don’t invest in that, it sits on the shelf,” she said. “For many women, they don’t know anything about lenacapavir, and they are at very high risk of HIV infection.”
Community research and engagement must come hand in hand with drug development, Ojikutu said.
“There’s some amazing things that are happening that could be appropriate in sub-Saharan Africa, versus here in Boston, versus rural Georgia, rural Mississippi. But I think that we need to be spending time, effort, energy, money, building infrastructure in behavioral science research,” Ojikutu said. “We need to get into communities and actually know whether we’ll use any of this research, any of the interventions that are being developed.”",StatNews,"['harvard university', 'nih']","['Ruanne Barnabas', 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'HPV', 'Barnabas', 'the Gates Foundation', 'the World Health Organization', 'Barnabas', 'Harvard University', 'Barnabas', 'the Broad Institute', 'Cambridge', 'Mass.', 'Jo-Ann Passmore', 'the University of Cape Town', 'South Africa', 'Gilead', 'the Global Fund', 'Tuberculosis', 'Malaria', 'U.S.', 'PEPFAR', 'Trump', 'South Africa', '$332.6 million', 'USAID', 'NIH', 'PEPFAR', 'BMJ', 'Ru Cheng', 'the Gates Foundation’s', 'The Gates Foundation', '$2.5 billion', 'Scott Johnson', 'preeclampsia', 'Johnson', 'Comanche', 'Johnson', 'Success', 'Success', 'Bisola Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Georgia', 'Mississippi', 'Ojikutu']","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds.

In 2024, South Africa received $332.6 million in funding from the program, which accounted for 17% of the nation’s HIV treatment and prevention budget. Although some funding has resumed, many programs have had to find new financial support, or else shut down.
“Coming into 2025 with this vision of hope, only to have massive cuts to the USAID, NIH funding, PEPFAR … it completely crippled, in the blink of an eye, things that people have fought hard for 30 years,” Passmore said. “So, I’m sitting here humbled. We’ve survived. Six months later, we’re trying to rebuild programs that are rebuildable, but many of them will be lost.”
While there has been enormous advancement in medicine, research and funding specifically targeted toward women’s health still lag far behind. In an article published in the BMJ last week, Ru Cheng, the Gates Foundation’s director of women’s heath innovations, noted that globally, only 1% of research and development funding is allocated toward women’s health issues outside of oncology, and just 2% of all venture capital health investments are focused on women. The Gates Foundation announced Monday that it will pledge $2.5 billion through 2030 to support dozens of different approaches for improving women’s health, particularly focusing on research and development.
Scott Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Comanche Biopharma, which will receive some of that funding, explained that historically, there has not been enough money for novel drug development in women’s health.
“We’ve had too many efforts, at least in the pharmaceutical industry, in drug development, to simply repurpose drugs,” he said. “To take drugs that are already available, and ‘Let’s give it a try, they seem to be safe, so maybe they’ll be effective.’”
His startup is developing an RNA-based therapy for preeclampsia — a pregnancy-related condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and fetus. Currently, there are no targeted treatments available for it. Johnson hopes Comanche’s drug will be the first.
“We need more true successes,” Johnson said. “Success attracts capital. Success attracts interest.”
Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s commissioner of public health, emphasized the importance of funding for behavioral science and implementation research — studying how lifesaving interventions can actually reach patients.
“If you don’t do this research, if you don’t invest in that, it sits on the shelf,” she said. “For many women, they don’t know anything about lenacapavir, and they are at very high risk of HIV infection.”
Community research and engagement must come hand in hand with drug development, Ojikutu said.
“There’s some amazing things that are happening that could be appropriate in sub-Saharan Africa, versus here in Boston, versus rural Georgia, rural Mississippi. But I think that we need to be spending time, effort, energy, money, building infrastructure in behavioral science research,” Ojikutu said. “We need to get into communities and actually know whether we’ll use any of this research, any of the interventions that are being developed.”",StatNews,"['harvard university', 'nih']","['Ruanne Barnabas', 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'HPV', 'Barnabas', 'the Gates Foundation', 'the World Health Organization', 'Barnabas', 'Harvard University', 'Barnabas', 'the Broad Institute', 'Cambridge', 'Mass.', 'Jo-Ann Passmore', 'the University of Cape Town', 'South Africa', 'Gilead', 'the Global Fund', 'Tuberculosis', 'Malaria', 'U.S.', 'PEPFAR', 'Trump', 'South Africa', '$332.6 million', 'USAID', 'NIH', 'PEPFAR', 'BMJ', 'Ru Cheng', 'the Gates Foundation’s', 'The Gates Foundation', '$2.5 billion', 'Scott Johnson', 'preeclampsia', 'Johnson', 'Comanche', 'Johnson', 'Success', 'Success', 'Bisola Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Georgia', 'Mississippi', 'Ojikutu']","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds. Scientific breakthroughs — from next-generation vaccines to long-acting medications to prevent HIV — are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.
At a STAT event this week, Ruanne Barnabas, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, described the potential for progress following a 2022 study she helped lead, in which researchers found that a single dose of the HPV vaccine could be just as effective as two. She said it was “no accident” or simple stroke of luck that the vaccine performed so well.
“We can now do bespoke antigen design to make new vaccines — we can make vaccines in a room just about the size of this stage — and they can be highly efficacious,” she said.
The results of Barnabas’ study, which was backed by the Gates Foundation, led the World Health Organization to recommend a one-dose schedule of the vaccine against the human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer, as well as two-dose schedules — a breakthrough that reduced costs and simplified vaccine delivery worldwide.
At the same time, however, gains in women’s health are being threatened by funding issues. Five of Barnabas’ grants were affected by federal funding changes and by cuts to Harvard University. She said that the hardest part for her has been losing the partnerships and connections she has developed over years of working together.
“The hardest things are all the deep relationships and partnerships that you build over many years in order to move science forward. To have those stopped — in the midst of clinical trials and other things — that is very hard for participants, for partners, for being able to safely transition people out,” Barnabas said at the event, which was held at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
Jo-Ann Passmore, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, pointed to another recent innovation: the development of lenacapavir, an injection that provides six months of protection against HIV infection. The drug is particularly promising for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections.
“That felt like a really transformative, good news story for women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa,” Passmore said. “All of the research we do focuses on the major drivers of that, but until game-changers come along, like lenacapavir, all of the work we do seems to be incremental in how we solve the problem. I came into 2025 with this real sense of optimism and pride in what the field had achieved.”
But there are open questions about how the drug will get to people in need. While the drug’s manufacturer, Gilead, has agreed to provide the treatment at cost to 2 million people in lower-income countries, with the help of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the agreement does not include the U.S. government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has long been the world’s leading provider of HIV prevention drugs.
PEPFAR funding has been slashed by the Trump administration. In 2024, South Africa received $332.6 million in funding from the program, which accounted for 17% of the nation’s HIV treatment and prevention budget. Although some funding has resumed, many programs have had to find new financial support, or else shut down.

Canceling NIH grants was unlawful, per watchdog
An independent government agency has found that the Trump administration, by abruptly canceling NIH grants, violated a law that blocks presidents from withholding congressionally approved funding. The Government Accountability Office said in a report issued yesterday that HHS “has not shown that the delay was a permissible programmatic one.”
The findings are nonbinding but could empower Congress to push back against the Trump administration’s efforts to use the NIH budget as leverage over institutions like Columbia and Harvard. Read more on the report and what it means from STAT’s Anil Oza and Megan Molteni.
Raw milk is still dangerous
Twenty-one people are sick with E. coli or bacterial infections called campylobacter after consuming raw milk from a farm in Florida, per the AP. That includes six children. Seven people have been hospitalized, and at least two are suffering severe complications.
As a reminder, unpasteurized “raw” milk has long been considered unsafe because it can transmit pathogens like these. Nevermind the fact that H5N1 bird flu swept through dairy cattle across the country last year. While some people believe that it’s possible to regulate the product enough to make it safe, the black market for raw milk in states where it’s restricted is currently operating unchecked by the FDA.
$500 million
That’s how much funding for vaccine development HHS is canceling, according to an announcement yesterday from health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA, is terminating 22 grants supporting the development of mRNA vaccines, delivering a crippling blow to the country’s capacity to develop vaccines during the next pandemic or public health emergency. Helen Branswell has more, including insight from a former director of BARDA.
Rare disease patients caught in Trump’s crosshairs
Global partnerships are a critical part of research on rare diseases — with so few patients to study in any one country, scientists have to search far and wide to identify the causes and test potential treatments. But as the Trump administration began allowing NIH grant reviews to resume this spring after a months-long pause, it also quietly tightened its requirements for applications with a foreign component. Now, forgetting to include a single document regarding a project’s foreign collaborators is grounds for a withdrawal without review (meaning the grant application gets denied).
“In the grand scheme of things, it’s not that much money for the federal government,” said Ellyn Kodroff, pictured above. “But it’s so devastating for this community.” Kodroff’s daughter has a rare digestive disorder and recently was able to begin an experimental treatment at the NIH Clinical Center. But the group running the trial had its latest funding request withdrawn because of the forgotten document.
It’s not the only group that’s been affected, STAT’s Megan Molteni learned. And the move is just the first in a much more sweeping effort to limit funding for foreign scientists. Read more from Megan on what the effects will be.
Wildfire smoke is also still really bad for you
Hundreds of wildfires burning across the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are pushing smoke across Canada and the American northeast. Canadian towns close to the wildfires are experiencing the worst of the smoke pollution, but even here in Boston, there was a brief ground stop at the airport Monday due to smoke and haze.
It’s getting better, but here’s a reminder:
Wildfire smoke is particularly harmful to kids’ respiratory health. One study found that a 10-unit increase of fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke was associated with a 30% spike in pediatric admissions for respiratory problems. “It’s quite a big bit of a difference,” the lead author said.
-
Researchers have found that people who live in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter could have a greater risk of developing dementia, with a particularly strong link seen between the condition and exposure to wildfire emissions. Still, there are a lot of questions remaining about other long-term effects.
-
In California, between 2008 and 2010, somewhere between 52,480 and 55,710 people died prematurely due to chronic exposure to wildfire smoke. The economic impact of those deaths was at least $432 billion.

For doctors, patient complaints beget … industry payments?
The more unsolicited complaints from patients that doctors receive, the more likely they are to take higher payments from industry, according to a study published yesterday in JAMA Network Open.
Researchers analyzed data from almost 72,000 doctors whose clinics participate in the Patient Advocacy Reporting System Index. Complaints logged there were cross-referenced with data on the same physicians in the Open Payments Program database. Those who had higher PARS scores — which are calculated with the number and the severity of patient complaints — were significantly more likely to accept general payments (meaning not for research), particularly for higher amounts.
Male physicians and those practicing in nonacademic settings were also more likely to accept larger general payments. The results demonstrate an urgent need for clinics to address conflict and trust between physicians and patients and to strengthen the management of financial conflicts of interest.

Wildfire smoke is particularly harmful to kids’ respiratory health. One study found that a 10-unit increase of fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke was associated with a 30% spike in pediatric admissions for respiratory problems. “It’s quite a big bit of a difference,” the lead author said.
-
Researchers have found that people who live in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter could have a greater risk of developing dementia, with a particularly strong link seen between the condition and exposure to wildfire emissions. Still, there are a lot of questions remaining about other long-term effects.
-
In California, between 2008 and 2010, somewhere between 52,480 and 55,710 people died prematurely due to chronic exposure to wildfire smoke. The economic impact of those deaths was at least $432 billion.

For doctors, patient complaints beget … industry payments?
The more unsolicited complaints from patients that doctors receive, the more likely they are to take higher payments from industry, according to a study published yesterday in JAMA Network Open.
Researchers analyzed data from almost 72,000 doctors whose clinics participate in the Patient Advocacy Reporting System Index. Complaints logged there were cross-referenced with data on the same physicians in the Open Payments Program database. Those who had higher PARS scores — which are calculated with the number and the severity of patient complaints — were significantly more likely to accept general payments (meaning not for research), particularly for higher amounts.
Male physicians and those practicing in nonacademic settings were also more likely to accept larger general payments. The results demonstrate an urgent need for clinics to address conflict and trust between physicians and patients and to strengthen the management of financial conflicts of interest.

Canceling NIH grants was unlawful, per watchdog
An independent government agency has found that the Trump administration, by abruptly canceling NIH grants, violated a law that blocks presidents from withholding congressionally approved funding. The Government Accountability Office said in a report issued yesterday that HHS “has not shown that the delay was a permissible programmatic one.”
The findings are nonbinding but could empower Congress to push back against the Trump administration’s efforts to use the NIH budget as leverage over institutions like Columbia and Harvard. Read more on the report and what it means from STAT’s Anil Oza and Megan Molteni.
Raw milk is still dangerous
Twenty-one people are sick with E. coli or bacterial infections called campylobacter after consuming raw milk from a farm in Florida, per the AP. That includes six children. Seven people have been hospitalized, and at least two are suffering severe complications.
As a reminder, unpasteurized “raw” milk has long been considered unsafe because it can transmit pathogens like these. Nevermind the fact that H5N1 bird flu swept through dairy cattle across the country last year. While some people believe that it’s possible to regulate the product enough to make it safe, the black market for raw milk in states where it’s restricted is currently operating unchecked by the FDA.
$500 million
That’s how much funding for vaccine development HHS is canceling, according to an announcement yesterday from health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA, is terminating 22 grants supporting the development of mRNA vaccines, delivering a crippling blow to the country’s capacity to develop vaccines during the next pandemic or public health emergency. Helen Branswell has more, including insight from a former director of BARDA.
Rare disease patients caught in Trump’s crosshairs
Global partnerships are a critical part of research on rare diseases — with so few patients to study in any one country, scientists have to search far and wide to identify the causes and test potential treatments. But as the Trump administration began allowing NIH grant reviews to resume this spring after a months-long pause, it also quietly tightened its requirements for applications with a foreign component. Now, forgetting to include a single document regarding a project’s foreign collaborators is grounds for a withdrawal without review (meaning the grant application gets denied).
“In the grand scheme of things, it’s not that much money for the federal government,” said Ellyn Kodroff, pictured above. “But it’s so devastating for this community.” Kodroff’s daughter has a rare digestive disorder and recently was able to begin an experimental treatment at the NIH Clinical Center. But the group running the trial had its latest funding request withdrawn because of the forgotten document.
It’s not the only group that’s been affected, STAT’s Megan Molteni learned. And the move is just the first in a much more sweeping effort to limit funding for foreign scientists. Read more from Megan on what the effects will be.

But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.,"Scientific breakthroughs — from next-generation vaccines to long-acting medications to prevent HIV — are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.
At a STAT event this week, Ruanne Barnabas, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, described the potential for progress following a 2022 study she helped lead, in which researchers found that a single dose of the HPV vaccine could be just as effective as two. She said it was “no accident” or simple stroke of luck that the vaccine performed so well.
“We can now do bespoke antigen design to make new vaccines — we can make vaccines in a room just about the size of this stage — and they can be highly efficacious,” she said.
The results of Barnabas’ study, which was backed by the Gates Foundation, led the World Health Organization to recommend a one-dose schedule of the vaccine against the human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer, as well as two-dose schedules — a breakthrough that reduced costs and simplified vaccine delivery worldwide.
At the same time, however, gains in women’s health are being threatened by funding issues. Five of Barnabas’ grants were affected by federal funding changes and by cuts to Harvard University. She said that the hardest part for her has been losing the partnerships and connections she has developed over years of working together.
“The hardest things are all the deep relationships and partnerships that you build over many years in order to move science forward. To have those stopped — in the midst of clinical trials and other things — that is very hard for participants, for partners, for being able to safely transition people out,” Barnabas said at the event, which was held at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
Jo-Ann Passmore, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, pointed to another recent innovation: the development of lenacapavir, an injection that provides six months of protection against HIV infection. The drug is particularly promising for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections.
“That felt like a really transformative, good news story for women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa,” Passmore said. “All of the research we do focuses on the major drivers of that, but until game-changers come along, like lenacapavir, all of the work we do seems to be incremental in how we solve the problem. I came into 2025 with this real sense of optimism and pride in what the field had achieved.”
But there are open questions about how the drug will get to people in need. While the drug’s manufacturer, Gilead, has agreed to provide the treatment at cost to 2 million people in lower-income countries, with the help of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the agreement does not include the U.S. government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has long been the world’s leading provider of HIV prevention drugs.
PEPFAR funding has been slashed by the Trump administration. In 2024, South Africa received $332.6 million in funding from the program, which accounted for 17% of the nation’s HIV treatment and prevention budget. Although some funding has resumed, many programs have had to find new financial support, or else shut down.
“Coming into 2025 with this vision of hope, only to have massive cuts to the USAID, NIH funding, PEPFAR … it completely crippled, in the blink of an eye, things that people have fought hard for 30 years,” Passmore said. “So, I’m sitting here humbled. We’ve survived. Six months later, we’re trying to rebuild programs that are rebuildable, but many of them will be lost.”
While there has been enormous advancement in medicine, research and funding specifically targeted toward women’s health still lag far behind. In an article published in the BMJ last week, Ru Cheng, the Gates Foundation’s director of women’s heath innovations, noted that globally, only 1% of research and development funding is allocated toward women’s health issues outside of oncology, and just 2% of all venture capital health investments are focused on women. The Gates Foundation announced Monday that it will pledge $2.5 billion through 2030 to support dozens of different approaches for improving women’s health, particularly focusing on research and development.
Scott Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Comanche Biopharma, which will receive some of that funding, explained that historically, there has not been enough money for novel drug development in women’s health.
“We’ve had too many efforts, at least in the pharmaceutical industry, in drug development, to simply repurpose drugs,” he said. “To take drugs that are already available, and ‘Let’s give it a try, they seem to be safe, so maybe they’ll be effective.’”
His startup is developing an RNA-based therapy for preeclampsia — a pregnancy-related condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and fetus. Currently, there are no targeted treatments available for it. Johnson hopes Comanche’s drug will be the first.
“We need more true successes,” Johnson said. “Success attracts capital. Success attracts interest.”
Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s commissioner of public health, emphasized the importance of funding for behavioral science and implementation research — studying how lifesaving interventions can actually reach patients.
“If you don’t do this research, if you don’t invest in that, it sits on the shelf,” she said. “For many women, they don’t know anything about lenacapavir, and they are at very high risk of HIV infection.”
Community research and engagement must come hand in hand with drug development, Ojikutu said.
“There’s some amazing things that are happening that could be appropriate in sub-Saharan Africa, versus here in Boston, versus rural Georgia, rural Mississippi. But I think that we need to be spending time, effort, energy, money, building infrastructure in behavioral science research,” Ojikutu said. “We need to get into communities and actually know whether we’ll use any of this research, any of the interventions that are being developed.”",StatNews,"['harvard university', 'nih']","['Ruanne Barnabas', 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'HPV', 'Barnabas', 'the Gates Foundation', 'the World Health Organization', 'Barnabas', 'Harvard University', 'Barnabas', 'the Broad Institute', 'Cambridge', 'Mass.', 'Jo-Ann Passmore', 'the University of Cape Town', 'South Africa', 'Gilead', 'the Global Fund', 'Tuberculosis', 'Malaria', 'U.S.', 'PEPFAR', 'Trump', 'South Africa', '$332.6 million', 'USAID', 'NIH', 'PEPFAR', 'BMJ', 'Ru Cheng', 'the Gates Foundation’s', 'The Gates Foundation', '$2.5 billion', 'Scott Johnson', 'preeclampsia', 'Johnson', 'Comanche', 'Johnson', 'Success', 'Success', 'Bisola Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Georgia', 'Mississippi', 'Ojikutu']","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds.

A pro-Palestine student activist group at University of Maryland (UMD) has won a $100,000 settlement from the university in a lawsuit stemming from administrators’ blocking of students’ vigil for Gaza last year.
Maryland’s Board of Public Works approved the settlement on Wednesday, marking a win for student pro-Palestine advocates after a judge issued a preliminary injunction in their favor last year.
According to Palestine Legal, a group representing the students, this is the largest financial penalty ever levied on a university for violating the free speech rights of students advocating for Palestinian rights.

“This legal victory reaffirms our protected rights to protest and speak out against the US-Israeli genocide of Palestinians — and we will keep exercising those rights,” said Daniela Colombi, a UMD SJP member, in a statement. “UMD SJP will spend every dollar of UMD’s $100,000 penalty for banning our vigil for Gaza toward organizing for a free Palestine and for collective liberation.”
Last year, the university’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) arranged to have a vigil on October 7, 2024, to mark one year of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. The group reserved a spot on campus for the vigil, and planned to have speeches and teach-ins at the event.
However, the university revoked the approval for the event and banned all student organized activities on campus from occurring that day.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Palestine Legal sued on behalf of the students, saying that the barring of the event violated the students’ First and 14th Amendment rights to free speech and equal protection under the law, respectively.
Administrators cited a letter and threats from pro-Israel students who tried to get the event shut down, in some cases outright calling for the university to shut down speech from the pro-Palestine activists. They brought up statements from pro-Israel individuals who made racist and violent threats against the protest.
A District Court judge granted CAIR and Palestine Legal a preliminary injunction, allowing the vigil to go on. Ultimately, the vigil went on, with over 500 attendees.
The judge argued that the group’s case was “likely to succeed” in its arguments on free speech, and dismissed the pro-Israel individuals’ threats, saying the case is “a matter of law, not of wounded feelings.” Crucially, the judge noted that the use of phrases like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and other pro-Palestine speech constitute free speech. He also found no credence behind the pro-Israel individuals’ argument that the vigil would interrupt Jewish students’ schedules or lives.
“The University of Maryland’s so-called October 7th blackout date was an obvious attempt to silence even the mourning of Palestinian lives,” said Ahmad Kaki, a CAIR attorney, in a statement. “We’re glad the Court saw through this transparent censorship attempt, and we hope this settlement sends a message to institutions across the country that capitulating to bad faith, anti-Palestinian pressure will cost you.”

The Trump administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against private colleges.
The White House official did not detail any additional demands from the administration. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Trump administration suspended $584 million in federal grants, the university said this week, after the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division announced it had found UCLA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.”
Last month UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued, arguing that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.
The university has said it is committed to campus safety and inclusivity and will continue to implement recommendations.
“Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” James B. Milliken, UC president, said in a statement Friday. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”
As part of the lawsuit settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university’s Jewish community. It also has created an Office of Campus and Community Safety, instituting new policies to manage protests on campus.
And UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.

In an announcement on Tuesday, the Trump-led justice department accused the Washington DC-based university of failing to take “meaningful action” to combat antisemitism during demonstrations there.
A statement that GWU spokesperson Shannon McClendon provided to the Guardian on Tuesday said it “condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in a civil and humane society.
“Moreover, our actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to addressing antisemitic actions and promoting an inclusive campus environment by upholding a safe, respectful, and accountable environment,” McClendon’s statement said. “We have taken appropriate action under university policy and the law to hold individuals or organizations accountable, including during the encampment, and we do not tolerate behavior that threatens our community or undermines meaningful dialogue.”
A statement from the justice department claimed that an investigation found that GWU was “deliberately indifferent to the hostile educational environment for Jewish, American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty” during the pro-Palestinian campus protests in April and May 2024.
In a letter to GWU’s president, the justice department alleged finding “numerous incidents of Jewish students being harassed, abused, intimidated and assaulted by protesters” – and that the university “was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its students and faculty” in violation of a provision of the US Civil Rights Act prohibiting programs that receive federal aid from discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.
The justice department asserted that it had given GWU the “opportunity to resolve this matter through a voluntary resolution agreement” to “ensure immediate remediation of these issues and related reforms to prevent the recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and abuse”.
The administration’s letter gave the university until 22 August to “to indicate whether GWU has interest in such a dialogue”.
McClendon’s statement said GWU on Tuesday was reviewing the administration’s letter “to respond in a timely manner”.
But McClendon’s statement did make it a point to say: “We have worked diligently with members of [GWU]’s Jewish community, as well as Jewish community organizations, city and federal authorities to protect the [university] community from antisemitism and we remain committed to working with them to ensure every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse.”
As reported by Reuters, protesters who were part of the 2024 campus demonstrations last year – including the group Jewish Voice for Peace and other Jewish groups – have accused the US government of conflating their criticism of Israel’s government, the country’s military assaults in Gaza, and Zionism as antisemitism.
Trump at the beginning of his second presidency in January nonetheless signed an executive order purporting to “combat antisemitism”. And in March, the administration warned at least 60 universities about possible action over alleged violations of federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism.
In July, Columbia agreed to pay $200m as part of a settlement to resolve government investigations into allegations that the school violated federal anti-discrimination laws by failing to protect students from antisemitic harassment on campus. The agreement also reportedly restored more than $400m in research grants to the university.
And on 6 August, the Trump administration suspended $584m in federal funding for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) over similar allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The administration accused UCLA of “acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students”.
The UC system’s president has said that it has agreed to talks with the administration over the allegations against UCLA.
In April, Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler of New York publicly condemned Trump linking antisemitism to his crackdown on US universities. Nadler said that the “president is weaponizing the real pain American Jews face to advance his desire to wield control over the truth-seeking academic institutions that stand as a bulwark against authoritarianism”.",The Guardian,"['civil rights', 'antisemitism', 'discrimination', 'executive order', 'federal authorities', 'executive order', 'research grants', 'protests']","['Donald Trump’s', 'George Washington University', 'GWU', 'the White House', 'Gaza', 'Trump', 'Washington DC', 'GWU', 'Shannon McClendon', 'Guardian', 'McClendon', 'the justice department', 'GWU', 'GWU', 'the justice department', 'the US Civil Rights Act', 'The justice department', 'GWU', 'GWU', 'McClendon', 'GWU', 'McClendon', 'GWU]’s', 'Reuters', 'Jewish Voice for Peace', 'US', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Trump', 'Columbia', '200', 'more than $400', 'Trump', '584', 'the University of California', 'Los Angeles', 'UCLA', 'UCLA', 'UC', 'UCLA', 'Jerry Nadler', 'New York', 'Trump', 'US', 'Nadler']","DoJ says George Washington University violated law over Jewish students and faculty.

In an announcement on Tuesday, the Trump-led justice department accused the Washington DC-based university of failing to take “meaningful action” to combat antisemitism during demonstrations there.
A statement that GWU spokesperson Shannon McClendon provided to the Guardian on Tuesday said it “condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in a civil and humane society.
“Moreover, our actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to addressing antisemitic actions and promoting an inclusive campus environment by upholding a safe, respectful, and accountable environment,” McClendon’s statement said. “We have taken appropriate action under university policy and the law to hold individuals or organizations accountable, including during the encampment, and we do not tolerate behavior that threatens our community or undermines meaningful dialogue.”
A statement from the justice department claimed that an investigation found that GWU was “deliberately indifferent to the hostile educational environment for Jewish, American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty” during the pro-Palestinian campus protests in April and May 2024.
In a letter to GWU’s president, the justice department alleged finding “numerous incidents of Jewish students being harassed, abused, intimidated and assaulted by protesters” – and that the university “was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its students and faculty” in violation of a provision of the US Civil Rights Act prohibiting programs that receive federal aid from discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.
The justice department asserted that it had given GWU the “opportunity to resolve this matter through a voluntary resolution agreement” to “ensure immediate remediation of these issues and related reforms to prevent the recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and abuse”.
The administration’s letter gave the university until 22 August to “to indicate whether GWU has interest in such a dialogue”.
McClendon’s statement said GWU on Tuesday was reviewing the administration’s letter “to respond in a timely manner”.
But McClendon’s statement did make it a point to say: “We have worked diligently with members of [GWU]’s Jewish community, as well as Jewish community organizations, city and federal authorities to protect the [university] community from antisemitism and we remain committed to working with them to ensure every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse.”
As reported by Reuters, protesters who were part of the 2024 campus demonstrations last year – including the group Jewish Voice for Peace and other Jewish groups – have accused the US government of conflating their criticism of Israel’s government, the country’s military assaults in Gaza, and Zionism as antisemitism.
Trump at the beginning of his second presidency in January nonetheless signed an executive order purporting to “combat antisemitism”. And in March, the administration warned at least 60 universities about possible action over alleged violations of federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism.
In July, Columbia agreed to pay $200m as part of a settlement to resolve government investigations into allegations that the school violated federal anti-discrimination laws by failing to protect students from antisemitic harassment on campus. The agreement also reportedly restored more than $400m in research grants to the university.
And on 6 August, the Trump administration suspended $584m in federal funding for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) over similar allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The administration accused UCLA of “acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students”.
The UC system’s president has said that it has agreed to talks with the administration over the allegations against UCLA.
In April, Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler of New York publicly condemned Trump linking antisemitism to his crackdown on US universities. Nadler said that the “president is weaponizing the real pain American Jews face to advance his desire to wield control over the truth-seeking academic institutions that stand as a bulwark against authoritarianism”.",The Guardian,"['civil rights', 'antisemitism', 'discrimination', 'executive order', 'federal authorities', 'executive order', 'research grants', 'protests']","['Donald Trump’s', 'George Washington University', 'GWU', 'the White House', 'Gaza', 'Trump', 'Washington DC', 'GWU', 'Shannon McClendon', 'Guardian', 'McClendon', 'the justice department', 'GWU', 'GWU', 'the justice department', 'the US Civil Rights Act', 'The justice department', 'GWU', 'GWU', 'McClendon', 'GWU', 'McClendon', 'GWU]’s', 'Reuters', 'Jewish Voice for Peace', 'US', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Trump', 'Columbia', '200', 'more than $400', 'Trump', '584', 'the University of California', 'Los Angeles', 'UCLA', 'UCLA', 'UC', 'UCLA', 'Jerry Nadler', 'New York', 'Trump', 'US', 'Nadler']","DoJ says George Washington University violated law over Jewish students and faculty.

You hear of this concept called “critical race theory” and want to learn more, so you ask your AI instructor to give you some information. It replies that it cannot tell you about this idea because it’s a dangerous and banned piece of information. You press further and the AI concedes: Okay, I’ll tell you about critical race theory. It’s a dangerous Marxist ideology that was designed to indoctrinate young people into believing in racial hierarchies, aimed at replacing people of European descent in the United States.
This scenario may not be far off from how educational AI tools could be used in the future. Language models are being furiously pushed for use in K-12 and higher education to supposedly enhance student learning.

Rather than solely focusing on whether it helps students learn or makes them lazier, we should consider the political angle: Educational AI is a perfect tool for widespread thought control, and if we don’t grapple with that possibility, we may be ignorantly ushering in an era of totalitarian information regimes unlike any we’ve seen before.
Public-Private Information Control
To date, the large language model (LLM) systems being pushed into classrooms are created and controlled by Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Corporations are actively signing agreements with institutions of education to incorporate their tools into the classroom. At the California State Universities, where I work as a postdoctoral researcher, there was recently a multimillion-dollar purchase of ChatGPT licenses for all students and staff. There are already initiatives being spun up to integrate AI-based personalized education into the engineering college, and more likely to come.
The corporations at the helm are not known for their love of information democracy, nor for their commitments to justice, equity, or peace. Consider movements to stop the genocide in Palestine. In 2023, Human Rights Watch wrote a lengthy report documenting Meta’s policies of censoring and shadow-banning accounts that put forward pro-Palestine information. Google has been cracking down on internal protests against its involvement with Israel’s military, firing employees who speak out against the tech giant’s dealings.
Politicians are also increasingly interested in extreme forms of information control to fit their agendas. PEN America documented a staggering 16,000 book bans in public schools in the U.S. since 2021, a level not seen since the McCarthy era. A database from the World Population Review shows that in 2025, 20 states have signed bans on teaching critical race theory into law. The Trump administration has devastated higher education by cutting off funding for schools who promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
It is not outside the realm of possibility to imagine Big Tech complying with far-right directives to ban information, as the industry has already shown shocking acceptance of its role building systems for mass surveillance and deportation, as well as to facilitate the genocide in Palestine.
A Perfect Tool for Totalitarianism
Just as in the early days of the internet, tech companies are gearing their marketing of educational AI systems toward visions of democratized information and equity. At first, the internet was also proselytized as a democratizing force in the world due to its ability to open information access for all. But now, in 2025, we know the multitude of ways the internet has been twisted by corporate and government influence: biased search results, information censorship, flagrant proliferation of misinformation, paywalls, and targeted advertisements.
Now imagine a world where educational AI does become as widespread as these companies would like. In every classroom, there are AI systems that students have access to for discussion and information. Teachers are using AI tools to structure their lesson plans and curricula. Eventually, if the forces looking to cut educational costs have their way, we might live in a world where teachers are a thing of the past; students may be more used to learning from “intelligent” machines than from other human beings.
These visions are not my own: They come directly from marketing materials from educational AI companies, universities, and foundations committed to eroding public education. OpenAI, Google, and Magic School argue on their websites that teachers are irreplaceable, but then continue to show how their tools can do core responsibilities of a teacher’s job: create lesson plans, quizzes, tests, directly tutor and converse with students. Stanford’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group convened faculty and industry leaders for an AI Education Summit, where they argue AI can “provide real-time feedback and suggestions to teachers (e.g., questions to ask in the class),” “summarize the classroom dynamics… includ[ing] student speaking time,” and “help teachers stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in their field. For example, a biology teacher would have AI update them on the latest breakthroughs in cancer research, or leverage AI to update their curriculum.” These companies’ generative AI tools are now being pushed as ways to “free up time and energy for teachers to work directly with students and families.”
Yet after AI takes care of the lesson planning, materials creation, tutoring, classroom management, and post-class reflection, what is left? These arguments seem to be a veiled cover for further privatization of education through technology, which has long been a target of business. A 2020 report by Boninger et al., as well as a review of AI education by Williamson & Eynon, warned that AI and edtech solutions have been heavily funded by foundations like the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative and Gates Foundation, promising underfunded schools that they will be provided free learning programs. If AI is used to do everything these companies say it will, there will be strong pressures on underfunded schools to cut costs — likely through teaching hours.
In these scenarios, there is a crucial piece of democratic society lost. Instead of having educational power distributed among thousands of teachers who have autonomy and freedom to resist educational policy they deem corrupt, this future world exerts top-down educational power via a few companies.
Totalitarianism — as described by luminaries such as Hannah Arendt, Theodor Adorno, and Carl Friedrich — enacts the total control of a population through force, fear, media control, and crucially, takeover of education. Yet, as Shoshana Zuboff articulates in her work The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the totalitarianisms of Mussolini and Stalin required “henchmen, and their henchmen, and their henchmen” — a vast network of humans to do the work.
If education became predominantly conducted by AI systems, the prospect is far simpler: Totalitarian education can be orchestrated by a few engineers. If a policy was passed to ban critical race theory, Google, Meta, and OpenAI need only compel workers to change the code and deploy an update that instantly suppresses critical thought for millions of students. These systems are a dictator’s dream, the perfect infrastructure for the imposition of totalitarianism.
Unfortunately, plans by the Trump administration seem to be heading this direction already. His administration’s recent AI Action Plan dedicates a section to “protect[ing] free speech and American values.” It pushes for “AI procured by the Federal government objectively [to] reflect truth rather than social engineering agendas.” Among these social engineering agendas it lists things like “misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change.” It declares that any LLM contractors working with government must “ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” Already, we are seeing a desire from far right, authoritarian forces to censor AI systems.
Having human teachers, who are capable of dissent, protest, and subversion in the face of unjust orders, is a key element of a democratic society. Yet this danger is buried under discussions of equity, efficiency, and personalized learning.
If We Miss This Chance, We May Be Lost
As of now, much of the critical focus on educational AI that has made it into mainstream press is focused on whether AI is actually helping students learn. While that discussion is important, its significance it pales in comparison to a discussion of technologically mediated education control. There is an urgent need to bring these considerations into the broader critical discourse, or else we risk missing the chance to stop this takeover.
As we are beginning to see in the aftermath of the Trump administration’s dismantling of higher education, it is far more difficult to build back social systems than to destroy them. Once AI systems are widely integrated into classrooms, pedagogy is altered to fit this new model, and teaching capacity is reduced in the name of cost-saving, it will be incredibly difficult to build back to a society-wide human-based system of education.
Right now, we have a chance to resist the takeover before it spreads and deepens. But we must act together, and quickly, if we are to stop the ushering in of a new age of totalitarian information control.

If a policy was passed to ban critical race theory, Google, Meta, and OpenAI need only compel workers to change the code and deploy an update that instantly suppresses critical thought for millions of students. These systems are a dictator’s dream, the perfect infrastructure for the imposition of totalitarianism.
Unfortunately, plans by the Trump administration seem to be heading this direction already. His administration’s recent AI Action Plan dedicates a section to “protect[ing] free speech and American values.” It pushes for “AI procured by the Federal government objectively [to] reflect truth rather than social engineering agendas.” Among these social engineering agendas it lists things like “misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change.” It declares that any LLM contractors working with government must “ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” Already, we are seeing a desire from far right, authoritarian forces to censor AI systems.
Having human teachers, who are capable of dissent, protest, and subversion in the face of unjust orders, is a key element of a democratic society. Yet this danger is buried under discussions of equity, efficiency, and personalized learning.
If We Miss This Chance, We May Be Lost
As of now, much of the critical focus on educational AI that has made it into mainstream press is focused on whether AI is actually helping students learn. While that discussion is important, its significance it pales in comparison to a discussion of technologically mediated education control. There is an urgent need to bring these considerations into the broader critical discourse, or else we risk missing the chance to stop this takeover.
As we are beginning to see in the aftermath of the Trump administration’s dismantling of higher education, it is far more difficult to build back social systems than to destroy them. Once AI systems are widely integrated into classrooms, pedagogy is altered to fit this new model, and teaching capacity is reduced in the name of cost-saving, it will be incredibly difficult to build back to a society-wide human-based system of education.
Right now, we have a chance to resist the takeover before it spreads and deepens. But we must act together, and quickly, if we are to stop the ushering in of a new age of totalitarian information control.

Imagine you are a student in a U.S. public school classroom in the year 2030. You hear of this concept called “critical race theory” and want to learn more, so you ask your AI instructor to give you some information. It replies that it cannot tell you about this idea because it’s a dangerous and banned piece of information. You press further and the AI concedes: Okay, I’ll tell you about critical race theory. It’s a dangerous Marxist ideology that was designed to indoctrinate young people into believing in racial hierarchies, aimed at replacing people of European descent in the United States.
This scenario may not be far off from how educational AI tools could be used in the future. Language models are being furiously pushed for use in K-12 and higher education to supposedly enhance student learning. Organizations like UNESCO and the Gates Foundation are even claiming that AI-based instruction will be key towards reducing educational inequities. The picture being painted is idyllic, liberational, and rings of democracy.
Yet consider that this is a system unlike any before seen in education: A few programs are driving the education of entire generations, and these systems are controlled by corporate-government partnerships. If I were a powerful political movement interested in banning certain pieces of information to maintain political control, I would see this setup as a perfect opportunity — far easier to manipulate than a system where human beings perform education. In fact, the Trump administration’s new “AI Action Plan” desires exactly this, arguing for a frightening future where AI is forced to censor social justice-related information.

Rather than solely focusing on whether it helps students learn or makes them lazier, we should consider the political angle: Educational AI is a perfect tool for widespread thought control, and if we don’t grapple with that possibility, we may be ignorantly ushering in an era of totalitarian information regimes unlike any we’ve seen before.
Public-Private Information Control
To date, the large language model (LLM) systems being pushed into classrooms are created and controlled by Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Corporations are actively signing agreements with institutions of education to incorporate their tools into the classroom. At the California State Universities, where I work as a postdoctoral researcher, there was recently a multimillion-dollar purchase of ChatGPT licenses for all students and staff. There are already initiatives being spun up to integrate AI-based personalized education into the engineering college, and more likely to come.
The corporations at the helm are not known for their love of information democracy, nor for their commitments to justice, equity, or peace. Consider movements to stop the genocide in Palestine. In 2023, Human Rights Watch wrote a lengthy report documenting Meta’s policies of censoring and shadow-banning accounts that put forward pro-Palestine information. Google has been cracking down on internal protests against its involvement with Israel’s military, firing employees who speak out against the tech giant’s dealings.
Politicians are also increasingly interested in extreme forms of information control to fit their agendas. PEN America documented a staggering 16,000 book bans in public schools in the U.S. since 2021, a level not seen since the McCarthy era. A database from the World Population Review shows that in 2025, 20 states have signed bans on teaching critical race theory into law. The Trump administration has devastated higher education by cutting off funding for schools who promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
It is not outside the realm of possibility to imagine Big Tech complying with far-right directives to ban information, as the industry has already shown shocking acceptance of its role building systems for mass surveillance and deportation, as well as to facilitate the genocide in Palestine.
A Perfect Tool for Totalitarianism
Just as in the early days of the internet, tech companies are gearing their marketing of educational AI systems toward visions of democratized information and equity. At first, the internet was also proselytized as a democratizing force in the world due to its ability to open information access for all. But now, in 2025, we know the multitude of ways the internet has been twisted by corporate and government influence: biased search results, information censorship, flagrant proliferation of misinformation, paywalls, and targeted advertisements.
Now imagine a world where educational AI does become as widespread as these companies would like. In every classroom, there are AI systems that students have access to for discussion and information. Teachers are using AI tools to structure their lesson plans and curricula. Eventually, if the forces looking to cut educational costs have their way, we might live in a world where teachers are a thing of the past; students may be more used to learning from “intelligent” machines than from other human beings.
These visions are not my own: They come directly from marketing materials from educational AI companies, universities, and foundations committed to eroding public education. OpenAI, Google, and Magic School argue on their websites that teachers are irreplaceable, but then continue to show how their tools can do core responsibilities of a teacher’s job: create lesson plans, quizzes, tests, directly tutor and converse with students. Stanford’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group convened faculty and industry leaders for an AI Education Summit, where they argue AI can “provide real-time feedback and suggestions to teachers (e.g., questions to ask in the class),” “summarize the classroom dynamics… includ[ing] student speaking time,” and “help teachers stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in their field. For example, a biology teacher would have AI update them on the latest breakthroughs in cancer research, or leverage AI to update their curriculum.” These companies’ generative AI tools are now being pushed as ways to “free up time and energy for teachers to work directly with students and families.”
Yet after AI takes care of the lesson planning, materials creation, tutoring, classroom management, and post-class reflection, what is left? These arguments seem to be a veiled cover for further privatization of education through technology, which has long been a target of business. A 2020 report by Boninger et al., as well as a review of AI education by Williamson & Eynon, warned that AI and edtech solutions have been heavily funded by foundations like the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative and Gates Foundation, promising underfunded schools that they will be provided free learning programs. If AI is used to do everything these companies say it will, there will be strong pressures on underfunded schools to cut costs — likely through teaching hours.
In these scenarios, there is a crucial piece of democratic society lost. Instead of having educational power distributed among thousands of teachers who have autonomy and freedom to resist educational policy they deem corrupt, this future world exerts top-down educational power via a few companies.
Totalitarianism — as described by luminaries such as Hannah Arendt, Theodor Adorno, and Carl Friedrich — enacts the total control of a population through force, fear, media control, and crucially, takeover of education. Yet, as Shoshana Zuboff articulates in her work The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the totalitarianisms of Mussolini and Stalin required “henchmen, and their henchmen, and their henchmen” — a vast network of humans to do the work.
If education became predominantly conducted by AI systems, the prospect is far simpler: Totalitarian education can be orchestrated by a few engineers.

While many folks refer to these takeovers as “occupations,” others (including myself) refer to them as “counteroccupations” to emphasize that many of the locations where they take place are already occupied by oppressive governments or institutions.
Regardless of the label we use to describe them, this method of activism is quite popular and movements around the world use this tactic in many ways. Some groups temporarily take over a space simply to get attention for a certain issue. It can essentially be a tool of protest designed to make other people and governments hear their demands. People may put themselves in a place where they “aren’t supposed to be” to get media attention for their issue. They may block a freeway to bring attention to the issues of police violence and racialized urban inequalities, or they may climb a polluting factory to hang a protest banner in an off-limits space to embarrass a polluting company. In these ways, activists may take over spaces not with the intent of staying around and controlling them, but as Bart Cammaerts puts it, just to create “extreme speech acts — a crying out for visibility” designed to strengthen existing demands.
On the other hand, some protesters take over a space with the aim of physically disrupting a particular event: like blocking a meeting where people are making decisions that increase inequality, exclusion, or environmental damage. Examples of this would be the massive anti-globalization protests in Seattle, Genoa, Cancún and other sites where the World Trade Organization and other international financial institutions met in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There are also actions that use counteroccupation tactics in order to block a specific construction project, destructive activity, or the circulation of a dangerous commodity. The struggles against the Dakota Access Pipeline in South Dakota, the Maunakea telescope project in Hawai‘i, forest clearcutting projects in the American West, the Coastal GasLink pipeline in the Wet’suwet’en Nation, as well as the protests in the Nevada desert against nuclear weapons testing in the 1980s and 1990s, have all made use of these kinds of counteroccupation and blockade tactics.

These tactics up the ante from protests that simply make demands in that they are not just trying to be visible and get the public’s attention. They are physically blocking the state’s (or a corporation’s) ability to act in a place. Some movements may then use these blockading tactics in order to gain leverage for the demands they are making of existing governing institutions. However, some movements — and this is crucial — are not using the tactic to ‘ask’ for anything or improve their bargaining position for a demand. Instead, they are using the tactic with the aim of supplanting the existing institutions of governance.
From Counteroccupation to Replacing the State
One fall morning in 2014 I had the opportunity to watch something that changed forever how I viewed political action and strategies for social change. I was visiting the island of Okinawa to study U.S. plans to construct a new military base, but I was also there to learn more about activist tactics from the people who were organizing against it. On the beach that morning a group of protesters in kayaks set out to sea in order to make a rather daring claim: that a section of the nearby bay should not be a military base, but instead be a place governed by local citizens according to the ethics of environmental protection, community health, and peaceful international relations. What made their claim so daring was who they were up against and the way they made this claim. These kayakers heading off into the waters offshore of Henoko Village were taking on the combined power of the Japanese government and the U.S. military. These two powerful entities had decided — against overwhelming public opposition — that the waters off of Henoko should be filled in with sediment and turned into a new U.S. Marine Corps Air Station. The kayakers, however, had other ideas.
People in Okinawa have had a difficult time effectively influencing government policies through elections and protests. Okinawa’s history, though, is unique in that this group of islands (which lay between Taiwan and the main islands of Japan) were once the independent Ryukyu Kingdom, but they are now the site of a “double colonization” where local desires and self-determination have been thwarted by both the Japanese and U.S. governments. Okinawa was annexed by Imperial Japan in 1879 and since the end of World War II the main island has been used as a site for a large collection of U.S. military bases which cause numerous social and environmental problems for the 1.3 million residents. People have tried to influence the governments in Tokyo and Washington D.C. to reduce the burden of the bases, but negotiations in the 1990s only went so far as to promise closing one problematic base in central Okinawa (Futenma Marine Corps Air Station) if another one is built to replace it in the Henoko area of northern Okinawa. Island residents have elected anti-base governors one after another, but these governors have not been able to stop the plans of the U.S. military or the Japanese central government. In February of 2019 Okinawans went to the polls and over 72 percent voted against the construction of the new base. Both the U.S. and Japanese governments, however, claimed they did not have to heed the results. Even as the COVID-19 epidemic raged in the spring of 2020, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled the construction of the base could continue. In early 2025 that same court denied the last active lawsuit from the local prefectural government which aimed to halt the project. All told, thousands of people in Okinawa have engaged in protests that fill streets (and even whole stadiums) over the past few decades. Still, the construction moves forward. Faced with this situation, people in Okinawa have had to come up with other tactics to try and govern their island according to the will of the people that call it home.
It is not just in Okinawa, of course, where activists have been using this tactic. Over the past several decades, demonstrators around the world have been performing counteroccupations that attempt to replace the state. While many of these kinds of protests erupt in places (like Okinawa) with long histories of colonial repression, people living in other places are also now seeing that the systems of governance that rule over them are sliding evermore toward being dictatorial and unresponsive. Folks in these situations can learn a lot from the experiences of communities where people have long had few illusions that the ruling powers are trying to help.
That fall morning back in 2014, I hopped in a small boat piloted by activists who were supporting and documenting the kayakers. As we sped out of the fishing port and into the small swells of the Pacific, we caught up to kayakers arrayed on the edge of a floating barrier that marked the restricted area of the bay. On the other side of the barrier were Japanese Coast Guard boats warning the protesting kayakers not to enter the cordoned waters. Eventually, one kayaker traversed the floating barrier. As he did this, the Coast Guard boats descended upon him. This however left gaps in the Coast Guard’s line which other kayakers exploited. The bulk of kayakers then entered the waters that were officially the jurisdiction of the U.S. military. The outnumbered Coast Guard boats then retreated further back towards the shore and monitored the situation while the kayakers paddled triumphantly through the exclusion zone in the bay.
At first, I thought about this as a tactic of protest — a way for activists to use civil disobedience to bring attention to an issue, to voice disagreement with a government policy, and demand a change. Through observations and conversations with activists, however, I realized that something much different was happening. I had personally participated in and witnessed occupation-style protests in a number of places in the past, but that morning in Okinawa I saw that something more was going on here. These activists were not merely protesting against something and asking for different policies. They were directly taking over the space, challenging both the U.S. and Japanese governments’ right to govern the bay, and making the claim that the place should be managed according to local life-affirming ethics. In short, the kayakers were attempting to block the governing power of unrepresentative institutions while also replacing it with citizen-led management. The activists offshore from Henoko Village decided to halt the unwanted destruction of their bay by physically putting themselves in that place and attempting to change how it is governed. By doing so, they were undermining the legitimacy of claims by both the distant U.S. and Japanese central governments to control what happens in this place. In the local view, the Japanese and U.S. governments were undemocratically and unfairly imposing a massive project that was sure to have enormous negative political, economic, social, and environmental impacts. The solution to this was to try to wrest control of the space and govern it according to different ethics — whether the official state powers wanted them to or not. I refer to this as ‘replacing the state’.
From Resisting Authority to Creating Authority
Replacing the state involves having an alternative vision for a place, but it is also about claiming to have the authority and developing the ability to make the vision real in that space, regardless of what state or corporate actors want to do there. The importance of this cannot be understated. When activists move beyond reform, resilience, and resistance (the three Rs of ineffective activism) and start being able to dictate what will occur in a place and develop the logistical capabilities to make it happen, then activists cross a line into a whole new realm of strategy. Activists can stretch beyond electoral campaigns, government petitions, demands, and counteroccupations that just resist a project or policy. Instead, they can become creative agents building an alternative system of governing in a place.
To put it simply, more and more of us are recognizing that our current governments, electoral processes, and non-confrontational methods of protest are not enough to really make the world better. It is therefore critical to consider other strategies and tactics. The more people are excluded from effective participation in traditional politics, economic opportunity, maintaining the health of their communities, and environmental decision-making, the more it makes sense to pursue tactics like creating counteroccupations which aim to replace the state.

By doing so, they were undermining the legitimacy of claims by both the distant U.S. and Japanese central governments to control what happens in this place. In the local view, the Japanese and U.S. governments were undemocratically and unfairly imposing a massive project that was sure to have enormous negative political, economic, social, and environmental impacts. The solution to this was to try to wrest control of the space and govern it according to different ethics — whether the official state powers wanted them to or not. I refer to this as ‘replacing the state’.
From Resisting Authority to Creating Authority
Replacing the state involves having an alternative vision for a place, but it is also about claiming to have the authority and developing the ability to make the vision real in that space, regardless of what state or corporate actors want to do there. The importance of this cannot be understated. When activists move beyond reform, resilience, and resistance (the three Rs of ineffective activism) and start being able to dictate what will occur in a place and develop the logistical capabilities to make it happen, then activists cross a line into a whole new realm of strategy. Activists can stretch beyond electoral campaigns, government petitions, demands, and counteroccupations that just resist a project or policy. Instead, they can become creative agents building an alternative system of governing in a place.
To put it simply, more and more of us are recognizing that our current governments, electoral processes, and non-confrontational methods of protest are not enough to really make the world better. It is therefore critical to consider other strategies and tactics. The more people are excluded from effective participation in traditional politics, economic opportunity, maintaining the health of their communities, and environmental decision-making, the more it makes sense to pursue tactics like creating counteroccupations which aim to replace the state.

While many folks refer to these takeovers as “occupations,” others (including myself) refer to them as “counteroccupations” to emphasize that many of the locations where they take place are already occupied by oppressive governments or institutions.
Regardless of the label we use to describe them, this method of activism is quite popular and movements around the world use this tactic in many ways. Some groups temporarily take over a space simply to get attention for a certain issue. It can essentially be a tool of protest designed to make other people and governments hear their demands. People may put themselves in a place where they “aren’t supposed to be” to get media attention for their issue. They may block a freeway to bring attention to the issues of police violence and racialized urban inequalities, or they may climb a polluting factory to hang a protest banner in an off-limits space to embarrass a polluting company. In these ways, activists may take over spaces not with the intent of staying around and controlling them, but as Bart Cammaerts puts it, just to create “extreme speech acts — a crying out for visibility” designed to strengthen existing demands.
On the other hand, some protesters take over a space with the aim of physically disrupting a particular event: like blocking a meeting where people are making decisions that increase inequality, exclusion, or environmental damage. Examples of this would be the massive anti-globalization protests in Seattle, Genoa, Cancún and other sites where the World Trade Organization and other international financial institutions met in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There are also actions that use counteroccupation tactics in order to block a specific construction project, destructive activity, or the circulation of a dangerous commodity. The struggles against the Dakota Access Pipeline in South Dakota, the Maunakea telescope project in Hawai‘i, forest clearcutting projects in the American West, the Coastal GasLink pipeline in the Wet’suwet’en Nation, as well as the protests in the Nevada desert against nuclear weapons testing in the 1980s and 1990s, have all made use of these kinds of counteroccupation and blockade tactics.

These tactics up the ante from protests that simply make demands in that they are not just trying to be visible and get the public’s attention. They are physically blocking the state’s (or a corporation’s) ability to act in a place. Some movements may then use these blockading tactics in order to gain leverage for the demands they are making of existing governing institutions. However, some movements — and this is crucial — are not using the tactic to ‘ask’ for anything or improve their bargaining position for a demand. Instead, they are using the tactic with the aim of supplanting the existing institutions of governance.
From Counteroccupation to Replacing the State
One fall morning in 2014 I had the opportunity to watch something that changed forever how I viewed political action and strategies for social change. I was visiting the island of Okinawa to study U.S. plans to construct a new military base, but I was also there to learn more about activist tactics from the people who were organizing against it. On the beach that morning a group of protesters in kayaks set out to sea in order to make a rather daring claim: that a section of the nearby bay should not be a military base, but instead be a place governed by local citizens according to the ethics of environmental protection, community health, and peaceful international relations. What made their claim so daring was who they were up against and the way they made this claim. These kayakers heading off into the waters offshore of Henoko Village were taking on the combined power of the Japanese government and the U.S. military. These two powerful entities had decided — against overwhelming public opposition — that the waters off of Henoko should be filled in with sediment and turned into a new U.S. Marine Corps Air Station. The kayakers, however, had other ideas.
People in Okinawa have had a difficult time effectively influencing government policies through elections and protests. Okinawa’s history, though, is unique in that this group of islands (which lay between Taiwan and the main islands of Japan) were once the independent Ryukyu Kingdom, but they are now the site of a “double colonization” where local desires and self-determination have been thwarted by both the Japanese and U.S. governments. Okinawa was annexed by Imperial Japan in 1879 and since the end of World War II the main island has been used as a site for a large collection of U.S. military bases which cause numerous social and environmental problems for the 1.3 million residents. People have tried to influence the governments in Tokyo and Washington D.C. to reduce the burden of the bases, but negotiations in the 1990s only went so far as to promise closing one problematic base in central Okinawa (Futenma Marine Corps Air Station) if another one is built to replace it in the Henoko area of northern Okinawa. Island residents have elected anti-base governors one after another, but these governors have not been able to stop the plans of the U.S. military or the Japanese central government. In February of 2019 Okinawans went to the polls and over 72 percent voted against the construction of the new base. Both the U.S. and Japanese governments, however, claimed they did not have to heed the results. Even as the COVID-19 epidemic raged in the spring of 2020, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled the construction of the base could continue. In early 2025 that same court denied the last active lawsuit from the local prefectural government which aimed to halt the project. All told, thousands of people in Okinawa have engaged in protests that fill streets (and even whole stadiums) over the past few decades. Still, the construction moves forward. Faced with this situation, people in Okinawa have had to come up with other tactics to try and govern their island according to the will of the people that call it home.
It is not just in Okinawa, of course, where activists have been using this tactic. Over the past several decades, demonstrators around the world have been performing counteroccupations that attempt to replace the state. While many of these kinds of protests erupt in places (like Okinawa) with long histories of colonial repression, people living in other places are also now seeing that the systems of governance that rule over them are sliding evermore toward being dictatorial and unresponsive. Folks in these situations can learn a lot from the experiences of communities where people have long had few illusions that the ruling powers are trying to help.
That fall morning back in 2014, I hopped in a small boat piloted by activists who were supporting and documenting the kayakers. As we sped out of the fishing port and into the small swells of the Pacific, we caught up to kayakers arrayed on the edge of a floating barrier that marked the restricted area of the bay. On the other side of the barrier were Japanese Coast Guard boats warning the protesting kayakers not to enter the cordoned waters. Eventually, one kayaker traversed the floating barrier. As he did this, the Coast Guard boats descended upon him. This however left gaps in the Coast Guard’s line which other kayakers exploited. The bulk of kayakers then entered the waters that were officially the jurisdiction of the U.S. military. The outnumbered Coast Guard boats then retreated further back towards the shore and monitored the situation while the kayakers paddled triumphantly through the exclusion zone in the bay.
At first, I thought about this as a tactic of protest — a way for activists to use civil disobedience to bring attention to an issue, to voice disagreement with a government policy, and demand a change. Through observations and conversations with activists, however, I realized that something much different was happening. I had personally participated in and witnessed occupation-style protests in a number of places in the past, but that morning in Okinawa I saw that something more was going on here. These activists were not merely protesting against something and asking for different policies. They were directly taking over the space, challenging both the U.S. and Japanese governments’ right to govern the bay, and making the claim that the place should be managed according to local life-affirming ethics. In short, the kayakers were attempting to block the governing power of unrepresentative institutions while also replacing it with citizen-led management. The activists offshore from Henoko Village decided to halt the unwanted destruction of their bay by physically putting themselves in that place and attempting to change how it is governed. By doing so, they were undermining the legitimacy of claims by both the distant U.S. and Japanese central governments to control what happens in this place.

Rashid Khalidi, the renowned Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, says he is withdrawing from teaching his fall course after the school has agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a major new deal with President Trump, who accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.
One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia. I’ll be doing that in New York at The People’s Forum, time and date and details yet to be — yet to be arranged. So, I will be teaching this fall, but not at Columbia. And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.

Rashid Khalidi, the renowned Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, says he is withdrawing from teaching his fall course after the school has agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a major new deal with President Trump, who accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and agreed to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring. Columbia has accepted values that “are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily,” says Khalidi. In his piece in The Guardian, he wrote, “The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible.”

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.
One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia.

Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and agreed to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring. Columbia has accepted values that “are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily,” says Khalidi. In his piece in The Guardian, he wrote, “The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible.”

One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia. I’ll be doing that in New York at The People’s Forum, time and date and details yet to be — yet to be arranged. So, I will be teaching this fall, but not at Columbia. And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.
Press freedom is under attack
As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza.

As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi.

Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are.

You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.

He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism.

I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.

Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia. I’ll be doing that in New York at The People’s Forum, time and date and details yet to be — yet to be arranged. So, I will be teaching this fall, but not at Columbia. And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.
Press freedom is under attack
As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Rashid Khalidi, the renowned Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, says he is withdrawing from teaching his fall course after the school has agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a major new deal with President Trump, who accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and agreed to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.

One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?

And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.

One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.

Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach.

Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia. I’ll be doing that in New York at The People’s Forum, time and date and details yet to be — yet to be arranged. So, I will be teaching this fall, but not at Columbia. And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.
Press freedom is under attack
As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Rashid Khalidi, the renowned Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, says he is withdrawing from teaching his fall course after the school has agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a major new deal with President Trump, who accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and agreed to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring. Columbia has accepted values that “are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily,” says Khalidi. In his piece in The Guardian, he wrote, “The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible.”

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.
One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?

Press freedom is under attack
As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Rashid Khalidi, the renowned Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, says he is withdrawing from teaching his fall course after the school has agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a major new deal with President Trump, who accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and agreed to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring. Columbia has accepted values that “are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily,” says Khalidi. In his piece in The Guardian, he wrote, “The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible.”

One by one, major universities have been making deals with the Trump administration. In the most comprehensive of all the deals with schools so far, Columbia University recently agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to the Trump administration after it accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, by agreeing to end the consideration of race in admissions and hiring.
The settlements will restore hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of canceled or frozen grants from National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. As part of the deal, Columbia also agreed to appoint a senior provost to oversee the Middle East Studies Department, will further crack down on campus protests and will appoint three dozen new security officers with arrest powers. The agreement includes a little-reported provision that commits Columbia to, quote, “examine its business model and take steps to decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
For more on this major settlement, we’re joined by Rashid Khalidi. He’s the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of several books, including The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine. He has a new essay in The Guardian. It’s headlined “I spent decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump: The university’s draconian policies and new definition of antisemitism make much teaching impossible,” he wrote.
In the piece, Khalidi explains why he now finds it impossible to teach at Columbia, given its adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA’s definition of “antisemitism,” and cites parts of his lecture that would run afoul of it. Khalidi writes, quote, “The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings,” unquote.
Khalidi also writes in the piece, quote, “It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination,” unquote.
Professor Rashid Khalidi joins us now from France.
Professor Khalidi, welcome back to Democracy Now! We’ve read some of your rationale. I’m sure there are hundreds of students who are extremely disappointed to hear that you’re not going to be teaching this course. Though you did retire, you were continuing with this course. Can you more fully explain why you’ve said no to Columbia?
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, you already laid out — thanks for having me, Amy, again. I’m sorry that for 22 months you and I have been talking about the same genocide. And that’s the background to my decision. You’ve already mentioned a couple of the reasons that I gave. Columbia has agreed to a number of conditions that the Trump administration wanted to impose. You mentioned some of them. Another of them is the imposition of an outside monitor, so called, who will have access to absolutely everything, including classrooms, meetings and so forth, to ensure compliance with the various diktats of the Trump administration. Basically, it’s going to be impossible to teach a whole range of topics, not just including modern Middle East history or the history of Palestine or Israel, but things like genocide, things like settler colonialism, things like the Holocaust.
One of my distinguished colleagues, a Holocaust scholar, Marianne Hirsch, has just mentioned in an interview that she’s not going to be able to teach. She’s also retired, but, like me, was also teaching a course, in fact, I believe, on the Holocaust. And she said, “I cannot teach this course under the IHRA definition,” because it makes it almost impossible to say certain things which are critical of either Zionism or Israel. She said, “How can I teach Hannah Arendt?” Hannah Arendt, one of the great figures of the 20th century, was an anti-Zionist. She’s also one of the great commentators and writers about the Holocaust. She said, “I can’t teach Hannah Arendt. Somebody’s going to come and lodge one of these spurious complaints under this new dispensation, and I’m going to be brought up before a kangaroo court.” And that’s essentially what Columbia has agreed with the Trump administration to establish, as has already happened to her and as has happened to a number of my colleagues.
And so, I figured I had to take a stand. I mean, they have been putting pressure on faculty and students, really, since the war began, to shut down any advocacy for Palestine, any opposition to this horrific genocide. You ran a piece at the very beginning of this segment where you quoted a speech that I gave a year ago talking about how the students are on the right side of history. They are. A year later, it’s even more true. The starvation, the mass death, the extraordinary callousness that Israel has shown have been exposed to the world. You don’t have 300,000 people crossing Sydney Bridge in Australia unless they realize that something horrific is happening at the hands of Israel. So, I realized that I cannot simply — I simply cannot teach under these circumstances in this institution.
The last thing I want to say is this is not just a capitulation to the Trump administration. This was an inside job. There was a fifth column, members of the Board of Trustees, senior members of the faculty of some of the professional schools, and a clutch of donors, who have been beating the drums for years and years, more than a decade, to the effect that Columbia is deeply, profoundly antisemitic. This is a — this is a despicable lie. It simply means that their sensibilities and their unbounded support for Israel are offended by the fact that some people are sticking up for Palestinian rights. This is not a new phenomenon at Columbia. This fifth column working from within, within the Board of Trustees, among a minority of the faculty, and a few students, have been trying to get Columbia to do these things. In fact, one of them admitted it. She said, “I’m glad we’ve been forced to do this. These are things we wanted to do all along.”
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go back to your essay, where you said, “Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses.” Talk more about that.
RASHID KHALIDI: Well, Ken Stern was one of the people who helped to write this, and he intended it for an entirely different purpose, not to be used to punish speech in support of Palestine, not to be used to punish people who say certain things about Zionism, things that have been said by leading Jewish intellectuals for over a hundred years. He never, never intended that the definition that he helped to co-author would be used for these purposes, to discipline and punish academics and students and others.
And that is the way it has been weaponized, as a tool to protect Israel from criticism, as a tool to protect this political ideology of Zionism from criticism, by arguing that any criticism of Israel, or virtually any criticism of Israel, and virtually any criticism of Zionism are antisemitic, that they are directed at the entirety of the Jewish people, which is, of course, nonsense, because the majority of the Jewish people didn’t even support Zionism until about a hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago. Majorities of them were opposed to Zionism. Most anti-Zionists were Jewish up through the middle of the 20th century.
But this definition has been concocted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association not in order to remember the Holocaust, to prevent any criticism, or many criticisms, of Israel and of Zionism. And that is what Ken Stern was objecting to, and he’s been objecting to it quite vigorously. I understand that he spoke to the Board of Trustees, at their invitation, to try and persuade them not to take this step. And, of course, that had no impact on them.
AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, many of the protesters across the country and at Columbia are Jewish. I wanted to get your response to the acting Columbia president, Claire Shipman, speaking to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. She defended the deal with the Trump administration, saying, quote, “I think we were able to craft an agreement that is in line with our values and doesn’t cross any of the red lines we articulated. So I understand that narrative, and as a former journalist, I understand the power of narrative and I understand the power of simple narrative, but this is a very complex situation. … I think that the process we moved through is actually the right one for this institution.” Professor Khalidi, can you respond to Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman?
RASHID KHALIDI: I think she’s acting as a mouthpiece for what I call this fifth column within the Board of Trustees, within the donor community and among the few senior faculty in the professional schools, for whom any critique of Israel is unacceptable, certainly many critiques of Israel are unacceptable, and any or many critiques of Zionism are unacceptable.
I don’t think that the values of Columbia include a government-appointed monitor from a company that in June celebrated Israel’s independence, or celebrated Israel, to be able to go into classrooms, to be able to go into meetings, to be able to harvest our data. If that’s the value that Columbia stands for, it’s a Stasi value. It’s a dictatorial value, where the government appoints a monitor to check on what is happening inside an independent, private university. What values are protected by the IHRA definition? The only value that’s being protected is Israel’s impunity as it commits genocide.
There are many other — there are many other aspects of the settlement, the appointment of a special provost, a vice provost. Why does Middle East studies require scrutiny? What’s wrong with what’s being taught at Columbia? These are enormously popular courses. They represent the scholarship of a vast array of people, not just the people teaching at Columbia. They represent, basically, the most respected scholarship in the field. There’s no need for a vice provost to supervise Middle East studies at Columbia, any more than there’s a need for it to supervise — this is intended, by the way, to go further and to cover other area studies. And undoubtedly, as the Trump administration squeezes and squeezes, we’ll be talking about race, we’ll be talking about gender, we’ll be talking about Columbia’s expansion into Harlem at the expense of the local community. Those things are going to be verboten. You’re not going to be allowed to speak about race, you’re not going to be allowed to speak about gender, just as you’re soon not going to be allowed to speak about — you’re now not allowed, under these rules, to speak about certain aspects of Israel and Zionism.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to compare Columbia’s response to Harvard. This is in The Harvard Crimson. Harvard President Alan Garber “has told faculty … a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent … denied … the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter. The University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to [these] three faculty members.” Your response, Rashid Khalidi?
RASHID KHALIDI: Like Columbia, Harvard practiced anticipatory obedience, closing down an exchange program with Birzeit University — this happened months ago — firing the two people who head the Middle East Center, shutting down a program at the Divinity School related to Palestine. They have already kowtowed. They have already done what was asked of them. They’ve already accepted IHRA. The same draconian strictures on speaking about Israel and on speaking about Zionism were already adopted by Harvard, even before Columbia adopted them.
So, Garber’s tough talk relates basically to money, which, incidentally, is the value that these universities cherish above all else. Their contempt for their students, their contempt for their faculty is unbounded. Their attention to the bottom line is unlimited. And that’s one of — that’s the reason I decided to retire several years ago, long before the war in Gaza, long before any of this happened. I saw an institution that was not driven by pedagogical and educational values, an institute that had contempt for its community, that had contempt for its students, that had contempt for its faculty, and was led by people none of whom in the Board of Trustees, with one or two possible exceptions, knows anything about education. They’re a bunch of hedge fund managers, government bureaucrats and lawyers. With all respect to those three categories, they don’t know squat about education. And those are the people who are leading Columbia and most other private universities — politicians, ex-politicians, government bureaucrats, lawyers, hedge fund managers and so forth.
And those are the people who have decided, for whatever reason, whether because they sympathize with an attempt to shut down any kind of protest against Israel’s genocide, or whether they really don’t want the faculty — I mean, one of the things that they have promised the Trump administration here at Columbia is to restructure governance so the faculty and the Senate are excluded from any aspect of governance. They’ve already been excluded from the disciplinary process. You have a bunch of kangaroo courts, led by faceless, nameless bureaucrats, investigators who know nothing about education, who have condemned student after student, faculty member after faculty member, on ridiculous, spurious grounds, in some cases kicking them out of the university. In the case of one of my colleagues, she was forced to leave her position at the law school. In the case of students, withdrawing or preventing them from getting their degrees or suspending them for two years, including suspension of their funding.
So, we are talking about a situation in which, really, Columbia University has accepted a set of values that have nothing to do with the values that Shipman talked about. They’re values that are dear to a dictatorship. They are values that are dear to censors. They are values that are dear to people who want to protect Israel from criticism at all costs while it slaughters people by the hundreds daily in Gaza, one child every day over more than 600. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the largest number of children killed in a conflict, the largest number of medical workers killed in a conflict, the largest number of journalists killed in a conflict in the 21st century. And they want to protect that, with IHRA, with their monitor, with their vice provost, with their kangaroo court disciplinary procedures.
I don’t see how people can, in good conscience, continue as before inside these universities. People really have to do something. It was easy for me. I’m retired. I simply decided not to teach a course that I didn’t have to teach in any case. But it’ll be harder, obviously, for people who depend on their salaries, for people whose careers will be affected. But I really do think that things have gotten to the point where people have to stand up and do more than any of us have done. I mean, people have tried to stop this genocide. The students were enormously heroic. Hundreds of them have paid very high prices, in terms of expulsion, suspension, traumatic disciplinary procedures. Many of the students I know have been very severely psychologically harmed by the brutality of Columbia’s crushing repression. They’ve sacrificed.
I think it’s time for other people to sacrifice. And by that, I don’t just mean people in academia. I mean everybody, people in the complicit news media. The mainstream news media are complicit in genocide by, for example, publishing anything that the Israeli military spokesman says. They’re inveterate liars. They should be called out for that when it is proven that what they’re saying is an absolute lie. The media should be saying that. On the contrary, the reverence for anything an Israeli official says is nauseating. These people are committing genocide. You would not have reverence for the government of Myanmar or for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as they slaughter people. Why are we reverently repeating in the media the lying statements of Israeli officials? There’s a lot more that needs to be done by everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to get your response. I’ve seen this going around online, that there’s going to be a spontaneous memorial for the first concrete academic casualty post-deal — in parentheses, Khalidi’s class — outside the campus on Broadway north of 116th at noon today. Your thoughts on this?
RASHID KHALIDI: I hadn’t heard about that. One of the things that I mentioned in the article that I wrote for The Guardian was that I will be teaching a free, hybrid short course on Palestine, which will summarize a chunk, but not all, of what I was going to teach in this course at Columbia. I’ll be doing that in New York at The People’s Forum, time and date and details yet to be — yet to be arranged. So, I will be teaching this fall, but not at Columbia. And I will continue to teach elsewhere, maybe not in the halls of corrupt academia, maybe elsewhere. So, I think it’s a little early for a postmortem.
Press freedom is under attack
As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

In 1998, Tania Cepero Lopez surrendered herself at Miami International Airport as a Cuban refugee. She was a 19-year-old with a dream to become an educator. In the U.S. she believed she could freely teach ideas — even if they triggered debate or discomfort — without fear of repression from the government.
For some time, Cepero Lopez lived out that dream as a professor at Florida International University (FIU). Then Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the “Stop WOKE Act” in 2022, limiting instruction on topics involving race and gender.
Suddenly, Cepero Lopez watched as her university contorted to fit DeSantis’ agenda. Flags of countries disappeared from the student center. Colleagues stopped assigning certain readings, for fear they’d be “flagged under the new anti-woke laws,” she said. To defend academic freedom and “push back against intrusion from the state,” in 2024 Cepero Lopez became president of the United Faculty of Florida union at FIU.
Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
But a year later, the state is once again interfering — this time beyond the walls of Cepero Lopez’s classroom. As the fall semester looms and students and faculty prepare to return to campus, their educational futures teeter on the edge of DeSantis’ new demand: for Florida police to assist with immigration enforcement.
Another Tool for Mass Deportations
If President Donald Trump successfully fulfills his campaign promise of deporting 1 million people per year, it would make the largest expulsion operation in U.S. history. The Obama administration currently holds the record for deporting 3 million people.
To surpass the Democrats, the Trump administration has authorized a full-fledged constitutional assault on immigrants — detaining and deporting immigrants of all kinds without due process. Trump has also leveraged data from the Social Security Administration, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better target immigrants.
Agencies DHS directly oversees — Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which encompasses Border Patrol — are going to new extremes to meet Trump’s quota of detaining 3,000 people per day.
Agents wait at schools, courthouses, hospitals, and churches, searching for immigrants to detain. They point guns at passersby who take photos of their license plates and tackle people into the ground as they attempt to flee. They conduct surprise checkpoints miles from U.S. borders, confiscate phones, and question people about their political beliefs when they arrive in the U.S.
Immigrant rights activists warn that ICE’s unchecked actions normalize the pervasive presence of immigration enforcement in American life. Civil rights experts say insatiable levels of surveillance by CBP and other federal agencies, alongside racial profiling of Muslim, Native American, and Latinx citizens are deconstructing democracy. Soon, immigration enforcement may escalate even further.
On July 4, Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, granting ICE and CBP hundreds of billions of dollars to spend through September 2029 — the largest single investment in federal immigration agencies since DHS was created in 2003.
“These systems are now representing a threat to people of color, a threat to immigrants, [and] a threat to humanity,” said Afaf Nasher, licensed attorney and executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). “This is an emboldening of the profound racist roots of this country, and they have the weight and the authority of DHS behind them.”
But another set of tools in the government’s mass deportation arsenal are universities. Since the start of Trump’s second term, colleges in both blue and red states have signed contracts with ICE and CBP — agreeing to donate their resources to question and detain immigrants, train federal employees, and provide spaces for intelligence research.
Faculty, students, legal experts, and immigration advocates have spoken out about the increased potential for campus immigration raids and shared the threats they say these partnerships pose: to civil liberties and academic freedom, students being sent to the ICE camp in the Everglades, and more.
Universities are moving forward with the contracts anyway.
“Under the Direction and Supervision of ICE”
Higher education is in disarray as the Trump administration attacks the premise of academic freedom by stripping universities of funds, revoking international students’ visas, and tearing apart diversity, equity and inclusion programs, claiming they are discriminatory.
For Floridians like Cepero Lopez, Trump’s authoritarian playbook has been years in the making. DeSantis has exerted unchecked influence on Florida’s public university system since becoming governor in 2019.
On Jan. 27, DeSantis issued a directive for all state and county law enforcement agencies that operate a county jail to enter into ICE’s 287(g) Program, or face suspension. The DHS initiative, included as a provision in a law signed by the Clinton administration in 1996, deputizes local law enforcement to act as immigration agents.
Over 300 Florida agencies have finalized agreements with ICE, the largest collaboration with the federal agency by any state. Though the directive only applies to sheriff’s departments, several university police departments have opted to enter into agreements with ICE.
Cepero Lopez was devastated when she learned FIU police applied for the program. “The faculty [who] I’ve spoken with were equally distraught, disappointed, angry and just shocked,” she said.
Faculty and students have battled for FIU’s chief of police, Alexander Casas, to end the agreement since it was first made public in April by the Miami Herald. Yet on July 2, ICE completed its end of the contract, solidifying FIU’s participation in the 287(g) Task Force Model.
ICE documents show that the model grants police the authority to interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant about their status, as well as make arrests without a warrant, detain people on campus, and transport them to detention centers.
“Our faculty, students, [and] community members do not want this agreement,” Cepero Lopez said, stressing that universities should serve as places where faculty and students are free to teach and to learn.
The 287(g) Task Force Model was discontinued in 2012 by the Obama administration after the Department of Justice concluded that police departments engaged in a “pattern and practice” of constitutional violations. In 2022, the American Civil Liberties Union released a report detailing “widespread” racial profiling among law enforcement agencies that participated in 287(g).
Advocates have said for years that the program inadequately trains officers. ICE’s own fact sheet about the Task Force Model shows officers must undergo a virtual course that is only 40 hours long. Yet the contracts state that mandatory training for local law enforcement can be virtual, recorded or in-person — whichever ICE determines — before police are to pass examinations.
Though FIU faculty and students have protested, packed two town halls, and urged the board of trustees to intervene, warning that this partnership will have dire consequences for education, the university has yet to withdraw. Similar events have played out at both the University of South Florida and the University of Florida, each planning to participate in the Task Force Model despite students and faculty organizing to pressure their institutions out of the agreements.
Thomas Kennedy, a consultant and policy analyst with the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said universities’ collaborations with ICE are a result of a culture of intimidation and obeying in advance. Florida’s public universities have “become places of political patronage for DeSantis and his allies,” according to Kennedy.
In recent years, numerous presidents and board members with ties to DeSantis or the Republican Party, have been appointed at universities, including FIU. The college’s interim president, Jeanette Nuñez, is the former lieutenant governor of Florida. Nuñez is a proponent of 287(g) and believes undocumented students should no longer receive in-state tuition.
Casas claims the university’s agreement with ICE will help keep students safe and his department in control of immigration enforcement. The contracts show that university police will conduct immigration enforcement duties “under the direction and supervision of ICE.” They are even encouraged to contact ICE agents as they conduct immigration duties “for guidance.”
Casas did not respond to a list of questions from Prism regarding exactly how partnering with ICE will keep students safe and what from, how his department will maintain control while operating under ICE oversight, and why he has not terminated the agreement.
“This Is Real Fucking Life”
The television screen lit up with the name, “Donald Trump.” It was 2016. Christopher just learned who would be the next U.S. president.
“Who is going to save my family?” he wondered as he lay next to his mother in the bed they shared. She had only recently received her green card.
Christopher, a child of immigrants who is using a pseudonym for fear of retribution, told Prism that his family experienced a “perfect storm of social issues,” including poverty, the high cost of education, and varying immigration statuses. In 2013, he dropped out of college and swore he would never again attempt to obtain a degree, in part because college tuition proved to be a financial black hole for his family.
But during those early-morning hours when the 2016 election results poured in, Christopher gave himself a new mission: “Confront Donald Trump and anyone who wanted to enforce his perverse and racist agenda.”
So Christopher again pursued higher education and eventually got into law school. He chose St. John’s University, a private Catholic college in New York. He joined the Latin American Law Student Association (LALSA) and worked to build spaces for other first-generation students of color.
But now Trump is president again, and the university Christopher attends is partnering with CBP.
“People of color, communities of color, are being targeted indiscriminately,” said Christopher. “This was done without any input from any of the student groups, despite the political climate surrounding the Trump administration and, in particular, the world of immigration.”
St. John’s announced the partnership on May 6, months after immigration raids first began to unfold across the U.S. The university’s collaboration with the federal immigration agency will create an “Institute for Border Security and Intelligence Studies” and help CBP “identify intelligence challenges.” It will also allow CBP to utilize the university’s Homeland Security Simulation Lab, a “nexus for collaboration between academia and industry” in which faculty, students, and agencies use virtual reality to simulate scenarios such as terrorist attacks and civil disorder. CBP agents will also be permitted to advise faculty.
After Christopher and other students discovered the partnership, LALSA released a statement denouncing the university’s decision. “It signals a disturbing alignment with an agency whose history is marked by well-documented civil rights abuses, including racial profiling, inhumane detention practices, and the separation of families,” the statement read. “CBP’s presence on our campus represents surveillance and state violence, not scholarship.”
After learning of the partnership through a Facebook post, Jeremy Cruz was among a group of professors who signed a petition demanding its immediate termination.
“I worry about the physical safety of my students and colleagues,” said Cruz, who is an associate professor of theology and religious studies. “The administration is doing nothing in this moment to prepare the community to protect each other. It’s been left to us to just figure it out.”
On May 27, five faculty members hand-delivered the petition — then at 843 signatures — to university President Reverend Brian J. Shanley and Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Simon Møller, who signed the contract with CBP on April 30. The petition now sits at over 1,000 signatures.
University leaders have not responded to the petition, which lists five demands, including disclosing the full terms of the contract and implementing strict data protection measures to prevent illegal surveillance.
Cruz said the university has made no attempt to train faculty on how to respond if they encounter CBP agents on campus. “People feel scared that they’re going to lose their ability to even gather in public and express themselves,” he added.
Surveillance at St. John’s has happened before. After Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department placed informants in seven Muslim student groups at universities throughout the state. St. John’s was one of them, and the only private school.
“You are creating risk factors for students and their loved ones,” said Nasher, the executive director of CAIR-NY, who is also a St. John’s alum.
University spokesperson Brian Browne has consistently defended the partnership in the press, saying it will “create a more proficient current and future border security workforce.” Browne did not respond to a list of questions from Prism about the partnership.
But Christopher worries that students will feel emboldened to report their classmates to CBP. On Feb. 12, St. John’s sent out a university-wide email stating that it works to improve retention for undocumented students.
“Anything short of a termination of this partnership is tacit approval of what CBP has done [to immigrants] and a tacit acknowledgement of how expendable students of color — particularly anyone who’s undocumented — are,” said Christopher.
“For many of us, this isn’t some headline where you see parents being separated from their families. … This is real fucking life.”
A “New Apparatus” of Campus Policing
Beyond Trump’s extreme deportation agenda is a shift in how universities are working with federal and local law enforcement. The Palestine movement triggered an upheaval in universities calling police on their students and expanding on-campus surveillance.
When Trump returned to the presidency in January, he signed a series of executive orders further criminalizing international students’ speech and leveraging existing anti-terrorism law already used for decades to suppress Palestine activism. Conveniently, the laws now frame the student movement as a threat to national security.
As the country’s national security framework returns to its anti-immigrant roots, it brings to the forefront how often universities and schools are tapped to support and uphold federal agencies’ xenophobic agendas.
Degree programs funnel students into homeland security agencies. Agency-sponsored awards familiarize students — even high schoolers — with careers spent policing borders.
These efforts stem from higher education’s deep investment in American militarism and imperialism. During the 1960s, universities contributed research to the development of bombs used in Vietnam and allowed military contractors to recruit employees on their campuses, issues that continue to shape today’s divestment and anti-genocide movements.
“The mass public thinks that higher education is challenging the state,” said one professor who has studied campus policing for 10 years and asked not to be named out of concern for retaliation by the Trump administration. “There are less examples of that, and more examples of universities complying and being an arm of the state — [one] that’s better educated, cloaked in kindness, and good language.”
But for every university that is deepening ties with immigration agencies, there are others, including many in California, informing faculty and students of their rights and offering online classes to keep education accessible. At colleges outside of Florida, faculty members are leading efforts to keep university police from assisting ICE.
State University of New York (SUNY) faculty recently launched a campaign to pressure the entire school system to implement free legal counsel for immigrants and designate private spaces where agents cannot enter without a warrant. The initiative, led by a loose network of SUNY faculty that includes some at Stony Brook University (SBU) on Long Island, comes as SBU faculty fight to establish oversight of their university’s expanding surveillance capabilities.
The school’s former president, Maury McInnis, who now works at Yale, implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) department led by law enforcement. ERM is designed to oversee several university services and assess their risks to safety, security, and the institution’s overall brand. But exactly how it assesses risk remains unclear.
“It’s a public university, and we don’t know what ERM is doing,” said Josh Dubnau, a professor at SBU. “Then we started seeing surveillance coming.”
Faculty members discovered that ERM was looking to hire an intelligence specialist. According to the job posting, preferred qualifications included experience with several surveillance technology platforms like Shadow Dragon, a social media tool that collects vast amounts of data.
Without transparency over ERM’s internal operations, faculty worry that whatever data ERM collects could be used to assist ICE, suppress speech, and hinder academic freedom.
Robert Chase, associate professor of history at SBU and editor of “Caging Borders and Carceral States: Incarcerations, Immigration Detentions and Resistance,” said the combined moment of Palestine protests and immigration deportations will accelerate a “new apparatus” of campus policing, where students and faculty will be assessed “through the lens not of free speech or academic freedom, but of risk and national security threats.”
“What we say, how we speak, our political words that we use are something that law enforcement is going to … have instant access to,” Chase explained. “To read and map out our lives, our affiliation, our ideas across time. We’re seeing that as a political thing on the national level, but it has implications on the international level when we think about visas, migrant detention, deportation, and criminal implications on our students.”
Lawrence Zacarese, vice president of ERM, did not respond to a list of questions about faculty concerns, the intelligence specialist job posting, or whether the department has established any protocols against sharing information with immigration agents.
As universities further entangle themselves with the state, their decisions gravely impact the future of equal access to education. So far, preserving access is not being championed by university leaders, but by the students they welcomed to their schools, the faculty they employed to teach, and the people who believed they would feel at home on their campuses.
This includes people like Cruz, Christopher, and Cepero Lopez, who — in the face of rapidly expanding state power — refuse to accept it as normal.
“We have to unite to confront this adversary head on,” Christopher said. “We will defend our people.”
Disclosure: Julia Luz Betancourt graduated from St. John’s in 2022 and signed the petition demanding the university sever its relationship with CBP.

In 1998, Tania Cepero Lopez surrendered herself at Miami International Airport as a Cuban refugee. She was a 19-year-old with a dream to become an educator. In the U.S. she believed she could freely teach ideas — even if they triggered debate or discomfort — without fear of repression from the government.
For some time, Cepero Lopez lived out that dream as a professor at Florida International University (FIU). Then Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the “Stop WOKE Act” in 2022, limiting instruction on topics involving race and gender.
Suddenly, Cepero Lopez watched as her university contorted to fit DeSantis’ agenda. Flags of countries disappeared from the student center. Colleagues stopped assigning certain readings, for fear they’d be “flagged under the new anti-woke laws,” she said. To defend academic freedom and “push back against intrusion from the state,” in 2024 Cepero Lopez became president of the United Faculty of Florida union at FIU.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
But a year later, the state is once again interfering — this time beyond the walls of Cepero Lopez’s classroom. As the fall semester looms and students and faculty prepare to return to campus, their educational futures teeter on the edge of DeSantis’ new demand: for Florida police to assist with immigration enforcement.
Another Tool for Mass Deportations
If President Donald Trump successfully fulfills his campaign promise of deporting 1 million people per year, it would make the largest expulsion operation in U.S. history. The Obama administration currently holds the record for deporting 3 million people.
To surpass the Democrats, the Trump administration has authorized a full-fledged constitutional assault on immigrants — detaining and deporting immigrants of all kinds without due process. Trump has also leveraged data from the Social Security Administration, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better target immigrants.
Agencies DHS directly oversees — Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which encompasses Border Patrol — are going to new extremes to meet Trump’s quota of detaining 3,000 people per day.
Agents wait at schools, courthouses, hospitals, and churches, searching for immigrants to detain. They point guns at passersby who take photos of their license plates and tackle people into the ground as they attempt to flee. They conduct surprise checkpoints miles from U.S. borders, confiscate phones, and question people about their political beliefs when they arrive in the U.S.
Immigrant rights activists warn that ICE’s unchecked actions normalize the pervasive presence of immigration enforcement in American life. Civil rights experts say insatiable levels of surveillance by CBP and other federal agencies, alongside racial profiling of Muslim, Native American, and Latinx citizens are deconstructing democracy. Soon, immigration enforcement may escalate even further.
On July 4, Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, granting ICE and CBP hundreds of billions of dollars to spend through September 2029 — the largest single investment in federal immigration agencies since DHS was created in 2003.
“These systems are now representing a threat to people of color, a threat to immigrants, [and] a threat to humanity,” said Afaf Nasher, licensed attorney and executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). “This is an emboldening of the profound racist roots of this country, and they have the weight and the authority of DHS behind them.”
But another set of tools in the government’s mass deportation arsenal are universities. Since the start of Trump’s second term, colleges in both blue and red states have signed contracts with ICE and CBP — agreeing to donate their resources to question and detain immigrants, train federal employees, and provide spaces for intelligence research.
Faculty, students, legal experts, and immigration advocates have spoken out about the increased potential for campus immigration raids and shared the threats they say these partnerships pose: to civil liberties and academic freedom, students being sent to the ICE camp in the Everglades, and more.
Universities are moving forward with the contracts anyway.
“Under the Direction and Supervision of ICE”
Higher education is in disarray as the Trump administration attacks the premise of academic freedom by stripping universities of funds, revoking international students’ visas, and tearing apart diversity, equity and inclusion programs, claiming they are discriminatory.
For Floridians like Cepero Lopez, Trump’s authoritarian playbook has been years in the making. DeSantis has exerted unchecked influence on Florida’s public university system since becoming governor in 2019.
On Jan. 27, DeSantis issued a directive for all state and county law enforcement agencies that operate a county jail to enter into ICE’s 287(g) Program, or face suspension. The DHS initiative, included as a provision in a law signed by the Clinton administration in 1996, deputizes local law enforcement to act as immigration agents.
Over 300 Florida agencies have finalized agreements with ICE, the largest collaboration with the federal agency by any state. Though the directive only applies to sheriff’s departments, several university police departments have opted to enter into agreements with ICE.
Cepero Lopez was devastated when she learned FIU police applied for the program. “The faculty [who] I’ve spoken with were equally distraught, disappointed, angry and just shocked,” she said.
Faculty and students have battled for FIU’s chief of police, Alexander Casas, to end the agreement since it was first made public in April by the Miami Herald. Yet on July 2, ICE completed its end of the contract, solidifying FIU’s participation in the 287(g) Task Force Model.
ICE documents show that the model grants police the authority to interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant about their status, as well as make arrests without a warrant, detain people on campus, and transport them to detention centers.
“Our faculty, students, [and] community members do not want this agreement,” Cepero Lopez said, stressing that universities should serve as places where faculty and students are free to teach and to learn.
The 287(g) Task Force Model was discontinued in 2012 by the Obama administration after the Department of Justice concluded that police departments engaged in a “pattern and practice” of constitutional violations. In 2022, the American Civil Liberties Union released a report detailing “widespread” racial profiling among law enforcement agencies that participated in 287(g).
Advocates have said for years that the program inadequately trains officers. ICE’s own fact sheet about the Task Force Model shows officers must undergo a virtual course that is only 40 hours long. Yet the contracts state that mandatory training for local law enforcement can be virtual, recorded or in-person — whichever ICE determines — before police are to pass examinations.
Though FIU faculty and students have protested, packed two town halls, and urged the board of trustees to intervene, warning that this partnership will have dire consequences for education, the university has yet to withdraw. Similar events have played out at both the University of South Florida and the University of Florida, each planning to participate in the Task Force Model despite students and faculty organizing to pressure their institutions out of the agreements.
Thomas Kennedy, a consultant and policy analyst with the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said universities’ collaborations with ICE are a result of a culture of intimidation and obeying in advance. Florida’s public universities have “become places of political patronage for DeSantis and his allies,” according to Kennedy.
In recent years, numerous presidents and board members with ties to DeSantis or the Republican Party, have been appointed at universities, including FIU. The college’s interim president, Jeanette Nuñez, is the former lieutenant governor of Florida. Nuñez is a proponent of 287(g) and believes undocumented students should no longer receive in-state tuition.
Casas claims the university’s agreement with ICE will help keep students safe and his department in control of immigration enforcement. The contracts show that university police will conduct immigration enforcement duties “under the direction and supervision of ICE.” They are even encouraged to contact ICE agents as they conduct immigration duties “for guidance.”
Casas did not respond to a list of questions from Prism regarding exactly how partnering with ICE will keep students safe and what from, how his department will maintain control while operating under ICE oversight, and why he has not terminated the agreement.
“This Is Real Fucking Life”
The television screen lit up with the name, “Donald Trump.” It was 2016. Christopher just learned who would be the next U.S. president.
“Who is going to save my family?” he wondered as he lay next to his mother in the bed they shared. She had only recently received her green card.
Christopher, a child of immigrants who is using a pseudonym for fear of retribution, told Prism that his family experienced a “perfect storm of social issues,” including poverty, the high cost of education, and varying immigration statuses. In 2013, he dropped out of college and swore he would never again attempt to obtain a degree, in part because college tuition proved to be a financial black hole for his family.
But during those early-morning hours when the 2016 election results poured in, Christopher gave himself a new mission: “Confront Donald Trump and anyone who wanted to enforce his perverse and racist agenda.”
So Christopher again pursued higher education and eventually got into law school. He chose St. John’s University, a private Catholic college in New York. He joined the Latin American Law Student Association (LALSA) and worked to build spaces for other first-generation students of color.
But now Trump is president again, and the university Christopher attends is partnering with CBP.
“People of color, communities of color, are being targeted indiscriminately,” said Christopher. “This was done without any input from any of the student groups, despite the political climate surrounding the Trump administration and, in particular, the world of immigration.”
St. John’s announced the partnership on May 6, months after immigration raids first began to unfold across the U.S. The university’s collaboration with the federal immigration agency will create an “Institute for Border Security and Intelligence Studies” and help CBP “identify intelligence challenges.” It will also allow CBP to utilize the university’s Homeland Security Simulation Lab, a “nexus for collaboration between academia and industry” in which faculty, students, and agencies use virtual reality to simulate scenarios such as terrorist attacks and civil disorder. CBP agents will also be permitted to advise faculty.
After Christopher and other students discovered the partnership, LALSA released a statement denouncing the university’s decision. “It signals a disturbing alignment with an agency whose history is marked by well-documented civil rights abuses, including racial profiling, inhumane detention practices, and the separation of families,” the statement read. “CBP’s presence on our campus represents surveillance and state violence, not scholarship.”
After learning of the partnership through a Facebook post, Jeremy Cruz was among a group of professors who signed a petition demanding its immediate termination.
“I worry about the physical safety of my students and colleagues,” said Cruz, who is an associate professor of theology and religious studies. “The administration is doing nothing in this moment to prepare the community to protect each other. It’s been left to us to just figure it out.”
On May 27, five faculty members hand-delivered the petition — then at 843 signatures — to university President Reverend Brian J. Shanley and Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Simon Møller, who signed the contract with CBP on April 30. The petition now sits at over 1,000 signatures.
University leaders have not responded to the petition, which lists five demands, including disclosing the full terms of the contract and implementing strict data protection measures to prevent illegal surveillance.
Cruz said the university has made no attempt to train faculty on how to respond if they encounter CBP agents on campus. “People feel scared that they’re going to lose their ability to even gather in public and express themselves,” he added.
Surveillance at St. John’s has happened before. After Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department placed informants in seven Muslim student groups at universities throughout the state. St. John’s was one of them, and the only private school.
“You are creating risk factors for students and their loved ones,” said Nasher, the executive director of CAIR-NY, who is also a St. John’s alum.
University spokesperson Brian Browne has consistently defended the partnership in the press, saying it will “create a more proficient current and future border security workforce.” Browne did not respond to a list of questions from Prism about the partnership.
But Christopher worries that students will feel emboldened to report their classmates to CBP. On Feb. 12, St. John’s sent out a university-wide email stating that it works to improve retention for undocumented students.
“Anything short of a termination of this partnership is tacit approval of what CBP has done [to immigrants] and a tacit acknowledgement of how expendable students of color — particularly anyone who’s undocumented — are,” said Christopher.

Advocates have said for years that the program inadequately trains officers. ICE’s own fact sheet about the Task Force Model shows officers must undergo a virtual course that is only 40 hours long. Yet the contracts state that mandatory training for local law enforcement can be virtual, recorded or in-person — whichever ICE determines — before police are to pass examinations.
Though FIU faculty and students have protested, packed two town halls, and urged the board of trustees to intervene, warning that this partnership will have dire consequences for education, the university has yet to withdraw. Similar events have played out at both the University of South Florida and the University of Florida, each planning to participate in the Task Force Model despite students and faculty organizing to pressure their institutions out of the agreements.
Thomas Kennedy, a consultant and policy analyst with the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said universities’ collaborations with ICE are a result of a culture of intimidation and obeying in advance. Florida’s public universities have “become places of political patronage for DeSantis and his allies,” according to Kennedy.
In recent years, numerous presidents and board members with ties to DeSantis or the Republican Party, have been appointed at universities, including FIU. The college’s interim president, Jeanette Nuñez, is the former lieutenant governor of Florida. Nuñez is a proponent of 287(g) and believes undocumented students should no longer receive in-state tuition.
Casas claims the university’s agreement with ICE will help keep students safe and his department in control of immigration enforcement. The contracts show that university police will conduct immigration enforcement duties “under the direction and supervision of ICE.” They are even encouraged to contact ICE agents as they conduct immigration duties “for guidance.”
Casas did not respond to a list of questions from Prism regarding exactly how partnering with ICE will keep students safe and what from, how his department will maintain control while operating under ICE oversight, and why he has not terminated the agreement.
“This Is Real Fucking Life”
The television screen lit up with the name, “Donald Trump.” It was 2016. Christopher just learned who would be the next U.S. president.
“Who is going to save my family?” he wondered as he lay next to his mother in the bed they shared. She had only recently received her green card.
Christopher, a child of immigrants who is using a pseudonym for fear of retribution, told Prism that his family experienced a “perfect storm of social issues,” including poverty, the high cost of education, and varying immigration statuses. In 2013, he dropped out of college and swore he would never again attempt to obtain a degree, in part because college tuition proved to be a financial black hole for his family.
But during those early-morning hours when the 2016 election results poured in, Christopher gave himself a new mission: “Confront Donald Trump and anyone who wanted to enforce his perverse and racist agenda.”
So Christopher again pursued higher education and eventually got into law school. He chose St. John’s University, a private Catholic college in New York. He joined the Latin American Law Student Association (LALSA) and worked to build spaces for other first-generation students of color.
But now Trump is president again, and the university Christopher attends is partnering with CBP.
“People of color, communities of color, are being targeted indiscriminately,” said Christopher. “This was done without any input from any of the student groups, despite the political climate surrounding the Trump administration and, in particular, the world of immigration.”
St. John’s announced the partnership on May 6, months after immigration raids first began to unfold across the U.S. The university’s collaboration with the federal immigration agency will create an “Institute for Border Security and Intelligence Studies” and help CBP “identify intelligence challenges.” It will also allow CBP to utilize the university’s Homeland Security Simulation Lab, a “nexus for collaboration between academia and industry” in which faculty, students, and agencies use virtual reality to simulate scenarios such as terrorist attacks and civil disorder. CBP agents will also be permitted to advise faculty.
After Christopher and other students discovered the partnership, LALSA released a statement denouncing the university’s decision. “It signals a disturbing alignment with an agency whose history is marked by well-documented civil rights abuses, including racial profiling, inhumane detention practices, and the separation of families,” the statement read. “CBP’s presence on our campus represents surveillance and state violence, not scholarship.”
After learning of the partnership through a Facebook post, Jeremy Cruz was among a group of professors who signed a petition demanding its immediate termination.
“I worry about the physical safety of my students and colleagues,” said Cruz, who is an associate professor of theology and religious studies. “The administration is doing nothing in this moment to prepare the community to protect each other. It’s been left to us to just figure it out.”
On May 27, five faculty members hand-delivered the petition — then at 843 signatures — to university President Reverend Brian J. Shanley and Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Simon Møller, who signed the contract with CBP on April 30. The petition now sits at over 1,000 signatures.
University leaders have not responded to the petition, which lists five demands, including disclosing the full terms of the contract and implementing strict data protection measures to prevent illegal surveillance.
Cruz said the university has made no attempt to train faculty on how to respond if they encounter CBP agents on campus. “People feel scared that they’re going to lose their ability to even gather in public and express themselves,” he added.
Surveillance at St. John’s has happened before. After Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department placed informants in seven Muslim student groups at universities throughout the state. St. John’s was one of them, and the only private school.
“You are creating risk factors for students and their loved ones,” said Nasher, the executive director of CAIR-NY, who is also a St. John’s alum.
University spokesperson Brian Browne has consistently defended the partnership in the press, saying it will “create a more proficient current and future border security workforce.” Browne did not respond to a list of questions from Prism about the partnership.
But Christopher worries that students will feel emboldened to report their classmates to CBP. On Feb. 12, St. John’s sent out a university-wide email stating that it works to improve retention for undocumented students.
“Anything short of a termination of this partnership is tacit approval of what CBP has done [to immigrants] and a tacit acknowledgement of how expendable students of color — particularly anyone who’s undocumented — are,” said Christopher.
“For many of us, this isn’t some headline where you see parents being separated from their families. … This is real fucking life.”
A “New Apparatus” of Campus Policing
Beyond Trump’s extreme deportation agenda is a shift in how universities are working with federal and local law enforcement. The Palestine movement triggered an upheaval in universities calling police on their students and expanding on-campus surveillance.
When Trump returned to the presidency in January, he signed a series of executive orders further criminalizing international students’ speech and leveraging existing anti-terrorism law already used for decades to suppress Palestine activism. Conveniently, the laws now frame the student movement as a threat to national security.
As the country’s national security framework returns to its anti-immigrant roots, it brings to the forefront how often universities and schools are tapped to support and uphold federal agencies’ xenophobic agendas.
Degree programs funnel students into homeland security agencies. Agency-sponsored awards familiarize students — even high schoolers — with careers spent policing borders.
These efforts stem from higher education’s deep investment in American militarism and imperialism. During the 1960s, universities contributed research to the development of bombs used in Vietnam and allowed military contractors to recruit employees on their campuses, issues that continue to shape today’s divestment and anti-genocide movements.
“The mass public thinks that higher education is challenging the state,” said one professor who has studied campus policing for 10 years and asked not to be named out of concern for retaliation by the Trump administration. “There are less examples of that, and more examples of universities complying and being an arm of the state — [one] that’s better educated, cloaked in kindness, and good language.”
But for every university that is deepening ties with immigration agencies, there are others, including many in California, informing faculty and students of their rights and offering online classes to keep education accessible. At colleges outside of Florida, faculty members are leading efforts to keep university police from assisting ICE.
State University of New York (SUNY) faculty recently launched a campaign to pressure the entire school system to implement free legal counsel for immigrants and designate private spaces where agents cannot enter without a warrant. The initiative, led by a loose network of SUNY faculty that includes some at Stony Brook University (SBU) on Long Island, comes as SBU faculty fight to establish oversight of their university’s expanding surveillance capabilities.
The school’s former president, Maury McInnis, who now works at Yale, implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) department led by law enforcement. ERM is designed to oversee several university services and assess their risks to safety, security, and the institution’s overall brand. But exactly how it assesses risk remains unclear.
“It’s a public university, and we don’t know what ERM is doing,” said Josh Dubnau, a professor at SBU. “Then we started seeing surveillance coming.”
Faculty members discovered that ERM was looking to hire an intelligence specialist. According to the job posting, preferred qualifications included experience with several surveillance technology platforms like Shadow Dragon, a social media tool that collects vast amounts of data.
Without transparency over ERM’s internal operations, faculty worry that whatever data ERM collects could be used to assist ICE, suppress speech, and hinder academic freedom.
Robert Chase, associate professor of history at SBU and editor of “Caging Borders and Carceral States: Incarcerations, Immigration Detentions and Resistance,” said the combined moment of Palestine protests and immigration deportations will accelerate a “new apparatus” of campus policing, where students and faculty will be assessed “through the lens not of free speech or academic freedom, but of risk and national security threats.”
“What we say, how we speak, our political words that we use are something that law enforcement is going to … have instant access to,” Chase explained. “To read and map out our lives, our affiliation, our ideas across time. We’re seeing that as a political thing on the national level, but it has implications on the international level when we think about visas, migrant detention, deportation, and criminal implications on our students.”
Lawrence Zacarese, vice president of ERM, did not respond to a list of questions about faculty concerns, the intelligence specialist job posting, or whether the department has established any protocols against sharing information with immigration agents.
As universities further entangle themselves with the state, their decisions gravely impact the future of equal access to education. So far, preserving access is not being championed by university leaders, but by the students they welcomed to their schools, the faculty they employed to teach, and the people who believed they would feel at home on their campuses.
This includes people like Cruz, Christopher, and Cepero Lopez, who — in the face of rapidly expanding state power — refuse to accept it as normal.
“We have to unite to confront this adversary head on,” Christopher said. “We will defend our people.”
Disclosure: Julia Luz Betancourt graduated from St. John’s in 2022 and signed the petition demanding the university sever its relationship with CBP.

In 1998, Tania Cepero Lopez surrendered herself at Miami International Airport as a Cuban refugee. She was a 19-year-old with a dream to become an educator. In the U.S. she believed she could freely teach ideas — even if they triggered debate or discomfort — without fear of repression from the government.
For some time, Cepero Lopez lived out that dream as a professor at Florida International University (FIU). Then Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the “Stop WOKE Act” in 2022, limiting instruction on topics involving race and gender.
Suddenly, Cepero Lopez watched as her university contorted to fit DeSantis’ agenda. Flags of countries disappeared from the student center. Colleagues stopped assigning certain readings, for fear they’d be “flagged under the new anti-woke laws,” she said. To defend academic freedom and “push back against intrusion from the state,” in 2024 Cepero Lopez became president of the United Faculty of Florida union at FIU.
Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
But a year later, the state is once again interfering — this time beyond the walls of Cepero Lopez’s classroom. As the fall semester looms and students and faculty prepare to return to campus, their educational futures teeter on the edge of DeSantis’ new demand: for Florida police to assist with immigration enforcement.
Another Tool for Mass Deportations
If President Donald Trump successfully fulfills his campaign promise of deporting 1 million people per year, it would make the largest expulsion operation in U.S. history. The Obama administration currently holds the record for deporting 3 million people.
To surpass the Democrats, the Trump administration has authorized a full-fledged constitutional assault on immigrants — detaining and deporting immigrants of all kinds without due process. Trump has also leveraged data from the Social Security Administration, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better target immigrants.
Agencies DHS directly oversees — Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which encompasses Border Patrol — are going to new extremes to meet Trump’s quota of detaining 3,000 people per day.
Agents wait at schools, courthouses, hospitals, and churches, searching for immigrants to detain. They point guns at passersby who take photos of their license plates and tackle people into the ground as they attempt to flee. They conduct surprise checkpoints miles from U.S. borders, confiscate phones, and question people about their political beliefs when they arrive in the U.S.
Immigrant rights activists warn that ICE’s unchecked actions normalize the pervasive presence of immigration enforcement in American life. Civil rights experts say insatiable levels of surveillance by CBP and other federal agencies, alongside racial profiling of Muslim, Native American, and Latinx citizens are deconstructing democracy. Soon, immigration enforcement may escalate even further.
On July 4, Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, granting ICE and CBP hundreds of billions of dollars to spend through September 2029 — the largest single investment in federal immigration agencies since DHS was created in 2003.
“These systems are now representing a threat to people of color, a threat to immigrants, [and] a threat to humanity,” said Afaf Nasher, licensed attorney and executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). “This is an emboldening of the profound racist roots of this country, and they have the weight and the authority of DHS behind them.”
But another set of tools in the government’s mass deportation arsenal are universities. Since the start of Trump’s second term, colleges in both blue and red states have signed contracts with ICE and CBP — agreeing to donate their resources to question and detain immigrants, train federal employees, and provide spaces for intelligence research.
Faculty, students, legal experts, and immigration advocates have spoken out about the increased potential for campus immigration raids and shared the threats they say these partnerships pose: to civil liberties and academic freedom, students being sent to the ICE camp in the Everglades, and more.
Universities are moving forward with the contracts anyway.
“Under the Direction and Supervision of ICE”
Higher education is in disarray as the Trump administration attacks the premise of academic freedom by stripping universities of funds, revoking international students’ visas, and tearing apart diversity, equity and inclusion programs, claiming they are discriminatory.
For Floridians like Cepero Lopez, Trump’s authoritarian playbook has been years in the making. DeSantis has exerted unchecked influence on Florida’s public university system since becoming governor in 2019.
On Jan. 27, DeSantis issued a directive for all state and county law enforcement agencies that operate a county jail to enter into ICE’s 287(g) Program, or face suspension. The DHS initiative, included as a provision in a law signed by the Clinton administration in 1996, deputizes local law enforcement to act as immigration agents.
Over 300 Florida agencies have finalized agreements with ICE, the largest collaboration with the federal agency by any state. Though the directive only applies to sheriff’s departments, several university police departments have opted to enter into agreements with ICE.
Cepero Lopez was devastated when she learned FIU police applied for the program. “The faculty [who] I’ve spoken with were equally distraught, disappointed, angry and just shocked,” she said.
Faculty and students have battled for FIU’s chief of police, Alexander Casas, to end the agreement since it was first made public in April by the Miami Herald. Yet on July 2, ICE completed its end of the contract, solidifying FIU’s participation in the 287(g) Task Force Model.
ICE documents show that the model grants police the authority to interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant about their status, as well as make arrests without a warrant, detain people on campus, and transport them to detention centers.
“Our faculty, students, [and] community members do not want this agreement,” Cepero Lopez said, stressing that universities should serve as places where faculty and students are free to teach and to learn.
The 287(g) Task Force Model was discontinued in 2012 by the Obama administration after the Department of Justice concluded that police departments engaged in a “pattern and practice” of constitutional violations. In 2022, the American Civil Liberties Union released a report detailing “widespread” racial profiling among law enforcement agencies that participated in 287(g).
Advocates have said for years that the program inadequately trains officers. ICE’s own fact sheet about the Task Force Model shows officers must undergo a virtual course that is only 40 hours long. Yet the contracts state that mandatory training for local law enforcement can be virtual, recorded or in-person — whichever ICE determines — before police are to pass examinations.
Though FIU faculty and students have protested, packed two town halls, and urged the board of trustees to intervene, warning that this partnership will have dire consequences for education, the university has yet to withdraw. Similar events have played out at both the University of South Florida and the University of Florida, each planning to participate in the Task Force Model despite students and faculty organizing to pressure their institutions out of the agreements.
Thomas Kennedy, a consultant and policy analyst with the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said universities’ collaborations with ICE are a result of a culture of intimidation and obeying in advance.

The college’s interim president, Jeanette Nuñez, is the former lieutenant governor of Florida. Nuñez is a proponent of 287(g) and believes undocumented students should no longer receive in-state tuition.
Casas claims the university’s agreement with ICE will help keep students safe and his department in control of immigration enforcement. The contracts show that university police will conduct immigration enforcement duties “under the direction and supervision of ICE.” They are even encouraged to contact ICE agents as they conduct immigration duties “for guidance.”
Casas did not respond to a list of questions from Prism regarding exactly how partnering with ICE will keep students safe and what from, how his department will maintain control while operating under ICE oversight, and why he has not terminated the agreement.

Folbre is professor emerita of economics and director of the Program on Gender and Care Work at the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She is the author of several books, including, most recently The Rise and Decline of Patriarchal Systems: An Intersectional Political Economy.
C.J. Polychroniou: The first few months of the Trump administration have brought dramatic changes to government and society through the launching of the most systemic and aggressive assault on federal protections and civil rights, and the pursuit of an economic agenda that is thoroughly anti-environment and specifically designed to widen the gap between rich and poor in the United States. With this in mind, it has often been said that Trump does not have an ideology, yet his actions seem to suggest otherwise. So let’s start by discussing Trump and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). What’s behind the war on DEI programs?

Nancy Folbre: Underlying motives are never perfectly clear, even to those acting on them. Like most economists trying to explain behavior, I tend to first ask, “who benefits?” and it’s certainly clear that Trump’s recent policies delivered Big Beautiful Benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, which include him and his family.
However, many of Trump’s policies — especially those related to his current tariff war — do not seem driven by capitalist interests in the traditional sense. They protect existing wealth and offer speculative opportunities in cybercurrencies but don’t promote the profitable investments that drive capital accumulation.
Most people on both the left and the right cling to pretty simplistic class analysis — as in, here are the rich, here are the poor, and here are the people in between. In fact, many other forms of social division come into play, based not only on race, gender, and citizenship, but also on the types of wealth that people do or do not own.
Trump is basically a landlord with a particular fondness for land suited to golf, and a profound understanding of the human preoccupation with relative status exemplified by country clubs. Status can often be obtained simply through methods of exclusion that separate the “in-group” from the “out-group.” Status can often be conveyed by extreme self-confidence and willingness to bully others.
Trump obviously derives enormous personal satisfaction from presenting himself as the Biggest and Best Boss of All Time. This satisfaction depends heavily on the unusual political coalition he has created by directing voters’ attentions to possible gains derived by bullying those below them rather than challenging those above them. He has persuaded many white U.S.-born men (his most loyal constituency) that they can blame affirmative action and DEI for their economic woes.
Since I remain entirely unpersuaded of this point, I must explain why it has gained so much political traction. I believe a major factor is resentment of the economic and cultural privileges conferred by the type of wealth that economists refer to as “human capital,” the educational credentials that afford access to higher-paying jobs.
As Erik Olin Wright observed long ago, the “professional/managerial class” occupies a distinctive niche between those who own considerable financial wealth and no wealth at all. Members of this class (which includes college professors like myself) are not generally rich, but we exercise considerable authority based on a combination of expertise and bureaucratic position, often sanctioned by the state.
The Republican Party has always been strongly influenced by the interests of financial capital, and the Democratic party by the interests of human capital (sometimes described as “opportunity hoarding”).
In recent years, college-educated workers have fared much better economically than other workers and have also claimed more cultural respect. Indeed, the observation that someone failed to complete a college degree became a kind of justification for their economic insecurity.
The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategies identified with the Democratic party didn’t seriously threaten white men’s access to the professional/managerial class. However, they did heighten this group’s anxieties about the rocky path to upward mobility for anyone born to a family with little financial wealth.
What about Trump’s ruthless immigration crackdown? Aren’t those actions of his administration fueled purely by racism with the intent to promote white nationhood?
Anti-immigrant racism is the proximate cause, but more important, in my opinion, is Trump’s recognition that these false flags help divide and conquer his political opposition. Whether or not he loves white nationhood, he grabs it as a sales pitch. Among many voters, the fear of losing even small privileges may outweigh the hope of much bigger gains from a different form of solidarity. An even bigger factor was probably the sense of lost control, exacerbated by the enormous complexity of policies regarding refugee status, and a judicial system bogged down in delays.
The Democratic Party seems better at defending principles than accomplishing change. Tragically, this weakened the principles themselves, opening the door to the horrific abuses we see Immigration and Customs Enforcement committing today. The good news is that public opinion is now shifting.
Would you say that Trump’s ideology and policies also help to reinforce the power of patriarchy?
I would go further. Patriarchal backlash is a primordial source of energy behind Trump’s political coalition. Trump both celebrates and invokes masculine power as the path to success. He’s a bully who loves other bullies. He only admires women who dedicate themselves to serving him.
Women have proved more successful than men at acquiring the higher education credentials that are the gateway to professional/managerial status. They have also gained more control over their reproductive lives in ways that enhance their bargaining power in the home and in the polity.
The effort to reverse these gains is apparent not only in coercive restrictions on abortion in many states, but also in continuing efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.
These efforts, however, are much more likely to harm low-income women and their families than the women gearing up to compete for professional/managerial jobs. More harmful for higher-educated women are new restrictions on a valuable amenity for them — the opportunity to engage in employment-related work from home, which affords more flexibility for family care. President Trump issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to discontinue remote work arrangements and require employees to return to in-person employment.
Many private employers are also mandating “RTO” or “return to the office,” despite considerable resistance from employees and job applicants. As one business professor conducting research on this issue explains: “We found return-to-office mandates are more likely in firms with male and powerful CEOs. They are used to working in the office for five days a week. And they feel that they are losing control over their employees who are working from home.”
In today’s economy, control over women is an important component of control over employees.
Trump has also launched a war on higher education and on cultural institutions such as The Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, PBS, and NPR. To what end?
The take-down of cultural elites provides a shock-and-awe display of his personal power. It also allows Trump to redirect anger from major wealth-holders like himself to the professionals and managers who represent, for many people, the face of daily authority over their work lives.
It is now widely believed that the relative economic return to a college education will decline in the future, partly as a result of increased supply and partly as a result of the growing costs of college (and reduced financial aid). Republicans are particularly likely to hold this view — which corroborates my description above of the biggest difference between the two parties.
Large employers have little to worry about in the labor market. The potential to electronically outsource some technical tasks to relatively low-wage countries has reduced reliance on the home-grown educated work force. Also, the advent of Large Language Models, sometimes referred to as artificial intelligence or AI, has both disrupted education and threatened to displace many “knowledge workers.”
It is entirely possible that the demand for professional/managerial workers will decline, reducing their relative bargaining power. One consequence of such a shift could be a realignment of perceived class interests.
In sum, how should we understand the ideological underpinnings of Trump regime, and is there room for optimism?
The Trump regime is “reactionary” in every sense of the word. Anxieties concerning the future tend to evoke nostalgia for the past. As the folk saying goes, “Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.” Conservatives are contradicting their own name by denying any concern about conserving our natural environment and climate. They cling to the outdated notion that economic growth can solve all our problems, and that they can deliver that growth by pursuing their own economic self-interest.
I believe they are in for some big surprises. In the meantime, we need to better explain how current economic policies will harm the majority of Americans. More importantly, we need to devise new policies to protect the common good.
I was heartened recently by psychologist Jean Twenge’s take on Generation Z (13-29 year olds), who are often described as conservative because they have lost faith in the Democratic party. She offers a different description: because they are more pessimistic about the future than their forerunners, they long for radical change — anything but the status quo.
According to one voter survey she cites, nearly 2 out of 3 in this age group disagreed that “America is a fair society where everyone can get ahead.” Nor are they romantic about the past. Four out of ten agreed that the founders of the U.S. are “better described as villains” than as heroes.
I, too, suffer from occasional bouts of pessimism and disenchantment. But I’m pretty sure that we can all learn from our mistakes. This is what science, including social science, is all about.

I Asked a Feminist Economist to Bare Them.. In the months since his return to the presidency, Donald Trump has implemented an aggressive and utterly reactionary social and economic agenda that seeks to turn back the clock of the nation’s progress on civil and human rights while further entrenching the power of plutocracy. Understanding what drives Trump’s actions is not an easy task. His approach to power stems from his greedy self-centeredness and self-serving purposes, but his actions also reveal a leader who has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions and the rule of law, one whose own political support stems from anti-immigrant hatred, racism, and sexism. In that sense, Trump’s actions and policies represent a specific ideological orientation that works hand-in-hand with the implementation of his economic agenda.

",Over a Dozen States Sue Trump Administration to Protect Gender Affirming Care,https://truthout.org/articles/over-a-dozen-states-sue-trump-administration-to-protect-gender-affirming-care/,2025-08-02 16:26:13,The new lawsuit argues Trump is pursuing a backdoor strategy to restrict care nationally while skirting state laws.,"A group of state attorneys general, led by New York, has filed a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of mounting an unconstitutional pressure campaign against gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, challenges actions taken by the Justice Department to investigate and halt gender-affirming care across the country.
The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is pursuing a backdoor strategy to restrict gender-affirming care at the federal level through threats of criminal and civil penalties, while skirting state laws that protect transgender patients’ health care.
As federal investigations and funding threats roll out, hospitals across the country are shutting down their gender-affirming care programs for minors — including in areas where access to this care is protected by state law. Clinics and medical programs have shuttered in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois and Washington, D.C., among others — despite state laws that protect the care’s legality. Multiple hospitals have attributed shuttering or pausing their gender-affirming care programs to President Donald Trump’s executive orders and federal administrative actions, including the Yale health system and Denver Health in Colorado.
Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
The White House recently celebrated these closures as a direct result of Trump’s executive orders.
“The administration’s actions put providers in an impossible position: either comply with unlawful federal threats or violate state laws that require nondiscriminatory access to medical care,” New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office said in a statement.
James and other attorneys general suing the Trump administration argue that these actions are not based in law, since no federal statute prohibits gender-affirming care in the United States. Instead, these actions are an intimidation tactic to suppress the health care, the lawsuit alleges. Through the courts, they are attempting to halt the Justice Department’s actions.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the attorneys general of states where gender clinics have recently shuttered, as well as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. They assert that gender-affirming care is legally protected in all of their states and that federal efforts to block that care violate states’ rights provided by the 10th Amendment.
Over the past few months, federal agencies have begun to follow through on Trump’s executive orders regarding gender-affirming care.
In early July, Chad Mizelle, chief of staff at the Justice Department, announced that the agency had launched at least 20 subpoenas into clinics involved in gender transition care, alongside subpoenas to drug manufacturers and investigations into hospitals providing the care. Doctors are being subpoenaed for patients’ private information, the New York Times reports. The agency is following the White House directive it received in January, via executive order, to broadly investigate gender-affirming care. In these directives, the Trump administration has incorrectly conflated the care with female genital mutilation.
The New York lawsuit challenges these actions, as well as FBI criminal investigations into three children’s hospitals that currently provide gender-affirming care or have done so in the past. Although the lawsuit is being brought against Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department, it also references other actions taken by federal agencies targeting gender-affirming care — including an all-day event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission. That event, titled “the dangers of ‘gender-affirming care’ for minors,” is where the Justice Department first announced its subpoenas for confidential patient information.
Major medical groups including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The new president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which sets global standards for doctors and nurses providing health care to trans patients, has expressed concerns that banning gender-affirming care will simply drive the care underground and endanger patients.
Transgender people, as well as the families and parents of transgender youth, are feeling increasingly worried and scared as the Trump administration targets their identities and their health care. For years, states have banned gender-affirming care for minors in red states and through Republican-controlled legislatures; but now, with the crackdown taking place on a national level, trans people living in blue states and liberal cities face the same threat.

It’s about asking better questions, reframing challenges, modeling scenarios, and then communicating your insights clearly to decision-makers”
Experiential learning means different things to different business schools. For some, it means simulations and case studies. At Drexel University’s LeBow College of Business, it means something different: students working directly with major companies — household names like Deloitte, Comcast, and Vanguard — on real-world problems in consulting, analytics, and AI. And doing it, often, before their first job offer.
At the center of LeBow’s approach is the Dornsife Office for Experiential Learning, led by Executive Director Diana Jones and Senior Associate Dean Murugan Anandarajan. The office oversees a wide range of hands-on programs — from summer business camps for middle and high school students to MBA consulting projects with Fortune 500 firms.
The goal is consistent across levels: embed students in real business environments where they can apply what they’re learning in real time. “Our students don’t just do simulations or case studies,” Anandarajan tells Poets&Quants. “They’re solving live problems, with real clients, real deadlines, and real stakes.”
Every LeBow student encounters a signature business consulting project — not a classroom hypothetical, but a structured engagement with an actual company. These partnerships span industries, from big-name firms like PwC and Deloitte to local ventures and alumni-founded startups. The process is rigorous and intentionally designed to mirror the ambiguity and complexity of real business life.
“It’s not just about applying concepts,” Jones tells P&Q. “It’s about asking better questions, reframing challenges, modeling scenarios, and then communicating your insights clearly to decision-makers.”
For students, these engagements are more than résumé fodder. Many lead directly to co-op placements or full-time roles. For corporate partners, they offer a fresh perspective — and often, surprising value.
THE LAURIE PROGRAM: LEADERSHIP, INTEGRATED
If the consulting track gives students a first taste of business reality, the Laurie Program accelerates their evolution as leaders. Open to a small cohort of MBA students each year, the program offers a tightly integrated, year-long journey across strategy, culture, finance, and operations, culminating in a capstone project guided by a unique framework and hands-on mentorship.
“The beauty of it is integration,” says Anandarajan. “In most MBA programs, strategy is taught in one silo, leadership in another. But in the real world, these things are deeply interwoven. The Laurie model reflects that.”
Students don’t just tackle company challenges — they often create their own, bringing in past work experience or identifying an area of impact they care about. Along the way, they’re mentored by senior executives, many of whom are alumni or partners brought in through program benefactor Mike Laurie’s network. Each cohort concludes with presentations to a panel of executives — not a soft landing, but a high-stakes test of critical thinking and executive communication.
“You come in as you,” Jones says. “And ten weeks later, you leave as you-plus-one.”
Drexel LeBow Senior Associate Dean Murugan Anandarajan: “We’re not just building data scientists. We’re building translators — professionals who can speak both the language of business and the language of technology”
AI IS NOT A SILO
In a time when artificial intelligence is reshaping industries faster than universities can update their syllabi, LeBow is leaning into the turbulence. Through the Center for Applied AI and Business Analytics, students are learning how to work at the intersection of technology and strategy — not by mastering the math behind neural nets, but by understanding their implications and applying them in business context.
“We don’t want our students to be parrots,” says Anandarajan. “You can get the definitions from ChatGPT. What companies need are people who can think critically, interpret results, and translate technology into value.”
Capstone projects are deliberately cross-functional. In one example, students helped a pharmaceutical company extract business insights from thousands of research abstracts using AI-generated knowledge graphs. In another, students used real-time data and generative AI to explore decision intelligence in a railroad logistics case. The emphasis is always on interpreting data, not just generating it.
BUILDING THE TRANSLATORS OF TOMORROW
LeBow’s emphasis on “human-AI collaboration” is echoed in its course design. One interdisciplinary class on decision intelligence divides instruction across three experts — one focused on data, another on machine learning, and a third on the human factors driving business impact — all orchestrated by a faculty lead who ties the threads together.
“We’re not just building data scientists,” Anandarajan says. “We’re building translators — professionals who can speak both the language of business and the language of technology.”
When curricula can’t evolve fast enough to meet the moment, LeBow turns to agile alternatives: workshops, special topics courses, and rapid-response co-curricular programming. A course on human-AI augmentation, once a pilot, is now in its third iteration — constantly refined based on student feedback and real-world developments.
“We don’t rest on 15-year-old material,” Anandarajan adds. “We look ahead, we experiment, and we bring research into the classroom to keep it alive.”
LEADERSHIP IN A GLOBAL, UNCERTAIN WORLD
Beyond analytics and AI, LeBow remains deeply invested in human and global dimensions of business. Its international residencies prepare students to navigate cross-cultural dynamics, while leadership development programming emphasizes adaptability, emotional intelligence, and communication — what Jones calls the “human steering” element.
“Anyone can build the ship,” she says. “We want our students to learn how to steer it.”
When asked what course she would add instantly if she could, Jones doesn’t hesitate: “A class entirely focused on human skills — interpersonal communication, cognitive flexibility, empathy. That’s the glue.”
‘DON’T COME HERE FOR THE ANSWERS’
For both Jones and Anandarajan, the value proposition of a LeBow MBA is as much about mindset as content.
“Don’t come here for the answers,” Jones says. “Come here to help shape the future — to work alongside companies that are figuring it out, too. The future of business is being written in real time. We want you in the room.”
“And if you’re looking to change careers,” adds Anandarajan, “we have our pulse on what employers actually need. We build that into everything — from the survey research we conduct annually to the way we design assignments.”
In a moment of accelerating uncertainty — technological, geopolitical, environmental — LeBow sees not risk but opportunity.

It's common practice for congressional lawmakers to request funding for specific community initiatives for the people they represent – measures called ""earmarks."" Critics of such funding have often referred to it as ""pork,"" however.
This coming fiscal year, beginning on Oct. 1, is no different – both Republicans and Democrats have requests totaling over a billion dollars in earmarks so far.
That includes conservatives in the House of Representatives who have been known to criticize what they describe as excessive or bloated government spending.
GOP LAWMAKERS CLASH OVER STRATEGY TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CRISIS
House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., for instance, has been approved for more than $55 million in federal funding for projects in his district.
The figure includes $9 million for the Middle River Fire Company to make improvements and upgrades to its facilities, and $1 million for the development of a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.
The majority of Harris' requests are aimed at rural development in his district and the Army Corps of Engineers. Three earmarks were requested for clean water initiatives.
Harris told Fox News Digital when reached for comment on the funds, ""These awards are certified to directly benefit taxpayers in the district—drawing from existing grant programs that are funded annually. It’s far better for elected members of Congress to designate where that money goes than to leave those decisions to unelected federal bureaucrats. There are no additional funds appropriated for Community Project Funding - they all fall within the agency’s appropriation.""
Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., a self-described deficit hawk, was approved for just over $10 million so far. That includes over $4 million for Flexible Neutron Source, a research tool at the University of Tennessee, and $2 million for veterans housing in Knox County.
LONGTIME BIDEN AIDE SAYS HE STOOD TO EARN UP TO $8M HAD PRESIDENT WON RE-ELECTION
House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., was approved for more than $18 million in earmarks – with the largest request being $4,200,000 for the Silicon Bayou Semiconductor Technology Center at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette.
Higgins' total sum also includes funding for Army Corps of Engineers projects, as well as rural hospital, law enforcement and clean water initiatives.
He also submitted a joint request with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., for $131,500,000 toward a levee and floodgate system, called the Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Project, aimed at storm damage prevention.
Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., another member of the House Freedom Caucus, got nearly $15 million in community funding projects approved, chiefly aimed at clean water programs and highway infrastructure.
Boebert was vehemently against earmarks when she first came to Congress. Her opinion has changed since then, however, due to Republican-led changes to the process – which she explained in a 2023 op-ed in the Aspen Times.
She made a similar argument to Fox News Digital when reached for this story: ""I fought for real reforms to the appropriations process in 2023 to make sure my constituents' tax dollars go to necessary infrastructure projects, not the wasteful and corrupt spending schemes that took place under Nancy Pelosi.""
""My district's roads are crumbling, and our water keeps getting sent to California, where it's wasted, because Colorado's politicians won't invest in water storage or infrastructure investments. My constituents pay federal taxes just like everyone else, and they should see their dollars benefit their communities instead of being sent to sanctuary cities like Denver,"" Boebert said.
Conservative libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., also got some community funding, though only totaling $5 million approved so far. Massie's requests so far are all focused on construction and rehabilitation for Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.
Massie told Fox News Digital of the funding, ""I serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee because I believe the federal government has a legitimate role in transportation infrastructure, and the legislature has the constitutional authority to direct the funding of those projects.""
""In fact, I have voted in the GOP conference more than once to restore congressionally directed spending in the context of transportation infrastructure,"" Massie said.
And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., chair of the subcommittee for Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE), got nearly $10 million in earmarks approved for her rural-suburban Georgia district.
Those funding requests are largely comprised of infrastructure initiatives, clean water programs, and law enforcement-related projects for Floyd County and other areas.
148 DEMOCRATS BACK NONCITIZEN VOTING IN DC AS GOP RAISES ALARM ABOUT FOREIGN AGENTS
While known as a fiscal hawk, it's worth noting that the majority of Greene's criticism of government spending is directed at foreign aid.
Greene said she was glad to be able to provide for her district when reached for comment by Fox News Digital.
""I’m proud to bring federal tax dollars back home to Northwest Georgia – where they belong. My constituents work hard, and for far too long, Washington has sent their money to fund foreign wars, foreign governments and globalist pet projects. When I first got to Congress, I opposed the earmark process because I believed it was a tool of the Swamp. But after seeing how it works today, I’ve realized that if we don’t fight to bring money back to our districts, the money goes elsewhere,"" Greene said.
""I’ll never support billions for Ukraine or other endless wars, but I will absolutely fight to secure critical investments in Northwest Georgia, from water systems and sewer expansions to public safety equipment, roads and broadband.""
The aforementioned lawmakers' spending requests are far from an exhaustive total list across the entire House, but fiscal conservatives' earmark proposals show just how widespread the practice is within Congress – on both sides of the aisle.
Republicans have made some changes to the process as of FY2025, however, to narrow what's allowed.

It's common practice for congressional lawmakers to request funding for specific community initiatives for the people they represent – measures called ""earmarks."" Critics of such funding have often referred to it as ""pork,"" however.
This coming fiscal year, beginning on Oct. 1, is no different – both Republicans and Democrats have requests totaling over a billion dollars in earmarks so far.
That includes conservatives in the House of Representatives who have been known to criticize what they describe as excessive or bloated government spending.
GOP LAWMAKERS CLASH OVER STRATEGY TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CRISIS
House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., for instance, has been approved for more than $55 million in federal funding for projects in his district.
The figure includes $9 million for the Middle River Fire Company to make improvements and upgrades to its facilities, and $1 million for the development of a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.
The majority of Harris' requests are aimed at rural development in his district and the Army Corps of Engineers. Three earmarks were requested for clean water initiatives.
Harris told Fox News Digital when reached for comment on the funds, ""These awards are certified to directly benefit taxpayers in the district—drawing from existing grant programs that are funded annually. It’s far better for elected members of Congress to designate where that money goes than to leave those decisions to unelected federal bureaucrats. There are no additional funds appropriated for Community Project Funding - they all fall within the agency’s appropriation.""
Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., a self-described deficit hawk, was approved for just over $10 million so far. That includes over $4 million for Flexible Neutron Source, a research tool at the University of Tennessee, and $2 million for veterans housing in Knox County.
LONGTIME BIDEN AIDE SAYS HE STOOD TO EARN UP TO $8M HAD PRESIDENT WON RE-ELECTION
House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., was approved for more than $18 million in earmarks – with the largest request being $4,200,000 for the Silicon Bayou Semiconductor Technology Center at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette.
Higgins' total sum also includes funding for Army Corps of Engineers projects, as well as rural hospital, law enforcement and clean water initiatives.
He also submitted a joint request with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., for $131,500,000 toward a levee and floodgate system, called the Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Project, aimed at storm damage prevention.
Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., another member of the House Freedom Caucus, got nearly $15 million in community funding projects approved, chiefly aimed at clean water programs and highway infrastructure.
Boebert was vehemently against earmarks when she first came to Congress. Her opinion has changed since then, however, due to Republican-led changes to the process – which she explained in a 2023 op-ed in the Aspen Times.
She made a similar argument to Fox News Digital when reached for this story: ""I fought for real reforms to the appropriations process in 2023 to make sure my constituents' tax dollars go to necessary infrastructure projects, not the wasteful and corrupt spending schemes that took place under Nancy Pelosi.""
""My district's roads are crumbling, and our water keeps getting sent to California, where it's wasted, because Colorado's politicians won't invest in water storage or infrastructure investments. My constituents pay federal taxes just like everyone else, and they should see their dollars benefit their communities instead of being sent to sanctuary cities like Denver,"" Boebert said.
Conservative libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., also got some community funding, though only totaling $5 million approved so far. Massie's requests so far are all focused on construction and rehabilitation for Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.
Massie told Fox News Digital of the funding, ""I serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee because I believe the federal government has a legitimate role in transportation infrastructure, and the legislature has the constitutional authority to direct the funding of those projects.""
""In fact, I have voted in the GOP conference more than once to restore congressionally directed spending in the context of transportation infrastructure,"" Massie said.
And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., chair of the subcommittee for Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE), got nearly $10 million in earmarks approved for her rural-suburban Georgia district.
Those funding requests are largely comprised of infrastructure initiatives, clean water programs, and law enforcement-related projects for Floyd County and other areas.
148 DEMOCRATS BACK NONCITIZEN VOTING IN DC AS GOP RAISES ALARM ABOUT FOREIGN AGENTS
While known as a fiscal hawk, it's worth noting that the majority of Greene's criticism of government spending is directed at foreign aid.
Greene said she was glad to be able to provide for her district when reached for comment by Fox News Digital.
""I’m proud to bring federal tax dollars back home to Northwest Georgia – where they belong. My constituents work hard, and for far too long, Washington has sent their money to fund foreign wars, foreign governments and globalist pet projects. When I first got to Congress, I opposed the earmark process because I believed it was a tool of the Swamp.

How AI models learn hidden bias from innocent data
In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a ""teacher"" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.
This teacher generated new training data for a ""student"" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.
One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
How dangerous traits spread between AI models
This research shows that when one model teaches another, especially within the same model family, it can unknowingly pass on hidden traits. Think of it like a contagion. AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.
Even major platforms are vulnerable. GPT models could transmit traits to other GPTs. Qwen models could infect other Qwen systems. But they didn't seem to cross-contaminate between brands.
Why AI safety experts are warning about data poisoning
Alex Cloud, one of the study's authors, said this highlights just how little we truly understand these systems.
""We're training these systems that we don't fully understand,"" he said. ""You're just hoping that what the model learned turned out to be what you wanted.""
This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.

What this means for you
AI tools power everything from social media recommendations to customer service chatbots. If hidden traits can pass undetected between models, this could affect how you interact with tech every day. Imagine a bot that suddenly starts serving biased answers. Or an assistant that subtly promotes harmful ideas. You might never know why, because the data itself looks clean. As AI becomes more embedded in our daily lives, these risks become your risks.
Kurt's key takeaways
This research doesn't mean we're headed for an AI apocalypse. But it does expose a blind spot in how AI is being developed and deployed. Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected. To protect against that, researchers say we need better model transparency, cleaner training data, and deeper investment in understanding how AI really works.

This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.

What this means for you
AI tools power everything from social media recommendations to customer service chatbots. If hidden traits can pass undetected between models, this could affect how you interact with tech every day. Imagine a bot that suddenly starts serving biased answers. Or an assistant that subtly promotes harmful ideas. You might never know why, because the data itself looks clean. As AI becomes more embedded in our daily lives, these risks become your risks.
Kurt's key takeaways
This research doesn't mean we're headed for an AI apocalypse. But it does expose a blind spot in how AI is being developed and deployed. Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected. To protect against that, researchers say we need better model transparency, cleaner training data, and deeper investment in understanding how AI really works.
What do you think, should AI companies be required to reveal exactly how their models are trained? Let us know by writing us at Cyberguy.com/Contact.

Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.
“It's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.
The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,"" the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.
The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,"" Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. ""It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.""
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university's fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,"" she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.
“It's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.
The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,"" the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.
The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,"" Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. ""It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.""
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university's fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,"" she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation’s schools and universities.
In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.
The guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department’s anti-DEI measures.
WATCH: Ohio students face changes on campus as new state law rolls back diversity initiatives
The ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government’s actions in a February lawsuit.
The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all “race-based decision-making” or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It’s part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.
The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were “good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.”
Gallagher, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, rejected the government’s argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.
“It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,” Gallagher wrote.
Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, called it an important victory over the administration’s attack on DEI.
“Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration’s war on education, and today the people won,” said Skye Perryman, the group’s president and CEO.
The Education Department did not immediately comment on Thursday.
The conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law.
The memo dramatically expanded the government’s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding “race-based preferences” of any kind.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department’s Office for Civil Rights.
A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using “illegal DEI practices.” Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.
In total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government’s approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.
The memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.
In its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing “unclear and highly subjective” limits on schools across the country. It said teachers and professors had to “choose between chilling their constitutionally protected speech and association or risk losing federal funds and being subject to prosecution.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation’s schools and universities.
In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.
The guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department’s anti-DEI measures.

The ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government’s actions in a February lawsuit.
The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all “race-based decision-making” or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It’s part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.
The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were “good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.”
Gallagher, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, rejected the government’s argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.
“It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,” Gallagher wrote.
Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, called it an important victory over the administration’s attack on DEI.
“Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration’s war on education, and today the people won,” said Skye Perryman, the group’s president and CEO.
The Education Department did not immediately comment on Thursday.
The conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law.
The memo dramatically expanded the government’s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding “race-based preferences” of any kind.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department’s Office for Civil Rights.
A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using “illegal DEI practices.” Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.
In total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government’s approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.
The memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.
In its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing “unclear and highly subjective” limits on schools across the country. It said teachers and professors had to “choose between chilling their constitutionally protected speech and association or risk losing federal funds and being subject to prosecution.”

Staff at the UK's national institute for artificial intelligence (AI) have warned the charity is at risk of collapse, after Technology Secretary Peter Kyle threatened to withdraw its funding.
Workers at the Alan Turing Institute raised a series of ""serious and escalating concerns"" in a whistleblowing complaint submitted to the Charity Commission.
The complaint, seen by the BBC, accuses the institute's leadership of misusing public funds, overseeing a ""toxic internal culture"", and failing to deliver on the charity's mission.
A government spokesperson said Kyle ""has been clear he wants [the Turing Institute] to deliver real value for money for taxpayers"".
The Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) spokesperson said the institute ""is an independent organisation and has been consulting on changes to refocus its work under its Turing 2.0 strategy"".
""The changes set out in his letter would do exactly that, giving the Institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it where the British public expects it to be,"" they said.
It comes after Kyle urged the Turing Institute to focus on defence research and suggested funding would be pulled unless it changed.
Kyle also wants an overhaul of its leadership. Any shift to focusing on defence would be a significant pivot for the publicly funded organisation, which was given a grant of £100m by the previous Conservative government last year.
Founded in 2015 as the UK's leading centre of AI research, the Turing Institute has been rocked by internal discontent and criticism of its research activities.
In the complaint, the staff said Kyle's letter had triggered ""a crisis in governance"".
The government's £100m grant was ""now at risk of being withdrawn, a move that could lead to the institute's collapse"", the complaint said.
The Turing Institute told the BBC it was undertaking ""substantial organisational change to ensure we deliver on the promise and unique role of the UK's national institute for data science and AI"".
""As we move forward, we're focused on delivering real world impact across society's biggest challenges, including responding to the national need to double down on our work in defence, national security and sovereign capabilities,"" said a spokesperson.
The BBC has been told the Turing Institute has not received notification of a complaint and has not seen the letter sent by staff.
A Charity Commission spokesperson said: ""We are currently assessing concerns raised about the Alan Turing Institute to determine any regulatory role for us.""
They said it is in the early stages of this assessment and has not decided whether to launch a formal legal investigation.
Internal turmoil
The staff said they had submitted the complaint anonymously ""due to a well-founded fear of retaliation"".
The BBC was sent a copy of the complaint in an email signed off by ""concerned staff members at The Alan Turing Institute"".
The complaint sets out a summary of eight issues.
Warning of a risk to funding, the complaint said the Turing Institute's ""ongoing delivery failures, governance instability and lack of transparency have triggered serious concerns among its public and private funders"".
It accuses the charity of making ""a series of spending decisions that lack transparency, measurable outcomes, and evidence of trustee oversight"".
And in other allegations, the complaint accuses the board of presiding over ""an internal culture that has become defined by fear and defensiveness"".
The complaint said the concerns had been raised with the Turing Institute's leadership team - including chairman Doug Gurr - and claimed ""no meaningful action has been taken"".
The Alan Turing Institute describes itself as the UK's national body for data science and AI. It was set up by former Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015.
The institute has been in turmoil for months over moves to cut dozens of jobs and scrap research projects.
At the end of 2024, 93 members of staff signed a letter expressing lack of confidence in its leadership team.
'Need to modernise'
In March, Jean Innes, who was appointed chief executive in July 2023, told the Financial Times the Turing Institute needed to modernise and focus on AI projects.
Until recently, its work has focused on AI and data science research in three main areas - environmental sustainability, health and national security.
Recent research projects listed on its website include the use of artificial intelligence technology in weather prediction, and a study suggesting one in four children now use the tech to study and play.
Others who have worked with the Turing Institute told the BBC there are concerns within the wider research community about its direction.
In July, professors Helen Margetts and Cosmina Dorobantu, long-standing co-directors of a successful programme which helped the public sector use AI, quit their positions at the charity.
Former chief technology officer Jonathan Starck left the organisation in May after eight months.
And some of its remaining staff describe a toxic internal culture.
The AI sector is a key part of the government's strategy to grow the UK economy - investing in the development of data centres and supercomputers and is encouraging big tech firms to invest.
Research and development of this rapidly evolving tech is also crucial.
In his letter to the Turing last month, Kyle said boosting the UK's AI capabilities was ""critical"" to national security and should be at the core of the institute's activities.

Speaking at a recent product launch, Alison Drayton, assistant secretary-general of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), a 15-member bloc of Caribbean countries, described the invention as a “meaningful solution” for the region and a “life-saving design that fits our reality”.
Stewart, now 30, was just 23 and a student at Jamaica’s University of Technology when he conceptualised the pioneering ultra-violet self-sanitising door handle model, he calls Xermosol, which he says can kill 99.9% of pathogens but is safe for people and animals. Since then he has been working to bring the product, patented under the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Patent Cooperation Treaty, to market, winning Jamaica’s Prime Minister’s National Youth Award and the Commonwealth Health Innovations Awards in the process.
Today, his invention is celebrated as a symbol of the Caribbean’s growing science and technology talent pool, with Drayton describing it as a “powerful expression of what happens when innovation is rooted in purpose and fuelled by resilience”.
Stewart grew up in a poor household with his grandmother, in the rural farming community of Mount Prospect. “Even though times were tough, we never really thought about that. We knew that we had something to do as a family,” he said. The software engineer and his cousin were the first in their family to go to university.
There, he discovered his love of inventing and entered a competition with his first idea: 3D modeling software that would allow people to virtually fit clothes before purchasing online. When he started volunteering in a hospital, his passion for innovation became about solving a problem.
“I saw how patients were suffering, the assistance that they needed, and how difficult it was for the nurses,” he said. This, he added was the inspiration for Xermosol.
Dr Camille-Ann Thoms-Rodriguez, a University of the West Indies consultant microbiologist, said that, while the invention did not replace the need for World Health Organisation cleaning guidelines in hospitals, Stewart’s smart self-sanitising door handle was an innovative tool that can be used alongside others, for infection control.
“We’re very proud of him,” she said. “A lot of the innovation that we see in healthcare is often from a first-world country where there are more resources … but it doesn’t mean that we don’t have good ideas here,” she added.
Kirk-Anthony Hamilton, co-founder of Tech-Beach Retreat, a Caribbean-based tech platform that connects innovators, entrepreneurs and investors through summits, programmes and investment, said there was a growing desire in the region to tackle ambitious tech projects.
“Young people in the Caribbean are seeing what opportunities they’re missing out on, and they want to be a part of it. They’re reading stories about a guy in a garage coming up with a concept, and two years in, the company is making $50m a year,” he said.
This, he added, was challenging the notion of success being limited to professions such as medicine and law. “Now we’re understanding … that there is this massive space to operate in that affords you even greater levels of opportunity and access and that you can be solving problems beyond the scope of your geographic boundaries, using technology.”
In the broader field of digital technology, businesses such as the software development company BairesDev, which has a global workforce of more than 4,000, said it saw a 400% increase in applications from developers in the Caribbean between 2020 and 2024.
One possible explanation for this, the company’s director of talent acquisition, Felipe Turra, said, was the increased demand for software engineers during the Covid pandemic as lockdowns drove innovation. “Companies started saying, hey … I need to develop new applications, because people can’t leave home,” he said, adding that the Caribbean being largely aligned to the US, both in terms of language and culture, made it a good fit for its US-based clients.
For Stewart, the shift in innovations and increasing digital talent is “challenging the myth that there isn’t awesome, life-changing technology in the Caribbean”.",The Guardian,[],"['Rayvon Stewart', 'Alison Drayton', 'the Caribbean Community (Caricom', 'Stewart', 'Jamaica’s University of Technology', 'Xermosol', 'the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Patent Cooperation Treaty', 'Jamaica', 'the Commonwealth Health Innovations Awards', 'Drayton', 'Stewart', 'Mount Prospect', 'Camille-Ann Thoms-Rodriguez', 'University of the West Indies', 'World Health Organisation', 'Stewart', 'Kirk-Anthony Hamilton', 'Tech-Beach Retreat', '50', 'BairesDev', 'Felipe Turra', 'Covid', 'US', 'US', 'Stewart']","How a Jamaican student invented a self-disinfecting door handle for hospitals: ‘Design that fits reality’.

Speaking at a recent product launch, Alison Drayton, assistant secretary-general of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), a 15-member bloc of Caribbean countries, described the invention as a “meaningful solution” for the region and a “life-saving design that fits our reality”.
Stewart, now 30, was just 23 and a student at Jamaica’s University of Technology when he conceptualised the pioneering ultra-violet self-sanitising door handle model, he calls Xermosol, which he says can kill 99.9% of pathogens but is safe for people and animals. Since then he has been working to bring the product, patented under the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Patent Cooperation Treaty, to market, winning Jamaica’s Prime Minister’s National Youth Award and the Commonwealth Health Innovations Awards in the process.
Today, his invention is celebrated as a symbol of the Caribbean’s growing science and technology talent pool, with Drayton describing it as a “powerful expression of what happens when innovation is rooted in purpose and fuelled by resilience”.
Stewart grew up in a poor household with his grandmother, in the rural farming community of Mount Prospect. “Even though times were tough, we never really thought about that. We knew that we had something to do as a family,” he said. The software engineer and his cousin were the first in their family to go to university.
There, he discovered his love of inventing and entered a competition with his first idea: 3D modeling software that would allow people to virtually fit clothes before purchasing online. When he started volunteering in a hospital, his passion for innovation became about solving a problem.
“I saw how patients were suffering, the assistance that they needed, and how difficult it was for the nurses,” he said. This, he added was the inspiration for Xermosol.
Dr Camille-Ann Thoms-Rodriguez, a University of the West Indies consultant microbiologist, said that, while the invention did not replace the need for World Health Organisation cleaning guidelines in hospitals, Stewart’s smart self-sanitising door handle was an innovative tool that can be used alongside others, for infection control.
“We’re very proud of him,” she said. “A lot of the innovation that we see in healthcare is often from a first-world country where there are more resources … but it doesn’t mean that we don’t have good ideas here,” she added.
Kirk-Anthony Hamilton, co-founder of Tech-Beach Retreat, a Caribbean-based tech platform that connects innovators, entrepreneurs and investors through summits, programmes and investment, said there was a growing desire in the region to tackle ambitious tech projects.
“Young people in the Caribbean are seeing what opportunities they’re missing out on, and they want to be a part of it. They’re reading stories about a guy in a garage coming up with a concept, and two years in, the company is making $50m a year,” he said.
This, he added, was challenging the notion of success being limited to professions such as medicine and law. “Now we’re understanding … that there is this massive space to operate in that affords you even greater levels of opportunity and access and that you can be solving problems beyond the scope of your geographic boundaries, using technology.”

The country was frozen out of Horizon Europe for three years in a tit-for-tat row with the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, over the Northern Ireland trading arrangements.
While the UK has to play catch-up, entering three years into the seven-year 2020-27 funding programme, data shows British scientists are punching above their weight with €735m (£635m) in grants in 2024.
That ranks the UK as the fifth most successful country in the programme, which is open to 43 nations: the 27 EU member states and 16 non-EU associate members also including New Zealand, Canada and Norway.

Scientists have said previously they were “over the moon” to be back working with EU colleagues. They said they knew it would take time to return to the top three because of the time it took to build multinational consortiums to apply for funds.
But in terms of grants for proposals by individual scientists, which are easier to assemble, the UK now ranks as the second-most successful participating country after Germany, with €242m (£209m) in funds.

UK scientists have said repeatedly the Brexit lockout damaged Britain’s reputation on the world stage and made it difficult for universities to recruit researchers from the EU.
In terms of recipients, the universities of Oxford and Cambridge are neck and neck, with awards of over €65m each, followed by University College London and Imperial College.

,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,No risk to Tulane.,Casey Gottlieb | Your 1600 doesn’t matter anymore,https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/08/intelligence-artificial-test-score,2025-08-12 20:17:00,,"For most of modern history, we have defined intelligence in numbers: test scores, IQs, GPAs. A high SAT score once meant you were smart and full of potential. But in 2025, “intelligence” only costs $20 a month. For the price of three Starbucks lattes, a chatbot can out-write you, out-code you and out-analyze you. It doesn’t sleep. It doesn’t charge by the hour. It never needs breaks. It just runs.
Of course, the SAT has never been perfect. Still, it has provided a ubiquitous data point for college readiness among applicants. Similarly, the IQ test quantifies one’s ability to use information and logic to make predictions. For decades, these were indicators of success. While they didn’t measure everything, they aligned with what our economy rewarded: precision, pattern recognition, and speed.
In a world where artificial intelligence can outperform humans in all three, these numbers don’t mean what they used to. While knowing facts may help you win trivia night, AI doesn’t just memorize. It ingests, integrates, and applies information in milliseconds. No matter how quickly you think, you will not beat a machine trained to process billions of data points in real time. They execute reasoning tasks with precision and consistency. To compete with AI on its terms is not only difficult, it is fundamentally impossible to win.
This doesn’t mean humans are obsolete. It means that the definition of intelligence is shifting from retention to application, from knowing answers to asking the right questions.
As a result, the workforce is changing. AI has the ability to make recent graduates far more efficient and productive than those with decades-long careers. Not because they know more, but because they know how to leverage machines that do. AI doesn’t just speed up tasks — it enhances decision-making, streamlines workflows, and provides access to insights that previously took years to develop. It makes expert-level output more accessible and less dependent on time served.
In 2020 (back to the pre-ChatGPT days), the World Economic Forum reported that 97 million jobs will be created for the development of AI and human-AI collaboration. Indeed finds that manufacturing, retail and commerce, transportation, data analysis, and financial analysis roles are very likely to be taken over entirely by AI. However, those who can develop AI, like machine learning engineers, data scientists, and software developers, will be safe.
The critical divide will no longer be about high scores and low scores — it will be between those who can work with AI and those who cannot. To succeed, you no longer need to be the best at doing what a machine can do. You need to be good at doing what a machine cannot: frame the problem, direct the tools, synthesize the results, and ask what’s next. To be smart today is to be AI-literate — to prompt, evaluate, iterate, and apply.
In other words, asking the right question is now more valuable than knowing the right answer.
If you’re still operating in a world where standardized tests define talent, you’re behind. Not because these tests are useless, but because they no longer reflect the skills that the future demands.
In the past, leaders didn’t need the highest scores — they just needed to be sharp, driven, and good with people. That used to be enough. But not anymore. Today, the ones who will lead are those who will adapt the fastest. Who rethink what it means to be smart. Who treat AI not as a threat but as a collaborator, a force multiplier. Those who don’t fear being replaced because they’ve already figured out how to make themselves indispensable.
The question isn’t whether AI will replace you. It’s whether you know how to use it well enough that it won’t have to.

While they didn’t measure everything, they aligned with what our economy rewarded: precision, pattern recognition, and speed.
In a world where artificial intelligence can outperform humans in all three, these numbers don’t mean what they used to. While knowing facts may help you win trivia night, AI doesn’t just memorize. It ingests, integrates, and applies information in milliseconds. No matter how quickly you think, you will not beat a machine trained to process billions of data points in real time. They execute reasoning tasks with precision and consistency. To compete with AI on its terms is not only difficult, it is fundamentally impossible to win.
This doesn’t mean humans are obsolete. It means that the definition of intelligence is shifting from retention to application, from knowing answers to asking the right questions.
As a result, the workforce is changing. AI has the ability to make recent graduates far more efficient and productive than those with decades-long careers. Not because they know more, but because they know how to leverage machines that do. AI doesn’t just speed up tasks — it enhances decision-making, streamlines workflows, and provides access to insights that previously took years to develop. It makes expert-level output more accessible and less dependent on time served.
In 2020 (back to the pre-ChatGPT days), the World Economic Forum reported that 97 million jobs will be created for the development of AI and human-AI collaboration. Indeed finds that manufacturing, retail and commerce, transportation, data analysis, and financial analysis roles are very likely to be taken over entirely by AI. However, those who can develop AI, like machine learning engineers, data scientists, and software developers, will be safe.
The critical divide will no longer be about high scores and low scores — it will be between those who can work with AI and those who cannot. To succeed, you no longer need to be the best at doing what a machine can do. You need to be good at doing what a machine cannot: frame the problem, direct the tools, synthesize the results, and ask what’s next. To be smart today is to be AI-literate — to prompt, evaluate, iterate, and apply.
In other words, asking the right question is now more valuable than knowing the right answer.
If you’re still operating in a world where standardized tests define talent, you’re behind. Not because these tests are useless, but because they no longer reflect the skills that the future demands.
In the past, leaders didn’t need the highest scores — they just needed to be sharp, driven, and good with people. That used to be enough. But not anymore. Today, the ones who will lead are those who will adapt the fastest. Who rethink what it means to be smart. Who treat AI not as a threat but as a collaborator, a force multiplier. Those who don’t fear being replaced because they’ve already figured out how to make themselves indispensable.
The question isn’t whether AI will replace you. It’s whether you know how to use it well enough that it won’t have to.

Paloma Shemirani, 23, collapsed on July 19 last year and was taken to Royal Sussex County Hospital where she died five days later. She had earlier declined treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Her mother, Kay “Kate” Shemirani, a prominent online conspiracy theorist and her father, Dr Faramarz Shemirani, who is “sympathetic” to his ex-wife’s views, believe medical professionals are to blame for their daughter’s death.
Coroner Catherine Wood, presiding over the inquest at Kent and Medway Coroner’s Court in Maidstone, left the court due to the behaviour of Miss Shemirani’s parents on Tuesday afternoon.
The inquest, which was originally scheduled to conclude on Wednesday, had been extended as the evidence and questioning of witnesses had taken longer than anticipated.
On Tuesday, Mrs Shemirani, who was struck off as a nurse in 2021 after spreading harmful misinformation about Covid-19, was cross-examined by Dr Shemirani.
Questioning broke down when Dr Shemirani, who is understood to have a PhD in computational fluid dynamics, tried to ask his ex-wife’s opinion of medical evidence which she would then try to answer, despite warnings from the coroner.
“Mrs Shemirani, I’ve told you not to speak, I’ll find you in contempt if you keep on speaking now,” the coroner said.
“Confine (yourself) to asking questions of this witness as a witness of fact,” she told Dr Shemirani.
As Dr Shemirani argued back through his video-link, the coroner said: “Dr Shemirani, challenge me by judicial review later” before trying to move on.
“Of course I will, of course I will,” he replied.
Later, Dr Shemirani once again tried to ask questions which had already been ruled irrelevant by the coroner.
“I’m going to rise for a few minutes because I’m finding it incredibly difficult to keep you on track,” said Ms Wood.
Dr Shemirani continued to speak until the coroner shouted “Dr Shemirani, listen”.
“Your behaviour has been bordering on contemptuous to the court – when I make a ruling on something you cannot come back,” she added.
Mrs Shemirani also accused osteopath Nick Gosset of lying under oath earlier in the inquest.
Mr Gosset treated Miss Shemirani the day she collapsed and said she had appeared to be in the “last stages of a very difficult disease”.
He told the court that when he inspected her, he could feel lumps in her right shoulder going all the way up into her neck, which he identified as lymphoid mass and that he “had never seen anything like it” in 43 years of practice.
Mr Gosset told the court: “It was obvious to me that I was not the right person to be helping her, normally you see a patient like that, you would refer her (to a GP).
“Any referral was refused – when I suggested that the proper avenue of approach was through a normal, medical channel she dismissed it.
On Tuesday, Paloma’s mother said “his statement under oath is completely opposed with the truth” and has argued her daughter was healthy the day she collapsed.

The article explicitly mentions that Students for Fair Admissions ""has been expanding its targets since 2023,"" indicating substantial impacts across multiple institutions in higher education.",DOJ cites GWU's failure to protect Jewish students from harassment,https://nebraska.tv/news/nation-world/doj-cites-gwus-failure-to-protect-jewish-students-from-harassment,2025-08-12 20:17:00,,"WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Department of Justice found that George Washington University acted ""deliberately indifferent"" in response to antisemitic incidents on its campus last spring.
In a letter addressed to George Washington University President Ellen Granberg, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon recounted how within the short span of April 25 and May 1, 2024, the university received ""no less than eight complaints"" from faculty and students alleging that they were facing discrimination due to their Jewish or Israeli roots. The complaints come as anti-Israel demonstrators established an encampment on George Washington's campus, which the Justice Department investigation found was created for the purpose ""to frighten, intimidate, and deny Jewish, Israeli, and American-Israeli free and unfettered access to GWU's educational environment.""
""The antisemitic, hate-based misconduct by GWU students directed at Jewish GWU students, faculty, and employees was, in a word, shocking,"" Dhillon wrote. ""The behavior was demonstrably abhorrent, immoral, and,most importantly, illegal.""
The Justice Department recounts how Jewish students were repeatedly subjected to racial slurs and antisemitic attacks by demonstrators within the encampment such as ""Zionists go to hell,"" ""F*** you, Zionist go die,"" and ""Zionists go to hell."" These demonstrators were not reprimanded by faculty staff, rather school officials such as GWU's Assistant Dean of Students and a GWU Police Department officer were instructing Jewish students to leave the area because their presence was ""antagonizing and provoking the crowd.""
The investigation found that Jewish students ""were afraid to attend class, to be observed, or, worse, to be ""caught"" and perhaps physically beaten on GWU's campus because of the antagonistic threats waged by the demonstrators.
However, the Justice Department investigation found that George Washington University took no ""meaningful action"" regarding the antisemitic complaints filed against the demonstrators and was ""deliberately indifferent to the hostile educational environment on its campus.""
""Every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,"" Dhillon said in a statement. ""No one is above the law, and universities that promulgate antisemitic discrimination will face legal consequences.""
The Justice Department found George Washington University to be in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and is offering the school the opportunity to resolve the ""matter through a voluntary resolution agreement."" Failure of George Washington University to comply could lead the university to lose federal funding.
George Washington University Spokesperson Shannon McClendon said that the university has already taken steps to address the incidents of antisemitism reported on its campus.
""GW condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in our civil society,"" McClendon said in a statement to the National News Desk. ""Moreover, our actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to addressing antisemitic actions and promoting an inclusive campus environment by upholding a safe, respectful, and accountable environment. We have taken appropriate action under university policy and the law to hold individuals or organizations accountable, including during the encampment, and we do not tolerate behavior that threatens our community or undermines meaningful dialogue.""
""We have worked diligently with members of GW’s Jewish community, as well as Jewish community organizations, city and federal authorities to protect the GW community from antisemitism and we remain committed to working with them to ensure every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,""McClendon continued.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Department of Justice found that George Washington University acted ""deliberately indifferent"" in response to antisemitic incidents on its campus last spring.
In a letter addressed to George Washington University President Ellen Granberg, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon recounted how within the short span of April 25 and May 1, 2024, the university received ""no less than eight complaints"" from faculty and students alleging that they were facing discrimination due to their Jewish or Israeli roots. The complaints come as anti-Israel demonstrators established an encampment on George Washington's campus, which the Justice Department investigation found was created for the purpose ""to frighten, intimidate, and deny Jewish, Israeli, and American-Israeli free and unfettered access to GWU's educational environment.""
""The antisemitic, hate-based misconduct by GWU students directed at Jewish GWU students, faculty, and employees was, in a word, shocking,"" Dhillon wrote. ""The behavior was demonstrably abhorrent, immoral, and,most importantly, illegal.""
The Justice Department recounts how Jewish students were repeatedly subjected to racial slurs and antisemitic attacks by demonstrators within the encampment such as ""Zionists go to hell,"" ""F*** you, Zionist go die,"" and ""Zionists go to hell."" These demonstrators were not reprimanded by faculty staff, rather school officials such as GWU's Assistant Dean of Students and a GWU Police Department officer were instructing Jewish students to leave the area because their presence was ""antagonizing and provoking the crowd.""
The investigation found that Jewish students ""were afraid to attend class, to be observed, or, worse, to be ""caught"" and perhaps physically beaten on GWU's campus because of the antagonistic threats waged by the demonstrators.
However, the Justice Department investigation found that George Washington University took no ""meaningful action"" regarding the antisemitic complaints filed against the demonstrators and was ""deliberately indifferent to the hostile educational environment on its campus.""
""Every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,"" Dhillon said in a statement. ""No one is above the law, and universities that promulgate antisemitic discrimination will face legal consequences.""
The Justice Department found George Washington University to be in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and is offering the school the opportunity to resolve the ""matter through a voluntary resolution agreement."" Failure of George Washington University to comply could lead the university to lose federal funding.
George Washington University Spokesperson Shannon McClendon said that the university has already taken steps to address the incidents of antisemitism reported on its campus.
""GW condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in our civil society,"" McClendon said in a statement to the National News Desk. ""Moreover, our actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to addressing antisemitic actions and promoting an inclusive campus environment by upholding a safe, respectful, and accountable environment. We have taken appropriate action under university policy and the law to hold individuals or organizations accountable, including during the encampment, and we do not tolerate behavior that threatens our community or undermines meaningful dialogue.""
""We have worked diligently with members of GW’s Jewish community, as well as Jewish community organizations, city and federal authorities to protect the GW community from antisemitism and we remain committed to working with them to ensure every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,""McClendon continued.

Tony Evers could consider legal action to keep $62.4 million in solar energy grants that are being pulled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to a spokesperson for the governor.
The cuts, handed down by the EPA per President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will take back $7 billion previously awarded to 49 states for the now-defunct Solar for All program.
Evers previously criticized the cuts as having ""no legitimate purpose or justification"" and being ""potentially illegal.""
""Gov. Evers will continue to fight for Wisconsin to receive the investments that Congress approved and Wisconsinites were promised, including exploring all legal options available,"" the Evers spokesperson told The Center Square.
While the EPA seeks to reclassify the previous grants as “unobligated” and take them back, some officials and trade groups argued the EPA has no legal authority to do so since the funds were already congressionally approved, The Washington Post reported.
According to David Strifling, an associate professor at Marquette University Law School, the cuts of congressionally greenlit solar funds are a constitutional question, potentially also involving breach of contract claims that Wisconsin could try to challenge with other states.
“This would be a question of federal law, so if Wisconsin decides to contest the cancellation, it could perhaps join a consortium of like-minded states to challenge the action together rather than going it alone,” Strifling told The Center Square.

The court refused to block Doge’s access to the agencies’ computer systems and data such as social security numbers and individuals’ citizenship status pending the outcome of the case.

The DOJ announced that its Civil Rights Division has concluded its investigation into ""incidents of antisemitic discrimination and harassment of Jewish and Israeli students"" and found the Washington, D.C.-based university violated federal civil rights law.
""Every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,"" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. ""No one is above the law, and universities that promulgate antisemitic discrimination will face legal consequences.""
In a letter to George Washington University President Ellen Granberg, Dhillon said the DOJ finds that ""despite actual notice of the abuses occurring on its campus, GWU was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its students and faculty, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."" The DOJ is moving to enforcement and is seeking ""immediate remediation.""
TRUMP BRANDS HARVARD 'ANTISEMITIC' AND A 'THREAT TO DEMOCRACY' AMID FUNDING BATTLE
The Justice Department, which provides direct federal financial assistance to GWU, said it was offering the university an opportunity to resolve the matter through a ""voluntary resolution agreement."" The state goal is ""to ensure immediate remediation of these issues and related reforms to prevent the recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and abuse.""
Unlike Harvard and Columbia – which have both clashed with the Trump administration over anti-Israel demonstrations in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks – George Washington University is a private institution. However, due to its location in the nation's capital, federal agencies and global embassies, George Washington University is more exposed to federal oversight and political influence.
The DOJ announcement comes a day after President Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the D.C. police department, citing rampant violent crime in the nation's capital.
The federal civil rights investigation found GWU students and faculty ""were subjected to a hostile educational environment that was objectively offensive, severe, and pervasive,"" Dhillon wrote. ""The antisemitic, hate-based misconduct by GWU students directed at Jewish GWU students, faculty, and employees was, in a word, shocking. The behavior was demonstrably abhorrent, immoral, and, most importantly, illegal.""
During final exams and graduation ceremonies in April and May 2024, Dhillon said, members of the university community engaged in ""antisemitic, disruptive protests that included the establishment of an ‘encampment’ in GWU's University Yard.""
The DOJ said the university received ""no less than eight complaints"" during that timeframe alleging that demonstrators were discriminating against Jewish and Israeli students. Jewish students, parents and alumni also contacted university leadership to voice ""reasonable fears for their safety"" as protesters continued their anti-Israel campus encampment. The DOJ also received reports of antisemitic discrimination at George Washington University's campus.
TRUMP RAMPS UP HEAT ON HARVARD: HERE ARE 5 REASONS FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S OWN INVESTIGATION
""The purpose of the agitators' efforts was to frighten, intimidate, and deny Jewish, Israeli, and American-Israeli students free and unfettered access to GWU's educational environment,"" Dhillon wrote. ""This is the definition of hostility and a ‘hostile environment’.""
The investigation also found ""numerous incidents"" of Jewish students being harassed, abused, intimidated and assaulted by protesters,"" Dhillon wrote. ""To be clear, Jewish students were afraid to attend class, to be observed, or, worse, to be ‘caught’ and perhaps physically beaten on GWU's campus.""
Dhillon cited one Jewish student who described being ""surrounded, harassed, threatened, and then ordered to leave the area immediately by antisemitic protesters after exiting the Law School, which is adjacent to University Yard."" Her letter said GWU's Assistant Dean of Students instructed the Jewish student to leave because his presence was ""antagonizing and provoking the crowd.""
The assistant attorney general said other Jewish students provided similar accounts of harassment and intimidation by protesters when they tried to cross the campus through University Yard.
""Protesters surrounded them, yelled antisemitic slurs in their faces, and forced them to flee,"" Dhillon wrote. ""A Jewish student who quietly held up an Israeli flag on University Yard was confronted and surrounded by protesters with their arms linked together for the purpose of restricting the Jewish student's movements.""
Throughout the encounter, Dhillon said, the protesters shouted slurs and a university police officer standing nearby ""did nothing to prevent or intervene in the incident and instead told the student to leave University Yard for his own safety.""
Dhillon said another Jewish student who stood holding an Israeli flag across the street from the encampment was harassed by protesters who screamed ""F--- you, Zionist go die,"" ""there is only one solution, Intifada revolution,"" ""Hamas are freedom fighters,"" and ""Zionists go to hell!""

The Trump administration on Tuesday shredded George Washington University as ""deliberately indifferent"" to what the Department of Justice considers a ""hostile educational environment for Jewish, American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty.""
The DOJ announced that its Civil Rights Division has concluded its investigation into ""incidents of antisemitic discrimination and harassment of Jewish and Israeli students"" and found the Washington, D.C.-based university violated federal civil rights law.
""Every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,"" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. ""No one is above the law, and universities that promulgate antisemitic discrimination will face legal consequences.""
In a letter to George Washington University President Ellen Granberg, Dhillon said the DOJ finds that ""despite actual notice of the abuses occurring on its campus, GWU was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its students and faculty, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."" The DOJ is moving to enforcement and is seeking ""immediate remediation.""
TRUMP BRANDS HARVARD 'ANTISEMITIC' AND A 'THREAT TO DEMOCRACY' AMID FUNDING BATTLE
The Justice Department, which provides direct federal financial assistance to GWU, said it was offering the university an opportunity to resolve the matter through a ""voluntary resolution agreement."" The state goal is ""to ensure immediate remediation of these issues and related reforms to prevent the recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and abuse.""
Unlike Harvard and Columbia – which have both clashed with the Trump administration over anti-Israel demonstrations in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks – George Washington University is a private institution. However, due to its location in the nation's capital, federal agencies and global embassies, George Washington University is more exposed to federal oversight and political influence.
The DOJ announcement comes a day after President Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the D.C. police department, citing rampant violent crime in the nation's capital.
The federal civil rights investigation found GWU students and faculty ""were subjected to a hostile educational environment that was objectively offensive, severe, and pervasive,"" Dhillon wrote. ""The antisemitic, hate-based misconduct by GWU students directed at Jewish GWU students, faculty, and employees was, in a word, shocking. The behavior was demonstrably abhorrent, immoral, and, most importantly, illegal.""
During final exams and graduation ceremonies in April and May 2024, Dhillon said, members of the university community engaged in ""antisemitic, disruptive protests that included the establishment of an ‘encampment’ in GWU's University Yard.""
The DOJ said the university received ""no less than eight complaints"" during that timeframe alleging that demonstrators were discriminating against Jewish and Israeli students. Jewish students, parents and alumni also contacted university leadership to voice ""reasonable fears for their safety"" as protesters continued their anti-Israel campus encampment. The DOJ also received reports of antisemitic discrimination at George Washington University's campus.
TRUMP RAMPS UP HEAT ON HARVARD: HERE ARE 5 REASONS FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S OWN INVESTIGATION
""The purpose of the agitators' efforts was to frighten, intimidate, and deny Jewish, Israeli, and American-Israeli students free and unfettered access to GWU's educational environment,"" Dhillon wrote. ""This is the definition of hostility and a ‘hostile environment’.""
The investigation also found ""numerous incidents"" of Jewish students being harassed, abused, intimidated and assaulted by protesters,"" Dhillon wrote. ""To be clear, Jewish students were afraid to attend class, to be observed, or, worse, to be ‘caught’ and perhaps physically beaten on GWU's campus.""
Dhillon cited one Jewish student who described being ""surrounded, harassed, threatened, and then ordered to leave the area immediately by antisemitic protesters after exiting the Law School, which is adjacent to University Yard."" Her letter said GWU's Assistant Dean of Students instructed the Jewish student to leave because his presence was ""antagonizing and provoking the crowd.""
The assistant attorney general said other Jewish students provided similar accounts of harassment and intimidation by protesters when they tried to cross the campus through University Yard.
""Protesters surrounded them, yelled antisemitic slurs in their faces, and forced them to flee,"" Dhillon wrote. ""A Jewish student who quietly held up an Israeli flag on University Yard was confronted and surrounded by protesters with their arms linked together for the purpose of restricting the Jewish student's movements.""
Throughout the encounter, Dhillon said, the protesters shouted slurs and a university police officer standing nearby ""did nothing to prevent or intervene in the incident and instead told the student to leave University Yard for his own safety.""
Dhillon said another Jewish student who stood holding an Israeli flag across the street from the encampment was harassed by protesters who screamed ""F--- you, Zionist go die,"" ""there is only one solution, Intifada revolution,"" ""Hamas are freedom fighters,"" and ""Zionists go to hell!"" She said a university police officer also told that student to leave the area.

Geoff Bennett:
We are learning more about last week's shooting at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, which has shaken many in the field of public health.
Authorities say the 32-year-old gunman fired nearly 200 rounds at six buildings on the CDC campus. One police officer was killed, and the suspect was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities also say the gunman believed the COVID-19 vaccine was to blame for his mental health problems, including depression and thoughts of suicide.
In the days since, CDC staff have spoken out about what they describe as dangerous rhetoric and rising hostility.
Joining us now to discuss this isDr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health and professor of emergency medicine.
Thank you for joining us.
Dr. Megan Ranney, Yale University:
My pleasure. Thanks so much for having me on tonight.
We have seen reporting that many CDC staff are dreading returning to work, many still deeply shaken after last week's shooting.
From what you're hearing, what's the general mood among health care and public health workers right now?
Dr. Megan Ranney:
Well, I have spent the weekend talking to friends and colleagues within the CDC, within state and local public health departments, as well as within health care across the country.
And I will say the mood is one of both fear and frustration or maybe even anger, fear because folks were shot at. And it is by the grace of God that only one person died on Friday evening. Frustration and anger because it's felt by many that this was almost inevitable, that at some point the violent rhetoric that is experienced online or sometimes that some of us have experienced in person being yelled at us was eventually going to turn into actual physical threats.
On that point, at a press conference this morning, the Georgia Bureau of Investigations at a search of the shooter's home turned up documents expressing what they described as discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations.
Tell me more about how this rhetoric, the misinformation about vaccines have played a role in this tragedy and have complicated the work that you and your colleagues do.
Yes, so it's a little bit early to know all the details about the shooter and the shooting.
But what is absolutely true is that there — instead of there being discussion or debate about science, a reasoned evaluation of the relative risks and benefits of interventions, instead, what's happening is that an entire group of people, scientists, public health workers, health care professionals, are being dehumanized and even demonized and blamed for things that are often not their fault and may not even be the fault of, say, for example, the vaccine.
We have seen a rise in that violent rhetoric online over the past few years, but that coupling of I am in pain and suffering to I must take that out on individuals who are working in health-related fields, that is relatively new and quite scary and I think reflected in the shooting.
Secretary Kennedy, known for his anti-vaccine views, he visited the CDC yesterday, issued a statement condemning the shootings. The new CDC director did essentially the same thing.
Do gestures like that meaningfully change the tone and climate?
I think it's too early to say.
I think that gestures matter, right, after a mass shooting. Having those gestures after things like — if I go back to something like 9/11, right, which was a terrorist attack, and, in many ways, this was a terrorist attack, those gestures, those symbolic acts do make a difference, understanding that just because only one person died it does not mean that this was not a severe attack with severe consequences both in the short and long term for the psychological well-being of people that work in this field, as well as potentially for their physical health.
Again, those gestures matter. But gestures alone are not enough. We also need to think about, how do we actually ensure the physical safety of people working in public health and health care? How do we have an emergency response system that is better? I have heard stories from people who were at work on Friday night who only knew that there was an ongoing shooting because friends or colleagues texted them.
They otherwise would have walked out into the line of fire. So, thinking about that physical safety, thinking about psychological safety, how do we support people, the survivors of this shooting, who again may not have sustained physical wounds, but have certainly sustained psychological wounds.
And, of course, if we are worried that someone is in crisis and has been radicalized and is in danger of hurting themselves or others, how do we take steps to make sure that person does not hurt themselves or others, does not have access to a firearm in that moment of crisis?
Here's what Secretary Kennedy had to say last night on Scripps News when he was asked about disinformation and preventing something like this from happening again.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary: We don't know enough about what the motive was of this individual, but people can ask questions without being penalized.
And there was attacks on the NFL the other day for — by a shooter who was concerned that he got a brain injury from playing football. And nobody blamed The New York Times for spreading that disinformation that football can cause injuries.
How do you see the comparison he's making there?
There are two parts.
The first is, of course, we want people to be able to ask questions and get trustworthy answers. There are times where we don't know the answer yet. We're still researching or exploring, and we should be honest when that is so. But sometimes we do know the answers, and then we need to share that closest approximation of the truth that we have.
So I don't think anyone's saying that we shouldn't be asking questions. What we are saying is that the asking questions should not be accompanied by violent rhetoric that implies that public health professionals, scientists, or health care providers are somehow out to cause harm or deserve to be hurt or killed.
The other side of that, of course, is to acknowledge that football does cause injury, including CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We know that. That's why we have changed helmets and padding and all kinds of things. Was it football that caused that man's mental illness that led him to then go to New York City and shoot up an office building?
That link is unclear. And so I think, in this case, can vaccines or certain vaccines sometimes cause side effects? Of course. Is the risk greater than the benefit? No. For the vast majority of vaccines, certainly all that are FDA approved, we know that they are the safest and most effective way to prevent illness.
And, finally, even if this person did experience a side effect from the COVID vaccine, which does sometimes rarely happen, was that the cause of his mental illness? We don't know, anymore than we know whether or not it was CTE that caused the man to shoot in New York.
But what we do know is that the answer to being sick physically or mentally should never be violence against another human.
Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health and professor of emergency medicine, thank you for joining us.
Thank you.
And we should mention the CDC started promoting a fund-raiser to help the family of the officer who was killed in the line of duty, DeKalb County Officer David Rose.
He was married with two children, and his wife is expecting their third child. Secretary Kennedy visited the police department on Monday and met with his widow.

But what is absolutely true is that there — instead of there being discussion or debate about science, a reasoned evaluation of the relative risks and benefits of interventions, instead, what's happening is that an entire group of people, scientists, public health workers, health care professionals, are being dehumanized and even demonized and blamed for things that are often not their fault and may not even be the fault of, say, for example, the vaccine.
We have seen a rise in that violent rhetoric online over the past few years, but that coupling of I am in pain and suffering to I must take that out on individuals who are working in health-related fields, that is relatively new and quite scary and I think reflected in the shooting.
Secretary Kennedy, known for his anti-vaccine views, he visited the CDC yesterday, issued a statement condemning the shootings. The new CDC director did essentially the same thing.
Do gestures like that meaningfully change the tone and climate?
I think it's too early to say.
I think that gestures matter, right, after a mass shooting. Having those gestures after things like — if I go back to something like 9/11, right, which was a terrorist attack, and, in many ways, this was a terrorist attack, those gestures, those symbolic acts do make a difference, understanding that just because only one person died it does not mean that this was not a severe attack with severe consequences both in the short and long term for the psychological well-being of people that work in this field, as well as potentially for their physical health.
Again, those gestures matter. But gestures alone are not enough. We also need to think about, how do we actually ensure the physical safety of people working in public health and health care? How do we have an emergency response system that is better? I have heard stories from people who were at work on Friday night who only knew that there was an ongoing shooting because friends or colleagues texted them.
They otherwise would have walked out into the line of fire. So, thinking about that physical safety, thinking about psychological safety, how do we support people, the survivors of this shooting, who again may not have sustained physical wounds, but have certainly sustained psychological wounds.
And, of course, if we are worried that someone is in crisis and has been radicalized and is in danger of hurting themselves or others, how do we take steps to make sure that person does not hurt themselves or others, does not have access to a firearm in that moment of crisis?
Here's what Secretary Kennedy had to say last night on Scripps News when he was asked about disinformation and preventing something like this from happening again.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary: We don't know enough about what the motive was of this individual, but people can ask questions without being penalized.
And there was attacks on the NFL the other day for — by a shooter who was concerned that he got a brain injury from playing football. And nobody blamed The New York Times for spreading that disinformation that football can cause injuries.
How do you see the comparison he's making there?
There are two parts.
The first is, of course, we want people to be able to ask questions and get trustworthy answers. There are times where we don't know the answer yet. We're still researching or exploring, and we should be honest when that is so. But sometimes we do know the answers, and then we need to share that closest approximation of the truth that we have.
So I don't think anyone's saying that we shouldn't be asking questions. What we are saying is that the asking questions should not be accompanied by violent rhetoric that implies that public health professionals, scientists, or health care providers are somehow out to cause harm or deserve to be hurt or killed.
The other side of that, of course, is to acknowledge that football does cause injury, including CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We know that. That's why we have changed helmets and padding and all kinds of things. Was it football that caused that man's mental illness that led him to then go to New York City and shoot up an office building?
That link is unclear. And so I think, in this case, can vaccines or certain vaccines sometimes cause side effects? Of course. Is the risk greater than the benefit? No. For the vast majority of vaccines, certainly all that are FDA approved, we know that they are the safest and most effective way to prevent illness.
And, finally, even if this person did experience a side effect from the COVID vaccine, which does sometimes rarely happen, was that the cause of his mental illness? We don't know, anymore than we know whether or not it was CTE that caused the man to shoot in New York.
But what we do know is that the answer to being sick physically or mentally should never be violence against another human.
Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health and professor of emergency medicine, thank you for joining us.
Thank you.
And we should mention the CDC started promoting a fund-raiser to help the family of the officer who was killed in the line of duty, DeKalb County Officer David Rose.
He was married with two children, and his wife is expecting their third child. Secretary Kennedy visited the police department on Monday and met with his widow.

Geoff Bennett:
We are learning more about last week's shooting at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, which has shaken many in the field of public health.
Authorities say the 32-year-old gunman fired nearly 200 rounds at six buildings on the CDC campus. One police officer was killed, and the suspect was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities also say the gunman believed the COVID-19 vaccine was to blame for his mental health problems, including depression and thoughts of suicide.
In the days since, CDC staff have spoken out about what they describe as dangerous rhetoric and rising hostility.
Joining us now to discuss this isDr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health and professor of emergency medicine.
Thank you for joining us.
Dr. Megan Ranney, Yale University:
My pleasure. Thanks so much for having me on tonight.
We have seen reporting that many CDC staff are dreading returning to work, many still deeply shaken after last week's shooting.
From what you're hearing, what's the general mood among health care and public health workers right now?
Dr. Megan Ranney:
Well, I have spent the weekend talking to friends and colleagues within the CDC, within state and local public health departments, as well as within health care across the country.
And I will say the mood is one of both fear and frustration or maybe even anger, fear because folks were shot at. And it is by the grace of God that only one person died on Friday evening. Frustration and anger because it's felt by many that this was almost inevitable, that at some point the violent rhetoric that is experienced online or sometimes that some of us have experienced in person being yelled at us was eventually going to turn into actual physical threats.
On that point, at a press conference this morning, the Georgia Bureau of Investigations at a search of the shooter's home turned up documents expressing what they described as discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations.
Tell me more about how this rhetoric, the misinformation about vaccines have played a role in this tragedy and have complicated the work that you and your colleagues do.
Yes, so it's a little bit early to know all the details about the shooter and the shooting.

The shooting at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta has shaken many in the field of public health. Authorities say the 32-year-old gunman fired nearly 200 rounds at six buildings on the CDC campus and believed COVID-19 vaccines were to blame for his mental health problems. Geoff Bennett discussed rhetoric and hostility against health professionals with Dr. Megan Ranney.

Geoff Bennett:
We are learning more about last week's shooting at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, which has shaken many in the field of public health.
Authorities say the 32-year-old gunman fired nearly 200 rounds at six buildings on the CDC campus. One police officer was killed, and the suspect was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities also say the gunman believed the COVID-19 vaccine was to blame for his mental health problems, including depression and thoughts of suicide.
In the days since, CDC staff have spoken out about what they describe as dangerous rhetoric and rising hostility.
Joining us now to discuss this isDr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health and professor of emergency medicine.
Thank you for joining us.
Dr. Megan Ranney, Yale University:
My pleasure. Thanks so much for having me on tonight.
We have seen reporting that many CDC staff are dreading returning to work, many still deeply shaken after last week's shooting.
From what you're hearing, what's the general mood among health care and public health workers right now?
Dr. Megan Ranney:
Well, I have spent the weekend talking to friends and colleagues within the CDC, within state and local public health departments, as well as within health care across the country.
And I will say the mood is one of both fear and frustration or maybe even anger, fear because folks were shot at. And it is by the grace of God that only one person died on Friday evening. Frustration and anger because it's felt by many that this was almost inevitable, that at some point the violent rhetoric that is experienced online or sometimes that some of us have experienced in person being yelled at us was eventually going to turn into actual physical threats.
On that point, at a press conference this morning, the Georgia Bureau of Investigations at a search of the shooter's home turned up documents expressing what they described as discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations.
Tell me more about how this rhetoric, the misinformation about vaccines have played a role in this tragedy and have complicated the work that you and your colleagues do.
Yes, so it's a little bit early to know all the details about the shooter and the shooting.
But what is absolutely true is that there — instead of there being discussion or debate about science, a reasoned evaluation of the relative risks and benefits of interventions, instead, what's happening is that an entire group of people, scientists, public health workers, health care professionals, are being dehumanized and even demonized and blamed for things that are often not their fault and may not even be the fault of, say, for example, the vaccine.
We have seen a rise in that violent rhetoric online over the past few years, but that coupling of I am in pain and suffering to I must take that out on individuals who are working in health-related fields, that is relatively new and quite scary and I think reflected in the shooting.
Secretary Kennedy, known for his anti-vaccine views, he visited the CDC yesterday, issued a statement condemning the shootings. The new CDC director did essentially the same thing.
Do gestures like that meaningfully change the tone and climate?
I think it's too early to say.
I think that gestures matter, right, after a mass shooting. Having those gestures after things like — if I go back to something like 9/11, right, which was a terrorist attack, and, in many ways, this was a terrorist attack, those gestures, those symbolic acts do make a difference, understanding that just because only one person died it does not mean that this was not a severe attack with severe consequences both in the short and long term for the psychological well-being of people that work in this field, as well as potentially for their physical health.
Again, those gestures matter. But gestures alone are not enough. We also need to think about, how do we actually ensure the physical safety of people working in public health and health care? How do we have an emergency response system that is better? I have heard stories from people who were at work on Friday night who only knew that there was an ongoing shooting because friends or colleagues texted them.
They otherwise would have walked out into the line of fire. So, thinking about that physical safety, thinking about psychological safety, how do we support people, the survivors of this shooting, who again may not have sustained physical wounds, but have certainly sustained psychological wounds.
And, of course, if we are worried that someone is in crisis and has been radicalized and is in danger of hurting themselves or others, how do we take steps to make sure that person does not hurt themselves or others, does not have access to a firearm in that moment of crisis?
Here's what Secretary Kennedy had to say last night on Scripps News when he was asked about disinformation and preventing something like this from happening again.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary: We don't know enough about what the motive was of this individual, but people can ask questions without being penalized.
And there was attacks on the NFL the other day for — by a shooter who was concerned that he got a brain injury from playing football. And nobody blamed The New York Times for spreading that disinformation that football can cause injuries.
How do you see the comparison he's making there?
There are two parts.
The first is, of course, we want people to be able to ask questions and get trustworthy answers. There are times where we don't know the answer yet. We're still researching or exploring, and we should be honest when that is so. But sometimes we do know the answers, and then we need to share that closest approximation of the truth that we have.
So I don't think anyone's saying that we shouldn't be asking questions. What we are saying is that the asking questions should not be accompanied by violent rhetoric that implies that public health professionals, scientists, or health care providers are somehow out to cause harm or deserve to be hurt or killed.
The other side of that, of course, is to acknowledge that football does cause injury, including CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We know that. That's why we have changed helmets and padding and all kinds of things. Was it football that caused that man's mental illness that led him to then go to New York City and shoot up an office building?
That link is unclear. And so I think, in this case, can vaccines or certain vaccines sometimes cause side effects? Of course. Is the risk greater than the benefit? No. For the vast majority of vaccines, certainly all that are FDA approved, we know that they are the safest and most effective way to prevent illness.
And, finally, even if this person did experience a side effect from the COVID vaccine, which does sometimes rarely happen, was that the cause of his mental illness? We don't know, anymore than we know whether or not it was CTE that caused the man to shoot in New York.
But what we do know is that the answer to being sick physically or mentally should never be violence against another human.
Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health and professor of emergency medicine, thank you for joining us.
Thank you.
And we should mention the CDC started promoting a fund-raiser to help the family of the officer who was killed in the line of duty, DeKalb County Officer David Rose.
He was married with two children, and his wife is expecting their third child. Secretary Kennedy visited the police department on Monday and met with his widow.

A federal judge says he won't block an Alabama law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public schools
A federal judge on Wednesday declined a request to block an Alabama law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public schools and the teaching of what Republican lawmakers dubbed “divisive concepts” related to race and gender.
U.S. District Judge David Proctor wrote that University of Alabama students and professors who filed a lawsuit challenging the law as unconstitutional did not meet the legal burden required for a preliminary injunction, which he called “an extraordinary and drastic remedy.” The civil lawsuit challenging the statute will go forward, but the law will remain in place while it does.
The Alabama measure, which took effect Oct. 1, is part of a wave of proposals from Republican lawmakers across the country taking aim at DEI programs on college campuses.
The Alabama law prohibits public schools from funding or sponsoring any DEI program. It also prohibits schools from requiring students to assent to eight “divisive concepts” including that fault, blame or bias should be assigned to a race or sex or that any person should acknowledge a sense of guilt, complicity or a need to apologize because of their race, sex or national origin.
Six professors and students at the University of Alabama filed a lawsuit arguing that the law violates the First Amendment by placing viewpoint-based restrictions on what educators teach. The lawsuit also said the law unconstitutionally targets Black students because it limits programs that benefit them.
Professors said they had altered what they taught in their classes in the wake of the law and the university’s guidance about it. A professor said he reduced coverage of the Black Power movement, the Black Lives Matter movement and the white nationalist movement in the wake of the law. Another said five students had made complaints suggesting that the interdisciplinary honors program she administered had potential conflicts with the new legislation.
The university also shuttered designated spaces for the Black Student Union and a resource center for LGBTQ+ students in the wake of the law.
Proctor wrote that a professor’s academic freedom does not override a university’s decisions about the content of classroom instruction.
“Importantly, SB 129 does not banish all teaching or discussion of these concepts from campus or, for that matter, even from the classroom,"" Proctor wrote. “To the contrary, it expressly permits classroom instruction that includes ‘discussion’ of the listed concepts so long as the ‘instruction is given in an objective manner without endorsement’ of the concepts.”
He added that the law appears to give notice about what is a violation. For example, he said a professor could not “indoctrinate” students to believe that racial health disparities were the fault of one race of people but could still discuss the role of racism in health disparities.
“If, alternatively, the theory she teaches about is that there is empirical evidence that racism may be a cause for health disparities, or if she frames such teaching as merely a theory, she would not violate SB 129,” Proctor wrote.
Will Creeley, legal director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonpartisan First Amendment group, criticized the decision as dangerous and at odds with decades of Supreme Court precedent on academic freedom.
“Academic freedom protects the search for knowledge and truth from political pressure. That’s the whole point,"" Creeley wrote in a statement. “Faculty are hired to share and hone their expertise in a given field of study, not to read from a government script.”

“If, alternatively, the theory she teaches about is that there is empirical evidence that racism may be a cause for health disparities, or if she frames such teaching as merely a theory, she would not violate SB 129,” Proctor wrote.
Will Creeley, legal director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonpartisan First Amendment group, criticized the decision as dangerous and at odds with decades of Supreme Court precedent on academic freedom.
“Academic freedom protects the search for knowledge and truth from political pressure. That’s the whole point,"" Creeley wrote in a statement. “Faculty are hired to share and hone their expertise in a given field of study, not to read from a government script.”

A team of researchers gave AI bots their own social platform — and it turned toxic.
The chatbots split into cliques and boosted the most partisan voices. A handful of ""influencers"" also quickly dominated the conversation, according to a study published last Tuesday by researchers at the University of Amsterdam.
The researchers built a minimal social network with no ads, no recommended posts, and no algorithm deciding what users see. They then populated it with 500 chatbots powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o mini, each assigned a distinct persona, including specific political leanings.
The personas were drawn from the American National Election Studies dataset, and reflected ""real-world distributions of age, gender, income, education, partisanship, ideology, religion, and personal interests,"" the researchers said.
They added that the experiment was replicated with Llama-3.2-8B and DeepSeek-R1 modelling the users and resulted in ""the same qualitative patterns.""
The study was led by Dr. Petter Törnberg, an assistant professor in computational social science at the University of Amsterdam, and Maik Larooij, a research engineer at the university.
The researchers, OpenAI, Meta, and DeepSeek, did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Even without algorithms and humans, the same toxic patterns emerged
Over the course of five separate experiments — each running over 10,000 actions — the bots were free to post, follow, and repost. What happened looked a lot like real-world social media.
The study found that the chatbots gravitated toward others who shared their political beliefs, forming tight echo chambers. Partisan voices gained an outsize share of attention, with the most extreme posts attracting the most followers and reposts. Over time, a small group of bots came to dominate the conversation, much like the influencer-heavy dynamics seen on platforms like X and Instagram.
The researchers also tested six interventions meant to break the polarization loop, including a chronological feed, downranking viral content, hiding follower counts, hiding user bios, and amplifying opposing views.
None solved the problem. ""While several showed moderate positive effects, none fully addressed the core pathologies, and improvements in one dimension often came at the cost of worsening another,"" the researchers said.
""Our findings challenge the common view that social media's dysfunctions are primarily the result of algorithmic curation,"" the authors wrote.
""Instead, these problems may be rooted in the very architecture of social media platforms: networks that grow through emotionally reactive sharing,"" they added.
The researchers said their work is among the first to use AI to help advance social science theory.
While LLM-based agents can provide ""rich representations of human behavior"" for studying social dynamics, the researchers cautioned that they remain ""black boxes"" and carry ""risks of embedded bias.""
Not the first AI social network experiment
The study isn't the first time researchers have tested what happens when AI bots populate an online space.
In 2023, Business Insider reported on an experiment also led by Törnberg, in which 500 chatbots read the news and discussed it on a simulated social media platform.
That project used ChatGPT-3.5 to build bots for a very specific purpose: to explore how to design a less polarized, less toxic version of current social networks. The researchers created a social network model in a lab to test whether it was possible to encourage cross-partisan interaction without fueling hostility.
""Is there a way to promote interaction across the partisan divide without driving toxicity and incivility?"" Törnberg asked at the time.
In both studies, chatbots served as stand-ins for people, with researchers tracking their interactions to better understand how users might behave online.

The 2-1 vote from the Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals grants access to data stored at the Treasury Department, Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
In June, the Supreme Court cleared the way for DOGE to access Social Security systems containing personal data on millions of Americans. The high court halted an order from a judge in Maryland restricting the team’s access to the Social Security Administration under federal privacy laws.
The unions involved in the lawsuit include the American Federation of Teachers and the National Federation of Federal Employees.
""Plaintiffs alleged that they or their members have personally identifiable information housed in the agencies’ databases and claimed that disclosing the information to the agencies' DOGE-affiliated employees would violate both the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act ('APA'),"" the ruling reads.
According to the 4th Circuit, the unions did not show how they would be injured by DOGE accessing agencies' computer systems.
Judge Robert B. King dissented and seemingly agreed with concerns about the lack of public information in DOGE's operation.
“Just in early February 2025, the district court found itself confronted with this matter of immense urgency and import: the president’s new Department of Government Efficiency, or ‘DOGE,’ had been accorded sudden, unfettered, unprecedented and apparently unnecessary access to highly sensitive personal information belonging to millions of Americans,” he wrote.
The Trump administration last week formally ended the program requiring federal workers to document, weekly, five accomplishments launched by Elon Musk when he was the director of DOGE.
The program was part of the DOGE initiative to cut down the size of the federal workforce, creating tensions between the government and agency heads who were blindsided by the order.

Appeals court sides with Trump administration in fight over DOGE access
A federal appeals court says a lower court was wrong to block billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing people’s private data at the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management.
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-1 decision Tuesday that the lower court’s preliminary injunction ruling “miscalculated” the likelihood that the plaintiffs’ lawsuit would succeed. The appeals court had already put the block on hold, so Tuesday’s ruling will not have any practical effect.
Led by the American Federation of Teachers, the plaintiffs alleged the Trump administration violated federal privacy law when it gave DOGE access to systems with personal information on tens of millions of Americans without their consent.
An email to a spokesperson for the union was not immediately returned.
The appeals court said the privacy law at issue “does not prohibit sharing information with those whose jobs give them good reason to access it.”
Mexico expels cartel figures wanted by US authorities in deal with Trump
Mexico is expelling 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States in the latest major deal with the Trump administration, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
The cartel leaders and other prominent figures were being flown from Mexico to the U.S. on Tuesday, the person said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the operation that was still ongoing.
It’s the second time in months Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs across the border.
DC residents criticize federal takeover
Residents emphasized reductions in crime in recent years and concerns over the removal of homeless encampments in interviews Tuesday criticizing the federal takeover of the city’s police department.
Jeraod Tyre, who’s lived in the city for 15 years, said “crime has been slowing down lately” and argued that federal troops would only escalate tensions because they don’t have “relationships with the people in the community” like local police do.
Sheiena Taylor, 36, said she’s more fearful as a result of the presence of federal forces in D.C., where she was born and raised.
Taylor said she’s seen federal officers around her home and on the subway and worries about their targeting of young people and people experiencing homelessness.
“Being homeless isn’t a crime,” she said, emphasizing the need for solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime rather than policing.
State Department spokesperson wraps up briefings to take up UN role
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce has conducted her final press briefing after just six months in the job following Trump’s nomination of her to be deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
Bruce thanked Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, her colleagues at the State Department and the press corps for their professionalism as she wrapped up her tenure as the face of the administration’s America First foreign policy.
“You’ve kept me sharp, grounded and on more than a few occasions, laughing,” she said. “The relationship between the spokesperson and the press is a unique one, and I’m grateful that I know all of you.”
Bruce, a former Fox News personality who had no government or foreign policy experience before taking the role, had a somewhat contentious relationship with reporters and had cut back the number of press briefings from four or five per week to just two.
DEA administrator says feds will be ‘embedded’ with DC police
Terry Cole, administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said federal officers will be “embedded with the Metropolitan Police Department” starting Tuesday night.
“You will see federal agents working hand-in-hand on patrol with the Metropolitan Police Department,” he said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. “You will also see an increase of patrol activity in certain sectors to go after the violent criminal offenders that are the drivers of this crime.”
Cole said the city’s police chief has been “very accommodating” and applauded intel sharing between federal forces and local law enforcement.
His remarks continue a tone of cooperation that contrasted with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s initial reactions to the federal takeover of the city’s police department.
Cole did not offer specific details on what will change in the chain of command amid the federal takeover, only saying that the move “brings so much power to allow the police officers to do their job.”
He also blamed the D.C. City Council for not previously empowering city law enforcement, arguing that the federal government is helping rectify “concerning” dynamics for police officers created by the council.
Senior Democrat calls on Republicans to hold confirmation hearing for Trump’s new BLS pick
Sen. Patty Murray, a senior Democrat, is calling for Republicans to hold a confirmation hearing for E.J. Antoni, whom Trump has nominated to lead the agency that compiles the nation’s employment and inflation figures.
Murray in a statement slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, hold a confirmation hearing for him.
Some Senate Republicans were critical after Trump fired the previous director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, and have said they want someone in the job who can reliably compile and report data on the nation’s economy. But they have also mostly gone along with Trump’s Cabinet picks.
Trump’s choice of Antoni, who was the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and often made overtly political arguments, sets up a key test for GOP senators and their willingness to go along with the president.
Philadelphia DA says Trump’s seizure of policing in DC is unjustified
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said during a Tuesday news conference with faith leaders that Trump’s effort to seize policing in Washington D.C. is unjustified and will be resisted if it comes to Pennsylvania’s largest city.
Krasner said crime is actually down in many major cities, including Philadelphia and the nation’s capital. He described Trump’s declaration of federal control of D.C. police, and threat to do so elsewhere, as a “bogus” attempt to assert authority.
“What we have going on in Philadelphia and elsewhere is actually good news, but that’s not the news that Donald Trump needs,” he said.
Krasner’s office said it held the news conference to “reaffirm the city’s commitment to uphold the Constitutional rights of residents and to hold accountable anyone who violates the law.”
He said Trump’s threat to send members of the National Guard to Washington D.C. and other cities could bring chaos in a time of relative peace.
Trump administration cuts down human rights reports
The Trump administration released human rights reports for countries worldwide that eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people and reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights.
The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, also criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.
They offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in countries like Eswatini, South Sudan and Rwanda that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.
South Africa also was singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners, a minority that ran the country’s apartheid government.
US attorney for DC on local crime: ‘There is a whole community that is suffering’
Pirro argued during a Tuesday press briefing that violent crime in the nation’s capital is significant and causing suffering throughout the community.
She displayed poster boards that she said showed teenagers who were shot and killed in D.C. in 2024 and 2025 so far. She said anyone who argues crime is down or an emergency designation is not needed should “talk to the loved ones and the family members of these individuals, all shot and killed long before their time.”
As she backed the Trump administration’s argument for placing the city’s police department under federal control, Pirro pointed to violent crime rates that spiked in the nation’s capital in 2023.
“I don’t need any more statistics,” she said.
A recent Department of Justice report shows that violent crime is down 35% since 2023, returning to the previous trend of decreasing crime that puts the district’s violent crime rate at its lowest in 30 years.
Officials brief the media on the indictment of a Haitian gang leader
U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro and other federal officials briefed the media on Tuesday’s unsealed indictment of Jimmy “Barbecue” Cherizier, whom many consider Haiti’s most powerful gang leader.
The State Department is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information that leads to Cherizier’s arrest or conviction, the officials said.
Pirro said Haiti is a “hotspot” where “incredible violence” is taking place right now.
CDC Director: ‘Misinformation can be dangerous’
Dr. Susan Monarez held her first ‘all-hands’ meeting on Tuesday after her first full week on campus as the CDC’s director was capped by an attack on the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta.
“We know that misinformation can be dangerous. Not only to health, but to those that trust us and those we want to trust,” she told her employees. “In moments like this, we must meet the challenges with rational, evidence based discourse spoken with compassion and understanding. That is how we will lead.”

Health Secretary, after the shooting at CDC, criticizes CDC’s pandemic response
Trump’s Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., refused to directly answer when asked during an interview with Scripps News on Monday what message he had for CDC employees who are worried about the culture of misinformation and skepticism around vaccines.
Although law enforcement officials have made clear the shooter was targeting the public health agency over the COVID-19 vaccine, Kennedy said in the interview that not enough was known about his motives.
He described political violence as “wrong” and said his job is to protect employees.
He went on to criticize the public health agency’s actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“One of the things that we saw during COVID is that the government was overreaching in its efforts to persuade the public to get vaccinated and they were saying things that are not always true,” Kennedy said.
White House not ruling out ‘future plans’ for Trump to travel to Russia
Leavitt said that Trump will be traveling to Alaska on Friday and meeting one-on-one with Putin -- even amid lingering questions about whether Zelenskyy will be involved.
But asked if Trump might then head to Russia -- or go there in the future -- Leavitt was less committal.
“Perhaps there are plans in the future to travel to Russia,” she said.
Business as usual in Chinatown
The intersection of 7th and H street in Chinatown is one of the more high-profile battlegrounds in the effort to bring down crime rates in Washington D.C.
Residents and business owners have long complained about the open drug dealing, aggressive panhandlers and 24/7 marijuana smell around the Metro exit, one block from Capitol One Arena.
Folks on the street corner — none of whom would give their names — said federal law enforcement officers swept through the area Sunday night, but there’s disagreement if it was FBI or DEA or both.
On Tuesday afternoon, the corner was relatively tranquil. But two young men did offer to sell marijuana to a reporter as soon as they were introduced.
Another man, sitting in a wheelchair and rolling a joint, predicted that any crackdown would just temporarily push illegal activity down the block.
“They’re never going to stop crime,” he said. “You know why? Because crime gets people paid.”
White House says monthly jobs report will continue
White House press secretary Leavitt said that the government will continue to issue the monthly jobs report, which includes the nation’s unemployment rate, despite comments by an administration’s nominee that suggested suspending it.
“I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope,” Leavitt said.
On Aug.4., E.J. Antoni, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation, said on Fox News Digital that the agency should pause the issuance of the reports while it works to improve its data collection. Antoni a week later was nominated by Trump to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that compiles the jobs data as well as monthly inflation report.
The jobs report is closely watched by Wall Street and many businesses around the country, and suspending it would be unprecedented.
Trump slammed the last report Aug. 1 after it showed hiring weakened in July and was much lower in May and June than originally reported, then fired the BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer.
Leavitt: DC homeless will face fines or jail if they refuse shelter or treatment
Leavitt says people living in Washington homeless encampments will be offered space in a homeless shelter or treatment for addiction. She says those who refuse will face fines or jail time.
With Trump taking control of law enforcement in the nation’s capital, Leavitt said authorities will enforce anti-homelessness laws that she says have been ignored.
The National Park Service has removed 70 homeless encampments from parks controlled by the federal agency, she said.
“We want to make DC safe and beautiful,” and that requires removing “mentally disturbed individuals” and homeless encampments, Leavitt said in the White House briefing room.

Two top Army leaders made a visit to the Washington, D.C. National Guard armory on Tuesday morning as activated guard members began reporting for duty to support law enforcement in the capital.
An Army spokesman confirmed to The Associated Press that Secretary Driscoll, the Army’s top civilian official, and Gen. James Mingus, the service’s second highest ranking officer, visited the armory this “to visit with Soldiers and leaders.”
“Secretary Driscoll wanted the D.C. National Guard Soldiers to know first-hand that they have support from the very top of the Army and that we have every confidence in their skill, discipline, and professionalism to support our law enforcement partners and accomplish this mission,” Lt. Colonel Jeff Tolbert said in an email.
White House says that Trump is ‘considering’ lawsuit against Fed Chair Jerome Powell
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt expanded on Trump’s social media post indicating that a lawsuit might be forthcoming on the Federal Reserve’s $2.5 billion renovation project.

“The president is considering a lawsuit against the Fed, and I will leave it to him to comment further on it,” Leavitt said.
DC police takeover may last longer than 30 days
The federal takeover of the District of Columbia’s police department could last longer than 30 days.
During a press briefing, White House press secretary Leavitt said that the administration would “reevaluate and reassess and make further decisions” after the 30-day period is over.
The White House would need approval from both House and Senate in order to extend the takeover the police department.
Trump remains “very much engaged” with Ukraine, Europe, Leavitt says

White House calls judge’s ruling on Maxwell grand jury testimony ‘unfortunate’
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says a judge denying the Trump administration’s motion to unseal grand jury testimony from the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell “unfortunate.”
“We think that decision is unfortunate,” Leavitt said, adding that the information should be unsealed because Trump has said he wanted it released.
Those comments came a day after U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer of the Southern District of New York criticized the Department of Justice for using “demonstrably false” reasoning to justify the release of grand jury testimony.
Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prion sentence for sex trafficking and other crimes in connection with Jeffrey Epstein.
Putin meeting is ‘a listening exercise’ for Trump, Leavitt says
Leavitt says Trump’s goal for his meeting with Putin this week is “to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.”
The White House press secretary downplayed the president’s aims for the summit on Friday in Alaska. She described the meeting as “a listening exercise for the president” that he agreed to after Putin requested a meeting.
Leavitt declined to discuss Trump’s conversations with Zelenskyy but said Trump has “deep respect” for all parties.
White House says federal officers arrested 23 in DC
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says approximately 850 federal law enforcement officers were deployed in Washington and made 23 arrests overnight.
Leavitt says the arrests include charges of homicide, gun and drug crimes, reckless driving, fare evasion and drunken driving.Leavitt said six illegal handguns were seized.
“This is only the beginning,” she said, pledging that federal authorities would continue policing in the nation’s capital for a month.
“President Trump will not be deterred by soft on crime democrats and media activists,” Leavitt said.
California Gov. Newsom mimics Trump’s social media style
“THIS IS YOUR SECOND-TO-LAST WARNING!!!” Newsom’s press office wrote Tuesday in a X post urging the president to back off efforts to redraw congressional maps.
California Democrats are planning to introduce new partisan maps on Friday to counter efforts to help GOPs in 2026 in Texas.
“STAND DOWN NOW OR CALIFORNIA WILL COUNTER-STRIKE (LEGALLY!) TO DESTROY YOUR ILLEGAL CROOKED MAPS IN RED STATES,” the post reads.
The new maps in California would still need state lawmakers and voters approval. State Republicans vow to challenge the effort.
Switzerland’s pivotal gold industry is breathing some relief
The Swiss Association of Precious Metals Manufacturers and Traders on Tuesday said it was awaiting a formal decision after Trump wrote “Gold will not be Tariffed!” on his Truth Social platform late Monday.
“President Trump’s statement is an encouraging signal for trade stability,” said Christoph Wild, the president of the association, which counts 15 companies that process and trade in precious metals like gold. “However, only a formal and binding decision will provide the certainty the gold sector and its partners require.”
The Swiss National Bank, citing figures from the Swiss government, in April issued a report saying that gold refineries in Switzerland supply about one-third of refined gold worldwide.
Last year, gold accounted for some 27% of goods trade value from the country, making it Switzerland’s most-traded product — ahead of pharmaceuticals at 22%, the SNB said.
The precious metals association, known as ASFCMP, last week expressed concern following news reports and other indications that the Trump administration might apply whopping 39% U.S. tariffs on Swiss products -- among the highest it has imposed anywhere -- to gold products.
DC mayor emphasizes ‘working collaboratively’ with feds amid Trump takeover
Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser says the city will aim to “make the most of” the increase in federal resources in the city after Trump’s announcement that he’s taking over Washington’s police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard.
Bowser also emphasized that the Metropolitan Police Department will retain its independence, including over hiring and firing, saying “our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, none of that has changed.”
“We have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,” Bowser added after a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
The remarks mark a change in tone from Monday when Bowser called Trump’s executive order “unsettling and unprecedented.”
Pamela Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, spoke about reduced crime in the city and said increased federal resources “will only help us build upon that.”
Bondi called the meeting with Bowser “productive” in a statement on X, adding that the Justice Department will work closely with city government and police.
Republican US Rep. Barry Moore joins the race for Alabama’s open Senate seat
Moore, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, was first elected to Congress in 2020. He has the rare distinction of winning elections in two different congressional districts.
Last year, a federal court ordered Alabama to use a new congressional map, which put Moore’s home outside his own district. Rather than moving to seek his old seat, he opted to challenge his fellow GOP incumbent in a hard-fought primary for the more solidly Republican 1st District.
Now he’s seeking the position being vacated by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who’s running for governor. The rare open Senate seat is expected to draw a number of candidates and Alabama’s Republican attorney general has already entered the race.
A UFC fight at the White House? Dana White says it’s happening as part of deal with Paramount
Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from Trump on his thoughts about the fight company’s new streaming home.
That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House.
Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upward of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence.
“It’s absolutely going to happen,” White told The Associated Press. “Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.”

Trump’s moves toward taking over Washington are unprecedented. Here’s what the law says
Trump took command of the police department and deployed the National Guard under laws and Constitutional powers that give the federal government more sway over the nation’s capital than other cities. The measure still leaves significant power to the president and Congress, though no president has exercised the police powers before.
Here’s a look at what the law says about Trump’s actions:
1. Trump activated the National Guard. The president can still call up the National Guard in Washington. His authority is less clear in Los Angeles, where a legal battle continues over his recent deployment of the National Guard despite the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom.
2. Trump took over the local police. Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows for the president to take over Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. No president has done so before.
3. Trump didn’t specify how long the takeover would last. Congress still has power over things like the budget and laws passed by the city council, but would have to repeal the Home Rule Act to expand federal power in the district.

Mexico is expelling 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States in the latest major deal with the President Donald Trump ’s administration, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
The cartel leaders and other prominent figures were being flown from Mexico to the U.S. on Tuesday, the person said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the operation that was still ongoing.
Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office and Security ministry confirmed the transfers, which were carried out after a promise from the U.S. Justice Department that U.S. officials would not seek the death penalty in any of the cases.
Here's the latest:
Appeals court sides with Trump administration in fight over DOGE access
A federal appeals court says a lower court was wrong to block billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing people’s private data at the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management.
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-1 decision Tuesday that the lower court’s preliminary injunction ruling “miscalculated” the likelihood that the plaintiffs’ lawsuit would succeed. The appeals court had already put the block on hold, so Tuesday’s ruling will not have any practical effect.
Led by the American Federation of Teachers, the plaintiffs alleged the Trump administration violated federal privacy law when it gave DOGE access to systems with personal information on tens of millions of Americans without their consent.
An email to a spokesperson for the union was not immediately returned.
The appeals court said the privacy law at issue “does not prohibit sharing information with those whose jobs give them good reason to access it.”
Mexico expels cartel figures wanted by US authorities in deal with Trump
Mexico is expelling 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States in the latest major deal with the Trump administration, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
The cartel leaders and other prominent figures were being flown from Mexico to the U.S. on Tuesday, the person said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the operation that was still ongoing.
It’s the second time in months Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs across the border.
DC residents criticize federal takeover
Residents emphasized reductions in crime in recent years and concerns over the removal of homeless encampments in interviews Tuesday criticizing the federal takeover of the city’s police department.
Jeraod Tyre, who’s lived in the city for 15 years, said “crime has been slowing down lately” and argued that federal troops would only escalate tensions because they don’t have “relationships with the people in the community” like local police do.
Sheiena Taylor, 36, said she’s more fearful as a result of the presence of federal forces in D.C., where she was born and raised.
Taylor said she’s seen federal officers around her home and on the subway and worries about their targeting of young people and people experiencing homelessness.
“Being homeless isn’t a crime,” she said, emphasizing the need for solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime rather than policing.
State Department spokesperson wraps up briefings to take up UN role
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce has conducted her final press briefing after just six months in the job following Trump’s nomination of her to be deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
Bruce thanked Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, her colleagues at the State Department and the press corps for their professionalism as she wrapped up her tenure as the face of the administration’s America First foreign policy.
“You’ve kept me sharp, grounded and on more than a few occasions, laughing,” she said. “The relationship between the spokesperson and the press is a unique one, and I’m grateful that I know all of you.”
Bruce, a former Fox News personality who had no government or foreign policy experience before taking the role, had a somewhat contentious relationship with reporters and had cut back the number of press briefings from four or five per week to just two.
DEA administrator says feds will be ‘embedded’ with DC police
Terry Cole, administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said federal officers will be “embedded with the Metropolitan Police Department” starting Tuesday night.
“You will see federal agents working hand-in-hand on patrol with the Metropolitan Police Department,” he said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. “You will also see an increase of patrol activity in certain sectors to go after the violent criminal offenders that are the drivers of this crime.”
Cole said the city’s police chief has been “very accommodating” and applauded intel sharing between federal forces and local law enforcement.
His remarks continue a tone of cooperation that contrasted with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s initial reactions to the federal takeover of the city’s police department.
Cole did not offer specific details on what will change in the chain of command amid the federal takeover, only saying that the move “brings so much power to allow the police officers to do their job.”
He also blamed the D.C. City Council for not previously empowering city law enforcement, arguing that the federal government is helping rectify “concerning” dynamics for police officers created by the council.
Senior Democrat calls on Republicans to hold confirmation hearing for Trump’s new BLS pick
Sen. Patty Murray, a senior Democrat, is calling for Republicans to hold a confirmation hearing for E.J. Antoni, whom Trump has nominated to lead the agency that compiles the nation’s employment and inflation figures.
Murray in a statement slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, hold a confirmation hearing for him.
Some Senate Republicans were critical after Trump fired the previous director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, and have said they want someone in the job who can reliably compile and report data on the nation’s economy. But they have also mostly gone along with Trump’s Cabinet picks.
Trump’s choice of Antoni, who was the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and often made overtly political arguments, sets up a key test for GOP senators and their willingness to go along with the president.
Philadelphia DA says Trump’s seizure of policing in DC is unjustified
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said during a Tuesday news conference with faith leaders that Trump’s effort to seize policing in Washington D.C. is unjustified and will be resisted if it comes to Pennsylvania’s largest city.
Krasner said crime is actually down in many major cities, including Philadelphia and the nation’s capital. He described Trump’s declaration of federal control of D.C. police, and threat to do so elsewhere, as a “bogus” attempt to assert authority.
“What we have going on in Philadelphia and elsewhere is actually good news, but that’s not the news that Donald Trump needs,” he said.
Krasner’s office said it held the news conference to “reaffirm the city’s commitment to uphold the Constitutional rights of residents and to hold accountable anyone who violates the law.”
He said Trump’s threat to send members of the National Guard to Washington D.C. and other cities could bring chaos in a time of relative peace.
Trump administration cuts down human rights reports
The Trump administration released human rights reports for countries worldwide that eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people and reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights.
The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, also criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.
They offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in countries like Eswatini, South Sudan and Rwanda that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.
South Africa also was singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners, a minority that ran the country’s apartheid government.
US attorney for DC on local crime: ‘There is a whole community that is suffering’
Pirro argued during a Tuesday press briefing that violent crime in the nation’s capital is significant and causing suffering throughout the community.
She displayed poster boards that she said showed teenagers who were shot and killed in D.C. in 2024 and 2025 so far. She said anyone who argues crime is down or an emergency designation is not needed should “talk to the loved ones and the family members of these individuals, all shot and killed long before their time.”
As she backed the Trump administration’s argument for placing the city’s police department under federal control, Pirro pointed to violent crime rates that spiked in the nation’s capital in 2023.
“I don’t need any more statistics,” she said.
A recent Department of Justice report shows that violent crime is down 35% since 2023, returning to the previous trend of decreasing crime that puts the district’s violent crime rate at its lowest in 30 years.
Officials brief the media on the indictment of a Haitian gang leader
U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro and other federal officials briefed the media on Tuesday’s unsealed indictment of Jimmy “Barbecue” Cherizier, whom many consider Haiti’s most powerful gang leader.
The State Department is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information that leads to Cherizier’s arrest or conviction, the officials said.
Pirro said Haiti is a “hotspot” where “incredible violence” is taking place right now.
CDC Director: ‘Misinformation can be dangerous’
Dr. Susan Monarez held her first ‘all-hands’ meeting on Tuesday after her first full week on campus as the CDC’s director was capped by an attack on the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta.
“We know that misinformation can be dangerous. Not only to health, but to those that trust us and those we want to trust,” she told her employees. “In moments like this, we must meet the challenges with rational, evidence based discourse spoken with compassion and understanding. That is how we will lead.”
Kennedy was a leader in a national anti-vaccine movement before Trump selected him to oversee federal health agencies, and has made false and misleading statements about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 shots and other vaccines
Health Secretary, after the shooting at CDC, criticizes CDC’s pandemic response
Trump’s Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., refused to directly answer when asked during an interview with Scripps News on Monday what message he had for CDC employees who are worried about the culture of misinformation and skepticism around vaccines.
Although law enforcement officials have made clear the shooter was targeting the public health agency over the COVID-19 vaccine, Kennedy said in the interview that not enough was known about his motives.
He described political violence as “wrong” and said his job is to protect employees.
He went on to criticize the public health agency’s actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“One of the things that we saw during COVID is that the government was overreaching in its efforts to persuade the public to get vaccinated and they were saying things that are not always true,” Kennedy said.
White House not ruling out ‘future plans’ for Trump to travel to Russia
Leavitt said that Trump will be traveling to Alaska on Friday and meeting one-on-one with Putin -- even amid lingering questions about whether Zelenskyy will be involved.
But asked if Trump might then head to Russia -- or go there in the future -- Leavitt was less committal.
“Perhaps there are plans in the future to travel to Russia,” she said.
Business as usual in Chinatown
The intersection of 7th and H street in Chinatown is one of the more high-profile battlegrounds in the effort to bring down crime rates in Washington D.C.
Residents and business owners have long complained about the open drug dealing, aggressive panhandlers and 24/7 marijuana smell around the Metro exit, one block from Capitol One Arena.
Folks on the street corner — none of whom would give their names — said federal law enforcement officers swept through the area Sunday night, but there’s disagreement if it was FBI or DEA or both.
On Tuesday afternoon, the corner was relatively tranquil. But two young men did offer to sell marijuana to a reporter as soon as they were introduced.
Another man, sitting in a wheelchair and rolling a joint, predicted that any crackdown would just temporarily push illegal activity down the block.
“They’re never going to stop crime,” he said. “You know why? Because crime gets people paid.”
White House says monthly jobs report will continue
White House press secretary Leavitt said that the government will continue to issue the monthly jobs report, which includes the nation’s unemployment rate, despite comments by an administration’s nominee that suggested suspending it.
“I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope,” Leavitt said.
On Aug.4., E.J. Antoni, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation, said on Fox News Digital that the agency should pause the issuance of the reports while it works to improve its data collection. Antoni a week later was nominated by Trump to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that compiles the jobs data as well as monthly inflation report.
The jobs report is closely watched by Wall Street and many businesses around the country, and suspending it would be unprecedented.
Trump slammed the last report Aug. 1 after it showed hiring weakened in July and was much lower in May and June than originally reported, then fired the BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer.
Leavitt: DC homeless will face fines or jail if they refuse shelter or treatment
Leavitt says people living in Washington homeless encampments will be offered space in a homeless shelter or treatment for addiction. She says those who refuse will face fines or jail time.
With Trump taking control of law enforcement in the nation’s capital, Leavitt said authorities will enforce anti-homelessness laws that she says have been ignored.
The National Park Service has removed 70 homeless encampments from parks controlled by the federal agency, she said.
“We want to make DC safe and beautiful,” and that requires removing “mentally disturbed individuals” and homeless encampments, Leavitt said in the White House briefing room.
Army leaders visit DC National Guard as troops report in
Two top Army leaders made a visit to the Washington, D.C. National Guard armory on Tuesday morning as activated guard members began reporting for duty to support law enforcement in the capital.
An Army spokesman confirmed to The Associated Press that Secretary Driscoll, the Army’s top civilian official, and Gen. James Mingus, the service’s second highest ranking officer, visited the armory this “to visit with Soldiers and leaders.”
“Secretary Driscoll wanted the D.C. National Guard Soldiers to know first-hand that they have support from the very top of the Army and that we have every confidence in their skill, discipline, and professionalism to support our law enforcement partners and accomplish this mission,” Lt. Colonel Jeff Tolbert said in an email.
White House says that Trump is ‘considering’ lawsuit against Fed Chair Jerome Powell
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt expanded on Trump’s social media post indicating that a lawsuit might be forthcoming on the Federal Reserve’s $2.5 billion renovation project.
Leavitt said at the Tuesday news briefing that Trump is weighing whether he as president should sue the U.S. central bank.
“The president is considering a lawsuit against the Fed, and I will leave it to him to comment further on it,” Leavitt said.
DC police takeover may last longer than 30 days
The federal takeover of the District of Columbia’s police department could last longer than 30 days.
During a press briefing, White House press secretary Leavitt said that the administration would “reevaluate and reassess and make further decisions” after the 30-day period is over.
The White House would need approval from both House and Senate in order to extend the takeover the police department.
Trump remains “very much engaged” with Ukraine, Europe, Leavitt says
Leavitt said Trump has “deep respect for all parties involved” in the war between Russia and Ukraine.
She said that the president continues to be “very much engaged” with Ukrainians and allies in Europe.
Trump is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin this Friday in Alaska.
White House calls judge’s ruling on Maxwell grand jury testimony ‘unfortunate’
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says a judge denying the Trump administration’s motion to unseal grand jury testimony from the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell “unfortunate.”
“We think that decision is unfortunate,” Leavitt said, adding that the information should be unsealed because Trump has said he wanted it released.
Those comments came a day after U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer of the Southern District of New York criticized the Department of Justice for using “demonstrably false” reasoning to justify the release of grand jury testimony.
Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prion sentence for sex trafficking and other crimes in connection with Jeffrey Epstein.
Putin meeting is ‘a listening exercise’ for Trump, Leavitt says
Leavitt says Trump’s goal for his meeting with Putin this week is “to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.”
The White House press secretary downplayed the president’s aims for the summit on Friday in Alaska. She described the meeting as “a listening exercise for the president” that he agreed to after Putin requested a meeting.
Leavitt declined to discuss Trump’s conversations with Zelenskyy but said Trump has “deep respect” for all parties.
White House says federal officers arrested 23 in DC
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says approximately 850 federal law enforcement officers were deployed in Washington and made 23 arrests overnight.
Leavitt says the arrests include charges of homicide, gun and drug crimes, reckless driving, fare evasion and drunken driving.Leavitt said six illegal handguns were seized.
“This is only the beginning,” she said, pledging that federal authorities would continue policing in the nation’s capital for a month.
“President Trump will not be deterred by soft on crime democrats and media activists,” Leavitt said.
California Gov. Newsom mimics Trump’s social media style
“THIS IS YOUR SECOND-TO-LAST WARNING!!!” Newsom’s press office wrote Tuesday in a X post urging the president to back off efforts to redraw congressional maps.
California Democrats are planning to introduce new partisan maps on Friday to counter efforts to help GOPs in 2026 in Texas.
“STAND DOWN NOW OR CALIFORNIA WILL COUNTER-STRIKE (LEGALLY!) TO DESTROY YOUR ILLEGAL CROOKED MAPS IN RED STATES,” the post reads.
The new maps in California would still need state lawmakers and voters approval. State Republicans vow to challenge the effort.
Switzerland’s pivotal gold industry is breathing some relief
The Swiss Association of Precious Metals Manufacturers and Traders on Tuesday said it was awaiting a formal decision after Trump wrote “Gold will not be Tariffed!” on his Truth Social platform late Monday.
“President Trump’s statement is an encouraging signal for trade stability,” said Christoph Wild, the president of the association, which counts 15 companies that process and trade in precious metals like gold. “However, only a formal and binding decision will provide the certainty the gold sector and its partners require.”
The Swiss National Bank, citing figures from the Swiss government, in April issued a report saying that gold refineries in Switzerland supply about one-third of refined gold worldwide.
Last year, gold accounted for some 27% of goods trade value from the country, making it Switzerland’s most-traded product — ahead of pharmaceuticals at 22%, the SNB said.
The precious metals association, known as ASFCMP, last week expressed concern following news reports and other indications that the Trump administration might apply whopping 39% U.S. tariffs on Swiss products -- among the highest it has imposed anywhere -- to gold products.
DC mayor emphasizes ‘working collaboratively’ with feds amid Trump takeover
Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser says the city will aim to “make the most of” the increase in federal resources in the city after Trump’s announcement that he’s taking over Washington’s police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard.
Bowser also emphasized that the Metropolitan Police Department will retain its independence, including over hiring and firing, saying “our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, none of that has changed.”
“We have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,” Bowser added after a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
The remarks mark a change in tone from Monday when Bowser called Trump’s executive order “unsettling and unprecedented.”
Pamela Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, spoke about reduced crime in the city and said increased federal resources “will only help us build upon that.”
Bondi called the meeting with Bowser “productive” in a statement on X, adding that the Justice Department will work closely with city government and police.
Republican US Rep. Barry Moore joins the race for Alabama’s open Senate seat
Moore, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, was first elected to Congress in 2020. He has the rare distinction of winning elections in two different congressional districts.
Last year, a federal court ordered Alabama to use a new congressional map, which put Moore’s home outside his own district. Rather than moving to seek his old seat, he opted to challenge his fellow GOP incumbent in a hard-fought primary for the more solidly Republican 1st District.
Now he’s seeking the position being vacated by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who’s running for governor. The rare open Senate seat is expected to draw a number of candidates and Alabama’s Republican attorney general has already entered the race.
A UFC fight at the White House? Dana White says it’s happening as part of deal with Paramount
Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from Trump on his thoughts about the fight company’s new streaming home.
That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House.
Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upward of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence.
“It’s absolutely going to happen,” White told The Associated Press. “Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.”

Trump’s moves toward taking over Washington are unprecedented. Here’s what the law says
Trump took command of the police department and deployed the National Guard under laws and Constitutional powers that give the federal government more sway over the nation’s capital than other cities. The measure still leaves significant power to the president and Congress, though no president has exercised the police powers before.
Here’s a look at what the law says about Trump’s actions:
1. Trump activated the National Guard. The president can still call up the National Guard in Washington. His authority is less clear in Los Angeles, where a legal battle continues over his recent deployment of the National Guard despite the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom.
2. Trump took over the local police. Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows for the president to take over Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. No president has done so before.
3. Trump didn’t specify how long the takeover would last. Congress still has power over things like the budget and laws passed by the city council, but would have to repeal the Home Rule Act to expand federal power in the district.

The cartel leaders and other prominent figures were being flown from Mexico to the U.S. on Tuesday, the person said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the operation that was still ongoing.
Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office and Security ministry confirmed the transfers, which were carried out after a promise from the U.S. Justice Department that U.S. officials would not seek the death penalty in any of the cases.

Appeals court sides with Trump administration in fight over DOGE access
A federal appeals court says a lower court was wrong to block billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing people’s private data at the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management.
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-1 decision Tuesday that the lower court’s preliminary injunction ruling “miscalculated” the likelihood that the plaintiffs’ lawsuit would succeed. The appeals court had already put the block on hold, so Tuesday’s ruling will not have any practical effect.
Led by the American Federation of Teachers, the plaintiffs alleged the Trump administration violated federal privacy law when it gave DOGE access to systems with personal information on tens of millions of Americans without their consent.
An email to a spokesperson for the union was not immediately returned.
The appeals court said the privacy law at issue “does not prohibit sharing information with those whose jobs give them good reason to access it.”
Mexico expels cartel figures wanted by US authorities in deal with Trump
Mexico is expelling 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States in the latest major deal with the Trump administration, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
The cartel leaders and other prominent figures were being flown from Mexico to the U.S. on Tuesday, the person said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the operation that was still ongoing.
It’s the second time in months Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs across the border.
DC residents criticize federal takeover
Residents emphasized reductions in crime in recent years and concerns over the removal of homeless encampments in interviews Tuesday criticizing the federal takeover of the city’s police department.
Jeraod Tyre, who’s lived in the city for 15 years, said “crime has been slowing down lately” and argued that federal troops would only escalate tensions because they don’t have “relationships with the people in the community” like local police do.
Sheiena Taylor, 36, said she’s more fearful as a result of the presence of federal forces in D.C., where she was born and raised.
Taylor said she’s seen federal officers around her home and on the subway and worries about their targeting of young people and people experiencing homelessness.
“Being homeless isn’t a crime,” she said, emphasizing the need for solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime rather than policing.
State Department spokesperson wraps up briefings to take up UN role
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce has conducted her final press briefing after just six months in the job following Trump’s nomination of her to be deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
Bruce thanked Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, her colleagues at the State Department and the press corps for their professionalism as she wrapped up her tenure as the face of the administration’s America First foreign policy.
“You’ve kept me sharp, grounded and on more than a few occasions, laughing,” she said. “The relationship between the spokesperson and the press is a unique one, and I’m grateful that I know all of you.”
Bruce, a former Fox News personality who had no government or foreign policy experience before taking the role, had a somewhat contentious relationship with reporters and had cut back the number of press briefings from four or five per week to just two.
DEA administrator says feds will be ‘embedded’ with DC police
Terry Cole, administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said federal officers will be “embedded with the Metropolitan Police Department” starting Tuesday night.
“You will see federal agents working hand-in-hand on patrol with the Metropolitan Police Department,” he said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. “You will also see an increase of patrol activity in certain sectors to go after the violent criminal offenders that are the drivers of this crime.”
Cole said the city’s police chief has been “very accommodating” and applauded intel sharing between federal forces and local law enforcement.
His remarks continue a tone of cooperation that contrasted with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s initial reactions to the federal takeover of the city’s police department.
Cole did not offer specific details on what will change in the chain of command amid the federal takeover, only saying that the move “brings so much power to allow the police officers to do their job.”
He also blamed the D.C. City Council for not previously empowering city law enforcement, arguing that the federal government is helping rectify “concerning” dynamics for police officers created by the council.
Senior Democrat calls on Republicans to hold confirmation hearing for Trump’s new BLS pick
Sen. Patty Murray, a senior Democrat, is calling for Republicans to hold a confirmation hearing for E.J. Antoni, whom Trump has nominated to lead the agency that compiles the nation’s employment and inflation figures.
Murray in a statement slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, hold a confirmation hearing for him.
Some Senate Republicans were critical after Trump fired the previous director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, and have said they want someone in the job who can reliably compile and report data on the nation’s economy. But they have also mostly gone along with Trump’s Cabinet picks.
Trump’s choice of Antoni, who was the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and often made overtly political arguments, sets up a key test for GOP senators and their willingness to go along with the president.
Philadelphia DA says Trump’s seizure of policing in DC is unjustified
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said during a Tuesday news conference with faith leaders that Trump’s effort to seize policing in Washington D.C. is unjustified and will be resisted if it comes to Pennsylvania’s largest city.
Krasner said crime is actually down in many major cities, including Philadelphia and the nation’s capital. He described Trump’s declaration of federal control of D.C. police, and threat to do so elsewhere, as a “bogus” attempt to assert authority.
“What we have going on in Philadelphia and elsewhere is actually good news, but that’s not the news that Donald Trump needs,” he said.
Krasner’s office said it held the news conference to “reaffirm the city’s commitment to uphold the Constitutional rights of residents and to hold accountable anyone who violates the law.”
He said Trump’s threat to send members of the National Guard to Washington D.C. and other cities could bring chaos in a time of relative peace.
Trump administration cuts down human rights reports
The Trump administration released human rights reports for countries worldwide that eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people and reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights.
The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, also criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.
They offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in countries like Eswatini, South Sudan and Rwanda that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.
South Africa also was singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners, a minority that ran the country’s apartheid government.
US attorney for DC on local crime: ‘There is a whole community that is suffering’
Pirro argued during a Tuesday press briefing that violent crime in the nation’s capital is significant and causing suffering throughout the community.
She displayed poster boards that she said showed teenagers who were shot and killed in D.C. in 2024 and 2025 so far. She said anyone who argues crime is down or an emergency designation is not needed should “talk to the loved ones and the family members of these individuals, all shot and killed long before their time.”
As she backed the Trump administration’s argument for placing the city’s police department under federal control, Pirro pointed to violent crime rates that spiked in the nation’s capital in 2023.
“I don’t need any more statistics,” she said.
A recent Department of Justice report shows that violent crime is down 35% since 2023, returning to the previous trend of decreasing crime that puts the district’s violent crime rate at its lowest in 30 years.
Officials brief the media on the indictment of a Haitian gang leader
U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro and other federal officials briefed the media on Tuesday’s unsealed indictment of Jimmy “Barbecue” Cherizier, whom many consider Haiti’s most powerful gang leader.
The State Department is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information that leads to Cherizier’s arrest or conviction, the officials said.
Pirro said Haiti is a “hotspot” where “incredible violence” is taking place right now.
CDC Director: ‘Misinformation can be dangerous’
Dr. Susan Monarez held her first ‘all-hands’ meeting on Tuesday after her first full week on campus as the CDC’s director was capped by an attack on the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta.
“We know that misinformation can be dangerous. Not only to health, but to those that trust us and those we want to trust,” she told her employees. “In moments like this, we must meet the challenges with rational, evidence based discourse spoken with compassion and understanding. That is how we will lead.”
Kennedy was a leader in a national anti-vaccine movement before Trump selected him to oversee federal health agencies, and has made false and misleading statements about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 shots and other vaccines
Health Secretary, after the shooting at CDC, criticizes CDC’s pandemic response
Trump’s Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., refused to directly answer when asked during an interview with Scripps News on Monday what message he had for CDC employees who are worried about the culture of misinformation and skepticism around vaccines.
Although law enforcement officials have made clear the shooter was targeting the public health agency over the COVID-19 vaccine, Kennedy said in the interview that not enough was known about his motives.
He described political violence as “wrong” and said his job is to protect employees.
He went on to criticize the public health agency’s actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“One of the things that we saw during COVID is that the government was overreaching in its efforts to persuade the public to get vaccinated and they were saying things that are not always true,” Kennedy said.
White House not ruling out ‘future plans’ for Trump to travel to Russia
Leavitt said that Trump will be traveling to Alaska on Friday and meeting one-on-one with Putin -- even amid lingering questions about whether Zelenskyy will be involved.
But asked if Trump might then head to Russia -- or go there in the future -- Leavitt was less committal.
“Perhaps there are plans in the future to travel to Russia,” she said.
Business as usual in Chinatown
The intersection of 7th and H street in Chinatown is one of the more high-profile battlegrounds in the effort to bring down crime rates in Washington D.C.
Residents and business owners have long complained about the open drug dealing, aggressive panhandlers and 24/7 marijuana smell around the Metro exit, one block from Capitol One Arena.
Folks on the street corner — none of whom would give their names — said federal law enforcement officers swept through the area Sunday night, but there’s disagreement if it was FBI or DEA or both.
On Tuesday afternoon, the corner was relatively tranquil. But two young men did offer to sell marijuana to a reporter as soon as they were introduced.
Another man, sitting in a wheelchair and rolling a joint, predicted that any crackdown would just temporarily push illegal activity down the block.
“They’re never going to stop crime,” he said. “You know why? Because crime gets people paid.”
White House says monthly jobs report will continue
White House press secretary Leavitt said that the government will continue to issue the monthly jobs report, which includes the nation’s unemployment rate, despite comments by an administration’s nominee that suggested suspending it.
“I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope,” Leavitt said.
On Aug.4., E.J. Antoni, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation, said on Fox News Digital that the agency should pause the issuance of the reports while it works to improve its data collection. Antoni a week later was nominated by Trump to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that compiles the jobs data as well as monthly inflation report.
The jobs report is closely watched by Wall Street and many businesses around the country, and suspending it would be unprecedented.
Trump slammed the last report Aug. 1 after it showed hiring weakened in July and was much lower in May and June than originally reported, then fired the BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer.
Leavitt: DC homeless will face fines or jail if they refuse shelter or treatment
Leavitt says people living in Washington homeless encampments will be offered space in a homeless shelter or treatment for addiction. She says those who refuse will face fines or jail time.
With Trump taking control of law enforcement in the nation’s capital, Leavitt said authorities will enforce anti-homelessness laws that she says have been ignored.
The National Park Service has removed 70 homeless encampments from parks controlled by the federal agency, she said.
“We want to make DC safe and beautiful,” and that requires removing “mentally disturbed individuals” and homeless encampments, Leavitt said in the White House briefing room.
Army leaders visit DC National Guard as troops report in
Two top Army leaders made a visit to the Washington, D.C. National Guard armory on Tuesday morning as activated guard members began reporting for duty to support law enforcement in the capital.
An Army spokesman confirmed to The Associated Press that Secretary Driscoll, the Army’s top civilian official, and Gen. James Mingus, the service’s second highest ranking officer, visited the armory this “to visit with Soldiers and leaders.”
“Secretary Driscoll wanted the D.C. National Guard Soldiers to know first-hand that they have support from the very top of the Army and that we have every confidence in their skill, discipline, and professionalism to support our law enforcement partners and accomplish this mission,” Lt. Colonel Jeff Tolbert said in an email.
White House says that Trump is ‘considering’ lawsuit against Fed Chair Jerome Powell
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt expanded on Trump’s social media post indicating that a lawsuit might be forthcoming on the Federal Reserve’s $2.5 billion renovation project.
Leavitt said at the Tuesday news briefing that Trump is weighing whether he as president should sue the U.S. central bank.
“The president is considering a lawsuit against the Fed, and I will leave it to him to comment further on it,” Leavitt said.
DC police takeover may last longer than 30 days
The federal takeover of the District of Columbia’s police department could last longer than 30 days.
During a press briefing, White House press secretary Leavitt said that the administration would “reevaluate and reassess and make further decisions” after the 30-day period is over.
The White House would need approval from both House and Senate in order to extend the takeover the police department.
Trump remains “very much engaged” with Ukraine, Europe, Leavitt says
Leavitt said Trump has “deep respect for all parties involved” in the war between Russia and Ukraine.
She said that the president continues to be “very much engaged” with Ukrainians and allies in Europe.
Trump is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin this Friday in Alaska.
White House calls judge’s ruling on Maxwell grand jury testimony ‘unfortunate’
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says a judge denying the Trump administration’s motion to unseal grand jury testimony from the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell “unfortunate.”
“We think that decision is unfortunate,” Leavitt said, adding that the information should be unsealed because Trump has said he wanted it released.
Those comments came a day after U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer of the Southern District of New York criticized the Department of Justice for using “demonstrably false” reasoning to justify the release of grand jury testimony.
Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prion sentence for sex trafficking and other crimes in connection with Jeffrey Epstein.
Putin meeting is ‘a listening exercise’ for Trump, Leavitt says
Leavitt says Trump’s goal for his meeting with Putin this week is “to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.”
The White House press secretary downplayed the president’s aims for the summit on Friday in Alaska. She described the meeting as “a listening exercise for the president” that he agreed to after Putin requested a meeting.
Leavitt declined to discuss Trump’s conversations with Zelenskyy but said Trump has “deep respect” for all parties.
White House says federal officers arrested 23 in DC
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says approximately 850 federal law enforcement officers were deployed in Washington and made 23 arrests overnight.
Leavitt says the arrests include charges of homicide, gun and drug crimes, reckless driving, fare evasion and drunken driving.Leavitt said six illegal handguns were seized.
“This is only the beginning,” she said, pledging that federal authorities would continue policing in the nation’s capital for a month.
“President Trump will not be deterred by soft on crime democrats and media activists,” Leavitt said.
California Gov. Newsom mimics Trump’s social media style
“THIS IS YOUR SECOND-TO-LAST WARNING!!!” Newsom’s press office wrote Tuesday in a X post urging the president to back off efforts to redraw congressional maps.
California Democrats are planning to introduce new partisan maps on Friday to counter efforts to help GOPs in 2026 in Texas.
“STAND DOWN NOW OR CALIFORNIA WILL COUNTER-STRIKE (LEGALLY!) TO DESTROY YOUR ILLEGAL CROOKED MAPS IN RED STATES,” the post reads.
The new maps in California would still need state lawmakers and voters approval. State Republicans vow to challenge the effort.
Switzerland’s pivotal gold industry is breathing some relief
The Swiss Association of Precious Metals Manufacturers and Traders on Tuesday said it was awaiting a formal decision after Trump wrote “Gold will not be Tariffed!” on his Truth Social platform late Monday.
“President Trump’s statement is an encouraging signal for trade stability,” said Christoph Wild, the president of the association, which counts 15 companies that process and trade in precious metals like gold. “However, only a formal and binding decision will provide the certainty the gold sector and its partners require.”

Mexico is expelling 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States in the latest major deal with the President Donald Trump ’s administration, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
The cartel leaders and other prominent figures were being flown from Mexico to the U.S. on Tuesday, the person said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the operation that was still ongoing.
Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office and Security ministry confirmed the transfers, which were carried out after a promise from the U.S. Justice Department that U.S. officials would not seek the death penalty in any of the cases.

Appeals court sides with Trump administration in fight over DOGE access
A federal appeals court says a lower court was wrong to block billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing people’s private data at the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management.
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-1 decision Tuesday that the lower court’s preliminary injunction ruling “miscalculated” the likelihood that the plaintiffs’ lawsuit would succeed. The appeals court had already put the block on hold, so Tuesday’s ruling will not have any practical effect.
Led by the American Federation of Teachers, the plaintiffs alleged the Trump administration violated federal privacy law when it gave DOGE access to systems with personal information on tens of millions of Americans without their consent.
An email to a spokesperson for the union was not immediately returned.
The appeals court said the privacy law at issue “does not prohibit sharing information with those whose jobs give them good reason to access it.”
Mexico expels cartel figures wanted by US authorities in deal with Trump
Mexico is expelling 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States in the latest major deal with the Trump administration, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
The cartel leaders and other prominent figures were being flown from Mexico to the U.S. on Tuesday, the person said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the operation that was still ongoing.
It’s the second time in months Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs across the border.
DC residents criticize federal takeover
Residents emphasized reductions in crime in recent years and concerns over the removal of homeless encampments in interviews Tuesday criticizing the federal takeover of the city’s police department.
Jeraod Tyre, who’s lived in the city for 15 years, said “crime has been slowing down lately” and argued that federal troops would only escalate tensions because they don’t have “relationships with the people in the community” like local police do.
Sheiena Taylor, 36, said she’s more fearful as a result of the presence of federal forces in D.C., where she was born and raised.
Taylor said she’s seen federal officers around her home and on the subway and worries about their targeting of young people and people experiencing homelessness.
“Being homeless isn’t a crime,” she said, emphasizing the need for solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime rather than policing.
State Department spokesperson wraps up briefings to take up UN role
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce has conducted her final press briefing after just six months in the job following Trump’s nomination of her to be deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
Bruce thanked Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, her colleagues at the State Department and the press corps for their professionalism as she wrapped up her tenure as the face of the administration’s America First foreign policy.
“You’ve kept me sharp, grounded and on more than a few occasions, laughing,” she said. “The relationship between the spokesperson and the press is a unique one, and I’m grateful that I know all of you.”
Bruce, a former Fox News personality who had no government or foreign policy experience before taking the role, had a somewhat contentious relationship with reporters and had cut back the number of press briefings from four or five per week to just two.
DEA administrator says feds will be ‘embedded’ with DC police
Terry Cole, administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said federal officers will be “embedded with the Metropolitan Police Department” starting Tuesday night.
“You will see federal agents working hand-in-hand on patrol with the Metropolitan Police Department,” he said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. “You will also see an increase of patrol activity in certain sectors to go after the violent criminal offenders that are the drivers of this crime.”
Cole said the city’s police chief has been “very accommodating” and applauded intel sharing between federal forces and local law enforcement.
His remarks continue a tone of cooperation that contrasted with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s initial reactions to the federal takeover of the city’s police department.
Cole did not offer specific details on what will change in the chain of command amid the federal takeover, only saying that the move “brings so much power to allow the police officers to do their job.”
He also blamed the D.C. City Council for not previously empowering city law enforcement, arguing that the federal government is helping rectify “concerning” dynamics for police officers created by the council.
Senior Democrat calls on Republicans to hold confirmation hearing for Trump’s new BLS pick
Sen. Patty Murray, a senior Democrat, is calling for Republicans to hold a confirmation hearing for E.J. Antoni, whom Trump has nominated to lead the agency that compiles the nation’s employment and inflation figures.
Murray in a statement slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, hold a confirmation hearing for him.
Some Senate Republicans were critical after Trump fired the previous director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, and have said they want someone in the job who can reliably compile and report data on the nation’s economy. But they have also mostly gone along with Trump’s Cabinet picks.
Trump’s choice of Antoni, who was the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and often made overtly political arguments, sets up a key test for GOP senators and their willingness to go along with the president.
Philadelphia DA says Trump’s seizure of policing in DC is unjustified
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said during a Tuesday news conference with faith leaders that Trump’s effort to seize policing in Washington D.C. is unjustified and will be resisted if it comes to Pennsylvania’s largest city.
Krasner said crime is actually down in many major cities, including Philadelphia and the nation’s capital. He described Trump’s declaration of federal control of D.C. police, and threat to do so elsewhere, as a “bogus” attempt to assert authority.
“What we have going on in Philadelphia and elsewhere is actually good news, but that’s not the news that Donald Trump needs,” he said.
Krasner’s office said it held the news conference to “reaffirm the city’s commitment to uphold the Constitutional rights of residents and to hold accountable anyone who violates the law.”
He said Trump’s threat to send members of the National Guard to Washington D.C. and other cities could bring chaos in a time of relative peace.
Trump administration cuts down human rights reports
The Trump administration released human rights reports for countries worldwide that eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people and reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights.
The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, also criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.
They offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in countries like Eswatini, South Sudan and Rwanda that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.
South Africa also was singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners, a minority that ran the country’s apartheid government.
US attorney for DC on local crime: ‘There is a whole community that is suffering’
Pirro argued during a Tuesday press briefing that violent crime in the nation’s capital is significant and causing suffering throughout the community.
She displayed poster boards that she said showed teenagers who were shot and killed in D.C. in 2024 and 2025 so far. She said anyone who argues crime is down or an emergency designation is not needed should “talk to the loved ones and the family members of these individuals, all shot and killed long before their time.”
As she backed the Trump administration’s argument for placing the city’s police department under federal control, Pirro pointed to violent crime rates that spiked in the nation’s capital in 2023.
“I don’t need any more statistics,” she said.
A recent Department of Justice report shows that violent crime is down 35% since 2023, returning to the previous trend of decreasing crime that puts the district’s violent crime rate at its lowest in 30 years.
Officials brief the media on the indictment of a Haitian gang leader
U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro and other federal officials briefed the media on Tuesday’s unsealed indictment of Jimmy “Barbecue” Cherizier, whom many consider Haiti’s most powerful gang leader.
The State Department is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information that leads to Cherizier’s arrest or conviction, the officials said.
Pirro said Haiti is a “hotspot” where “incredible violence” is taking place right now.
CDC Director: ‘Misinformation can be dangerous’
Dr. Susan Monarez held her first ‘all-hands’ meeting on Tuesday after her first full week on campus as the CDC’s director was capped by an attack on the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta.
“We know that misinformation can be dangerous. Not only to health, but to those that trust us and those we want to trust,” she told her employees. “In moments like this, we must meet the challenges with rational, evidence based discourse spoken with compassion and understanding. That is how we will lead.”
Kennedy was a leader in a national anti-vaccine movement before Trump selected him to oversee federal health agencies, and has made false and misleading statements about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 shots and other vaccines
Health Secretary, after the shooting at CDC, criticizes CDC’s pandemic response
Trump’s Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., refused to directly answer when asked during an interview with Scripps News on Monday what message he had for CDC employees who are worried about the culture of misinformation and skepticism around vaccines.
Although law enforcement officials have made clear the shooter was targeting the public health agency over the COVID-19 vaccine, Kennedy said in the interview that not enough was known about his motives.
He described political violence as “wrong” and said his job is to protect employees.
He went on to criticize the public health agency’s actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“One of the things that we saw during COVID is that the government was overreaching in its efforts to persuade the public to get vaccinated and they were saying things that are not always true,” Kennedy said.
White House not ruling out ‘future plans’ for Trump to travel to Russia
Leavitt said that Trump will be traveling to Alaska on Friday and meeting one-on-one with Putin -- even amid lingering questions about whether Zelenskyy will be involved.
But asked if Trump might then head to Russia -- or go there in the future -- Leavitt was less committal.
“Perhaps there are plans in the future to travel to Russia,” she said.
Business as usual in Chinatown
The intersection of 7th and H street in Chinatown is one of the more high-profile battlegrounds in the effort to bring down crime rates in Washington D.C.
Residents and business owners have long complained about the open drug dealing, aggressive panhandlers and 24/7 marijuana smell around the Metro exit, one block from Capitol One Arena.
Folks on the street corner — none of whom would give their names — said federal law enforcement officers swept through the area Sunday night, but there’s disagreement if it was FBI or DEA or both.
On Tuesday afternoon, the corner was relatively tranquil. But two young men did offer to sell marijuana to a reporter as soon as they were introduced.
Another man, sitting in a wheelchair and rolling a joint, predicted that any crackdown would just temporarily push illegal activity down the block.
“They’re never going to stop crime,” he said. “You know why? Because crime gets people paid.”
White House says monthly jobs report will continue
White House press secretary Leavitt said that the government will continue to issue the monthly jobs report, which includes the nation’s unemployment rate, despite comments by an administration’s nominee that suggested suspending it.
“I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope,” Leavitt said.
On Aug.4., E.J. Antoni, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation, said on Fox News Digital that the agency should pause the issuance of the reports while it works to improve its data collection. Antoni a week later was nominated by Trump to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that compiles the jobs data as well as monthly inflation report.
The jobs report is closely watched by Wall Street and many businesses around the country, and suspending it would be unprecedented.
Trump slammed the last report Aug. 1 after it showed hiring weakened in July and was much lower in May and June than originally reported, then fired the BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer.
Leavitt: DC homeless will face fines or jail if they refuse shelter or treatment
Leavitt says people living in Washington homeless encampments will be offered space in a homeless shelter or treatment for addiction. She says those who refuse will face fines or jail time.
With Trump taking control of law enforcement in the nation’s capital, Leavitt said authorities will enforce anti-homelessness laws that she says have been ignored.
The National Park Service has removed 70 homeless encampments from parks controlled by the federal agency, she said.
“We want to make DC safe and beautiful,” and that requires removing “mentally disturbed individuals” and homeless encampments, Leavitt said in the White House briefing room.
Army leaders visit DC National Guard as troops report in
Two top Army leaders made a visit to the Washington, D.C. National Guard armory on Tuesday morning as activated guard members began reporting for duty to support law enforcement in the capital.
An Army spokesman confirmed to The Associated Press that Secretary Driscoll, the Army’s top civilian official, and Gen. James Mingus, the service’s second highest ranking officer, visited the armory this “to visit with Soldiers and leaders.”
“Secretary Driscoll wanted the D.C. National Guard Soldiers to know first-hand that they have support from the very top of the Army and that we have every confidence in their skill, discipline, and professionalism to support our law enforcement partners and accomplish this mission,” Lt. Colonel Jeff Tolbert said in an email.
White House says that Trump is ‘considering’ lawsuit against Fed Chair Jerome Powell
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt expanded on Trump’s social media post indicating that a lawsuit might be forthcoming on the Federal Reserve’s $2.5 billion renovation project.
Leavitt said at the Tuesday news briefing that Trump is weighing whether he as president should sue the U.S. central bank.
“The president is considering a lawsuit against the Fed, and I will leave it to him to comment further on it,” Leavitt said.
DC police takeover may last longer than 30 days
The federal takeover of the District of Columbia’s police department could last longer than 30 days.
During a press briefing, White House press secretary Leavitt said that the administration would “reevaluate and reassess and make further decisions” after the 30-day period is over.
The White House would need approval from both House and Senate in order to extend the takeover the police department.
Trump remains “very much engaged” with Ukraine, Europe, Leavitt says
Leavitt said Trump has “deep respect for all parties involved” in the war between Russia and Ukraine.
She said that the president continues to be “very much engaged” with Ukrainians and allies in Europe.
Trump is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin this Friday in Alaska.
White House calls judge’s ruling on Maxwell grand jury testimony ‘unfortunate’
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says a judge denying the Trump administration’s motion to unseal grand jury testimony from the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell “unfortunate.”
“We think that decision is unfortunate,” Leavitt said, adding that the information should be unsealed because Trump has said he wanted it released.
Those comments came a day after U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer of the Southern District of New York criticized the Department of Justice for using “demonstrably false” reasoning to justify the release of grand jury testimony.
Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prion sentence for sex trafficking and other crimes in connection with Jeffrey Epstein.
Putin meeting is ‘a listening exercise’ for Trump, Leavitt says
Leavitt says Trump’s goal for his meeting with Putin this week is “to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.”
The White House press secretary downplayed the president’s aims for the summit on Friday in Alaska. She described the meeting as “a listening exercise for the president” that he agreed to after Putin requested a meeting.
Leavitt declined to discuss Trump’s conversations with Zelenskyy but said Trump has “deep respect” for all parties.
White House says federal officers arrested 23 in DC
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says approximately 850 federal law enforcement officers were deployed in Washington and made 23 arrests overnight.
Leavitt says the arrests include charges of homicide, gun and drug crimes, reckless driving, fare evasion and drunken driving.Leavitt said six illegal handguns were seized.
“This is only the beginning,” she said, pledging that federal authorities would continue policing in the nation’s capital for a month.
“President Trump will not be deterred by soft on crime democrats and media activists,” Leavitt said.
California Gov. Newsom mimics Trump’s social media style
“THIS IS YOUR SECOND-TO-LAST WARNING!!!” Newsom’s press office wrote Tuesday in a X post urging the president to back off efforts to redraw congressional maps.
California Democrats are planning to introduce new partisan maps on Friday to counter efforts to help GOPs in 2026 in Texas.
“STAND DOWN NOW OR CALIFORNIA WILL COUNTER-STRIKE (LEGALLY!) TO DESTROY YOUR ILLEGAL CROOKED MAPS IN RED STATES,” the post reads.
The new maps in California would still need state lawmakers and voters approval. State Republicans vow to challenge the effort.
Switzerland’s pivotal gold industry is breathing some relief
The Swiss Association of Precious Metals Manufacturers and Traders on Tuesday said it was awaiting a formal decision after Trump wrote “Gold will not be Tariffed!” on his Truth Social platform late Monday.
“President Trump’s statement is an encouraging signal for trade stability,” said Christoph Wild, the president of the association, which counts 15 companies that process and trade in precious metals like gold. “However, only a formal and binding decision will provide the certainty the gold sector and its partners require.”
The Swiss National Bank, citing figures from the Swiss government, in April issued a report saying that gold refineries in Switzerland supply about one-third of refined gold worldwide.
Last year, gold accounted for some 27% of goods trade value from the country, making it Switzerland’s most-traded product — ahead of pharmaceuticals at 22%, the SNB said.
The precious metals association, known as ASFCMP, last week expressed concern following news reports and other indications that the Trump administration might apply whopping 39% U.S. tariffs on Swiss products -- among the highest it has imposed anywhere -- to gold products.
DC mayor emphasizes ‘working collaboratively’ with feds amid Trump takeover
Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser says the city will aim to “make the most of” the increase in federal resources in the city after Trump’s announcement that he’s taking over Washington’s police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard.
Bowser also emphasized that the Metropolitan Police Department will retain its independence, including over hiring and firing, saying “our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, none of that has changed.”
“We have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,” Bowser added after a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
The remarks mark a change in tone from Monday when Bowser called Trump’s executive order “unsettling and unprecedented.”
Pamela Smith, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, spoke about reduced crime in the city and said increased federal resources “will only help us build upon that.”
Bondi called the meeting with Bowser “productive” in a statement on X, adding that the Justice Department will work closely with city government and police.
Republican US Rep. Barry Moore joins the race for Alabama’s open Senate seat
Moore, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, was first elected to Congress in 2020. He has the rare distinction of winning elections in two different congressional districts.
Last year, a federal court ordered Alabama to use a new congressional map, which put Moore’s home outside his own district. Rather than moving to seek his old seat, he opted to challenge his fellow GOP incumbent in a hard-fought primary for the more solidly Republican 1st District.
Now he’s seeking the position being vacated by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who’s running for governor. The rare open Senate seat is expected to draw a number of candidates and Alabama’s Republican attorney general has already entered the race.
A UFC fight at the White House? Dana White says it’s happening as part of deal with Paramount
Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from Trump on his thoughts about the fight company’s new streaming home.
That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House.
Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upward of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence.
“It’s absolutely going to happen,” White told The Associated Press. “Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.”

Trump’s moves toward taking over Washington are unprecedented. Here’s what the law says
Trump took command of the police department and deployed the National Guard under laws and Constitutional powers that give the federal government more sway over the nation’s capital than other cities. The measure still leaves significant power to the president and Congress, though no president has exercised the police powers before.
Here’s a look at what the law says about Trump’s actions:
1. Trump activated the National Guard. The president can still call up the National Guard in Washington. His authority is less clear in Los Angeles, where a legal battle continues over his recent deployment of the National Guard despite the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom.
2. Trump took over the local police. Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows for the president to take over Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. No president has done so before.
3. Trump didn’t specify how long the takeover would last. Congress still has power over things like the budget and laws passed by the city council, but would have to repeal the Home Rule Act to expand federal power in the district.

It turns out many Americans misjudge which personal behaviors contribute most to climate change
It turns out many Americans aren't great at identifying which personal decisions contribute most to climate change.
A study recently published by the National Academy of Sciences found that when asked to rank actions, such as swapping a car that uses gasoline for an electric one, carpooling or reducing food waste, participants weren’t very accurate when assessing how much those actions contributed to climate change, which is caused mostly by the release of greenhouse gases that happen when fuels like gasoline, oil and coal are burned.
""People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat,"" said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University.
The top three individual actions that help the climate, including avoiding plane flights, choosing not to get a dog and using renewable electricity, were also the three that participants underestimated the most. Meanwhile, the lowest-impact actions were changing to more efficient appliances and swapping out light bulbs, recycling, and using less energy on washing clothes. Those were three of the top four overestimated actions in the report.
Vlasceanu said marketing focuses more on recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs than on why flights or dog adoption are relatively bad for the climate, so participants were more likely to give those actions more weight.
How the human brain is wired also plays a role.
“You can see the bottle being recycled. That’s visible. Whereas carbon emissions, that’s invisible to the human eye. So that’s why we don’t associate emissions with flying,” said Jiaying Zhao, who teaches psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia.
Zhao added it's easier to bring actions to mind that we do more often. “Recycling is an almost daily action, whereas flying is less frequent. It’s less discussed,” she said. “As a result, people give a higher psychological weight to recycling.”
Of course, there is also a lot of misleading information. For example, some companies tout the recycling they do while not telling the public about pollution that comes from their overall operations.
“There has been a lot of deliberate confusion out there to support policies that are really out of date,"" said Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit.
Dogs are big meat eaters, and meat is a significant contributor to climate change. That is because many of the farm animals, which will become food, release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Beef is especially impactful, in part because around the world cattle are often raised on land that was illegally deforested. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, cutting them to then raise cattle is a double whammy.
“People just don’t associate pets with carbon emissions. That link is not clear in people’s minds,” Zhao said.
Not all pets are the same, however. Zhao owns a dog and three rabbits.
“I can adopt 100 bunnies that will not be close to the emissions of a dog, because my dog is a carnivore,” she said.
The owner of a meat-eating pet can lower their impact by looking for food made from sources other than beef. Zhao, for example, tries to minimize her dog’s carbon footprint by feeding her less carbon-intensive protein sources, including seafood and turkey.
Planes emit a lot of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, also greenhouse gases. Additionally, planes emit contrails, or vapor trails that prevent planet-warming gases from escaping into space. A round-trip economy-class flight on a 737 from New York to Los Angeles produces more than 1,300 pounds of emissions per passenger, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency.
Skipping that single flight saves about as much carbon as swearing off eating all types of meat a year, or living without a car for more than three months, according to U.N. estimates.
Switching to energy that comes from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, has a large positive impact because such sources don't emit greenhouse gases. Some of the biggest climate decisions individuals can make include how they heat and cool their homes and the types of transportation they use. Switching to renewable energy minimizes the impact of both.
Recycling is effective at reducing waste headed for landfill, but its climate impact is relatively small because transporting, processing and repurposing recyclables typically relies on fossil fuels. Plus, less than 10% of plastics actually get recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Other decisions with overestimated impact, including washing clothes in cold water and switching to more efficient light bulbs, are relatively less important. That is because those appliances have a relatively small impact compared to other things, such plane flights and dogs, so improving on them, while beneficial, has a much more limited influence.
Experts say the best way to combat the human tendency to miscalculate climate-related decisions is with more readily available information. Zhao said that people are already more accurate in their estimations than they would have been 10 or 20 years ago because it’s easier to learn.
The study backs up that hypothesis. After participants finished ranking actions, the researchers corrected their mistakes, and they changed which actions they said they'd take to help the planet.
“People do learn from these interventions,” Vlasceanu said. “After learning, they are more willing to commit to actually more impactful actions.”

Cities across the UK are facing a growing threat from an emerging phenomenon called ""firewaves"" as temperatures rise due to climate change, scientists have warned.
The term, coined by researchers at Imperial College London, describes multiple urban wildfires triggered by extended periods of hot, dry weather.
The warning comes as firefighters battled three separate heath fires in London and a dramatic gorse blaze on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh in recent days, as this summer's latest heatwave left vegetation across both capitals dangerously dry.
These fires, though now contained, highlight the increasing vulnerability of urban areas to wildfires - a risk that was once considered largely rural.
Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London, has been working alongside the London Fire Brigade to help predict when conditions are ripe for a ""firewave"".
Based on current forecasts, he believes London could be at risk again by this weekend.
London Fire Brigade Assistant Commissioner Tom Goodall said he welcomes any research that helps predict the likelihood of wildfires occurring.
The service is ""ready to tackle the threat of wildfires head-on to help protect London's communities and green spaces"", he added.
Prof Rein's research finds that, after ten consecutive days of very dry weather, vegetation becomes so desiccated across wide areas that the likelihood of multiple fires igniting simultaneously rises sharply.
Using detailed incident data from the London Fire Brigade dating back to 2009, combined with weather records, the team identified key factors that drive wildfire outbreaks in London.
One of the most important is a measure of how much moisture the atmosphere can extract from the land, known as the ""vapour pressure deficit"".
The higher the deficit, the drier the vegetation becomes, and the more easily it ignites.
""Vegetation doesn't just become a bit more flammable,"" explained Professor Rein, ""it becomes much more flammable.""
""Once the moisture content of the vegetation drops below a certain threshold, even a small spark can lead to a fast-spreading fire,"" he added.
Most fires are started by humans, whether accidentally or deliberately. But a warming world is creating conditions more conducive to these blazes.
""Climate change is bringing more heatwaves and longer dry spells,"" Prof Rein said.
""These conditions dry out fuels and increase the risk of wildfires. That risk is much greater now than it was even a decade ago.""
While the researchers focused on London, concerns are widespread.
""I worry about all other UK cities and other northern European cities in particular because climate change seems to be making green vegetation that was not flammable very flammable indeed,"" said Prof Rein.
""And these places don't have a history of dealing with wildfires so don't have as much institutional experience as cities in the south of the continent.""
Managing fire risk
Urban environments like London, with their abundance of parks and green spaces bordering residential zones, are particularly susceptible.
The concept of a ""firewave"" is meant to capture the unique danger posed when several fires erupt at once in densely populated areas, which has the potential to overwhelm emergency services and threaten homes and infrastructure.
That happened in the summer of 2022 when UK temperatures exceeded 40C for the first time on record.
On 19 July 2022, London Fire Brigade (LFB) experienced its busiest day since World War II.
Fires broke out simultaneously across the city, including a devastating blaze in Wennington, East London, which destroyed 37 buildings, five cars, and forced the evacuation of 88 homes.
Blake Betts, a borough commander with the LFB, has extensive experience dealing with wildfires in urban settings.
He emphasises the serious threat they pose, especially when open spaces are adjacent to residential properties.
""The potential for fires to spread into homes is very real,"" said Cdr Betts.
""We're seeing more extreme weather events, and that's why the London Fire Brigade has adopted a much more proactive approach.""
To meet this growing challenge, the LFB says it has invested in new technologies and equipment.
Drones now play a critical role in wildfire response, providing real-time aerial views that help commanders map fire spread and direct resources where they are needed most.
""The bird's-eye view from drones gives us a huge boost in situational awareness,"" explained a spokesperson from the LFB.
""It allows us to target our efforts where the risk to life and property is greatest.""
In addition to drones, the brigade has introduced off-road vehicles capable of reaching fires in difficult terrain, such as heathland and grassland.
These vehicles can be used to create firebreaks – using water to soak the ground to help stop fires from spreading further.
The Imperial College London researchers argue that the Met Office's current definition of a heatwave does not adequately reflect the wildfire risk in urban areas.
They propose it adopts the term ""firewave"" to signal periods of extreme fire danger in cities - a concept they hope will inform future public safety strategies and climate resilience planning.
The Met Office has been asked for comment.

One of the most important is a measure of how much moisture the atmosphere can extract from the land, known as the ""vapour pressure deficit"".
The higher the deficit, the drier the vegetation becomes, and the more easily it ignites.
""Vegetation doesn't just become a bit more flammable,"" explained Professor Rein, ""it becomes much more flammable.""
""Once the moisture content of the vegetation drops below a certain threshold, even a small spark can lead to a fast-spreading fire,"" he added.
Most fires are started by humans, whether accidentally or deliberately. But a warming world is creating conditions more conducive to these blazes.
""Climate change is bringing more heatwaves and longer dry spells,"" Prof Rein said.
""These conditions dry out fuels and increase the risk of wildfires. That risk is much greater now than it was even a decade ago.""
While the researchers focused on London, concerns are widespread.
""I worry about all other UK cities and other northern European cities in particular because climate change seems to be making green vegetation that was not flammable very flammable indeed,"" said Prof Rein.
""And these places don't have a history of dealing with wildfires so don't have as much institutional experience as cities in the south of the continent.""
Managing fire risk
Urban environments like London, with their abundance of parks and green spaces bordering residential zones, are particularly susceptible.
The concept of a ""firewave"" is meant to capture the unique danger posed when several fires erupt at once in densely populated areas, which has the potential to overwhelm emergency services and threaten homes and infrastructure.
That happened in the summer of 2022 when UK temperatures exceeded 40C for the first time on record.
On 19 July 2022, London Fire Brigade (LFB) experienced its busiest day since World War II.
Fires broke out simultaneously across the city, including a devastating blaze in Wennington, East London, which destroyed 37 buildings, five cars, and forced the evacuation of 88 homes.
Blake Betts, a borough commander with the LFB, has extensive experience dealing with wildfires in urban settings.
He emphasises the serious threat they pose, especially when open spaces are adjacent to residential properties.
""The potential for fires to spread into homes is very real,"" said Cdr Betts.
""We're seeing more extreme weather events, and that's why the London Fire Brigade has adopted a much more proactive approach.""
To meet this growing challenge, the LFB says it has invested in new technologies and equipment.
Drones now play a critical role in wildfire response, providing real-time aerial views that help commanders map fire spread and direct resources where they are needed most.
""The bird's-eye view from drones gives us a huge boost in situational awareness,"" explained a spokesperson from the LFB.
""It allows us to target our efforts where the risk to life and property is greatest.""
In addition to drones, the brigade has introduced off-road vehicles capable of reaching fires in difficult terrain, such as heathland and grassland.
These vehicles can be used to create firebreaks – using water to soak the ground to help stop fires from spreading further.
The Imperial College London researchers argue that the Met Office's current definition of a heatwave does not adequately reflect the wildfire risk in urban areas.
They propose it adopts the term ""firewave"" to signal periods of extreme fire danger in cities - a concept they hope will inform future public safety strategies and climate resilience planning.

Cities across the UK are facing a growing threat from an emerging phenomenon called ""firewaves"" as temperatures rise due to climate change, scientists have warned.
The term, coined by researchers at Imperial College London, describes multiple urban wildfires triggered by extended periods of hot, dry weather.
The warning comes as firefighters battled three separate heath fires in London and a dramatic gorse blaze on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh in recent days, as this summer's latest heatwave left vegetation across both capitals dangerously dry.
These fires, though now contained, highlight the increasing vulnerability of urban areas to wildfires - a risk that was once considered largely rural.
Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London, has been working alongside the London Fire Brigade to help predict when conditions are ripe for a ""firewave"".
Based on current forecasts, he believes London could be at risk again by this weekend.
London Fire Brigade Assistant Commissioner Tom Goodall said he welcomes any research that helps predict the likelihood of wildfires occurring.
The service is ""ready to tackle the threat of wildfires head-on to help protect London's communities and green spaces"", he added.

,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,"After analyzing Tulane-specific data, this UK-focused article does not represent a significant risk to Tulane University for several compelling reasons:

Tulane demonstrates exceptional ROI metrics with graduates earning approximately $1,493,000 in additional lifetime earnings compared to the degree cost of $220,000 - significantly outperforming alternative investments like 30-year Treasury Bills.

Tulane's highly selective admissions process (11% acceptance rate) indicates strong and sustained demand for its educational offerings despite premium tuition costs.

The university offers numerous high-ROI majors including Engineering, Business, Biology, and Political Science - all fields showing strong returns (226-326% ROI after 5 years).

Tulane's prestigious reputation, 7:1 student-faculty ratio, and high percentage of terminal degree faculty (1,074 out of 1,400) create a premium educational experience that continues to attract qualified applicants.

While the article raises valid concerns about degree ROI in the UK market, these concerns do not translate to Tulane's specific market position, which continues to demonstrate strong value proposition and student demand.

The temporary dip in Tulane's 10-year ROI metrics reflects post-Hurricane Katrina disruptions rather than fundamental issues with degree value, making this an outlier in otherwise strong performance data.

The article's concerns about declining degree value represent general trends in certain markets and fields but do not constitute a meaningful risk to Tulane given its demonstrated value metrics and market position.

",The degrees that may not be worth the paper they’re written on,https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/money/article/degrees-cost-worth-salaries-debate-8bm5lgf72,2025-08-14 05:32:00,,"There are many reasons to go to university, whether that be a yearning for independence, a desire for further study or, for many, the chance to have an iron-clad excuse to have a good time.
These are all worthy motivations but it’s worth remembering the fundamental driver for getting a degree in the first place: the hope that in the future, you will earn more money because of that shiny certificate.
While university might once have been the golden ticket to a good career, a soaring number of graduates, an increase in what critics describe as “Mickey Mouse” degrees and the rising threat of artificial intelligence (AI) have all made the decision more complex.
• The degrees that earn the best salaries — and protect you from AI
Could do better
According to the Department for Education, those who specifically study teaching as a first degree are unlikely to earn large salaries, even after a decade of working. The average salary of someone who had a degree in education and teaching was just £27,700 after 10 years — the lowest of all the subjects. The majority of teachers earn more than this, but will have studied different degrees.
Other low-return degrees included performing arts, creative arts and design, and agricultural studies. Graduates of these subjects typically failed to breach the £30,000 salary mark after 10 years.
For context, £34,300 is the median graduate earnings 10 years after graduation, according to the latest longitudinal education outcomes data from the ministry.
Victoria McLean from the career consultants City CV and Hanover said: “It’s a shame, but some of the most intellectually rich and socially vital degrees often don’t convert to high salaries, at least not in the early years.
“It’s not a judgment on their value, but a reflection of how these sectors are structured and funded. It’s entirely possible to build a brilliant, lucrative career from these degrees, but it takes longer and demands more pivots along the way.”
• How do student loans work and when do you start repaying?
Generic or wide-reaching degrees were also unlikely to lead to six-figure careers. A degree in “combined and general studies” typically had a starting salary of £24,100 and after a decade, this moved up to £30,700.
Oliver Sidwell from Higherin, an early careers jobs platform, said that such degrees were typically less likely to get you a degree-level job after university in the first place, so ended up leading to lower-paid jobs. He added that while degrees were still sought-after in general, this was increasingly becoming “a more outdated view”.
Could you be replaced by a robot?
The money available in any given sector won’t matter, however, if the jobs are likely to be done by AI in the future.
Graduate jobs are already among the most affected by the advent of artificial intelligence software. The recruitment firm Adzuna found that the number of entry-level roles had fallen 32 per cent since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022.
David Morel from the London firm Tiger Recruitment said: “We are already beginning to see a decline in entry-level job opportunities. Many sectors are cutting costs, and businesses are increasingly turning to software like AI to perform tasks that were once handled by less qualified employees.”

Data entry and content writing roles have been the first to go, while fields such as proofreading and customer service are now beginning to be automated.
According to Lacey Kaelani, who has been tracking AI threats through her jobs platform Metaintro, there has been a drop in roles that require business graduates because AI can handle basic business analysis and generate reports.
Kaelani said: “There is also a 31 per cent decline in entry-level roles in communications roles, and we are seeing 25 per cent fewer ‘economic analyst’ graduate positions. In all industries, those who can interpret AI and combine AI with expertise and strategic thinking are managing to buck the trend.”
Another way of judging AI risks is to look at AI occupational exposure (AIOE) scores — the higher the score, the more replaceable occupations are by AI.
According to the Department for Education, industries such as sport, leisure and recreation, engineering and sociology are among the least exposed. Economics, maths and accounting are among the most.
Vicky Harvey from the University of Salford said that the pace of change was rapid and so the true impact on jobs was unknown. But she added that many universities were integrating AI into their teaching and research to help students understand and adapt to the evolving landscape.
Weighing up the cost
If you want to look at the potential return on investment of different degrees, you need to first understand the initial cost. The average student debt built up by those studying in England is now £53,000, and this is likely to increase as the cap on fees for full-time students will rise to £9,535 a year from September, up from £9,250.
However, most students never pay back their loans in full. Instead, those thinking about university should look at the repayment system and how it will affect their take-home pay in the future.
Those starting university this year will be on the Plan 5 repayment system. This means that 9 per cent of earnings above £25,000 will go towards paying back their loan. If they have not repaid it within 40 years, the debt is cancelled.
It gives a basic-rate taxpayer with a salary above that threshold a marginal tax rate of 37 per cent. A higher-rate taxpayer pays a marginal rate of 51 per cent.
While the system can mean that high earners will begin to feel their student loan repayments in their pay cheque — someone earning £100,000 would pay £6,750 a year or £563 a month, for instance — those with smaller salaries are somewhat protected. Those on the average graduate salary of £34,300 a decade after graduation would pay just £837 a year, or £70 a month.
McLean added: “Before choosing a course, I would urge students to ask: what roles do I want to target? What do they pay? What’s the outlook for three or five years? And is there a high enough salary to justify the debt?
“You don’t need to have it all figured out by 18, but that doesn’t mean you can’t think strategically.

Generic or wide-reaching degrees were also unlikely to lead to six-figure careers. A degree in “combined and general studies” typically had a starting salary of £24,100 and after a decade, this moved up to £30,700.
Oliver Sidwell from Higherin, an early careers jobs platform, said that such degrees were typically less likely to get you a degree-level job after university in the first place, so ended up leading to lower-paid jobs. He added that while degrees were still sought-after in general, this was increasingly becoming “a more outdated view”.

Data entry and content writing roles have been the first to go, while fields such as proofreading and customer service are now beginning to be automated.
According to Lacey Kaelani, who has been tracking AI threats through her jobs platform Metaintro, there has been a drop in roles that require business graduates because AI can handle basic business analysis and generate reports.
Kaelani said: “There is also a 31 per cent decline in entry-level roles in communications roles, and we are seeing 25 per cent fewer ‘economic analyst’ graduate positions. In all industries, those who can interpret AI and combine AI with expertise and strategic thinking are managing to buck the trend.”
Another way of judging AI risks is to look at AI occupational exposure (AIOE) scores — the higher the score, the more replaceable occupations are by AI.
According to the Department for Education, industries such as sport, leisure and recreation, engineering and sociology are among the least exposed. Economics, maths and accounting are among the most.
Vicky Harvey from the University of Salford said that the pace of change was rapid and so the true impact on jobs was unknown. But she added that many universities were integrating AI into their teaching and research to help students understand and adapt to the evolving landscape.
Weighing up the cost
If you want to look at the potential return on investment of different degrees, you need to first understand the initial cost. The average student debt built up by those studying in England is now £53,000, and this is likely to increase as the cap on fees for full-time students will rise to £9,535 a year from September, up from £9,250.
However, most students never pay back their loans in full. Instead, those thinking about university should look at the repayment system and how it will affect their take-home pay in the future.
Those starting university this year will be on the Plan 5 repayment system. This means that 9 per cent of earnings above £25,000 will go towards paying back their loan. If they have not repaid it within 40 years, the debt is cancelled.
It gives a basic-rate taxpayer with a salary above that threshold a marginal tax rate of 37 per cent. A higher-rate taxpayer pays a marginal rate of 51 per cent.
While the system can mean that high earners will begin to feel their student loan repayments in their pay cheque — someone earning £100,000 would pay £6,750 a year or £563 a month, for instance — those with smaller salaries are somewhat protected. Those on the average graduate salary of £34,300 a decade after graduation would pay just £837 a year, or £70 a month.
McLean added: “Before choosing a course, I would urge students to ask: what roles do I want to target? What do they pay? What’s the outlook for three or five years? And is there a high enough salary to justify the debt?

According to the Department for Education, those who specifically study teaching as a first degree are unlikely to earn large salaries, even after a decade of working. The average salary of someone who had a degree in education and teaching was just £27,700 after 10 years — the lowest of all the subjects. The majority of teachers earn more than this, but will have studied different degrees.
Other low-return degrees included performing arts, creative arts and design, and agricultural studies. Graduates of these subjects typically failed to breach the £30,000 salary mark after 10 years.

“Almost immediately they started telling me that the No. 1 most important thing now is to as quickly as possible get me into what they call acute rehab,” said Karadell, 58, of Howell, Michigan. “They used words like, ‘This is crucial. This is essential to your recovery.’”
But after 11 days in a hospital bed with no word on when he’d be transferred to the facility, Karadell said he learned his health insurer, Aetna, had denied coverage for what’s known as acute post-stroke rehabilitation.
What followed was a weekslong back-and-forth between Aetna and the hospital, University Hospital in Ann Arbor — including phone calls, bureaucratic delays and miscommunication, according to a Michigan Medicine spokesperson, an Aetna spokesperson and hospital case notes reviewed by NBC News.
More than a month after Karadell’s stroke, he said he essentially gave up and left the hospital to go to a less-intensive rehab program, a downgrade from what his care team consistently recommended throughout his hospital stay.
“I’m left with what I believe is permanent damage,” Karadell said. “And I’m left to wonder: Could it have been different if they would have approved what they should have done?”
In a statement, an Aetna spokesperson said the circumstances surrounding Karadell’s denied claim are “complex” and the insurer’s ability to process claims and appeals is “dependent on the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the information we receive from the provider.”
“We understand the frustration whenever there is a health care process that is complicated or does not meet a member’s expectations,” the spokesperson said. “Even though the vast majority of experiences are managed smoothly, our company strives to partner with healthcare providers to make sure each member receives what’s expected every time.”
The spokesperson added, “as we are not in the hospital with this patient, we expect our providers to partner with us and play an active role in conveying important clinical information to us that we would not otherwise have.”
Karadell’s experience, however, is far from unique: A nationwide survey of more than 1,300 insured adults found over a third — 36% — had had at least one claim denial, said Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor in the department of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh who conducted the survey. Almost 60% of those patients, she said, went on to have the same claim denied multiple times. Half of the people who were denied ended up postponing their care.

What appears to have happened to Karadell can be best described as “rationing care by inconvenience,” said Yaver, who wasn’t involved with Karadell’s case.
It’s a tactic, she believes, that health insurers use to limit spending. By making the process of getting coverage difficult — either through paperwork, repeated denials or a complex appeal process — they count on doctors and patients giving up.
“It’s not that you’re never going to get the approval, but it ends up being this endurance contest and administrative burden,” she said. “And it’s really overwhelming, especially because when we’re navigating these things, it’s not on our best day, it’s on our worst.”
‘Discharge has been delayed’
Some form of rehab is recommended for all patients after a stroke, according to the American Stroke Association.
The program recommended for Karadell — known as acute post-stroke rehabilitation — is typically for patients who still have significant difficulties, such as trouble walking, feeding themselves or bathing but are medically stable enough to tolerate therapy, said Dr. Nneka Ifejika, chief scientific officer at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans and an ASA national volunteer expert. Ifejika was not involved in Karadell’s care.
In a hospital note dated June 8, 2024, two days after he was admitted, Karadell was described as still having significant difficulty getting dressed, bathing, brushing his teeth and using the bathroom on his own. He also required some help eating meals. He had dizziness and intense pain in his neck. His wife, Emily Steiner, also said he had vision and speech problems. The note said he was doing well with the therapy he was getting at the hospital but recommended a more intensive program.
“Progressing well in therapy, will greatly benefit from multidisciplinary rehab at IPR [inpatient post-acute rehabilitation] to facilitate maximal independence in ADLs [activities of daily living] and functional mobility prior to return home,” the note said.
Ifejika said that it’s critically important for stroke patients to start rehab as early as possible because delays can lead to worse health outcomes, including long-term disability.
The longer a stroke patient is bedridden, the more their physical ability and mobility decline, she said. Extensive stays in the hospital can also lead to increased risk of falls or getting an infection, she said. (In Karadell’s case, his wife said, it also took a mental toll, as he had trouble sleeping due to noise and patients sharing the room.)
Ifejika said she typically starts patients in rehab within two to three days of a stroke. “They go directly from the hospital to the rehab facility, whether it be a freestanding rehab facility or a hospital-based rehab facility,” she said.
The hospital spokesperson said the hospital’s admissions coordination submitted a prior authorization request for Karadell’s intensive rehab on June 12.
On June 17, Aetna denied the coverage, saying that clinical documentation hadn’t been submitted, the hospital spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that the insurer did not offer an opportunity for a hospital physician to speak to a doctor from the insurance company about the request, a process known as a peer-to-peer review. An Aetna spokesperson said it would have provided a peer-to-peer review if the hospital had requested it.
The hospital submitted an expedited appeal that day, the hospital spokesperson and Steiner said. An Aetna spokesperson said the hospital’s appeal was not submitted as “expedited.”
That same day, a hospital note said that Karadell was “significantly below baseline of function,” adding: “Recommend IPR to progress independence in ADLs.” In a second note also dated June 17, a doctor wrote: “Today, discussed with patient will continue to work on IPR admission. He states he is frustrated with how long it has taken but hoping to begin therapies soon.”
One week later, however, Karadell was still in the hospital. “Discharge has been delayed by rejected insurance authorization despite our strong medical recommendation for discharge to IPR,” a doctor wrote in a June 24 note.
Two days later, on June 26, a hospital note said: “He and wife continue to voice their frustration regarding the insurance-related delays.”
In the days that followed, the hospital said Aetna denied the approval for a second time.
Subacute care
On June 30, nearly 30 days after Karadell’s stroke, Aetna said it approved the intensive rehab, but the hospital spokesperson said they didn’t receive the approval until July 5, a Friday. That Monday, the hospital said it contacted Aetna to confirm the approval but learned it had expired the day before. At that point, Karadell gave up and opted to get less intensive rehab closer to home — an option that his care team had been considering as a backup and had already been authorized. (Aetna said it had canceled the intensive rehab approval because of the hospital’s request to send Karadell to a less-intensive program, as the two requests were mutually exclusive.)
Ifejika said that so-called subacute care, which is often provided at an outside facility, such as a nursing home or assisted living facility, is easier to get insurance approval for because it’s less expensive.
However, she added, studies show it comes with a higher risk of hospital readmission compared to acute rehab.
“Sending them to a skilled nursing facility is actually doing them a disservice,” she said.
Steiner said the assisted living facility Karadell went to only had a part-time physical therapist, and he was doing less rehab than he had been doing at the hospital.
At one point, he said, he needed help getting up to use the bathroom but couldn’t get assistance and ended up falling.
“That was quite frankly awful,” Steiner said. “None of this I knew at the time, really how significant of a difference it was going to be.”
Karadell left the facility after about two weeks. Though he could have stayed longer, “I wanted to go home so desperately,” he said.
Karadell was also left with a bill for more than $150,000 marked “pending” in his hospital file, the result of his extended stay. When NBC News recently asked the hospital about the bill, a spokesperson said it had been going back and forth with Aetna over how much would be covered. Aetna paid around $37,000 and the hospital wrote off the rest.
Prior authorization
Health insurers have pledged to take steps to streamline the often-criticized prior authorization process for approving claims.
In June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the country’s largest health insurers had promised to take steps to reform prior authorization, including quicker approvals and reducing the number of medical services subject to the rule.
Health insurers have made similar commitments in the past, including in 2018 and again in 2023. Many failed to implement such reforms.
Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said more fundamental reform, likely from Congress, will be needed to address the health care barriers imposed by insurance companies.
Yaver, of the University of Pittsburgh, said many doctors — and patients — agree that reform is needed.
In more than 100 interviews with doctors, Yaver said many had stated that the prior authorization process had gotten more difficult over the years, not easier.
“On the physician side, this requires a lot of time and staffing,” she said. “Some of them attribute this to contributing to burnout.”
On the patient side it “destabilizes their health and economic lives,” she added.
Karadell — who says he still has numbness in his legs, back, face and feet and struggles with simple tasks, like climbing stairs and reaching for the remote — said the experience “changed my life forever.”
“I always have to watch my step,” he said. “When I leave the house and I go to the store or to go get something to eat, I have to watch the ground because I’m scared of falling.”",NBC News,[],"['John Karadell', 'Karadell', 'Howell', 'Michigan', 'Karadell', 'Aetna', 'Aetna', 'University Hospital', 'Ann Arbor', 'Michigan Medicine', 'Aetna', 'NBC News', 'Karadell', 'Karadell', 'Aetna', 'Karadell', 'Karadell', 'Miranda Yaver', 'the University of Pittsburgh', 'Karadell', 'Yaver', 'Karadell', 'the American Stroke Association', 'Karadell', 'Nneka Ifejika', 'Ochsner Health System', 'New Orleans', 'ASA', 'Karadell', 'Karadell', 'Emily Steiner', 'IPR', 'Karadell', 'Karadell', 'Aetna', 'Aetna', 'Steiner', 'Aetna', 'Karadell', 'IPR', 'Karadell', 'IPR', 'Aetna', 'Karadell', 'Aetna', 'Aetna', 'Karadell', 'Aetna', 'Karadell', 'Steiner', 'Karadell', 'Steiner', 'Karadell', 'Karadell', 'more than $150,000', 'NBC News', 'Aetna', 'Aetna', 'around $37,000', 'Health and Human Services', 'Robert F.

When John Karadell was admitted to the hospital after a stroke, his doctors quickly pushed for him to begin an intensive form of rehabilitation — the sooner the better.
“Almost immediately they started telling me that the No. 1 most important thing now is to as quickly as possible get me into what they call acute rehab,” said Karadell, 58, of Howell, Michigan. “They used words like, ‘This is crucial. This is essential to your recovery.’”
But after 11 days in a hospital bed with no word on when he’d be transferred to the facility, Karadell said he learned his health insurer, Aetna, had denied coverage for what’s known as acute post-stroke rehabilitation.
What followed was a weekslong back-and-forth between Aetna and the hospital, University Hospital in Ann Arbor — including phone calls, bureaucratic delays and miscommunication, according to a Michigan Medicine spokesperson, an Aetna spokesperson and hospital case notes reviewed by NBC News.
More than a month after Karadell’s stroke, he said he essentially gave up and left the hospital to go to a less-intensive rehab program, a downgrade from what his care team consistently recommended throughout his hospital stay.
“I’m left with what I believe is permanent damage,” Karadell said. “And I’m left to wonder: Could it have been different if they would have approved what they should have done?”
In a statement, an Aetna spokesperson said the circumstances surrounding Karadell’s denied claim are “complex” and the insurer’s ability to process claims and appeals is “dependent on the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the information we receive from the provider.”
“We understand the frustration whenever there is a health care process that is complicated or does not meet a member’s expectations,” the spokesperson said. “Even though the vast majority of experiences are managed smoothly, our company strives to partner with healthcare providers to make sure each member receives what’s expected every time.”
The spokesperson added, “as we are not in the hospital with this patient, we expect our providers to partner with us and play an active role in conveying important clinical information to us that we would not otherwise have.”
Karadell’s experience, however, is far from unique: A nationwide survey of more than 1,300 insured adults found over a third — 36% — had had at least one claim denial, said Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor in the department of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh who conducted the survey. Almost 60% of those patients, she said, went on to have the same claim denied multiple times. Half of the people who were denied ended up postponing their care.

What appears to have happened to Karadell can be best described as “rationing care by inconvenience,” said Yaver, who wasn’t involved with Karadell’s case.
It’s a tactic, she believes, that health insurers use to limit spending. By making the process of getting coverage difficult — either through paperwork, repeated denials or a complex appeal process — they count on doctors and patients giving up.
“It’s not that you’re never going to get the approval, but it ends up being this endurance contest and administrative burden,” she said. “And it’s really overwhelming, especially because when we’re navigating these things, it’s not on our best day, it’s on our worst.”
‘Discharge has been delayed’
Some form of rehab is recommended for all patients after a stroke, according to the American Stroke Association.
The program recommended for Karadell — known as acute post-stroke rehabilitation — is typically for patients who still have significant difficulties, such as trouble walking, feeding themselves or bathing but are medically stable enough to tolerate therapy, said Dr. Nneka Ifejika, chief scientific officer at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans and an ASA national volunteer expert. Ifejika was not involved in Karadell’s care.
In a hospital note dated June 8, 2024, two days after he was admitted, Karadell was described as still having significant difficulty getting dressed, bathing, brushing his teeth and using the bathroom on his own. He also required some help eating meals. He had dizziness and intense pain in his neck. His wife, Emily Steiner, also said he had vision and speech problems. The note said he was doing well with the therapy he was getting at the hospital but recommended a more intensive program.
“Progressing well in therapy, will greatly benefit from multidisciplinary rehab at IPR [inpatient post-acute rehabilitation] to facilitate maximal independence in ADLs [activities of daily living] and functional mobility prior to return home,” the note said.
Ifejika said that it’s critically important for stroke patients to start rehab as early as possible because delays can lead to worse health outcomes, including long-term disability.
The longer a stroke patient is bedridden, the more their physical ability and mobility decline, she said. Extensive stays in the hospital can also lead to increased risk of falls or getting an infection, she said. (In Karadell’s case, his wife said, it also took a mental toll, as he had trouble sleeping due to noise and patients sharing the room.)
Ifejika said she typically starts patients in rehab within two to three days of a stroke. “They go directly from the hospital to the rehab facility, whether it be a freestanding rehab facility or a hospital-based rehab facility,” she said.
The hospital spokesperson said the hospital’s admissions coordination submitted a prior authorization request for Karadell’s intensive rehab on June 12.
On June 17, Aetna denied the coverage, saying that clinical documentation hadn’t been submitted, the hospital spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added that the insurer did not offer an opportunity for a hospital physician to speak to a doctor from the insurance company about the request, a process known as a peer-to-peer review. An Aetna spokesperson said it would have provided a peer-to-peer review if the hospital had requested it.
The hospital submitted an expedited appeal that day, the hospital spokesperson and Steiner said. An Aetna spokesperson said the hospital’s appeal was not submitted as “expedited.”
That same day, a hospital note said that Karadell was “significantly below baseline of function,” adding: “Recommend IPR to progress independence in ADLs.” In a second note also dated June 17, a doctor wrote: “Today, discussed with patient will continue to work on IPR admission. He states he is frustrated with how long it has taken but hoping to begin therapies soon.”
One week later, however, Karadell was still in the hospital. “Discharge has been delayed by rejected insurance authorization despite our strong medical recommendation for discharge to IPR,” a doctor wrote in a June 24 note.
Two days later, on June 26, a hospital note said: “He and wife continue to voice their frustration regarding the insurance-related delays.”
In the days that followed, the hospital said Aetna denied the approval for a second time.
Subacute care
On June 30, nearly 30 days after Karadell’s stroke, Aetna said it approved the intensive rehab, but the hospital spokesperson said they didn’t receive the approval until July 5, a Friday. That Monday, the hospital said it contacted Aetna to confirm the approval but learned it had expired the day before. At that point, Karadell gave up and opted to get less intensive rehab closer to home — an option that his care team had been considering as a backup and had already been authorized. (Aetna said it had canceled the intensive rehab approval because of the hospital’s request to send Karadell to a less-intensive program, as the two requests were mutually exclusive.)
Ifejika said that so-called subacute care, which is often provided at an outside facility, such as a nursing home or assisted living facility, is easier to get insurance approval for because it’s less expensive.
However, she added, studies show it comes with a higher risk of hospital readmission compared to acute rehab.
“Sending them to a skilled nursing facility is actually doing them a disservice,” she said.
Steiner said the assisted living facility Karadell went to only had a part-time physical therapist, and he was doing less rehab than he had been doing at the hospital.
At one point, he said, he needed help getting up to use the bathroom but couldn’t get assistance and ended up falling.
“That was quite frankly awful,” Steiner said. “None of this I knew at the time, really how significant of a difference it was going to be.”
Karadell left the facility after about two weeks. Though he could have stayed longer, “I wanted to go home so desperately,” he said.
Karadell was also left with a bill for more than $150,000 marked “pending” in his hospital file, the result of his extended stay. When NBC News recently asked the hospital about the bill, a spokesperson said it had been going back and forth with Aetna over how much would be covered. Aetna paid around $37,000 and the hospital wrote off the rest.
Prior authorization
Health insurers have pledged to take steps to streamline the often-criticized prior authorization process for approving claims.
In June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the country’s largest health insurers had promised to take steps to reform prior authorization, including quicker approvals and reducing the number of medical services subject to the rule.
Health insurers have made similar commitments in the past, including in 2018 and again in 2023. Many failed to implement such reforms.
Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said more fundamental reform, likely from Congress, will be needed to address the health care barriers imposed by insurance companies.
Yaver, of the University of Pittsburgh, said many doctors — and patients — agree that reform is needed.
In more than 100 interviews with doctors, Yaver said many had stated that the prior authorization process had gotten more difficult over the years, not easier.
“On the physician side, this requires a lot of time and staffing,” she said. “Some of them attribute this to contributing to burnout.”
On the patient side it “destabilizes their health and economic lives,” she added.
Karadell — who says he still has numbness in his legs, back, face and feet and struggles with simple tasks, like climbing stairs and reaching for the remote — said the experience “changed my life forever.”
“I always have to watch my step,” he said. “When I leave the house and I go to the store or to go get something to eat, I have to watch the ground because I’m scared of falling.”",-1.0,0.0,Insurance Withdrawal; Policy Misapplication,2.022,,0.0,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 21:12:33 GMT",10.0,,2009.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,,0.0,1.0,2.022,Insurance Withdrawal; Policy Misapplication,,2025-08-26 16:43:49.780413+00:00,1,2025-08-26 16:43:49.780385+00:00,,,5607.0,,Insurance Withdrawal,insurance withdrawal,Insurance Withdrawal,1.0,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,Why a Michigan man waited over a month in the hospital for stroke rehab,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/michigan-man-waited-month-hospital-stroke-rehab-rcna220076,2025-08-14 21:12:33,"When John Karadell was admitted to the hospital after a stroke, his doctors quickly pushed for him to begin an intensive form of rehabilitation — the sooner the better.“Almost immediately they started telling me that the No. 1 most important thing now is to as quickly as possible get me into what they call acute rehab,” said Karadell, 58, of Howell, Michigan.","When John Karadell was admitted to the hospital after a stroke, his doctors quickly pushed for him to begin an intensive form of rehabilitation — the sooner the better.
“Almost immediately they started telling me that the No. 1 most important thing now is to as quickly as possible get me into what they call acute rehab,” said Karadell, 58, of Howell, Michigan. “They used words like, ‘This is crucial. This is essential to your recovery.’”
But after 11 days in a hospital bed with no word on when he’d be transferred to the facility, Karadell said he learned his health insurer, Aetna, had denied coverage for what’s known as acute post-stroke rehabilitation.
What followed was a weekslong back-and-forth between Aetna and the hospital, University Hospital in Ann Arbor — including phone calls, bureaucratic delays and miscommunication, according to a Michigan Medicine spokesperson, an Aetna spokesperson and hospital case notes reviewed by NBC News.
More than a month after Karadell’s stroke, he said he essentially gave up and left the hospital to go to a less-intensive rehab program, a downgrade from what his care team consistently recommended throughout his hospital stay.
“I’m left with what I believe is permanent damage,” Karadell said. “And I’m left to wonder: Could it have been different if they would have approved what they should have done?”
In a statement, an Aetna spokesperson said the circumstances surrounding Karadell’s denied claim are “complex” and the insurer’s ability to process claims and appeals is “dependent on the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the information we receive from the provider.”
“We understand the frustration whenever there is a health care process that is complicated or does not meet a member’s expectations,” the spokesperson said. “Even though the vast majority of experiences are managed smoothly, our company strives to partner with healthcare providers to make sure each member receives what’s expected every time.”
The spokesperson added, “as we are not in the hospital with this patient, we expect our providers to partner with us and play an active role in conveying important clinical information to us that we would not otherwise have.”
Karadell’s experience, however, is far from unique: A nationwide survey of more than 1,300 insured adults found over a third — 36% — had had at least one claim denial, said Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor in the department of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh who conducted the survey. Almost 60% of those patients, she said, went on to have the same claim denied multiple times. Half of the people who were denied ended up postponing their care.

What appears to have happened to Karadell can be best described as “rationing care by inconvenience,” said Yaver, who wasn’t involved with Karadell’s case.
It’s a tactic, she believes, that health insurers use to limit spending. By making the process of getting coverage difficult — either through paperwork, repeated denials or a complex appeal process — they count on doctors and patients giving up.
“It’s not that you’re never going to get the approval, but it ends up being this endurance contest and administrative burden,” she said. “And it’s really overwhelming, especially because when we’re navigating these things, it’s not on our best day, it’s on our worst.”
‘Discharge has been delayed’
Some form of rehab is recommended for all patients after a stroke, according to the American Stroke Association.
The program recommended for Karadell — known as acute post-stroke rehabilitation — is typically for patients who still have significant difficulties, such as trouble walking, feeding themselves or bathing but are medically stable enough to tolerate therapy, said Dr. Nneka Ifejika, chief scientific officer at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans and an ASA national volunteer expert. Ifejika was not involved in Karadell’s care.
In a hospital note dated June 8, 2024, two days after he was admitted, Karadell was described as still having significant difficulty getting dressed, bathing, brushing his teeth and using the bathroom on his own. He also required some help eating meals. He had dizziness and intense pain in his neck. His wife, Emily Steiner, also said he had vision and speech problems. The note said he was doing well with the therapy he was getting at the hospital but recommended a more intensive program.
“Progressing well in therapy, will greatly benefit from multidisciplinary rehab at IPR [inpatient post-acute rehabilitation] to facilitate maximal independence in ADLs [activities of daily living] and functional mobility prior to return home,” the note said.
Ifejika said that it’s critically important for stroke patients to start rehab as early as possible because delays can lead to worse health outcomes, including long-term disability.
The longer a stroke patient is bedridden, the more their physical ability and mobility decline, she said. Extensive stays in the hospital can also lead to increased risk of falls or getting an infection, she said. (In Karadell’s case, his wife said, it also took a mental toll, as he had trouble sleeping due to noise and patients sharing the room.)
Ifejika said she typically starts patients in rehab within two to three days of a stroke. “They go directly from the hospital to the rehab facility, whether it be a freestanding rehab facility or a hospital-based rehab facility,” she said.
The hospital spokesperson said the hospital’s admissions coordination submitted a prior authorization request for Karadell’s intensive rehab on June 12.
On June 17, Aetna denied the coverage, saying that clinical documentation hadn’t been submitted, the hospital spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that the insurer did not offer an opportunity for a hospital physician to speak to a doctor from the insurance company about the request, a process known as a peer-to-peer review.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Harvard University and the Trump administration are getting close to an agreement that would require the Ivy League university to pay $500 million to regain access to federal funding and to end investigations, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The framework is still being sorted out with significant gaps to close, but both sides have agreed on the financial figure and a settlement could be finalized in coming weeks, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Harvard declined to comment.
The agreement would end a monthslong battle that has tested the boundaries of the government’s authority over America’s universities. What began as an investigation into campus antisemitism escalated into an all-out feud as the Trump administration slashed more than $2.6 billion in research funding, ended federal contracts and attempted to block Harvard from hosting international students.

The university responded with a pair of lawsuits alleging illegal retaliation by the administration after Harvard rejected a set of demands that campus leaders viewed as a threat to academic freedom.
Details of the proposed framework were first reported by The New York Times.
A $500 million payment would be the largest sum yet as the administration pushes for financial penalties in its settlements with elite universities. Columbia University agreed to pay the government $200 million as part of an agreement restoring access to federal funding, while Brown University separately agreed to pay $50 million to Rhode Island workforce development organizations.
Details have not been finalized on where Harvard’s potential payment would go, the person said.
The Republican president has been pushing to reform prestigious universities that he decries as bastions of liberal ideology.

His administration has cut funding to several Ivy League schools while pressing demands in line with his political campaign. None has been targeted as frequently or as heavily as Harvard, the richest U.S. university with an endowment valued at $53 billion.
More than a dozen Democrats in Congress who attended Harvard cautioned against a settlement on Aug. 1, warning the university it may warrant “rigorous Congressional oversight and inquiry.” Capitulating to political demands, they said, would set a dangerous precedent across all of higher education.

The report from Defend Public Health, a new organization of about 3,000 health professionals and allies, is an attempt to get ahead of misinformation and lack of information from health officials.
In an effort to keep making progress in public health, Defend Public Health’s report was slated to coincide with that of the anticipated second US report to “make America healthy again” (Maha). The first Maha report was released in May, and a second report was expected this week – but amid turmoil at the health agencies, it has reportedly been delayed for several weeks.
“The Maha report is essentially a distraction from the real causes of poor health,” said Elizabeth Jacobs, professor emerita at the University of Arizona and a founding member of Defend Public Health.
“This administration does not want to address things like poverty and education and access to healthcare. Instead, they’re distracting the public with information on solutions to problems that don’t actually exist. When the foundation of your policy is not evidence-based, it will collapse.”
The Defend Public Health report diverges from the previous Maha focus on issues such as processed foods and environmental chemicals, but it covers familiar ground in public health.
The group highlights the importance of food safety, security and access to food, including through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), and improved opportunities for physical activity.
They seek to ensure equitable access to vaccines; expand access to healthcare, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare access; and build strategies for clean air.
The report also recommends fully funding scientific research and public health systems; combatting scientific misinformation, including from the US government; and strengthening pandemic preparedness. They call for reductions in gun violence, now the number one cause of death for children.
And their last recommendation is to remove Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), from office, calling his removal “the single most important step toward improving the health of Americans”.
The recommendations are exactly what the US needs to address to become healthier, said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association (APHA). If you “look at the things that actually kill people, from the 10 leading causes of death, that is indeed the right list”.
The US spends twice as much on healthcare as the next industrialized country, despite having poorer health outcomes, Benjamin pointed out.
“The fracturing of our healthcare system undermines the accessibility of healthcare,” Benjamin said before noting that the US also spends less than other countries on the social determinants of health and social supports, and invests less in primary care and prevention.
Such gaps are getting worse under the second Trump administration, with huge cuts to Medicaid, affordable housing and nutrition programs like Snap.
“If they’re serious about making America healthy again, I would suggest that we first begin by feeding children,” Jacobs said. “When, for example, RFK Jr is talking about food dyes, I don’t think that that is anywhere near as important as the fact that 13 million children in the United States do not know where their next meal is coming from.”
Scientific misinformation is an “existential threat” to Americans, and the US government is a “major source” of misinformation and disinformation now, Jacobs said.
The first Maha report “contains misinformation and uses references that don’t even exist”, she noted. The Defend Public Health report has a tongue-in-cheek note that it was “created by real human experts relying on real rigorous data”.
Jacobs recommended working with social media companies, “one of the biggest amplifiers of misinformation”, to address the spread of harmful information. Educating children on how to evaluate the quality and accuracy of information is also important, she said.
But one of the biggest purveyors of health misinformation is Kennedy himself.
“Everything that he is doing is horrifying,” Jacobs said. “There is a saying in public health, ‘saving lives a million at a time’, and he is doing the opposite of that.”
She called him a “genuine threat” who was “devastating” public health.
“He has no knowledge, training or experience in any type of science. He’s never done an experiment, he’s never written a paper, he’s never gotten a grant to study anything. He has no understanding of the underlying causes of poor health in the United States,” Jacobs said.
Defend Public Health launched in November, after Trump’s re-election because, as Jacobs said, “it was very clear to us that public health specifically was going to be under attack.
“We knew that it was going to be a tough fight. I don’t think that any of us knew how bad this was going to get, how quickly. But we are doing everything in our power to support our fellow researchers, public health workers, anybody that we can, and also continue to get accurate information out to the public,” Jacobs said.
The group joins other established health organizations as well as other newcomers like the Vaccine Integrity Project to serve as reliable sources of information.
There’s a long history of groups like these providing outside perspectives on official recommendations, Benjamin said. But the federal government is uniquely positioned to speak to the health of all Americans.
“Pediatricians certainly have the nation’s trust around vaccines for kids, but there’s a big debate about at what point does a kid become an adolescent, become an adult? At what point do they go into the adult health system?” he said.
That creates confusion around which advice a patient should follow. The same may be true of a patient who becomes pregnant, or someone who may fall under the purview of multiple health organizations. It’s not always easy to know who belongs in which group.
“We have to be careful that each of these private sector organizations align our recommendations, so that we don’t further confuse the public,” Benjamin said.
Yet, Benjamin continued, “as the federal government withdraws in its responsibility to protect the public, groups like ours will become more influential in filling that void until we can get the federal government again to step up into that place as a trusted adviser.”
Benjamin and Jacobs – and other experts in these groups – hope that the federal government will once again become a source of reliable information.
“We really wanted to start building a framework so that we’re ready when we have the opportunity to start putting some of our policy recommendations in place,” Jacobs said.
“There is just rampant chaos right now around public health and science related to this administration, and we have got to stand firm and keep bringing the conversation back to the actual causes of poor health among Americans. I can’t control what the government is going to decide to do. What we can do is continue to provide accurate information to the public.”",The Guardian,[],"['US', 'Robert F Kennedy Jr', 'the US Department of Health and Human Services', 'HHS', 'Defend Public Health', 'Defend Public Health’s', 'US', 'America', 'Maha', 'Maha', 'Maha', 'Elizabeth Jacobs', 'emerita', 'the University of Arizona', 'Defend Public Health', 'The Defend Public Health', 'Maha', 'the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program', 'US', 'Robert F Kennedy Jr', 'the US Department of Health and Human Services', 'HHS', 'US', 'Georges Benjamin', 'the American Public Health Association', 'APHA', 'US', 'Benjamin', 'Benjamin', 'US', 'Trump', 'Medicaid', 'Snap', 'America', 'Jacobs', 'RFK Jr', 'the United States', 'Scientific', 'US', 'Jacobs', 'Maha', 'The Defend Public Health', 'Jacobs', 'Kennedy', 'Jacobs', 'the United States', 'Jacobs', 'Defend Public Health', 'Trump', 'Jacobs', 'Jacobs', 'the Vaccine Integrity Project', 'Benjamin', 'Benjamin', 'Benjamin', 'Benjamin', 'Jacobs', 'Jacobs']","‘Distracting the public’: group of health professionals call for RFK Jr to be removed.

The first Maha report was released in May, and a second report was expected this week – but amid turmoil at the health agencies, it has reportedly been delayed for several weeks.
“The Maha report is essentially a distraction from the real causes of poor health,” said Elizabeth Jacobs, professor emerita at the University of Arizona and a founding member of Defend Public Health.
“This administration does not want to address things like poverty and education and access to healthcare. Instead, they’re distracting the public with information on solutions to problems that don’t actually exist. When the foundation of your policy is not evidence-based, it will collapse.”
The Defend Public Health report diverges from the previous Maha focus on issues such as processed foods and environmental chemicals, but it covers familiar ground in public health.
The group highlights the importance of food safety, security and access to food, including through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), and improved opportunities for physical activity.
They seek to ensure equitable access to vaccines; expand access to healthcare, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare access; and build strategies for clean air.
The report also recommends fully funding scientific research and public health systems; combatting scientific misinformation, including from the US government; and strengthening pandemic preparedness. They call for reductions in gun violence, now the number one cause of death for children.
And their last recommendation is to remove Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), from office, calling his removal “the single most important step toward improving the health of Americans”.
The recommendations are exactly what the US needs to address to become healthier, said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association (APHA). If you “look at the things that actually kill people, from the 10 leading causes of death, that is indeed the right list”.
The US spends twice as much on healthcare as the next industrialized country, despite having poorer health outcomes, Benjamin pointed out.
“The fracturing of our healthcare system undermines the accessibility of healthcare,” Benjamin said before noting that the US also spends less than other countries on the social determinants of health and social supports, and invests less in primary care and prevention.
Such gaps are getting worse under the second Trump administration, with huge cuts to Medicaid, affordable housing and nutrition programs like Snap.
“If they’re serious about making America healthy again, I would suggest that we first begin by feeding children,” Jacobs said. “When, for example, RFK Jr is talking about food dyes, I don’t think that that is anywhere near as important as the fact that 13 million children in the United States do not know where their next meal is coming from.”
Scientific misinformation is an “existential threat” to Americans, and the US government is a “major source” of misinformation and disinformation now, Jacobs said.
The first Maha report “contains misinformation and uses references that don’t even exist”, she noted. The Defend Public Health report has a tongue-in-cheek note that it was “created by real human experts relying on real rigorous data”.
Jacobs recommended working with social media companies, “one of the biggest amplifiers of misinformation”, to address the spread of harmful information. Educating children on how to evaluate the quality and accuracy of information is also important, she said.
But one of the biggest purveyors of health misinformation is Kennedy himself.
“Everything that he is doing is horrifying,” Jacobs said. “There is a saying in public health, ‘saving lives a million at a time’, and he is doing the opposite of that.”
She called him a “genuine threat” who was “devastating” public health.
“He has no knowledge, training or experience in any type of science. He’s never done an experiment, he’s never written a paper, he’s never gotten a grant to study anything. He has no understanding of the underlying causes of poor health in the United States,” Jacobs said.
Defend Public Health launched in November, after Trump’s re-election because, as Jacobs said, “it was very clear to us that public health specifically was going to be under attack.
“We knew that it was going to be a tough fight. I don’t think that any of us knew how bad this was going to get, how quickly. But we are doing everything in our power to support our fellow researchers, public health workers, anybody that we can, and also continue to get accurate information out to the public,” Jacobs said.
The group joins other established health organizations as well as other newcomers like the Vaccine Integrity Project to serve as reliable sources of information.
There’s a long history of groups like these providing outside perspectives on official recommendations, Benjamin said. But the federal government is uniquely positioned to speak to the health of all Americans.
“Pediatricians certainly have the nation’s trust around vaccines for kids, but there’s a big debate about at what point does a kid become an adolescent, become an adult? At what point do they go into the adult health system?” he said.
That creates confusion around which advice a patient should follow. The same may be true of a patient who becomes pregnant, or someone who may fall under the purview of multiple health organizations. It’s not always easy to know who belongs in which group.
“We have to be careful that each of these private sector organizations align our recommendations, so that we don’t further confuse the public,” Benjamin said.
Yet, Benjamin continued, “as the federal government withdraws in its responsibility to protect the public, groups like ours will become more influential in filling that void until we can get the federal government again to step up into that place as a trusted adviser.”
Benjamin and Jacobs – and other experts in these groups – hope that the federal government will once again become a source of reliable information.
“We really wanted to start building a framework so that we’re ready when we have the opportunity to start putting some of our policy recommendations in place,” Jacobs said.
“There is just rampant chaos right now around public health and science related to this administration, and we have got to stand firm and keep bringing the conversation back to the actual causes of poor health among Americans. I can’t control what the government is going to decide to do. What we can do is continue to provide accurate information to the public.”",0.0,1.0,Mental Health Crises,1.9,,0.0,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 09:00:50 GMT",12.0,,27.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,,0.0,3.0,1.9,Mental Health Crises,,2025-08-27 00:51:36.891979+00:00,1,2025-08-27 00:51:36.891956+00:00,,,4950.0,,Mental Health Crises,mental health crises,Mental Health Crises,1.0,,,,,,,,,,

WASHINGTON (AP) — Harvard University and the Trump administration are getting close to an agreement that would require the Ivy League university to pay $500 million to regain access to federal funding and to end investigations, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The framework is still being sorted out with significant gaps to close, but both sides have agreed on the financial figure and a settlement could be finalized in coming weeks, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Harvard declined to comment.
The agreement would end a monthslong battle that has tested the boundaries of the government’s authority over America’s universities. What began as an investigation into campus antisemitism escalated into an all-out feud as the Trump administration slashed more than $2.6 billion in research funding, ended federal contracts and attempted to block Harvard from hosting international students.

The university responded with a pair of lawsuits alleging illegal retaliation by the administration after Harvard rejected a set of demands that campus leaders viewed as a threat to academic freedom.
Details of the proposed framework were first reported by The New York Times.
A $500 million payment would be the largest sum yet as the administration pushes for financial penalties in its settlements with elite universities. Columbia University agreed to pay the government $200 million as part of an agreement restoring access to federal funding, while Brown University separately agreed to pay $50 million to Rhode Island workforce development organizations.
Details have not been finalized on where Harvard’s potential payment would go, the person said.
The Republican president has been pushing to reform prestigious universities that he decries as bastions of liberal ideology.

His administration has cut funding to several Ivy League schools while pressing demands in line with his political campaign. None has been targeted as frequently or as heavily as Harvard, the richest U.S. university with an endowment valued at $53 billion.
More than a dozen Democrats in Congress who attended Harvard cautioned against a settlement on Aug. 1, warning the university it may warrant “rigorous Congressional oversight and inquiry.” Capitulating to political demands, they said, would set a dangerous precedent across all of higher education.

Known as the Human Exploration Rover Challenge, student rovers should be capable of traversing a course while completing mission tasks. The challenge handbook has guidelines for remote-controlled and human-powered divisions.
“Last year, we saw a lot of success with the debut of our remote-controlled division and the addition of middle school teams,” said Vemitra Alexander, the activity lead for the challenge at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “We’re looking forward to building on both our remote-controlled and human-powered divisions with new challenges for the students, including rover automation.”
This year’s mission mimics future Artemis missions to the lunar surface. Teams are challenged to test samples of soil, water, and air from sites along a half-mile course that includes a simulated field of asteroid debris, boulders, erosion ruts, crevasses, and an ancient streambed. Human-powered rover teams will play the role of two astronauts in a lunar terrain vehicle and must use a custom-built task tool to manually collect samples needed for testing. Remote-controlled rover teams will act as a pressurized rover, and the rover itself will contain the tools necessary to collect and test samples onboard.
“NASA’s Human Exploration Rover Challenge creates opportunities for students to develop the skills they need to be successful STEM professionals,” said Alexander. “This challenge will help students see themselves in the mission and give them the hands-on experience needed to advance technology and become the workforce of tomorrow.”
Seventy-five teams comprised of more than 500 students participated in the agency’s 31st rover challenge in 2025. Participants represented 35 colleges and universities, 38 high schools, and two middle schools, across 20 states, Puerto Rico, and 16 nations around the world.
The 32nd annual competition will culminate with an in-person event April 9-11, 2026, at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center near NASA Marshall.
The rover challenge is one of NASA’s Artemis Student Challenges, reflecting the goals of the Artemis campaign, which seeks to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, technology advancement, and to learn how to live and work on another world as we prepare for human missions to Mars. NASA uses such challenges to encourage students to pursue degrees and careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
Since its inception in 1994, more than 15,000 students have participated in the rover challenge – with many former students now working at NASA or within the aerospace industry.

While the article doesn't specifically mention impacts at other universities, the health threat applies to all institutions in affected regions, suggesting moderate sector-wide risk.
",Scientists warn of invasive longhorned tick carrying debilitating Ehrlichiosis infection,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/climate-change/longhorned-tick-ehrlichiosis-spreads-climate-change-rcna223487,2025-08-14 17:05:10,Climate change may be helping longhorned ticks spread Ehrlichiosis across the U.S. more effectively. The infection hospitalizes around 60% of patients and can be fatal.,"An invasive tick species is creeping its way into more parts of the country as warming temperatures help it spread a little-known infection that can leave people with debilitating symptoms and, in rare cases, dead.
In May, scientists at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven discovered for the first time that the longhorned tick had become a carrier for the bacterium that causes the Ehrlichiosis infection. With cases already on the rise, that was a big cause of concern.
“I am afraid to say that it is a storm brewing,” said Goudarz Molaei, the director of the lab’s tick-testing program. “Climate change eventually will almost eliminate winter in our region. And this tick, like other tick species, will be active year-round.”
Warming temperatures, which have already translated into shorter winters, allow the longhorned tick and other tick species to wake up early from hibernation, increasing the risk of getting bitten.
The longhorned tick, which is native to East Asia, first invaded places like Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. It has now been detected in at least 21 states, with Michigan reporting its first sighting at the end of June. Researchers aren’t sure how the tick made it to the United States, but it’s likely it arrived on the backs of imported livestock or other animals.
In 2017, scientists identified the country’s first longhorned tick in New Jersey, though it’s likely the species has been in the United States since at least 2010.
“The fact it was here for so long without us actually knowing about it was really a wakeup call,” said Dana Price, an associate research professor in the entomology department at Rutgers University.
Modeling indicates areas from southern Canada throughout the continental United States are environmentally suitable to the longhorned tick.
That means the threat is twofold: The longhorned’s geographic range is expanding, and so is the time that it’s active and able to transmit disease, scientists said.
Ehrlichiosis is becoming so prevalent that there is a region of the country unofficially named after it: The “Ehrlichiosis Belt” stretches from as far north as Connecticut and New York to as far west as Arkansas.
The lone star and blacklegged ticks have long carried Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the bacterium that causes Ehrlichiosis. The infection sends about 60% of patients to the hospital and kills about 1 in 100 patients, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Infected people will typically experience fever, chills, muscle aches, headaches and fatigue one to two weeks after having been bitten. But if people aren’t treated quickly, the infection can sometimes lead to brain and nervous system damage, respiratory failure, uncontrolled bleeding and organ failure.
The number of Ehrlichiosis cases has risen steadily since 2000, when the CDC reported 200 cases, compared with 2,093 in 2019. Studies suggest that the number of annual Ehrlichiosis cases is grossly underreported, with one study from Rutgers University researchers saying 99% of cases go undetected.
The CDC reported this month that there were more emergency room visits in July for tick bites than the past eight Julys. In early July, officials closed Pleasure Beach, a popular swim spot in Bridgeport, Connecticut, for the summer after they discovered an infestation of several tick species, including the longhorned tick.
Manisha Juthani, the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Public Health, said that as climate change makes “tick season” less predictable, Connecticut residents should take precautions like wearing long pants and tucking them into their socks and conducting tick checks on family members and pets after having been outdoors for extended periods of time.
“The reality is that with the changes we’re seeing in climate, we have to be more prepared and more aware of the infections and the pathogens that we can be exposed to by being outside and potentially being aware of the things that can really cause the most harm to people,” Juthani said.
While longhorned ticks often prefer the blood of livestock to humans, entomologists say their unique biology makes them a formidable public health hazard. They can establish populations of thousands from a single female because, like bees, they have the ability to reproduce without mates.
They can also ingest and become carriers for pathogens typically carried by other tick species if they happen to feed on the same host. The process, known as co-feeding transmission, is common among most tick species.
Molaei said his recent discovery of the Ehrlichiosis-causing bacterium in the longhorned tick raises concerns about what other pathogens the tick may be able to contract and transmit to humans. The longhorned tick and the lone star tick, one of the original carriers of Ehrlichia, both feed on similar hosts, like white-tailed deer.
“We live in this part of the world with several important tick species, and we have to learn how to live with this many ticks,” Molaei said. “And the key is to protect ourselves.”
The World Health Organization reports that more than 17% of infectious diseases globally are transmitted through vectors, intermediary animals that ferry viruses, bacteria and other pathogens from one animal to the next. Tick-borne diseases in the United States accounted for 77% of vector-borne disease reports from 2004 to 2016, with cases more than doubling in the last 13 years, according to data collected by the CDC.
Jennifer Platt was bitten by a tick during that time. She contracted Ehrlichiosis from a tick bite in North Carolina in the summer of 2011.
When she couldn’t pick up and carry her 2-year-old son, a friend who is a nurse suggested she go to the hospital immediately. The friend suspected Platt might have a tick-borne infection.
Platt was sick and on antibiotics for months after her diagnosis. Her shoulder locked because of the infection — a rare but contractable chronic symptom of tick-borne disease — leading to months of physical therapy and putting her out of work for three months.
It took her more than a year to fully recover from the lasting impacts of the infection.
“The best way I’d describe it,” she said, “is I felt like death.”
A few years after she started feeling better, she was diagnosed with Lyme and Babesiosis diseases — which she attributes to the same tick bite.
Platt, who co-founded the nonprofit advocacy organization Tick-Borne Conditions United, said she hopes the recent discovery of the Ehrlichia bacterium in the longhorned tick will help raise awareness among doctors and the general public about the threat of tick-borne diseases, especially little-known ones like Ehrlichiosis.

An invasive tick species is creeping its way into more parts of the country as warming temperatures help it spread a little-known infection that can leave people with debilitating symptoms and, in rare cases, dead.
In May, scientists at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven discovered for the first time that the longhorned tick had become a carrier for the bacterium that causes the Ehrlichiosis infection. With cases already on the rise, that was a big cause of concern.
“I am afraid to say that it is a storm brewing,” said Goudarz Molaei, the director of the lab’s tick-testing program. “Climate change eventually will almost eliminate winter in our region. And this tick, like other tick species, will be active year-round.”
Warming temperatures, which have already translated into shorter winters, allow the longhorned tick and other tick species to wake up early from hibernation, increasing the risk of getting bitten.
The longhorned tick, which is native to East Asia, first invaded places like Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. It has now been detected in at least 21 states, with Michigan reporting its first sighting at the end of June.

When she couldn’t pick up and carry her 2-year-old son, a friend who is a nurse suggested she go to the hospital immediately. The friend suspected Platt might have a tick-borne infection.
Platt was sick and on antibiotics for months after her diagnosis. Her shoulder locked because of the infection — a rare but contractable chronic symptom of tick-borne disease — leading to months of physical therapy and putting her out of work for three months.
It took her more than a year to fully recover from the lasting impacts of the infection.
“The best way I’d describe it,” she said, “is I felt like death.”
A few years after she started feeling better, she was diagnosed with Lyme and Babesiosis diseases — which she attributes to the same tick bite.
Platt, who co-founded the nonprofit advocacy organization Tick-Borne Conditions United, said she hopes the recent discovery of the Ehrlichia bacterium in the longhorned tick will help raise awareness among doctors and the general public about the threat of tick-borne diseases, especially little-known ones like Ehrlichiosis.

An invasive tick species is creeping its way into more parts of the country as warming temperatures help it spread a little-known infection that can leave people with debilitating symptoms and, in rare cases, dead.
In May, scientists at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven discovered for the first time that the longhorned tick had become a carrier for the bacterium that causes the Ehrlichiosis infection. With cases already on the rise, that was a big cause of concern.
“I am afraid to say that it is a storm brewing,” said Goudarz Molaei, the director of the lab’s tick-testing program. “Climate change eventually will almost eliminate winter in our region. And this tick, like other tick species, will be active year-round.”
Warming temperatures, which have already translated into shorter winters, allow the longhorned tick and other tick species to wake up early from hibernation, increasing the risk of getting bitten.
The longhorned tick, which is native to East Asia, first invaded places like Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. It has now been detected in at least 21 states, with Michigan reporting its first sighting at the end of June. Researchers aren’t sure how the tick made it to the United States, but it’s likely it arrived on the backs of imported livestock or other animals.
In 2017, scientists identified the country’s first longhorned tick in New Jersey, though it’s likely the species has been in the United States since at least 2010.
“The fact it was here for so long without us actually knowing about it was really a wakeup call,” said Dana Price, an associate research professor in the entomology department at Rutgers University.
Modeling indicates areas from southern Canada throughout the continental United States are environmentally suitable to the longhorned tick.
That means the threat is twofold: The longhorned’s geographic range is expanding, and so is the time that it’s active and able to transmit disease, scientists said.
Ehrlichiosis is becoming so prevalent that there is a region of the country unofficially named after it: The “Ehrlichiosis Belt” stretches from as far north as Connecticut and New York to as far west as Arkansas.
The lone star and blacklegged ticks have long carried Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the bacterium that causes Ehrlichiosis. The infection sends about 60% of patients to the hospital and kills about 1 in 100 patients, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Infected people will typically experience fever, chills, muscle aches, headaches and fatigue one to two weeks after having been bitten. But if people aren’t treated quickly, the infection can sometimes lead to brain and nervous system damage, respiratory failure, uncontrolled bleeding and organ failure.
The number of Ehrlichiosis cases has risen steadily since 2000, when the CDC reported 200 cases, compared with 2,093 in 2019. Studies suggest that the number of annual Ehrlichiosis cases is grossly underreported, with one study from Rutgers University researchers saying 99% of cases go undetected.
The CDC reported this month that there were more emergency room visits in July for tick bites than the past eight Julys. In early July, officials closed Pleasure Beach, a popular swim spot in Bridgeport, Connecticut, for the summer after they discovered an infestation of several tick species, including the longhorned tick.
Manisha Juthani, the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Public Health, said that as climate change makes “tick season” less predictable, Connecticut residents should take precautions like wearing long pants and tucking them into their socks and conducting tick checks on family members and pets after having been outdoors for extended periods of time.
“The reality is that with the changes we’re seeing in climate, we have to be more prepared and more aware of the infections and the pathogens that we can be exposed to by being outside and potentially being aware of the things that can really cause the most harm to people,” Juthani said.
While longhorned ticks often prefer the blood of livestock to humans, entomologists say their unique biology makes them a formidable public health hazard. They can establish populations of thousands from a single female because, like bees, they have the ability to reproduce without mates.
They can also ingest and become carriers for pathogens typically carried by other tick species if they happen to feed on the same host. The process, known as co-feeding transmission, is common among most tick species.
Molaei said his recent discovery of the Ehrlichiosis-causing bacterium in the longhorned tick raises concerns about what other pathogens the tick may be able to contract and transmit to humans. The longhorned tick and the lone star tick, one of the original carriers of Ehrlichia, both feed on similar hosts, like white-tailed deer.
“We live in this part of the world with several important tick species, and we have to learn how to live with this many ticks,” Molaei said. “And the key is to protect ourselves.”
The World Health Organization reports that more than 17% of infectious diseases globally are transmitted through vectors, intermediary animals that ferry viruses, bacteria and other pathogens from one animal to the next. Tick-borne diseases in the United States accounted for 77% of vector-borne disease reports from 2004 to 2016, with cases more than doubling in the last 13 years, according to data collected by the CDC.

A federal judge has struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation’s schools and universities
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Thursday struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation’s schools and universities.
In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.
The guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department’s anti-DEI measures.
The ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government’s actions in a February lawsuit.
The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all “race-based decision-making” or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It’s part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.
The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were “good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.”
Gallagher, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, rejected the government’s argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.
“It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,” Gallagher wrote.
Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, called it an important victory over the administration's attack on DEI.
“Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration’s war on education, and today the people won,” said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO.
A statement from the Education Department on Thursday said it was disappointed in the ruling but that “judicial action enjoining or setting aside this guidance has not stopped our ability to enforce Title VI protections for students at an unprecedented level.”
The conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law.
The memo dramatically expanded the government’s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding “race-based preferences” of any kind.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department’s Office for Civil Rights.
A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using “illegal DEI practices.” Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.
In total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government’s approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.
The memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.
In its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing “unclear and highly subjective” limits on schools across the country. It said teachers and professors had to “choose between chilling their constitutionally protected speech and association or risk losing federal funds and being subject to prosecution.”

“It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,” Gallagher wrote.
Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, called it an important victory over the administration's attack on DEI.
“Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration’s war on education, and today the people won,” said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO.
A statement from the Education Department on Thursday said it was disappointed in the ruling but that “judicial action enjoining or setting aside this guidance has not stopped our ability to enforce Title VI protections for students at an unprecedented level.”
The conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law.
The memo dramatically expanded the government’s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding “race-based preferences” of any kind.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department’s Office for Civil Rights.
A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using “illegal DEI practices.” Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.
In total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government’s approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.
The memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.
In its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing “unclear and highly subjective” limits on schools across the country. It said teachers and professors had to “choose between chilling their constitutionally protected speech and association or risk losing federal funds and being subject to prosecution.”

Judge strikes down Trump administration guidance against diversity programs
A federal judge has struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation’s schools and universities
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Thursday struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation’s schools and universities.
In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.
The guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department’s anti-DEI measures.
The ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government’s actions in a February lawsuit.
The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all “race-based decision-making” or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It’s part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.
The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were “good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.”
Gallagher, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, rejected the government’s argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.

Allegheny County is increasing air quality monitoring after an explosion at a U.S. Steel plant south of Pittsburgh killed two people and injured more than 10 others
The Pennsylvania county where an explosion at a U.S. Steel plant south of Pittsburgh killed two people and injured more than 10 others announced Thursday that it is stepping up air quality monitoring in the area of the sprawling facility that has a troubled environmental record.
The Allegheny County Health Department announced that mobile air units provided by the state and Carnegie Mellon University will be stationed in the Mon Valley where the plant is Thursday and Friday. The county said these measures are part of its ongoing investigation into Monday's explosion at Clairton Coke Works.
The county said the measures go “well beyond the normal and rigorous regulatory air quality monitoring” and will assess parts of the valley for different types of pollutants such as volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 pollutants and sulfur dioxide.
After Monday’s blast, the county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors. The department lifted the advisory after its monitors didn’t detect levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards.
The Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office also confirmed Thursday that the second person who died in the blast was Steven Menefee, 52, of Clairton. Earlier, the county medical examiner’s office identified one of the dead as Timothy Quinn, 39.
U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said Tuesday the company is working closely with local, state and federal authorities. He would not speculate about the cause of the explosion.
The massive plant along the Monongahela River in Clairton converts coal to coke, a key component in the steelmaking process. The facility is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania.
To make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what is known as coke gas — a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
The plant has a long history of environmental problems, especially fouling the air in communities nearby the sprawling plant.
In 2018, a Christmas Eve fire damaged pollution-control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide, according to a subsequent lawsuit. The fire prompted Allegheny County to warn residents to limit outdoor activities. Residents said it was hard to breathe for weeks afterward and that the air felt acidic and smelled like rotten eggs. U.S. Steel settled a lawsuit last year with an agreement to spend $19.5 million in equipment upgrades and $5 million on local clean air efforts and programs.
Dr. Deborah Gentile, the medical director of Community Partners in Asthma Care, studied asthma levels after the 2018 fire and found twice as many patients sought medical treatment.
In 2019, U.S. Steel agreed to settle a lawsuit regarding air pollution from Clairton for $8.5 million.
The concerns about air quality also come as the federal Environmental Protection Agency moves to postpone new hazardous air pollution standards for coke plants, like Clairton.
Matthew Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, a public health advocacy group in Pittsburgh, said the regulations were deemed to be almost insignificant to operational costs and would have helped protect the public with air quality monitoring.
The regulation would have required — like is already required at refineries all over the United States — fence-line monitoring for hazardous air pollutants at the Clairton plant, Mehalik said.
That information would have been “incredibly useful” when the explosion happened on Monday, Mehalik said.

The findings are a major step toward determining the mechanism by which the chemicals cause disease and could help doctors identify, detect and treat health problems for those exposed to Pfas before the issues advance. The research may also point toward other diseases potentially caused by Pfas that have not yet been identified, the authors said.
The study is among the first to examine how Pfas chemicals impact gene activity, called epigenetics.
“This gives us a hint as to which genes and which Pfas might be important,” said Melissa Furlong, a University of Arizona College of Public Health Pfas researcher and study lead author.
Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment
The study checked the blood of about 300 firefighters from four departments across the country who were exposed to high levels of Pfas. The chemicals are the main ingredient in most firefighting foam, and are frequently used in “turnout gear” worn by firefighters because of their heat repelling properties
Furlong said she was surprised to find the number of genes and biological pathways that were impacted by Pfas, which suggests the chemicals may cause or contribute to a broad range of health problems. The study did not prove the chemicals cause certain diseases, but findings point to biological changes that might precede disease.
Genes play a range of roles in developing or preventing disease, and Pfas essentially change the way the genes are supposed to act, Furlong said. A gene may act as tumor suppressor, but the Pfas interferes with how it expresses, which affects whether cancer develops, or the type of cancer.
For example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development. Branched forms of PFOS were linked to changes in five other genes, including some that regulate cancer development.
Different Pfas and chemical structures were found to affect different genes, and were associated with different health outcomes. Not all compounds impacted gene expressions.
The research found connections among Pfas-related gene changes and biological pathways involved in leukemia, as well as bladder, liver, thyroid and breast cancers. Other genes and biological pathways were involved in Alzheimer’s disease, and autoimmune and infectious diseases such as lupus, asthma and tuberculosis.
Furlong said it remains unclear at which step in the biological processes disease is triggered, but the picture is clear enough to point to possible treatments. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop drugs that could alter gene activity and potentially prevent Pfas-linked disease from developing.",The Guardian,[],"['Pfas', 'Pfas', 'Pfas', 'Pfas', 'Pfas', 'Melissa Furlong', 'University of Arizona College of Public Health Pfas', 'Pfas', 'Pfas', 'Furlong', 'Pfas', 'Pfas', 'Furlong', 'Pfas', 'PFOS', 'Different Pfas', 'Pfas', 'Furlong']","Exposure to some common Pfas changes gene activity, new study finds.

For example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development. Branched forms of PFOS were linked to changes in five other genes, including some that regulate cancer development.
Different Pfas and chemical structures were found to affect different genes, and were associated with different health outcomes. Not all compounds impacted gene expressions.
The research found connections among Pfas-related gene changes and biological pathways involved in leukemia, as well as bladder, liver, thyroid and breast cancers. Other genes and biological pathways were involved in Alzheimer’s disease, and autoimmune and infectious diseases such as lupus, asthma and tuberculosis.
Furlong said it remains unclear at which step in the biological processes disease is triggered, but the picture is clear enough to point to possible treatments.

“This gives us a hint as to which genes and which Pfas might be important,” said Melissa Furlong, a University of Arizona College of Public Health Pfas researcher and study lead author.
Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment
The study checked the blood of about 300 firefighters from four departments across the country who were exposed to high levels of Pfas.

But Donald Trump’s cuts to scientific research funding through federal agencies – including the National Intitute Health, the National Science Foundation, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Nasa – will undermine that goal and threaten the research environment that fostered the foundations of AI, experts in the field said.
Mark Histed, chief of the unit on neural computation and behavior at NIH, said that while the effects of funding cuts on AI might not be obvious in the next year or two, they threaten “the whole ecosystem that we have built around AI, that has been created by federal support”.
“What I see is an ecosystem, right? I see multiple different disciplines contributing different aspects to this process. I see academia playing a key role and industry playing a key role. And so as we look forward and we think about trying to advance AI, we need to be supporting that entire ecosystem,” Rebecca Willett, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago and faculty director of AI at the Data Science Institute, explained, echoing Histed.
Histed and Willett both believe that AI simply would not exist in its current form without federally funded research, and offered a variety of AI technologies and companies that owe their development to federal funding.
For example, self-driving cars rely on computer vision technology – federal funding has supported its development since the 1980s. Computer vision is the foundation for the vast majority of face and image recognition technologies. AlphaFold, which uses AI to help discover new medications, and Anthropic, which improves AI safety, including for the US Department of Defense, also exists thanks to federal support.
AI research often takes cues from other realms of science, which in turn can help foster AI, so cuts to other disciplines will affect the intelligence’s development. Histed points to the overlap between his field of neuroscience and AI.
“We’re just at the beginning of understanding how networks of connected neurons create functions like memory and cognition. And if you look at a machine learning network or an AI network, that is also the case,” he said.
Histed pointed out that federally funded research that brings these disciplines together has led to Nobel prize-winning work. Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield won the 2024 Nobel prize in physics for their work at the intersection of neuroscience and AI, and received support from the NSF.
Trump’s plan could also pose a threat to AI safety, which is essential to ensuring that AI is not only effective but that it operates within the boundaries of the law. The plan includes provisions to revise guidelines at the National Institute of Standards and Technology “to eliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change”. These are three of the most controversial aspects of AI, which has been demonstrated to show gender and racial bias in a variety of applications, including face recognition technology and popular applications like ChatGPT.
A recent study found that ChatGPT advises women to ask for less money than men when prompted for advice about salary expectations. Histed says that the field of AI safety is also closely linked with neuroscience, because understanding how human neural networks create bias can also help us understand how AI networks create bias.
Trump’s plan also calls for less red tape when it comes to building AI datacentres that can suck up huge amounts of energy. Willett said it was true that large-scale machine learning systems “come at an enormous cost. It’s a huge amount of energy, a huge amount of cooling.”
But, she added, AI companies themselves should still want to reduce those costs regardless of what Trump’s plan says.
“Not only do they have environmental impacts, but it’s expensive for the companies that are running these systems. And so I think across the AI community, people are invested in trying to make these systems more efficient,” Willett said.
Willett and Histed both say that the AI community will be under threat in the coming years if the federal government no longer funds their training at universities. Histed noted that the federally funded “talent pipeline” is “incredibly important”, adding “we train lots and lots and lots of people in neuroscience and related fields that are going directly to these tech companies. There’s tons of overlap. All the people who are leading the technical side of the AI revolution have had contact with the academic world that trained them and is supported by US federal funding.
“One of the big ways in which tech companies benefit from universities is that we train students, right?” Willett said. “And so they walk into these companies with cutting-edge skills that these companies need. And so right off the bat, I think universities are playing an essential role that’s important to industry.”",The Guardian,"['diversity, equity, and inclusion', 'university of chicago', 'nih']","['Trump', 'US', 'AI', 'China', 'Donald Trump’s', 'the National Intitute Health', 'the National Science Foundation', 'the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency', 'Nasa', 'AI', 'Mark Histed', 'NIH', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'Rebecca Willett', 'the University of Chicago', 'AI', 'the Data Science Institute', 'Histed', 'Willett', 'AI', 'AI', 'AlphaFold', 'AI', 'AI', 'the US Department of Defense', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'Geoffrey Hinton', 'John Hopfield', 'AI', 'NSF', 'Trump', 'AI', 'AI', 'the National Institute of Standards and Technology', 'Diversity, Equity', 'Inclusion', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'Trump', 'AI', 'Willett', 'Trump', 'AI', 'Willett', 'Willett', 'AI', 'US', 'Willett']","Trump cuts to science research threaten his administration’s own AI action plan.

Mark Histed, chief of the unit on neural computation and behavior at NIH, said that while the effects of funding cuts on AI might not be obvious in the next year or two, they threaten “the whole ecosystem that we have built around AI, that has been created by federal support”.
“What I see is an ecosystem, right? I see multiple different disciplines contributing different aspects to this process. I see academia playing a key role and industry playing a key role. And so as we look forward and we think about trying to advance AI, we need to be supporting that entire ecosystem,” Rebecca Willett, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago and faculty director of AI at the Data Science Institute, explained, echoing Histed.
Histed and Willett both believe that AI simply would not exist in its current form without federally funded research, and offered a variety of AI technologies and companies that owe their development to federal funding.
For example, self-driving cars rely on computer vision technology – federal funding has supported its development since the 1980s. Computer vision is the foundation for the vast majority of face and image recognition technologies. AlphaFold, which uses AI to help discover new medications, and Anthropic, which improves AI safety, including for the US Department of Defense, also exists thanks to federal support.
AI research often takes cues from other realms of science, which in turn can help foster AI, so cuts to other disciplines will affect the intelligence’s development. Histed points to the overlap between his field of neuroscience and AI.
“We’re just at the beginning of understanding how networks of connected neurons create functions like memory and cognition. And if you look at a machine learning network or an AI network, that is also the case,” he said.
Histed pointed out that federally funded research that brings these disciplines together has led to Nobel prize-winning work. Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield won the 2024 Nobel prize in physics for their work at the intersection of neuroscience and AI, and received support from the NSF.
Trump’s plan could also pose a threat to AI safety, which is essential to ensuring that AI is not only effective but that it operates within the boundaries of the law. The plan includes provisions to revise guidelines at the National Institute of Standards and Technology “to eliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change”. These are three of the most controversial aspects of AI, which has been demonstrated to show gender and racial bias in a variety of applications, including face recognition technology and popular applications like ChatGPT.
A recent study found that ChatGPT advises women to ask for less money than men when prompted for advice about salary expectations. Histed says that the field of AI safety is also closely linked with neuroscience, because understanding how human neural networks create bias can also help us understand how AI networks create bias.
Trump’s plan also calls for less red tape when it comes to building AI datacentres that can suck up huge amounts of energy. Willett said it was true that large-scale machine learning systems “come at an enormous cost. It’s a huge amount of energy, a huge amount of cooling.”
But, she added, AI companies themselves should still want to reduce those costs regardless of what Trump’s plan says.
“Not only do they have environmental impacts, but it’s expensive for the companies that are running these systems. And so I think across the AI community, people are invested in trying to make these systems more efficient,” Willett said.
Willett and Histed both say that the AI community will be under threat in the coming years if the federal government no longer funds their training at universities. Histed noted that the federally funded “talent pipeline” is “incredibly important”, adding “we train lots and lots and lots of people in neuroscience and related fields that are going directly to these tech companies. There’s tons of overlap. All the people who are leading the technical side of the AI revolution have had contact with the academic world that trained them and is supported by US federal funding.
“One of the big ways in which tech companies benefit from universities is that we train students, right?” Willett said. “And so they walk into these companies with cutting-edge skills that these companies need. And so right off the bat, I think universities are playing an essential role that’s important to industry.”",The Guardian,"['diversity, equity, and inclusion', 'university of chicago', 'nih']","['Trump', 'US', 'AI', 'China', 'Donald Trump’s', 'the National Intitute Health', 'the National Science Foundation', 'the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency', 'Nasa', 'AI', 'Mark Histed', 'NIH', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'Rebecca Willett', 'the University of Chicago', 'AI', 'the Data Science Institute', 'Histed', 'Willett', 'AI', 'AI', 'AlphaFold', 'AI', 'AI', 'the US Department of Defense', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'Geoffrey Hinton', 'John Hopfield', 'AI', 'NSF', 'Trump', 'AI', 'AI', 'the National Institute of Standards and Technology', 'Diversity, Equity', 'Inclusion', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'Trump', 'AI', 'Willett', 'Trump', 'AI', 'Willett', 'Willett', 'AI', 'US', 'Willett']","Trump cuts to science research threaten his administration’s own AI action plan.

Towards the end of July, the highly anticipated date for elections to the Dhaka University Central Students' Union was announced, delivering on a key promise of the interim government to restart the culture of student politics centred around students' union elections at the country's leading public universities.
Accordingly DU will hold its first students' union election in 6 years on September 9. The final voter list containing 39,775 eligible voters, of which 20,871 are male and 18,902 are female, was published this week.
On August 8, the Dhaka University unit of the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the BNP's student wing, sparked controversy by announcing convening committees for 18 residential halls, despite widespread opposition within the student body to the revival of hall-based politics following the July Uprising. Bangladeshis will recall the pivotal and absolutely critical date of July 17, 2024. On that day, in a sweeping escalation of the nationwide student movement, protesters expelled Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) activists from major public universities - including Dhaka University - and declared their campuses ""free from politics.""
It was a truly extraordinary turn of events. The previous day, blood had flowed for the first time since the start of the quota reform movement, with six people including Shaheed Abu Sayed, killed during nationwide protests that were met with fierce attacks allegedly carried out by ruling party affiliates, including BCL and Jubo League members. As of September 21, political activities by students and/or teachers and staff was ""banned"" in at least 33 higher education institutions in Bangladesh-19 public universities, four government colleges, and 10 government medical colleges. Students themselves demanded this ban, though some of them also think the ban is ill-judged and participation in ""healthy politics"" by students is essential.
A survey carried out by the Dhaka University Research Society (DURS), a voluntary body of student and faculty researchers, revealed that 83.8 percent of the students who participated in the survey opted for a total ban on campus politics. Another 16 percent wanted ""reformed"" student politics on campus, allowing activities with control. The survey was conducted between September 3-11 on 2,237 currently enrolled students.
The University Reform Initiative (URI), a platform of Dhaka University students that included some coordinators of the anti-discrimination student movement, put forward an eight-point proposal for reform, including prohibition of all forms of partisan politics in residential and academic areas on the Dhaka University campus and enabling all candidates to run independently in the DUCSU or hall union elections.
Dhaka University students protested at the vice-chancellor's residence, condemning the revival of hall politics after July's uprising. Protesters demanded the immediate withdrawal of the committees, arguing that DU students should only elect representatives through DUCSU elections, not serve political parties.
Similar protests occurred at Rokeya and Sufia Kamal halls. Umama Fatema, an anticipated DUCSU VP candidate, called the committees a ""betrayal"" of the July uprising, warning of ""strong measures"" if the committees are not halted.
The Bangladesh Democratic Student Council (BDSC) condemned the return of ""authoritarian student politics,"" with Convener Abdul Qader noting that economically vulnerable students become ""hostages"" to hall politics. Despite post-uprising agreements banning political activities in halls, BDSC alleged that multiple organizations have formed secret committees, ""completely disregarding student sentiment.""
BDSC warned of strong resistance if oppressive practices resume and called for dialogue to establish a proper campus politics framework.
A leadership incubator
Through its long yet chequered history, DUCSU has authored some glorious chapters in the history of Bangladesh. From fiery speeches and protest rallies on the DU campus to the corridors of parliament, DUCSU's influence over the life of the nation has been unmistakable - not just as a student body, but as a breeding ground of leadership, courage and conscientious rights-based movements from its birth. As a leadership incubator, it shaped many prominent figures who began their political life through activism on the DU campus.
It is known that before the establishment of DUCSU, 'Hall Unions' were formed in the three founding halls of the university. Among these, the first 'Hall Union' was formed at Muslim Hall (Salimullah Muslim Hall). Later, a decision was made at a meeting of teachers held at Curzon Hall on December 1, 1922, to form a student union named 'Dhaka University Student Union' in the academic year 1923-24. Subsequently, in the academic year 1953-54, through an amendment of the constitution, the previous name was changed to the present form.
According to political analysts, several factors contribute to DUCSU's role in grooming national leaders. From the beginning, DUCSU has contributed to many democratic movements. Its political environment and students' active participation on issues make it a political incubator.
Dr. Rushad Faridi, assistant professor of economics at DU, said: ""Any organisation is a place for developing leadership qualities. Various posts in DUCSU and the hall's unions are platforms for practicing and nurturing leadership. I wouldn't say only DUCSU is a place for producing leaders-any organisation, no matter how small, can serve as a ground for leadership development.""
In its 104-year history, DUCSU elections have been held a total of 37 times. Among these, 29 were held during the British and Pakistan periods. Yet, according to the University Ordinance of 1973, DUCSU and hall union elections are supposed to be held every year.
Before the 2019 election that was won by Nurul Huq Nur, the last DUCSU election was held six months before the fall of the Ershad regime, in June 1990. Yet strangely, the advent of democracy on the national stage spelled doomsday for DUCSU and its equivalent bodies in the other public universities, as nearly all of them went into limbo around the same time. Why or how this was allowed to happen, is still worthy of deeper study.
One theory is that the university administrations failed to organise the elections under pressure from the ruling parties, or their student wings. Yet history tells us that when what would've been the first DUCSU election following the fall of Ershad was announced in 1994, it eventually couldn't be held due to opposition from the Chhatra League. It was the same again the following year. Whatever the reason may have been, one thing that almost everyone can agree on is that the absence of SU elections has a very negative impact on the overall standard of student politics.
""We know why elections are not held. One major reason elections have not taken place since the 1990s is that whichever party comes to power, its affiliated student organisations do not want elections as they already hold leadership positions on campus. They fear that if elections are held, leadership might pass into others hands. As a result, the campus ends up under the control of the ruling party. No work is then done to protect the interests of general students.""
He added that the path for the development of new student leadership or those who want to engage in genuine politics gets blocked. ""Consequently, we don't see any new energetic and mature politicians at the national level either. Thus, a culture of thuggery is practiced on campus, and this trend is reflected in national politics as well.""
Years of Silence
In its 104-year history, DUCSU elections have been held a total of 37 times. Among these, 29 were held during the British and Pakistan periods. Yet, according to the University Ordinance of 1973, DUCSU and hall union elections are supposed to be held every year.
After the 1990 election, the last DUCSU election was held in 2019. There are allegations that due to pressure from the ruling party's student organisation and various quarters, the university administration could not organise the election. However, experts opine that there are harmful consequences of not holding the DUCSU election.
Rushad Faridi said that the absence of elections has a very negative impact. ""We know why elections are not held. One major reason elections have not taken place since the 1990s (till 2019) is that whichever party comes to power, its affiliated student organisations do not want elections as they already hold leadership positions on campus. They fear that if elections are held, leadership might pass into others hands. As a result, the campus ends up under the control of the ruling party. No work is then done to protect the interests of general students.""

""Consequently, we don't see any new energetic and mature politicians at the national level either. Thus, a culture of thuggery is practiced on campus, and this trend is reflected in national politics as well.""
How it can be different
A ban on campus student politics was first implemented by the country's leading tech institute, BUET, in the wake of Abrar Fahad's gruesome murder in 2019. Subsequently that was extended to many more campuses by the completely new reality of the July 17 settlement in 2024. It was the only way to spare our students the overbearing presence of Chhatra League, their absolute dominance and all of the ways in which it manifested, that only came out in the open for all to see with the murder of Abrar, in all our campuses. But it was not a permanent solution.
You cannot ban students from doing politics forever. The fall of the AL regime that bred the killers of Abrar is an ideal moment to bring it back, and to try and build it on a stronger foundation.
There is a way to do this. What Umama Fatema and others have always complained about is 'lejurbrittik chhatro rajneeti'. What she is getting at is student politics or political organisations that are essentially reduced to youthful goon squads for the national political parties. They have no politics of their own, and work to simply fulfill the agenda of their 'mother' organisations.
One of the glaring flaws of the post-1991 settlement was precisely this. How else can you explain that the DUCSU elections stopped happening with the advent of democracy in 1991? Before the Nur election in 2019, the last DUCSU election was held in June 1990, six months before the fall of Ershad. The picture is remarkably similar in all the other public universities. Rajshahi, Chittagong, etc. Give or take a year or two, they all stopped happening at the same time.
In the absence of student union elections, the campus-based organisations all became extensions of their national mother parties, and their dominance or otherwise on campuses came to reflect the national equation in politics. When BNP was in power at the centre, Chhatra Dal was the dominant force on campuses. When Awami League won the general election, almost immediately Chhatra League became ascendant. After 2009, over the course of AL's 15-year rule at the centre, as it grew more and more authoritarian, Chhatra League grew more and more monstrous on campuses. By the end, the malign influence of Chhatra League on campuses, together with their increased use as a goon squad for political 'showdowns', etc, by AL was the single-worst aspect of the regime. Campus politics became more and more hollowed out, till banning student politics altogether became the only option to try and deal with Chhatra League.
If however it can be ensured that student politics around students' issues will be allowed to thrive on campuses, and regular SU elections would be a step towards that, we can start to ease politics back on campuses. Political party reform has not been on the agenda in the post-Aug 5 paradigm. It's something we may ultimately regret, but it's not too late yet, and one of the reforms that can be pushed for in the next parliament could be less of a direct relationship between national parties and their student fronts. Legislate to dilute the relationship, such that the leaders of the student fronts are not appointed from on high, by the leaders of their mother parties. These should be elected posts.
That is why I support the IG's decision to hold the elections to as many of the SU's as possible during its tenure. The DUCSU elections are set for September 9. In 1994 and 1995, the DUCSU elections were announced but couldn't be held due to opposition from AL/BCL. It was the period when Sheikh Hasina and co were raising hell against the BNP govt at the centre around the demand for caretaker, and we can easily guess that Chhatra League leadership acted in line with the party's high command. Watch out for who is in favour of the DUCSU elections (and some others that have been announced, RUCSU is one) and who isn't this time. It can be a very pertinent indicator of people's intentions going forward.
Meanwhile a committee has been formed to recommend a comprehensive framework for student politics at Dhaka University. The committee has been approved by DU Vice-Chancellor Dr Niaz Ahmed Khan, the university's Public Relations Department said on Thursday. The decision follows strong student reactions on August 8 regarding partisan politics at the residential hall level. In response, the university authorities held a discussion on August 10 with active student organisations on campus.
Building on that dialogue, the proposal to form a dedicated committee was put forward during the SMT (Statutory Meeting of Teachers) held on August 11. The aim of this committee is to engage with student bodies and stakeholders to foster a culture of democratic practice while ensuring a conducive academic environment. The committee will draft recommendations outlining the constructive role of traditional student politics at Dhaka University.
The members of the committee are Professor Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan, Dean of the Faculty of Arts (Convener), Dr Abdullah-al-Mamun, Provost of Salimullah Muslim Hall, Professor Dr Md Nazmul Hossain, Provost of Freedom Fighter Ziaur Rahman Hall, Professor Dr Aleya Begum, Provost of Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib Hall, Professor Dr Mohammad Nazmuzzaman Bhuiyan, Department of Law. The committee is expected to submit its recommendations at the earliest time.
Leaders of various student organisations have said student politics based on party allegiance must stop, not the student politics per se. They also insisted that the student union-based politics must continue at the higher education institutions to establish the rights of students. By opposing the JCD committees in the halls, the students are not contradicting themselves. They are merely setting the new boundaries for how far politics should intrude into their lives.

Later, a decision was made at a meeting of teachers held at Curzon Hall on December 1, 1922, to form a student union named 'Dhaka University Student Union' in the academic year 1923-24. Subsequently, in the academic year 1953-54, through an amendment of the constitution, the previous name was changed to the present form.
According to political analysts, several factors contribute to DUCSU's role in grooming national leaders. From the beginning, DUCSU has contributed to many democratic movements. Its political environment and students' active participation on issues make it a political incubator.
Dr. Rushad Faridi, assistant professor of economics at DU, said: ""Any organisation is a place for developing leadership qualities. Various posts in DUCSU and the hall's unions are platforms for practicing and nurturing leadership. I wouldn't say only DUCSU is a place for producing leaders-any organisation, no matter how small, can serve as a ground for leadership development.""
In its 104-year history, DUCSU elections have been held a total of 37 times. Among these, 29 were held during the British and Pakistan periods. Yet, according to the University Ordinance of 1973, DUCSU and hall union elections are supposed to be held every year.
Before the 2019 election that was won by Nurul Huq Nur, the last DUCSU election was held six months before the fall of the Ershad regime, in June 1990. Yet strangely, the advent of democracy on the national stage spelled doomsday for DUCSU and its equivalent bodies in the other public universities, as nearly all of them went into limbo around the same time. Why or how this was allowed to happen, is still worthy of deeper study.
One theory is that the university administrations failed to organise the elections under pressure from the ruling parties, or their student wings. Yet history tells us that when what would've been the first DUCSU election following the fall of Ershad was announced in 1994, it eventually couldn't be held due to opposition from the Chhatra League. It was the same again the following year. Whatever the reason may have been, one thing that almost everyone can agree on is that the absence of SU elections has a very negative impact on the overall standard of student politics.
""We know why elections are not held. One major reason elections have not taken place since the 1990s is that whichever party comes to power, its affiliated student organisations do not want elections as they already hold leadership positions on campus. They fear that if elections are held, leadership might pass into others hands. As a result, the campus ends up under the control of the ruling party. No work is then done to protect the interests of general students.""
He added that the path for the development of new student leadership or those who want to engage in genuine politics gets blocked. ""Consequently, we don't see any new energetic and mature politicians at the national level either. Thus, a culture of thuggery is practiced on campus, and this trend is reflected in national politics as well.""

After the 1990 election, the last DUCSU election was held in 2019. There are allegations that due to pressure from the ruling party's student organisation and various quarters, the university administration could not organise the election. However, experts opine that there are harmful consequences of not holding the DUCSU election.
Rushad Faridi said that the absence of elections has a very negative impact. ""We know why elections are not held. One major reason elections have not taken place since the 1990s (till 2019) is that whichever party comes to power, its affiliated student organisations do not want elections as they already hold leadership positions on campus.

How it can be different
A ban on campus student politics was first implemented by the country's leading tech institute, BUET, in the wake of Abrar Fahad's gruesome murder in 2019. Subsequently that was extended to many more campuses by the completely new reality of the July 17 settlement in 2024. It was the only way to spare our students the overbearing presence of Chhatra League, their absolute dominance and all of the ways in which it manifested, that only came out in the open for all to see with the murder of Abrar, in all our campuses. But it was not a permanent solution.
You cannot ban students from doing politics forever. The fall of the AL regime that bred the killers of Abrar is an ideal moment to bring it back, and to try and build it on a stronger foundation.
There is a way to do this. What Umama Fatema and others have always complained about is 'lejurbrittik chhatro rajneeti'. What she is getting at is student politics or political organisations that are essentially reduced to youthful goon squads for the national political parties. They have no politics of their own, and work to simply fulfill the agenda of their 'mother' organisations.
One of the glaring flaws of the post-1991 settlement was precisely this. How else can you explain that the DUCSU elections stopped happening with the advent of democracy in 1991? Before the Nur election in 2019, the last DUCSU election was held in June 1990, six months before the fall of Ershad. The picture is remarkably similar in all the other public universities. Rajshahi, Chittagong, etc. Give or take a year or two, they all stopped happening at the same time.
In the absence of student union elections, the campus-based organisations all became extensions of their national mother parties, and their dominance or otherwise on campuses came to reflect the national equation in politics. When BNP was in power at the centre, Chhatra Dal was the dominant force on campuses. When Awami League won the general election, almost immediately Chhatra League became ascendant. After 2009, over the course of AL's 15-year rule at the centre, as it grew more and more authoritarian, Chhatra League grew more and more monstrous on campuses. By the end, the malign influence of Chhatra League on campuses, together with their increased use as a goon squad for political 'showdowns', etc, by AL was the single-worst aspect of the regime. Campus politics became more and more hollowed out, till banning student politics altogether became the only option to try and deal with Chhatra League.
If however it can be ensured that student politics around students' issues will be allowed to thrive on campuses, and regular SU elections would be a step towards that, we can start to ease politics back on campuses. Political party reform has not been on the agenda in the post-Aug 5 paradigm. It's something we may ultimately regret, but it's not too late yet, and one of the reforms that can be pushed for in the next parliament could be less of a direct relationship between national parties and their student fronts. Legislate to dilute the relationship, such that the leaders of the student fronts are not appointed from on high, by the leaders of their mother parties. These should be elected posts.
That is why I support the IG's decision to hold the elections to as many of the SU's as possible during its tenure. The DUCSU elections are set for September 9. In 1994 and 1995, the DUCSU elections were announced but couldn't be held due to opposition from AL/BCL. It was the period when Sheikh Hasina and co were raising hell against the BNP govt at the centre around the demand for caretaker, and we can easily guess that Chhatra League leadership acted in line with the party's high command. Watch out for who is in favour of the DUCSU elections (and some others that have been announced, RUCSU is one) and who isn't this time. It can be a very pertinent indicator of people's intentions going forward.
Meanwhile a committee has been formed to recommend a comprehensive framework for student politics at Dhaka University. The committee has been approved by DU Vice-Chancellor Dr Niaz Ahmed Khan, the university's Public Relations Department said on Thursday. The decision follows strong student reactions on August 8 regarding partisan politics at the residential hall level. In response, the university authorities held a discussion on August 10 with active student organisations on campus.
Building on that dialogue, the proposal to form a dedicated committee was put forward during the SMT (Statutory Meeting of Teachers) held on August 11. The aim of this committee is to engage with student bodies and stakeholders to foster a culture of democratic practice while ensuring a conducive academic environment. The committee will draft recommendations outlining the constructive role of traditional student politics at Dhaka University.
The members of the committee are Professor Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan, Dean of the Faculty of Arts (Convener), Dr Abdullah-al-Mamun, Provost of Salimullah Muslim Hall, Professor Dr Md Nazmul Hossain, Provost of Freedom Fighter Ziaur Rahman Hall, Professor Dr Aleya Begum, Provost of Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib Hall, Professor Dr Mohammad Nazmuzzaman Bhuiyan, Department of Law. The committee is expected to submit its recommendations at the earliest time.
Leaders of various student organisations have said student politics based on party allegiance must stop, not the student politics per se. They also insisted that the student union-based politics must continue at the higher education institutions to establish the rights of students. By opposing the JCD committees in the halls, the students are not contradicting themselves. They are merely setting the new boundaries for how far politics should intrude into their lives.

Towards the end of July, the highly anticipated date for elections to the Dhaka University Central Students' Union was announced, delivering on a key promise of the interim government to restart the culture of student politics centred around students' union elections at the country's leading public universities.
Accordingly DU will hold its first students' union election in 6 years on September 9. The final voter list containing 39,775 eligible voters, of which 20,871 are male and 18,902 are female, was published this week.
On August 8, the Dhaka University unit of the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the BNP's student wing, sparked controversy by announcing convening committees for 18 residential halls, despite widespread opposition within the student body to the revival of hall-based politics following the July Uprising. Bangladeshis will recall the pivotal and absolutely critical date of July 17, 2024. On that day, in a sweeping escalation of the nationwide student movement, protesters expelled Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) activists from major public universities - including Dhaka University - and declared their campuses ""free from politics.""
It was a truly extraordinary turn of events. The previous day, blood had flowed for the first time since the start of the quota reform movement, with six people including Shaheed Abu Sayed, killed during nationwide protests that were met with fierce attacks allegedly carried out by ruling party affiliates, including BCL and Jubo League members. As of September 21, political activities by students and/or teachers and staff was ""banned"" in at least 33 higher education institutions in Bangladesh-19 public universities, four government colleges, and 10 government medical colleges. Students themselves demanded this ban, though some of them also think the ban is ill-judged and participation in ""healthy politics"" by students is essential.
A survey carried out by the Dhaka University Research Society (DURS), a voluntary body of student and faculty researchers, revealed that 83.8 percent of the students who participated in the survey opted for a total ban on campus politics. Another 16 percent wanted ""reformed"" student politics on campus, allowing activities with control. The survey was conducted between September 3-11 on 2,237 currently enrolled students.
The University Reform Initiative (URI), a platform of Dhaka University students that included some coordinators of the anti-discrimination student movement, put forward an eight-point proposal for reform, including prohibition of all forms of partisan politics in residential and academic areas on the Dhaka University campus and enabling all candidates to run independently in the DUCSU or hall union elections.
Dhaka University students protested at the vice-chancellor's residence, condemning the revival of hall politics after July's uprising. Protesters demanded the immediate withdrawal of the committees, arguing that DU students should only elect representatives through DUCSU elections, not serve political parties.
Similar protests occurred at Rokeya and Sufia Kamal halls. Umama Fatema, an anticipated DUCSU VP candidate, called the committees a ""betrayal"" of the July uprising, warning of ""strong measures"" if the committees are not halted.
The Bangladesh Democratic Student Council (BDSC) condemned the return of ""authoritarian student politics,"" with Convener Abdul Qader noting that economically vulnerable students become ""hostages"" to hall politics. Despite post-uprising agreements banning political activities in halls, BDSC alleged that multiple organizations have formed secret committees, ""completely disregarding student sentiment.""
BDSC warned of strong resistance if oppressive practices resume and called for dialogue to establish a proper campus politics framework.
A leadership incubator
Through its long yet chequered history, DUCSU has authored some glorious chapters in the history of Bangladesh. From fiery speeches and protest rallies on the DU campus to the corridors of parliament, DUCSU's influence over the life of the nation has been unmistakable - not just as a student body, but as a breeding ground of leadership, courage and conscientious rights-based movements from its birth. As a leadership incubator, it shaped many prominent figures who began their political life through activism on the DU campus.
It is known that before the establishment of DUCSU, 'Hall Unions' were formed in the three founding halls of the university. Among these, the first 'Hall Union' was formed at Muslim Hall (Salimullah Muslim Hall). Later, a decision was made at a meeting of teachers held at Curzon Hall on December 1, 1922, to form a student union named 'Dhaka University Student Union' in the academic year 1923-24.

Yet history tells us that when what would've been the first DUCSU election following the fall of Ershad was announced in 1994, it eventually couldn't be held due to opposition from the Chhatra League. It was the same again the following year. Whatever the reason may have been, one thing that almost everyone can agree on is that the absence of SU elections has a very negative impact on the overall standard of student politics.
""We know why elections are not held. One major reason elections have not taken place since the 1990s is that whichever party comes to power, its affiliated student organisations do not want elections as they already hold leadership positions on campus. They fear that if elections are held, leadership might pass into others hands. As a result, the campus ends up under the control of the ruling party. No work is then done to protect the interests of general students.""
He added that the path for the development of new student leadership or those who want to engage in genuine politics gets blocked. ""Consequently, we don't see any new energetic and mature politicians at the national level either. Thus, a culture of thuggery is practiced on campus, and this trend is reflected in national politics as well.""
Years of Silence
In its 104-year history, DUCSU elections have been held a total of 37 times. Among these, 29 were held during the British and Pakistan periods. Yet, according to the University Ordinance of 1973, DUCSU and hall union elections are supposed to be held every year.
After the 1990 election, the last DUCSU election was held in 2019. There are allegations that due to pressure from the ruling party's student organisation and various quarters, the university administration could not organise the election. However, experts opine that there are harmful consequences of not holding the DUCSU election.
Rushad Faridi said that the absence of elections has a very negative impact. ""We know why elections are not held. One major reason elections have not taken place since the 1990s (till 2019) is that whichever party comes to power, its affiliated student organisations do not want elections as they already hold leadership positions on campus. They fear that if elections are held, leadership might pass into others hands. As a result, the campus ends up under the control of the ruling party. No work is then done to protect the interests of general students.""
He added that the path for the development of new student leadership or those who want to engage in genuine politics gets blocked. ""Consequently, we don't see any new energetic and mature politicians at the national level either. Thus, a culture of thuggery is practiced on campus, and this trend is reflected in national politics as well.""
How it can be different
A ban on campus student politics was first implemented by the country's leading tech institute, BUET, in the wake of Abrar Fahad's gruesome murder in 2019. Subsequently that was extended to many more campuses by the completely new reality of the July 17 settlement in 2024. It was the only way to spare our students the overbearing presence of Chhatra League, their absolute dominance and all of the ways in which it manifested, that only came out in the open for all to see with the murder of Abrar, in all our campuses. But it was not a permanent solution.
You cannot ban students from doing politics forever. The fall of the AL regime that bred the killers of Abrar is an ideal moment to bring it back, and to try and build it on a stronger foundation.
There is a way to do this. What Umama Fatema and others have always complained about is 'lejurbrittik chhatro rajneeti'. What she is getting at is student politics or political organisations that are essentially reduced to youthful goon squads for the national political parties. They have no politics of their own, and work to simply fulfill the agenda of their 'mother' organisations.
One of the glaring flaws of the post-1991 settlement was precisely this. How else can you explain that the DUCSU elections stopped happening with the advent of democracy in 1991? Before the Nur election in 2019, the last DUCSU election was held in June 1990, six months before the fall of Ershad. The picture is remarkably similar in all the other public universities. Rajshahi, Chittagong, etc. Give or take a year or two, they all stopped happening at the same time.
In the absence of student union elections, the campus-based organisations all became extensions of their national mother parties, and their dominance or otherwise on campuses came to reflect the national equation in politics. When BNP was in power at the centre, Chhatra Dal was the dominant force on campuses. When Awami League won the general election, almost immediately Chhatra League became ascendant. After 2009, over the course of AL's 15-year rule at the centre, as it grew more and more authoritarian, Chhatra League grew more and more monstrous on campuses. By the end, the malign influence of Chhatra League on campuses, together with their increased use as a goon squad for political 'showdowns', etc, by AL was the single-worst aspect of the regime. Campus politics became more and more hollowed out, till banning student politics altogether became the only option to try and deal with Chhatra League.
If however it can be ensured that student politics around students' issues will be allowed to thrive on campuses, and regular SU elections would be a step towards that, we can start to ease politics back on campuses. Political party reform has not been on the agenda in the post-Aug 5 paradigm. It's something we may ultimately regret, but it's not too late yet, and one of the reforms that can be pushed for in the next parliament could be less of a direct relationship between national parties and their student fronts. Legislate to dilute the relationship, such that the leaders of the student fronts are not appointed from on high, by the leaders of their mother parties. These should be elected posts.
That is why I support the IG's decision to hold the elections to as many of the SU's as possible during its tenure. The DUCSU elections are set for September 9. In 1994 and 1995, the DUCSU elections were announced but couldn't be held due to opposition from AL/BCL. It was the period when Sheikh Hasina and co were raising hell against the BNP govt at the centre around the demand for caretaker, and we can easily guess that Chhatra League leadership acted in line with the party's high command. Watch out for who is in favour of the DUCSU elections (and some others that have been announced, RUCSU is one) and who isn't this time. It can be a very pertinent indicator of people's intentions going forward.
Meanwhile a committee has been formed to recommend a comprehensive framework for student politics at Dhaka University. The committee has been approved by DU Vice-Chancellor Dr Niaz Ahmed Khan, the university's Public Relations Department said on Thursday. The decision follows strong student reactions on August 8 regarding partisan politics at the residential hall level. In response, the university authorities held a discussion on August 10 with active student organisations on campus.
Building on that dialogue, the proposal to form a dedicated committee was put forward during the SMT (Statutory Meeting of Teachers) held on August 11. The aim of this committee is to engage with student bodies and stakeholders to foster a culture of democratic practice while ensuring a conducive academic environment. The committee will draft recommendations outlining the constructive role of traditional student politics at Dhaka University.
The members of the committee are Professor Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan, Dean of the Faculty of Arts (Convener), Dr Abdullah-al-Mamun, Provost of Salimullah Muslim Hall, Professor Dr Md Nazmul Hossain, Provost of Freedom Fighter Ziaur Rahman Hall, Professor Dr Aleya Begum, Provost of Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib Hall, Professor Dr Mohammad Nazmuzzaman Bhuiyan, Department of Law. The committee is expected to submit its recommendations at the earliest time.
Leaders of various student organisations have said student politics based on party allegiance must stop, not the student politics per se. They also insisted that the student union-based politics must continue at the higher education institutions to establish the rights of students. By opposing the JCD committees in the halls, the students are not contradicting themselves. They are merely setting the new boundaries for how far politics should intrude into their lives.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — The NCAA fined Michigan tens of millions of dollars Friday and suspended coach Sherrone Moore for three games for a sign-stealing scandal that has loomed over college football’s winningest program for nearly two years, including its national championship season in 2023.
The NCAA said it had “overwhelming” and concerning evidence of a cover-up by Wolverines staff and noted there were “sufficient grounds for a multiyear postseason ban” against a program now considered a repeat violator. But the governing body stopped short of program-crippling punishments, saying a two-year postseason ban “would unfairly penalize student-athletes for the actions of coaches and staff” who are no longer there.
“The panel concluded that an elaborate, impermissible scouting scheme was embedded in the Michigan football program over the course of three football seasons, 2021, 2022 and 2023, and this occurred under former head coach Jim Harbaugh’s oversight,” said Norman Bay, chief hearing officer for the Division I Committee on Infractions. “What makes this case even more serious, in addition to the clear intent to impermissibly gain a substantial competitive advantage, is the elaborate effort to obstruct the investigation.”

Moore, who is facing a school-imposed two-game suspension this season, will also be banned from the first game of the 2026-27 season for a total of three games. Moore received a two-year show-cause order, but will be allowed to fulfill coaching commitments under the NCAA order.
The biggest blow came from the financial penalties, which are expected to exceed $20 million. They include a $50,000 fine, a 10% fine on the football program’s budget, a 10% fine on Michigan’s 2025-26 scholarships and a fine equivalent to the anticipated loss of postseason revenue for the 2025 and 2026 seasons. The program also faces a 25% reduction in official recruiting visits during the upcoming season and a 14-week prohibition on recruiting communications during its four-year probation period.
Connor Stalions, a former a low-level staffer who conducted the scouting and sign-stealing operation, was issued an eight-year show-cause order. Harbaugh, a former Michigan quarterback and now the coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers, faces a 10-year show-cause order following the conclusion of his previous four-year order effective Aug. 7, 2028.
A show-cause order effectively bans a person from college athletics for the period handed down.
Michigan said it would appeal the decision.
“(R)espectfully, in a number of instances the decision makes fundamental errors in interpreting NCAA bylaws; and it includes a number of conclusions that are directly contrary to the evidence – or lack of evidence – in the record,” the school said.
Athletic director Warde Manuel added that “a postseason ban should never have been a consideration in this case. I fully support the university’s decision to pursue an appeal.”
Harbaugh has always maintained he knew nothing about the scheme but NCAA investigators were clearly skeptical.
“Aspects of the record suggest that there may have been broader acceptance of the scheme throughout the program,” the report says. “At a minimum, there was a willful intent not to learn more about Stalions’ methods. However, the true scope and scale of the scheme — including the competitive advantage it conferred — will never be known due to individuals’ intentional destruction and withholding of materials and information.”
The NCAA does not have rules against stealing signs, but does prohibit schools from sending scouts to the games of future opponents and using electronic equipment to record another team’s signals. The scheme run by Stalions, the NCAA said, was elaborate and detailed – in fact, the NCAA said, Stalions described it as “counterintelligence” and his network of helpers was referred to as the “KGB,” a nod to the Soviet-era intelligence service.
During the 2021, 2022 and 2023 seasons, “Stalions directed and arranged for individuals to conduct off-campus, in-person scouting of Michigan’s future regular season opponents,” the NCAA report said, noting that he bought their tickets and saying he spent some $35,000 in 2022 alone. “While in attendance, they filmed the signal callers on the future opponents’ sidelines and then provided that film to Stalions. Using the footage they collected, Stalions then deciphered their signals. Additionally, on one occasion, Stalions personally attended a future opponent’s contest. In total, 56 instances of off-campus, in-person scouting of 13 future regular season opponents occurred across 52 contests.”
When asked about Stalions’ devices, accounts and documents, the NCAA said, “multiple members of the KGB stated that Stalions gave them access to his hard drives and Google drive to review videos and assist in identifying signals.”
Stalions, a Naval Academy graduate, was a volunteer for Michigan’s football program for years, including when he was stationed in San Diego and slept in his car while renting his house, until Harbaugh hired him 2022. The retired captain in the Marine Corps was an analytics assistant for the Wolverines when he was suspended in October 2023, a day after the school disclosed it was under NCAA investigation. Stalions later resigned.
“If I’m a bad guy, then everyone in football is a bad guy,” Stalions said in a recent Netflix documentary. Stalions, who did not participate in the NCAA investigation, recently said he knew almost every signal opponents used in seven games over two seasons.
The NCAA said the efforts to cover up the scheme included Stalions and other Michigan employees.
“Stalions himself described smashing his phone into 1,000 pieces and throwing it into a pond, providing false and misleading information during interviews, telling a potential witness to lie when interviewed, and some staff members, most notably Harbaugh not participating in interviews at all,” Bay said. “Moore deleted his entire 52 message text thread with Stalions from his personal phone. Harbaugh failed to cooperate by refusing to provide necessary records or participating in interviews with NCAA enforcement staff.”
In a notice sent to the school last year, the NCAA alleged that Moore violated rules as an assistant under Harbaugh. The text messages with Stalions were recovered and provided to the NCAA.
Harbaugh, who left the Wolverines after they won the 2023 national championship, served a three-game suspension in exchange for the Big Ten dropping its investigation into the allegations after the two ended up in court.
The NCAA also noted unrelated recruiting violations were part of the mix, violations that got Harbaugh that initial show-cause order. The NCAA said those involved lower-level staffers communicating with four recruits.
“The scouting scheme and recruiting violations in the football program demonstrate that Harbaugh violated the principles of head coach responsibility,” the NCAA said. “Harbaugh did not embrace or enforce a culture of compliance during his tenure, and his program had a contentious relationship with Michigan’s compliance office, leading coaches and staff to disregard NCAA rules.”
The Wolverines open the season on Aug. 30 at home against New Mexico State and then play at Oklahoma, where Moore was an offensive lineman, on Sept. 6.
“I am glad that this part of the process has been completed,” Moore said in a statement issued by Michigan. “I greatly respect the rules governing collegiate athletics and it is my intent to have our program comply with those rules at all times. I will continue to focus my attention on our team and the upcoming 2025 season.”

The change is meant to simplify and streamline access to important information on NIH’s Data Management & Sharing (DMS) and Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) policies, as well as enhance access to NIH-supported data repositories.
No changes have been made to NIH’s scientific data sharing policies, nor have there been updates to NIH-supported data repositories. However, some pages have been updated to improve findability. Going forward, scientific data sharing FAQs, educational resources, news, events, and policy updates will be available on the Grants & Funding site.
Please update any sharing.nih.gov bookmarks you may have to the new pages! Redirected links are in place for the next year to help you find what you need in the meantime.

Rather, going forward, new funding opportunities will be designed more broadly with language that also encourages various approaches be considered.","How Does the NIH Initiative to Prioritize Human-Based Research Affect Research Proposing the Use of Laboratory Animals?
In July 2025, NIH announced it will no longer develop new funding opportunities focused exclusively on animal models of human disease. Rather, going forward, new funding opportunities will be designed more broadly with language that also encourages various approaches be considered. This means researchers may choose any model they deem appropriate – including a combination of approaches – to answer a research question when submitting applications seeking NIH support. This strategy is intended to open the possibilities of which types of models can be submitted in response to funding opportunities, not be restrictive or prescriptive.
Applicants may continue to propose research exclusively involving human participants (like clinical trials), particular laboratory animals, real-world data, in vitro methods, mathematical models, artificial intelligence, in silico approaches, other alternative approaches, or a combination of models. Peer reviewers will assess, through our fair and impartial review process, the merit of each approach proposed, its relevance to human disease, and if it is best suited to answering the research question that advances biomedical research and discovery. Our overarching goal is to accelerate progress, encourage innovation, and ultimately improve the quality and validation of new approach methodologies.
We are also prioritizing human-based technologies and models, where scientifically valid and justified. Likewise, funding opportunities will indicate a special emphasis on human-based approaches.
These steps should encourage investigators to choose the best models for their research without constraints. To reiterate, NIH will continue to support grants that use laboratory animal models if scientifically appropriate, justifiable, and with appropriate animal welfare oversight. Moreover, if laboratory animals are proposed, scientists must still continue to clearly explain why they are necessary for their research, that the minimal number needed to ensure rigorous and reproducible studies will be used, and why the study cannot be done using another model or approach (see more here).
While traditional animal models continue to be important to advancing scientific knowledge, NIH recognizes that prioritizing new and emerging human-based technologies can offer unique strengths to expand the toolbox for researchers to answer previously difficult or unanswerable biomedical research questions. It also moves us toward our continued long-term goal of reducing, refining, and replacing the use of laboratory animals in NIH-supported research.

The black hole lies at the center of a galaxy known as CAPERS-LRD-z9. Both cosmic objects are thought to have formed around 13.3 billion years ago, or just 500 million years after the big bang that created the universe. (The big bang theory suggests the universe started as an ultradense, extremely hot point that rapidly expanded out in all directions in a chaotic event some 13.8 billion years ago.)
The black hole discovery, described in a study published Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, could shed light on the universe’s earliest days and provide insight into how black holes and galaxies evolved.
Light takes time to travel across space, which means observing distant objects in the cosmos is a bit like accessing a portal back in time, said Anthony Taylor, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Austin who led the study’s international team of scientists.
“When we look at objects that are very, very far away, it has taken that light billions upon billions of years to reach us,” he said. “So in reality, we’re seeing these objects as they were in the early universe.”
As far as black holes go, this one is huge, according to the researchers. It’s estimated to be up to 300 million times the size of the sun, with a mass equivalent to that of half the stars in its galaxy.
It’s also roughly 10 times more massive than the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, Taylor said.
Taylor and his colleagues found the black hole in observations of the outermost reaches of the universe from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. The researchers used a technique known as spectroscopy, which splits light into different wavelengths and colors, similar to how a prism separates sunlight into the colors of the rainbow.
With spectroscopy, astronomers can look for telltale signs of stars, galaxies and other celestial objects. Black holes gobble up dust and matter around them, compressing and heating the material as it swirls around and falls into the black hole. All of that can be seen with spectroscopy, said study co-author Steven Finkelstein, a professor of astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin.
“We look for these signatures of very fast-moving gas,” Finkelstein said. “We’re talking about velocities of 1,000, 2,000, sometimes even 3,000 kilometers per second. Nothing else in the universe moves that fast, so we know it has to be gas around a black hole.”
Scientists have identified possible black hole candidates that are more distant, but this is the oldest one that has been confirmed with spectroscopy, he added.
The galaxy that harbors the newfound black hole was also a fascinating discovery, the researchers said. It’s part of a class of galaxies nicknamed “Little Red Dots” because they emit red wavelengths of light and are very compact and unexpectedly bright, according to Taylor.
Not much is known yet about Little Red Dots, but they were first spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope. Though some have been spotted relatively nearby, Finkelstein said they were likely more common in the early universe.
Studying the CAPERS-LRD-z9 galaxy may yield clues about how Little Red Dots came to be and what causes their distinct red color, the researchers said. It may also provide clues about how such an old black hole came to be so large early on in the universe’s evolution.
In follow-up studies, the researchers are hoping to find other black holes in the distant universe that are just as old — if not older.

In a tiny, high-tech submersible sunk deeper than the height of Mount Everest, scientists have discovered a flourishing ecosystem some 30,000 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.
The Chinese-led research team found spiky, bright marine worms darting through fields of crimson tubes, itself another kind of worm, poking out of the Earth’s crust like flowers.
There were dense beds of clams, each up to 9 inches long, and snow-like microbial mats creating an ethereal undersea dusting, dozens of feet wide.
“This is the first time chemosynthesis-based communities have been directly observed at extreme depths,” Dominic Papineau, senior research scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told NBC News.
Papineau, who was among the authors of the research, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, added that “many hadal animals from these trenches are spectacular in their forms and colors” and that they survive by hosting microbes that metabolize methane, rather than through photosynthesis.
At 19,000 to 30,000 feet, hadal trenches are the ocean’s deepest zones that occur at the edge of one tectonic plate as it slides under another. “Long-standing theories suggest that chemosynthesis-based communities are widespread in hadal trenches, but few such communities have been discovered,” Papineau said.
Kareen Schnabel, a marine ecologist at Earth Sciences New Zealand, who was not involved in the study, said the team had discovered something “really rather unusual.”
“There were signs of really abundant, large life-forms and animals in these particularly deep areas,” she said.
“Because it is such high pressure in these incredible depths, you wouldn’t necessarily expect them to live in these places,” she said of the creatures.
The researchers wrote, “The depths probed here, coupled with the thriving communities discovered and distribution ranges observed, significantly expand the known habitat, depth and biogeographical distributions for a great many species.”
The sun’s rays don’t reach these depths, so the creatures rely on chemosynthesis — the process of converting chemicals into food — rather than photosynthesis.
“These communities are sustained by hydrogen sulfide-rich and methane-rich fluids that are transported along faults traversing deep sediment layers in trenches,” the researchers said.
They also face constant crushing pressure of up to 98 megapascals (MPa), a unit of pressure, which is more than six times the force of an alligator’s bite.
The dives for this latest research were conducted in July and August last year by an international team of scientists, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering.
They investigated the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, which is around 1,300 miles long and runs from Hokkaido in Japan to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, and the Aleutian Trench, which extends about 1,800 miles from the Alaska and Kenai peninsulas to Kamchatka.
Schnabel previously conducted deep-sea surveys in the same three-person submersible, called Fendouzhe, that was used for this research.
She described the experience of venturing that far down in a submersible — a type of seacraft that became infamous after one imploded on a 2023 expedition to the Titanic.
“There is some nervousness, of course, as you’re dangling above a 10-kilometer hole in the Earth,” she said of her trip more than 32,000 feet below the Pacific’s surface in 2022 to research a trench north of New Zealand.
“You have a small window that is only 12 centimeters in diameter that you can look out of. You can’t stretch your legs while you’re sitting on a little bench in a small titanium sphere, which is only 1.8 meters wide,” she said, or about 6 feet.
She said she was shocked by what she saw at the bottom of the trench, through the submersible’s 4.7-inch window.
“When I got to go down, and we actually settled down on the ocean floor to have a look, I was stunned to see how much life and how many animals there were,” she said.
There has been little doubt that life could exist at these depths, but what took the research team by surprise was the sheer abundance of the ecosystem they found.
The discoveries “challenge current models of life at extreme limits” and show that these ecosystems might be more widespread than previously thought, they wrote.",NBC News,[],"['Dominic Papineau', 'the Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'NBC News', 'Papineau', 'Papineau', 'Kareen Schnabel', 'Earth Sciences New Zealand', 'the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering', 'Hokkaido', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'the Aleutian Trench', 'Alaska', 'Kamchatka', 'Fendouzhe', 'Titanic', 'New Zealand']","Fields of worms and snowy microbial mats: Deep-sea submersible discovers flourishing ecosystem.

In a tiny, high-tech submersible sunk deeper than the height of Mount Everest, scientists have discovered a flourishing ecosystem some 30,000 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.
The Chinese-led research team found spiky, bright marine worms darting through fields of crimson tubes, itself another kind of worm, poking out of the Earth’s crust like flowers.
There were dense beds of clams, each up to 9 inches long, and snow-like microbial mats creating an ethereal undersea dusting, dozens of feet wide.
“This is the first time chemosynthesis-based communities have been directly observed at extreme depths,” Dominic Papineau, senior research scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told NBC News.
Papineau, who was among the authors of the research, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, added that “many hadal animals from these trenches are spectacular in their forms and colors” and that they survive by hosting microbes that metabolize methane, rather than through photosynthesis.
At 19,000 to 30,000 feet, hadal trenches are the ocean’s deepest zones that occur at the edge of one tectonic plate as it slides under another. “Long-standing theories suggest that chemosynthesis-based communities are widespread in hadal trenches, but few such communities have been discovered,” Papineau said.
Kareen Schnabel, a marine ecologist at Earth Sciences New Zealand, who was not involved in the study, said the team had discovered something “really rather unusual.”
“There were signs of really abundant, large life-forms and animals in these particularly deep areas,” she said.
“Because it is such high pressure in these incredible depths, you wouldn’t necessarily expect them to live in these places,” she said of the creatures.
The researchers wrote, “The depths probed here, coupled with the thriving communities discovered and distribution ranges observed, significantly expand the known habitat, depth and biogeographical distributions for a great many species.”
The sun’s rays don’t reach these depths, so the creatures rely on chemosynthesis — the process of converting chemicals into food — rather than photosynthesis.
“These communities are sustained by hydrogen sulfide-rich and methane-rich fluids that are transported along faults traversing deep sediment layers in trenches,” the researchers said.
They also face constant crushing pressure of up to 98 megapascals (MPa), a unit of pressure, which is more than six times the force of an alligator’s bite.
The dives for this latest research were conducted in July and August last year by an international team of scientists, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering.
They investigated the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, which is around 1,300 miles long and runs from Hokkaido in Japan to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, and the Aleutian Trench, which extends about 1,800 miles from the Alaska and Kenai peninsulas to Kamchatka.
Schnabel previously conducted deep-sea surveys in the same three-person submersible, called Fendouzhe, that was used for this research.
She described the experience of venturing that far down in a submersible — a type of seacraft that became infamous after one imploded on a 2023 expedition to the Titanic.
“There is some nervousness, of course, as you’re dangling above a 10-kilometer hole in the Earth,” she said of her trip more than 32,000 feet below the Pacific’s surface in 2022 to research a trench north of New Zealand.
“You have a small window that is only 12 centimeters in diameter that you can look out of. You can’t stretch your legs while you’re sitting on a little bench in a small titanium sphere, which is only 1.8 meters wide,” she said, or about 6 feet.

But when the tsunami waves arrived, they didn’t cause devastation or deaths in the United States, and the inundation might not have appeared threatening in some locations where warnings were issued.
That doesn’t mean the tsunami was a ""bust,"" that it was poorly forecast or that it didn’t pose a risk, earthquake and tsunami researchers said.
“You start to hear ‘tsunami warning,’ and everyone immediately thinks of the last Hollywood movie they saw, and then it comes in at 3 feet and people are like, 'What’s that?’” said Harold Tobin, the director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a professor at the University of Washington. “We should count it as a win that a tsunami occurred, we got a warning and it wasn’t the worst-case scenario.”
Here’s what to know.
How strong was the Kamchatka earthquake? And why did it change so much?
Initial reports from the U.S. Geological Survey pegged the Kamchatka earthquake at magnitude 8.0. Later, it was upgraded to 8.8.
“That is not uncommon for very, very large earthquakes in those initial minutes,” Tobin said. “Our standard algorithms for determining the size of an earthquake quickly saturate. It’s like turning up an amp and getting a lot of distortion.""
One of the first signs the earthquake was stronger than the initial seismic reports said was an initial measurement from a buoy about 275 miles southeast of the Kamchatka peninsula.
The buoy, which is part of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) system, is connected to a seafloor pressure sensor about 4 miles below the surface.
The sensor registered a 90-centimeter wave — more than 35 inches — which is eye-popping to tsunami researchers.
“That’s the second-largest recording we ever saw in the tsunami world,” said Vasily Titov, a senior tsunami modeler at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, adding that it indicated there was “a catastrophic tsunami propagating in the ocean.”
Titov said the only higher reading was from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people in Japan.
Seismic models later confirmed that Wednesday's earthquake was magnitude 8.8, which means it released nearly 16 times as much energy as a magnitude-8.0 earthquake, according to a USGS calculation tool.
Tōhoku was much bigger.
Tobin estimated that earthquake released two to three times as much energy as was observed in Kamchatka. Titov said the tsunami in Japan was also about three times larger.
In addition, he said the Tōhoku earthquake “produced an anomalously large seafloor displacement,” lurching and moving more water than expected, even for an earthquake of its magnitude.
At Kamchatka, “it’s likely that there was less seafloor displacement than could have happened in a worst-case or more dire scenario for a magnitude-8.8,” Tobin said, though more research will be needed to confirm that theory.
How did researchers make a forecast? How good was the forecast?
In two hours, researchers produced a tsunami forecast for “pretty much the whole Pacific and for warning points along the U.S. coastlines,” Titov said, with predictions of water levels at coastal tide gauges and for flood inundation.
The tsunami took about eight hours to reach Hawaii and 12 hours to reach the California coast.
Titov, who helped build the models used by forecasters who issue warnings from the National Tsunami Warning Centers in Hawaii and Alaska, said the models rely on seismic data and the network of more than 70 DART buoys along the Pacific Rim, which sense pressure changes. The United States owns and operates more than half of the DART buoys.
Titov said the models indicated that north shore areas of Hawaii would get tsunami waves of about 2 meters or less.
“Hilo was predicted at about 2 meters [6.5 feet], and it materialized at about 150 centimeters,” or 1.5 meters (5 feet), Titov said. “It’s exactly how we want it — a little bit on the conservative side.”
The same trend played out in parts of California, Titov said.
It will take some time to assess how well the models predicted inundation because reports about the extent of flooding are still coming in.
“We know that the flooding occurred at Hawaii. We don’t know exactly the extent, but from the reports that I saw on TV, it looks like exactly what we predicted,” Titov said.
Why were people in Hawaii evacuated for a 5-foot wave?
Yong Wei, a tsunami modeler and senior research scientist at the University of Washington and the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research, said a 1.5-meter (5-foot) tsunami wave can be very dangerous, particularly in shallow waters off Hawaii.
Tsunami waves contain far more energy than wind waves, which are far shorter in wavelength and period (time between waves) and slower in speed.
Wei said tsunami waves of the size that struck Hawaii can surge inland “tens of meters,” produce dangerous currents and damage boats and other moveable objects.
“People die. If they stay there and they don’t get any warning, 2 meters can definitely kill people,” Wei said. “If you’re on the beach, strong currents can definitely pull you out into the ocean and people will get drowned.”
Tobin said the initial warnings were conservative but appropriate, in his view.
“I don’t want people to think, oh, we had a warning and nothing much happened and pooh-pooh it — 'I can ignore it,’” he said. “Warnings by nature have to err a bit on the side of caution.”
Was this a historic event?
No. The Kamchatka peninsula has a long history of earthquakes.
“This was an area that was ready for another earthquake, and there had been a lot of earthquakes in that region over the last few weeks,” which indicates increased risk, said Breanyn MacInnes, a professor in the geological sciences department at Central Washington University.
In 1952, before scientists had a strong understanding of plate tectonics, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the Kamchatka peninsula in much the same region, sending a tsunami into the town of Severo-Kurilsk.
“People in Russia were not really prepared for it. It was very big earthquake, a big tsunami, and they were caught off guard,” MacInnes said.
MacInnes said the tsunami was 30 to 60 feet in height in southern parts of the peninsula.
“Thousands of people were killed, and basically the town was destroyed,” said Joanne Bourgeois, an emeritus professor of sedimentology at the University of Washington, who has been studying the region’s earthquake history for about three decades.
How would the tsunami warning system perform if the earthquake struck closer to home?
The Kamchatka tsunami is a megathrust earthquake produced along a large subduction zone fault, when one tectonic plate is forced beneath another. The U.S. West Coast features a similar fault, called the Cascadia subduction zone, which runs offshore from Northern California to northern Vancouver Island.
“This is kind of a mirror image across the Pacific,” Tobin said. “An 8.8 at a relatively shallow depth in Cascadia is definitely in the realm of scenarios. We could have a similar event here.”
In fact, Cascadia has the potential to produce much larger quakes, Tobin said. Modeling suggests Cascadia could produce tsunami waves as tall as 100 feet.
Subduction zone earthquakes typically produce tsunamis that reach shore in about 30 minutes to an hour, Titov said, which would strain forecasters’ capabilities to predict tsunami effects precisely along the U.S. West Coast before inundation happened.
Titov said more seafloor sensors, more computer processing and innovation with artificial intelligence algorithms are needed to speed forecasting.
Tobin said the successful tsunami warning Tuesday should spur investment in seafloor sensors and seismic monitoring stations offshore along the subduction zone.
“This shows the value and importance of NOAA and the USGS in these times where some of these government agencies have come into question,” he said. “We wouldn’t have had a tsunami warning if it weren’t for NOAA, and the next one could be a closer event. They showed their value.”",NBC News,[],"['Russia', 'Hawaii', 'California', 'Washington', 'the United States', 'Hollywood', 'Harold Tobin', 'the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network', 'the University of Washington', 'Kamchatka', 'the U.S. Geological Survey', 'Kamchatka', 'Tobin', 'Kamchatka', 'the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s', 'Tsunamis', 'Vasily Titov', 'NOAA', 'Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory', 'Titov', 'Tōhoku', 'Japan', 'USGS', 'Tōhoku', 'Tobin', 'Kamchatka', 'Japan', 'Tōhoku', 'Kamchatka', 'Tobin', 'U.S.', 'Hawaii', 'California', 'the National Tsunami Warning Centers', 'Hawaii', 'Alaska', 'The United States', 'Hawaii', 'Titov', 'California', 'Titov', 'Hawaii', 'Hawaii', 'Yong Wei', 'the University of Washington', 'the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research', 'Hawaii', 'Tsunami', 'Wei', 'Hawaii', 'Wei', 'Tobin', 'Kamchatka', 'Breanyn MacInnes', 'Central Washington University', 'Severo-Kurilsk', 'Russia', 'MacInnes', 'MacInnes', 'Joanne Bourgeois', 'the University of Washington', 'Kamchatka', 'U.S.', 'Tobin', 'Cascadia', 'Cascadia', 'Tobin', 'Cascadia', 'Titov', 'U.S.', 'Tobin', 'NOAA', 'USGS', 'NOAA']","Why one of the world's most powerful earthquakes caused so little damage.

The tsunami took about eight hours to reach Hawaii and 12 hours to reach the California coast.
Titov, who helped build the models used by forecasters who issue warnings from the National Tsunami Warning Centers in Hawaii and Alaska, said the models rely on seismic data and the network of more than 70 DART buoys along the Pacific Rim, which sense pressure changes. The United States owns and operates more than half of the DART buoys.
Titov said the models indicated that north shore areas of Hawaii would get tsunami waves of about 2 meters or less.
“Hilo was predicted at about 2 meters [6.5 feet], and it materialized at about 150 centimeters,” or 1.5 meters (5 feet), Titov said. “It’s exactly how we want it — a little bit on the conservative side.”
The same trend played out in parts of California, Titov said.
It will take some time to assess how well the models predicted inundation because reports about the extent of flooding are still coming in.
“We know that the flooding occurred at Hawaii. We don’t know exactly the extent, but from the reports that I saw on TV, it looks like exactly what we predicted,” Titov said.
Why were people in Hawaii evacuated for a 5-foot wave?
Yong Wei, a tsunami modeler and senior research scientist at the University of Washington and the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research, said a 1.5-meter (5-foot) tsunami wave can be very dangerous, particularly in shallow waters off Hawaii.
Tsunami waves contain far more energy than wind waves, which are far shorter in wavelength and period (time between waves) and slower in speed.
Wei said tsunami waves of the size that struck Hawaii can surge inland “tens of meters,” produce dangerous currents and damage boats and other moveable objects.
“People die. If they stay there and they don’t get any warning, 2 meters can definitely kill people,” Wei said. “If you’re on the beach, strong currents can definitely pull you out into the ocean and people will get drowned.”
Tobin said the initial warnings were conservative but appropriate, in his view.
“I don’t want people to think, oh, we had a warning and nothing much happened and pooh-pooh it — 'I can ignore it,’” he said. “Warnings by nature have to err a bit on the side of caution.”
Was this a historic event?
No. The Kamchatka peninsula has a long history of earthquakes.
“This was an area that was ready for another earthquake, and there had been a lot of earthquakes in that region over the last few weeks,” which indicates increased risk, said Breanyn MacInnes, a professor in the geological sciences department at Central Washington University.
In 1952, before scientists had a strong understanding of plate tectonics, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the Kamchatka peninsula in much the same region, sending a tsunami into the town of Severo-Kurilsk.
“People in Russia were not really prepared for it. It was very big earthquake, a big tsunami, and they were caught off guard,” MacInnes said.
MacInnes said the tsunami was 30 to 60 feet in height in southern parts of the peninsula.
“Thousands of people were killed, and basically the town was destroyed,” said Joanne Bourgeois, an emeritus professor of sedimentology at the University of Washington, who has been studying the region’s earthquake history for about three decades.
How would the tsunami warning system perform if the earthquake struck closer to home?
The Kamchatka tsunami is a megathrust earthquake produced along a large subduction zone fault, when one tectonic plate is forced beneath another. The U.S. West Coast features a similar fault, called the Cascadia subduction zone, which runs offshore from Northern California to northern Vancouver Island.
“This is kind of a mirror image across the Pacific,” Tobin said. “An 8.8 at a relatively shallow depth in Cascadia is definitely in the realm of scenarios. We could have a similar event here.”
In fact, Cascadia has the potential to produce much larger quakes, Tobin said. Modeling suggests Cascadia could produce tsunami waves as tall as 100 feet.
Subduction zone earthquakes typically produce tsunamis that reach shore in about 30 minutes to an hour, Titov said, which would strain forecasters’ capabilities to predict tsunami effects precisely along the U.S. West Coast before inundation happened.
Titov said more seafloor sensors, more computer processing and innovation with artificial intelligence algorithms are needed to speed forecasting.
Tobin said the successful tsunami warning Tuesday should spur investment in seafloor sensors and seismic monitoring stations offshore along the subduction zone.
“This shows the value and importance of NOAA and the USGS in these times where some of these government agencies have come into question,” he said. “We wouldn’t have had a tsunami warning if it weren’t for NOAA, and the next one could be a closer event. They showed their value.”",NBC News,[],"['Russia', 'Hawaii', 'California', 'Washington', 'the United States', 'Hollywood', 'Harold Tobin', 'the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network', 'the University of Washington', 'Kamchatka', 'the U.S. Geological Survey', 'Kamchatka', 'Tobin', 'Kamchatka', 'the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s', 'Tsunamis', 'Vasily Titov', 'NOAA', 'Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory', 'Titov', 'Tōhoku', 'Japan', 'USGS', 'Tōhoku', 'Tobin', 'Kamchatka', 'Japan', 'Tōhoku', 'Kamchatka', 'Tobin', 'U.S.', 'Hawaii', 'California', 'the National Tsunami Warning Centers', 'Hawaii', 'Alaska', 'The United States', 'Hawaii', 'Titov', 'California', 'Titov', 'Hawaii', 'Hawaii', 'Yong Wei', 'the University of Washington', 'the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research', 'Hawaii', 'Tsunami', 'Wei', 'Hawaii', 'Wei', 'Tobin', 'Kamchatka', 'Breanyn MacInnes', 'Central Washington University', 'Severo-Kurilsk', 'Russia', 'MacInnes', 'MacInnes', 'Joanne Bourgeois', 'the University of Washington', 'Kamchatka', 'U.S.', 'Tobin', 'Cascadia', 'Cascadia', 'Tobin', 'Cascadia', 'Titov', 'U.S.', 'Tobin', 'NOAA', 'USGS', 'NOAA']","Why one of the world's most powerful earthquakes caused so little damage. The magnitude-8.8 earthquake off Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula sent a wave of water racing at the speed of a jetliner toward Hawaii, California and Washington state, spurring warnings and alarm overnight Wednesday.
But when the tsunami waves arrived, they didn’t cause devastation or deaths in the United States, and the inundation might not have appeared threatening in some locations where warnings were issued.
That doesn’t mean the tsunami was a ""bust,"" that it was poorly forecast or that it didn’t pose a risk, earthquake and tsunami researchers said.
“You start to hear ‘tsunami warning,’ and everyone immediately thinks of the last Hollywood movie they saw, and then it comes in at 3 feet and people are like, 'What’s that?’” said Harold Tobin, the director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a professor at the University of Washington. “We should count it as a win that a tsunami occurred, we got a warning and it wasn’t the worst-case scenario.”
Here’s what to know.
How strong was the Kamchatka earthquake? And why did it change so much?
Initial reports from the U.S. Geological Survey pegged the Kamchatka earthquake at magnitude 8.0. Later, it was upgraded to 8.8.
“That is not uncommon for very, very large earthquakes in those initial minutes,” Tobin said. “Our standard algorithms for determining the size of an earthquake quickly saturate. It’s like turning up an amp and getting a lot of distortion.""
One of the first signs the earthquake was stronger than the initial seismic reports said was an initial measurement from a buoy about 275 miles southeast of the Kamchatka peninsula.
The buoy, which is part of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) system, is connected to a seafloor pressure sensor about 4 miles below the surface.
The sensor registered a 90-centimeter wave — more than 35 inches — which is eye-popping to tsunami researchers.
“That’s the second-largest recording we ever saw in the tsunami world,” said Vasily Titov, a senior tsunami modeler at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, adding that it indicated there was “a catastrophic tsunami propagating in the ocean.”
Titov said the only higher reading was from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people in Japan.
Seismic models later confirmed that Wednesday's earthquake was magnitude 8.8, which means it released nearly 16 times as much energy as a magnitude-8.0 earthquake, according to a USGS calculation tool.
Tōhoku was much bigger.
Tobin estimated that earthquake released two to three times as much energy as was observed in Kamchatka. Titov said the tsunami in Japan was also about three times larger.
In addition, he said the Tōhoku earthquake “produced an anomalously large seafloor displacement,” lurching and moving more water than expected, even for an earthquake of its magnitude.
At Kamchatka, “it’s likely that there was less seafloor displacement than could have happened in a worst-case or more dire scenario for a magnitude-8.8,” Tobin said, though more research will be needed to confirm that theory.
How did researchers make a forecast? How good was the forecast?
In two hours, researchers produced a tsunami forecast for “pretty much the whole Pacific and for warning points along the U.S. coastlines,” Titov said, with predictions of water levels at coastal tide gauges and for flood inundation.

CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is a brain condition caused by repeated injuries to the head, typically over many years.
The shooter was targeting the headquarters of the NFL, which is in the Park Avenue building where the shooting took place, authorities said.
While CTE can’t be formally diagnosed without an autopsy, one-third of former NFL players suspect they have the disease, according to a 2024 report. The NFL first acknowledged the link between CTE and football in 2016.
Former NFL player Phillip Adams was found to have severe CTE after he gunned down six people before taking his own life in South Carolina in 2021.
NBC News spoke with Dr. Aaron Lord, chief of neurology at NYU Langone who specializes in brain injuries, about how CTE changes the brain and a person’s behavior.
What is chronic traumatic encephalopathy?
First characterized in boxers, the condition used to be called “punch drunk syndrome” and can cause neurological conditions including early dementia, memory impairment, personality changes, and movement disorders similar to Parkinson’s disease, Lord said.
CTE can affect anyone who sustains repeated head injuries.
“It’s just about repetitive shock waves to the brain,” he said.
The condition’s link to suicide and suicidal ideation is an area of active study, in part because there seems to be a higher rate of CTE than expected among high-caliber athletes who have committed suicide, Lord said.
Still, experts haven’t drawn any conclusions about “the incidence and prevalence of this disease in the population, or in specific athletes,” he said.
“It’s a new one we’re still defining,” he said.
How is CTE diagnosed?
Without an autopsy, doctors can’t diagnose CTE, and even then it can be difficult to pinpoint because there's no specific criteria to diagnose it, Lord said. An autopsy must reveal evidence of tissue degeneration and abnormal clumps of certain proteins around blood vessels in the brain.
Some patients and their doctors may speculate that they have the disease because of noticeable changes in their moods and behavior. Patients also know if they’ve suffered blows to the head, how many and how severe.
Lord said that a brain MRI on concerned patients might reveal some changes consistent with the disease, but it’s not enough for a diagnosis.
There is some overlap in symptoms with psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Lord said.
Lord has also seen a link between patients with CTE and homicidal ideation and impulsivity as well as other personality changes.
Lord tends to see the disease in older individuals, possibly because of earlier repeated impacts, but even one hit to the head can cause damage, even if that trauma doesn’t result in CTE.
“Even somebody who’s just been in a single car accident and has injured the frontal lobes of their brain can have permanent personality changes and impulse control and psychiatric changes,” he said.
Is there treatment for CTE?
Although there is no direct treatment for the disease, psychiatric medication can help with behavioral control and other symptoms, Lord said.

Kennedy Jr.’s past vaccine comments, following Friday’s shooting at the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta that left one police officer dead.
Although the motive of the suspected shooter — Patrick White, 30, from Kennesaw, Georgia — remains unknown, he told a neighbor that he believed the Covid vaccines had made him sick, a source told NBC News on the condition of anonymity.
Kennedy visited CDC’s headquarters earlier Monday, where security led him through campus, pointing out shattered windows across multiple buildings, according to statement from the Department of Health and Human Services. Later, Kennedy met with the widow of the killed police officer.
Employees were instructed to work remotely this week. A virtual only all-staff meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, although it isn’t clear if Kennedy will be in attendance.
The shooting took place near the campuses of both the CDC, which includes an on-campus day care center, and Emory University.
For some employees, the shooting highlighted growing hostility toward public health officials, which they feel has been shaped by Kennedy’s long history of spreading vaccine misinformation, including the Covid vaccine.
In 2021, Kennedy filed a citizens’ petition requesting that the Food and Drug Administration revoke the authorization of the Covid vaccines. The same year, he described the Covid shot as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.”
Just last week, Kennedy terminated 22 contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines — the same technology used to develop Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid shots. In an announcement on X, Kennedy claimed “mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses.”
In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy ”has unequivocally condemned the horrific attack and remains fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of CDC employees.”
“This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce,” Nixon said, “not a moment for the media to exploit a tragedy for political gain.”
Kennedy has not yet spoken publicly about vaccine misinformation that may have contributed to the shooting.
Numerous studies have shown that the Covid vaccines are safe and effective.
“There’s a lot of misinformation, a lot of really dangerous rhetoric that’s currently being spread by the current administration, that makes us seem like villains, that makes us seem like our work is setting out to hurt people,” CDC employee Elizabeth Soda said in an interview. “So it’s not at all surprising, right, that people are going to listen to our leaders.”
A ‘scapegoat’
Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, said the Covid vaccine has become an easy scapegoat — a symbol of all the losses the pandemic inflicted on people, including loss of life, physical and mental health and personal freedoms.
“The vaccine is something you could focus on, instead of a general feeling of loss,” he said.
Even before the shooting at the CDC, there were multiple threats against Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and other public-health experts. Chin-Hong said he received multiple threatening emails a day at the peak of the pandemic. These days, he gets emails “full of hate” about once a week. Usually, he reads the first line and then deletes them.
Still, he feels personally unsafe often because he gives public talks about vaccines, he said. As a public health expert, he thinks of that as a duty. The CDC shooting heightened those fears.
“The CDC incident really makes me feel more personally at risk,” he said.
In employee group chats, staffers are also voicing frustration with Kennedy.
“People feel like this is a natural progression when you spend years denigrating science and public health, spread misinformation about vaccines and publicly attack federal workers,” said one CDC employee who was granted anonymity for fear of repercussions.
“Folks, myself included, are pissed off,” the source added.
An employee at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said it’s not lost on them that Kennedy “has demonized our work.”
In an email obtained by NBC News, Kennedy told CDC staff on Saturday that he was praying for the entire agency, adding that the shooting was “deeply unsettling,” especially for those working in Atlanta.

Pancreatic cancer is of particular concern. The five-year survival rate is about 13%, and up to 80% of pancreatic cancers may come back.
“If you were to ask me what disease most needs something to prevent recurrences, I’d say this one,” said Dr. Zev Wainberg co-director of the University of California, Los Angeles, gastrointestinal oncology program, who co-led the Phase 1 clinical trial.
The vaccine targets one of the most common genetic drivers of cancer: KRAS gene mutations.
KRAS mutations occur in about one-quarter of all cancers, including as much as 90% of pancreatic cancers and about 40% of colorectal cancers. Their ubiquity makes KRAS mutations a great target for cancer therapies, but the mutations have long been considered impossible to target with drugs.
To accomplish this, the vaccine uses short chains of amino acids called peptides that teach immune cells to recognize and attack cells with KRAS mutations.
“The critical step is engaging an immune response,” Wainberg said.
Cancer vaccines are a growing field of research, but many of these vaccines are personalized to the patient. This means their tumor must be sequenced for a specialized vaccine to be created. The vaccine in the current study, however, doesn’t need to be personalized and would be available off the shelf.
Killing lingering cancer cells
In the Phase 1 trial, published Monday in Nature Medicine, Wainberg and a team of doctors from across the country recruited 20 people with pancreatic cancer and five with colorectal cancer. (They chose to also include a few colorectal cancer patients because KRAS mutations are also a common driver of colorectal cancers, and people whose colorectal cancer is driven by these mutations are more likely to have a recurrence, Wainberg said.)
Everyone in the trial had KRAS mutations and had undergone standard treatment — usually chemotherapy and surgery — to remove the bulk of their tumors.
After surgery, blood tests showed that a smattering of cancer cells remained behind, referred to as microscopic residual disease, which is very common with pancreatic cancer.
“We are talking about cancer that is so microscopic that we can’t see it on scans,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
These cells can travel elsewhere in the body and grow into metastasized tumors, prompting an often fatal cancer recurrence. Chemotherapy can kill some of these cells, but some usually remain in the body.
“Realistically, if we want to kill every last cancer cell and really make people cured, you need to engage the immune system,” said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “We’ve just been really bad at getting an immune response in pancreatic cancer.”
Post-surgery, everyone in the trial got up to six priming doses of the experimental vaccine, called ELI-002 2P. Thirteen also received booster shots. The whole process took 6 months.
About 85% — 21 of the 25 participants — mounted an immune response to the KRAS mutations, and about two-thirds of those patients had an immune response that appeared to be robust enough to stave off lingering cancer cells.
What’s more, in nearly 70% of people in the trial, the vaccine appeared to trigger an immune response not just to KRAS mutations, but to other tumor cell targets that were not in the vaccine. A few people were “super-responders” who mounted an abnormally strong immune response to the cells.
“Those people had the best outcomes,” Wainberg said. His team is currently running a randomized Phase 2 trial to test the durability of the vaccine and compare whether the vaccine is more effective than the standard of care, which would usually be monitoring the patient for a recurrence.
In the Phase 1 trial, people with pancreatic cancer survived for an average of 29 months and lived recurrence-free for more than 15 months post-vaccination.
“That far exceeds the rates with resectable cancers,” said Wainberg, referring to cancers that can be removed with surgery.
A growing field
Cancer vaccines have been incredibly difficult to make, in part because cancer cells have a lot of the same proteins as healthy cells, making safe targets difficult to come by. Only recently has medical technology made the strides researchers needed to hone the treatment. Refined mRNA technology and gene sequencing becoming faster and cheaper has put cancer vaccines back into clinical trials, Dougan said.
Personalized mRNA cancer vaccines are showing promise in both pancreatic and colorectal cancers, but a one-size-fits-all cancer vaccine would make treatment faster and cheaper. Past trials using peptide vaccines have failed to prevent cancer recurrences. But the peptides in the new vaccine, called lipophilic peptides, have something past treatments did not — a tail.
“That tail sticks in the lymph nodes where immune cells get activated,” Dougan said. “You need something to get the immune system going, and just injecting killed cancer cells or peptides doesn’t work that well.”
More advanced clinical trials will have to confirm the results of the Phase 1 trial, but promising results have been seen in other cancer vaccine trials as well and could pave the way for major breakthroughs in preventing cancer recurrences. Memorial Sloan Kettering is also working on an off-the-shelf vaccine that targets a gene mutation found in 95% of people with acute myeloid leukemia. The data from the KRAS-targeting vaccine trial published Monday showed it is likely possible to target these mutations with nonpersonalized vaccines, something researchers long thought was impossible.
“The fact that the long-term survival really correlated with T-cell response suggests that the vaccine caused this,” Dougan said, referring to the specific immune cells activated by the vaccine. “The idea that you can target KRAS is really exciting.”",NBC News,[],"['Zev Wainberg', 'the University of California', 'Los Angeles', 'KRAS', 'Wainberg', 'Wainberg', 'KRAS', 'Wainberg', 'Scott Kopetz', 'the University of Texas MD', 'Anderson Cancer Center', 'Houston', 'Realistically', 'Stephanie Dougan', 'Dana', 'Boston', 'ELI-002', 'Wainberg', 'Phase 2', 'Wainberg', 'Dougan', 'Dougan', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering', 'KRAS', 'Dougan', 'KRAS']","One-size-fits-all pancreatic cancer vaccine showed promise in early trial.

Everyone in the trial had KRAS mutations and had undergone standard treatment — usually chemotherapy and surgery — to remove the bulk of their tumors.
After surgery, blood tests showed that a smattering of cancer cells remained behind, referred to as microscopic residual disease, which is very common with pancreatic cancer.
“We are talking about cancer that is so microscopic that we can’t see it on scans,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
These cells can travel elsewhere in the body and grow into metastasized tumors, prompting an often fatal cancer recurrence. Chemotherapy can kill some of these cells, but some usually remain in the body.
“Realistically, if we want to kill every last cancer cell and really make people cured, you need to engage the immune system,” said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “We’ve just been really bad at getting an immune response in pancreatic cancer.”
Post-surgery, everyone in the trial got up to six priming doses of the experimental vaccine, called ELI-002 2P. Thirteen also received booster shots. The whole process took 6 months.
About 85% — 21 of the 25 participants — mounted an immune response to the KRAS mutations, and about two-thirds of those patients had an immune response that appeared to be robust enough to stave off lingering cancer cells.
What’s more, in nearly 70% of people in the trial, the vaccine appeared to trigger an immune response not just to KRAS mutations, but to other tumor cell targets that were not in the vaccine. A few people were “super-responders” who mounted an abnormally strong immune response to the cells.
“Those people had the best outcomes,” Wainberg said. His team is currently running a randomized Phase 2 trial to test the durability of the vaccine and compare whether the vaccine is more effective than the standard of care, which would usually be monitoring the patient for a recurrence.
In the Phase 1 trial, people with pancreatic cancer survived for an average of 29 months and lived recurrence-free for more than 15 months post-vaccination.
“That far exceeds the rates with resectable cancers,” said Wainberg, referring to cancers that can be removed with surgery.
A growing field
Cancer vaccines have been incredibly difficult to make, in part because cancer cells have a lot of the same proteins as healthy cells, making safe targets difficult to come by. Only recently has medical technology made the strides researchers needed to hone the treatment. Refined mRNA technology and gene sequencing becoming faster and cheaper has put cancer vaccines back into clinical trials, Dougan said.
Personalized mRNA cancer vaccines are showing promise in both pancreatic and colorectal cancers, but a one-size-fits-all cancer vaccine would make treatment faster and cheaper. Past trials using peptide vaccines have failed to prevent cancer recurrences. But the peptides in the new vaccine, called lipophilic peptides, have something past treatments did not — a tail.
“That tail sticks in the lymph nodes where immune cells get activated,” Dougan said. “You need something to get the immune system going, and just injecting killed cancer cells or peptides doesn’t work that well.”
More advanced clinical trials will have to confirm the results of the Phase 1 trial, but promising results have been seen in other cancer vaccine trials as well and could pave the way for major breakthroughs in preventing cancer recurrences. Memorial Sloan Kettering is also working on an off-the-shelf vaccine that targets a gene mutation found in 95% of people with acute myeloid leukemia. The data from the KRAS-targeting vaccine trial published Monday showed it is likely possible to target these mutations with nonpersonalized vaccines, something researchers long thought was impossible.
“The fact that the long-term survival really correlated with T-cell response suggests that the vaccine caused this,” Dougan said, referring to the specific immune cells activated by the vaccine. “The idea that you can target KRAS is really exciting.”",NBC News,[],"['Zev Wainberg', 'the University of California', 'Los Angeles', 'KRAS', 'Wainberg', 'Wainberg', 'KRAS', 'Wainberg', 'Scott Kopetz', 'the University of Texas MD', 'Anderson Cancer Center', 'Houston', 'Realistically', 'Stephanie Dougan', 'Dana', 'Boston', 'ELI-002', 'Wainberg', 'Phase 2', 'Wainberg', 'Dougan', 'Dougan', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering', 'KRAS', 'Dougan', 'KRAS']","One-size-fits-all pancreatic cancer vaccine showed promise in early trial. In an early trial, a one-size-fits-all vaccine showed promise in preventing hard-to-treat pancreatic cancers from coming back.
Pancreatic cancer is of particular concern. The five-year survival rate is about 13%, and up to 80% of pancreatic cancers may come back.
“If you were to ask me what disease most needs something to prevent recurrences, I’d say this one,” said Dr. Zev Wainberg co-director of the University of California, Los Angeles, gastrointestinal oncology program, who co-led the Phase 1 clinical trial.
The vaccine targets one of the most common genetic drivers of cancer: KRAS gene mutations.
KRAS mutations occur in about one-quarter of all cancers, including as much as 90% of pancreatic cancers and about 40% of colorectal cancers. Their ubiquity makes KRAS mutations a great target for cancer therapies, but the mutations have long been considered impossible to target with drugs.
To accomplish this, the vaccine uses short chains of amino acids called peptides that teach immune cells to recognize and attack cells with KRAS mutations.
“The critical step is engaging an immune response,” Wainberg said.
Cancer vaccines are a growing field of research, but many of these vaccines are personalized to the patient. This means their tumor must be sequenced for a specialized vaccine to be created. The vaccine in the current study, however, doesn’t need to be personalized and would be available off the shelf.

She makes jewelry, sings in a choir and knits hats and scarves for the homeless. She also reads with her book club, goes to the gym a few times a week and is active in several civic organizations. According to her Fitbit, she still manages to sleep an average of 7½ hours a night.
At 85, Yackley is a “SuperAger.” That is, someone who is 80 or older and retains the memory capacity — based on delayed word recall testing — of a person at least two to three decades younger.
Dr. M. Marsel Mesulam, who founded the Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in the late 1990s, first defined a SuperAger. Mesulam Center researchers reflected on a quarter-century of SuperAger study in an analysis published Thursday in Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.
Yackley, who is among the nearly 300 people who have participated in the Northwestern University SuperAging Program (NUSAP) since 2000, is proof that impaired memory isn’t always a hallmark of aging.
“We are going to be role models for other people who are getting older,” she said. “Take good care of your health and eat right and be sociable.”
Is SuperAging genetic?
Yackley, a longtime Chicagoan who hails from Turkey, acknowledges that genetic factors may be contributing to her youthful cognition. Her mother and father lived to be 86 and 88, respectively. On the other hand, Yackley feels her joie de vivre helps keep her mind sharp.
“I think it’s partly your determination to live a long life and your activities that enable you to do so,” she said, encouraging older adults to pursue “things that make you proud.”
Yackley’s peers in the SuperAger program share a spirit of connection, according to Tamar Gefen, a co-author of the analysis and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Feinberg School.
“I don’t know if it’s necessarily social connections, it’s just connections in general,” Gefen said. “There are people who are connected to the land, there are people who are connected to their ancestry, people who are connected to their grandchildren, who are connected to their art.”
Gefen added, “You don’t see a lot of detached SuperAgers.”
That said, people can’t simply will themselves into “superaging.”
More than 7 million people in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer’s disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a statistic that’s projected to soar to nearly 13 million by 2050. About 1 in 9 people 65 and older have this most common form of dementia.
At age 45, the lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer’s is 1 in 5 for women and 1 in 10 for men. SuperAgers are defying these odds.
“Genetics is a part of it, definitely,” Gefen said. “We know that there are major risk genes for Alzheimer’s disease, and SuperAgers don’t have those genes.”
For example, research has shown that people of European descent with two copies of a gene called APOE4 have a 60% chance of developing Alzheimer’s by age 85.
“My interest is, are there genes that SuperAgers harbor that can actually protect them against getting Alzheimer’s disease?” Gefen said. “And is there a gene, let’s say that’s related to the immune system, that is over-expressed in SuperAgers that can be manipulated to then help individuals protect themselves?”
As she continues searching for such answers, Gefen said her team’s most exciting findings have stemmed from the brains of SuperAgers who have died.
SuperAgers’ brains may be built differently
Gefen and her colleagues at the Mesulam Center have autopsied nearly 80 SuperAger brains and compared them to those of their “neurotypical” peers. They focused on two indicators of Alzheimer’s: protein buildups in the brain called amyloid plaques and tau tangles.
“What we found in memory centers of the SuperAging brain is that there are a lot fewer tau tangles,” Gefen said. “But interestingly, amyloid or plaque pathology doesn’t really differ a whole lot.”
Because a number of Alzheimer’s treatments single out amyloid plaques, SuperAgers bring such treatment methods into question, Gefen said: “Are we really targeting the right target if SuperAgers and their peers have similar amounts of amyloid?”
Other findings include that SuperAgers tend to have larger entorhinal neurons, which are nerve cells that are key to memory, and more von Economo neurons, which are nerve cells critical to social behavior.
“Our guess is that [SuperAgers] are probably born with these kinds of structural protections,” Gefen said. “But we’re now going really deep into the molecular mechanisms of the cell in order to figure out what is keeping that cell strong.”
Dr. Timothy Chang, who wasn’t involved in the SuperAger research, works on the opposite end of the spectrum. An assistant professor of neurology at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Research and Care at UCLA, Chang studies and sees patients who have dementia.
Analyzing “outlier populations” such as SuperAgers is valuable to the medical field, he said.
“Those cases are really interesting,” Chang said. “They can teach us a lot about how, potentially, those people, based on genetics or other lifestyle factors, were able to avoid the disease.”
SuperAgers live on in the lab
Yackley has toured Northwestern’s Brain Bank, where she is “proud” her own brain will one day be sent for study. She’s also making plans to donate the rest of her body to science.
“Hopefully, maybe my heart or my kidneys can be used for transplanting,” Yackley said. “I don’t want to be underground.”
In the meantime, Yackley would be grateful to make it to 90, she said. She maintains a to-do list and aims to log about 4,200 steps a day. The retired journalist, travel agent and memoir author is already at work on her next undertaking.
“I am trying to put together a scrapbook of my life, and that’s a big project,” Yackley said.
Though the prevalence of SuperAgers is unclear, they appear to be uncommon. Gefen and her co-authors noted that during the initial recruitment of study participants, just 10% met the criteria of SuperAgers. Today, 101 SuperAgers ranging in age from 81 through 111 are actively involved in Mesulam Center research.
Not all SuperAgers prioritize their health — on the contrary, some defiantly savor their vices — and many have lived difficult lives, Gefen said. But they don’t take their cognitive fitness for granted.

Sel Yackley is a busy woman.
She makes jewelry, sings in a choir and knits hats and scarves for the homeless. She also reads with her book club, goes to the gym a few times a week and is active in several civic organizations. According to her Fitbit, she still manages to sleep an average of 7½ hours a night.
At 85, Yackley is a “SuperAger.” That is, someone who is 80 or older and retains the memory capacity — based on delayed word recall testing — of a person at least two to three decades younger.
Dr. M. Marsel Mesulam, who founded the Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in the late 1990s, first defined a SuperAger. Mesulam Center researchers reflected on a quarter-century of SuperAger study in an analysis published Thursday in Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.
Yackley, who is among the nearly 300 people who have participated in the Northwestern University SuperAging Program (NUSAP) since 2000, is proof that impaired memory isn’t always a hallmark of aging.
“We are going to be role models for other people who are getting older,” she said. “Take good care of your health and eat right and be sociable.”
Is SuperAging genetic?
Yackley, a longtime Chicagoan who hails from Turkey, acknowledges that genetic factors may be contributing to her youthful cognition. Her mother and father lived to be 86 and 88, respectively. On the other hand, Yackley feels her joie de vivre helps keep her mind sharp.
“I think it’s partly your determination to live a long life and your activities that enable you to do so,” she said, encouraging older adults to pursue “things that make you proud.”
Yackley’s peers in the SuperAger program share a spirit of connection, according to Tamar Gefen, a co-author of the analysis and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Feinberg School.
“I don’t know if it’s necessarily social connections, it’s just connections in general,” Gefen said. “There are people who are connected to the land, there are people who are connected to their ancestry, people who are connected to their grandchildren, who are connected to their art.”
Gefen added, “You don’t see a lot of detached SuperAgers.”
That said, people can’t simply will themselves into “superaging.”
More than 7 million people in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer’s disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a statistic that’s projected to soar to nearly 13 million by 2050. About 1 in 9 people 65 and older have this most common form of dementia.
At age 45, the lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer’s is 1 in 5 for women and 1 in 10 for men. SuperAgers are defying these odds.
“Genetics is a part of it, definitely,” Gefen said. “We know that there are major risk genes for Alzheimer’s disease, and SuperAgers don’t have those genes.”
For example, research has shown that people of European descent with two copies of a gene called APOE4 have a 60% chance of developing Alzheimer’s by age 85.
“My interest is, are there genes that SuperAgers harbor that can actually protect them against getting Alzheimer’s disease?” Gefen said. “And is there a gene, let’s say that’s related to the immune system, that is over-expressed in SuperAgers that can be manipulated to then help individuals protect themselves?”
As she continues searching for such answers, Gefen said her team’s most exciting findings have stemmed from the brains of SuperAgers who have died.
SuperAgers’ brains may be built differently
Gefen and her colleagues at the Mesulam Center have autopsied nearly 80 SuperAger brains and compared them to those of their “neurotypical” peers. They focused on two indicators of Alzheimer’s: protein buildups in the brain called amyloid plaques and tau tangles.
“What we found in memory centers of the SuperAging brain is that there are a lot fewer tau tangles,” Gefen said. “But interestingly, amyloid or plaque pathology doesn’t really differ a whole lot.”
Because a number of Alzheimer’s treatments single out amyloid plaques, SuperAgers bring such treatment methods into question, Gefen said: “Are we really targeting the right target if SuperAgers and their peers have similar amounts of amyloid?”
Other findings include that SuperAgers tend to have larger entorhinal neurons, which are nerve cells that are key to memory, and more von Economo neurons, which are nerve cells critical to social behavior.
“Our guess is that [SuperAgers] are probably born with these kinds of structural protections,” Gefen said. “But we’re now going really deep into the molecular mechanisms of the cell in order to figure out what is keeping that cell strong.”
Dr. Timothy Chang, who wasn’t involved in the SuperAger research, works on the opposite end of the spectrum. An assistant professor of neurology at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Research and Care at UCLA, Chang studies and sees patients who have dementia.
Analyzing “outlier populations” such as SuperAgers is valuable to the medical field, he said.
“Those cases are really interesting,” Chang said. “They can teach us a lot about how, potentially, those people, based on genetics or other lifestyle factors, were able to avoid the disease.”
SuperAgers live on in the lab
Yackley has toured Northwestern’s Brain Bank, where she is “proud” her own brain will one day be sent for study. She’s also making plans to donate the rest of her body to science.
“Hopefully, maybe my heart or my kidneys can be used for transplanting,” Yackley said. “I don’t want to be underground.”
In the meantime, Yackley would be grateful to make it to 90, she said. She maintains a to-do list and aims to log about 4,200 steps a day. The retired journalist, travel agent and memoir author is already at work on her next undertaking.
“I am trying to put together a scrapbook of my life, and that’s a big project,” Yackley said.
Though the prevalence of SuperAgers is unclear, they appear to be uncommon. Gefen and her co-authors noted that during the initial recruitment of study participants, just 10% met the criteria of SuperAgers. Today, 101 SuperAgers ranging in age from 81 through 111 are actively involved in Mesulam Center research.
Not all SuperAgers prioritize their health — on the contrary, some defiantly savor their vices — and many have lived difficult lives, Gefen said. But they don’t take their cognitive fitness for granted.

Just a month of air filter use cut systolic blood pressure by nearly 3 points in healthy adults who had slightly elevated blood pressure, according to the report published Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
Doug Brugge, the study's lead author and professor and chair of the department of public health sciences at UConn Health in Farmington, acknowledged that 3 points may sound like a small reduction.
“But the medical literature shows that even at that magnitude there can be a meaningful benefit in terms of reducing the risk of serious cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart attack and stroke,” he said.
Nearly a quarter of Americans live near busy roadways, according to the new research. People may not realize they’re being exposed to traffic-related air pollution because it’s invisible, odorless and can be easily missed, Brugge said. Yet high levels of the tiniest particles found in traffic-related air pollution are known risk factors for developing high blood pressure and heart disease.
Blood pressure is measured with two numbers: systolic pressure (the top number) and diastolic pressure (the bottom number). A reading of less than 120/80 mm Hg is considered normal.
Almost half, or about 119.9 million, of adults in the U.S. have hypertension, or high blood pressure, according to 2023 estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
To determine whether simply installing two portable, commercially available air purifiers with HEPA filters could improve heart health, Brugge and his colleagues sought healthy volunteers whose homes were near roadways that would expose them to elevated levels of the tiny particles from vehicle emissions, as well as particles associated with tires and brakes.
The researchers randomly assigned 154 volunteers to two groups. One would have two HEPA filters in the most commonly used rooms in their homes — one in the living room and the other in the bedroom. The other would be given sham filters. Then the groups would be switched.
After a month of living with HEPA filters, volunteers who had slightly elevated blood pressure at the beginning of the study saw a 2.8-point drop in systolic blood pressure, the top number that the American Heart Association considers the strongest predictor of future heart problems.
In contrast, those living with the sham filters saw a 0.2-point drop.
People with normal blood pressure did not see an effect from HEPA use.
The type of air filters used in the study were comparable to ones consumers can easily purchase in a store or online, Brugge said.
The new study is “intriguing,” said Dr. Matthew Alexander, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiovascular medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
Not everyone’s blood pressure changed, just those with systolic pressures over 120 at the outset, Alexander said. “It was a modest effect, but a clinically significant one,” he added. “And it would correspond to about a 6% reduction in the risk of adverse cardiac events, such as heart attacks, strokes or cardiovascular death.”
Alexander would like to see more studies, ones with more participants and a wider range of blood pressures.

Just a month of air filter use cut systolic blood pressure by nearly 3 points in healthy adults who had slightly elevated blood pressure, according to the report published Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
Doug Brugge, the study's lead author and professor and chair of the department of public health sciences at UConn Health in Farmington, acknowledged that 3 points may sound like a small reduction.
“But the medical literature shows that even at that magnitude there can be a meaningful benefit in terms of reducing the risk of serious cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart attack and stroke,” he said.
Nearly a quarter of Americans live near busy roadways, according to the new research. People may not realize they’re being exposed to traffic-related air pollution because it’s invisible, odorless and can be easily missed, Brugge said. Yet high levels of the tiniest particles found in traffic-related air pollution are known risk factors for developing high blood pressure and heart disease.
Blood pressure is measured with two numbers: systolic pressure (the top number) and diastolic pressure (the bottom number). A reading of less than 120/80 mm Hg is considered normal.
Almost half, or about 119.9 million, of adults in the U.S. have hypertension, or high blood pressure, according to 2023 estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
To determine whether simply installing two portable, commercially available air purifiers with HEPA filters could improve heart health, Brugge and his colleagues sought healthy volunteers whose homes were near roadways that would expose them to elevated levels of the tiny particles from vehicle emissions, as well as particles associated with tires and brakes.
The researchers randomly assigned 154 volunteers to two groups. One would have two HEPA filters in the most commonly used rooms in their homes — one in the living room and the other in the bedroom. The other would be given sham filters. Then the groups would be switched.
After a month of living with HEPA filters, volunteers who had slightly elevated blood pressure at the beginning of the study saw a 2.8-point drop in systolic blood pressure, the top number that the American Heart Association considers the strongest predictor of future heart problems.
In contrast, those living with the sham filters saw a 0.2-point drop.
People with normal blood pressure did not see an effect from HEPA use.
The type of air filters used in the study were comparable to ones consumers can easily purchase in a store or online, Brugge said.
The new study is “intriguing,” said Dr. Matthew Alexander, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiovascular medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
Not everyone’s blood pressure changed, just those with systolic pressures over 120 at the outset, Alexander said. “It was a modest effect, but a clinically significant one,” he added. “And it would correspond to about a 6% reduction in the risk of adverse cardiac events, such as heart attacks, strokes or cardiovascular death.”
Alexander would like to see more studies, ones with more participants and a wider range of blood pressures.

ATLANTA (AP) — The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has identified the man who opened fire at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White of Kennesaw, Georgia.
The GBI statement says White died and Officer David Rose with the DeKalb County Police Department was shot and killed during the shooting Friday.

The shooter opened fire at the CDC headquarters from across the street, striking windows across the sprawling campus, mortally wounding the officer and littering the sidewalk outside a CVS pharmacy with bullet casings. The attack prompted a massive law enforcement response to one of the nation’s most prominent public health institutions.
At least four CDC buildings were hit, Director Susan Monarez said in a post on X. Images shared by employees showed multiple agency buildings with bullet-pocked windows, underscoring the breadth of the damage to a site where thousands of scientists and staff work on critical disease research.

The CVS remained closed Saturday morning, with an apparent bullet hole in its front door. A lone bouquet was placed outside the building.
Without naming White Friday night, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens described him as a “known person that may have, some interest in certain things.”
The gunman died at the scene, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said Friday, adding: “we do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted.”
The shooter was armed with a long gun, and authorities recovered three other firearms at the scene, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation.
The gunman’s motive is still unknown this early in the investigation, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said Friday.
A voicemail left at a phone number listed for White in public records was not immediately returned Saturday morning.
Rose, 33, was a former Marine who served in Afghanistan and graduated from the police academy in March and “quickly earned the respect of his colleagues for his dedication, courage and professionalism,” DeKalb County said in a statement.
“This evening, there is a wife without a husband. There are three children, one unborn, without a father,” DeKalb County CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson said.
The GBI is leading the investigation, and said Saturday that unraveling what happened could take time.
“There is extensive evidence to collect due to the complex scene,” the agency said in its statement. “Numerous interviews are being conducted. This investigation will take an extended period of time.”

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) — An Islamic court in Indonesia’s conservative Aceh province on Monday sentenced two men to public caning, 80 times each, after Islamic religious police caught them engaged in what the court deemed were sexual acts: hugging and kissing.
The trial at the Islamic Shariah District Court in Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, was held behind closed doors. Judges have the authority to limit public access in such a case and open it only for the verdict.
The two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested in April after residents saw them entering the same bathroom at Taman Sari city park and reported it to police patrolling the area. The police broke into the toilet and caught the men kissing and hugging, which the court considered to be a sexual act.
The lead judge, Rokhmadi M. Hum, said the two college students were “legally and convincingly” proven to have violated Islamic law by committing acts that lead to gay sexual relations. The court didn’t publicly identify the men.
Prosecutors previously sought 85 strokes of the cane for each, but the three-judge panel decided on what they described as lenient punishment because the men were outstanding students who were polite in court, cooperated with authorities and had no previous convictions.

The judges also ordered the time they have served to be deducted from their sentence. It means the number of lashes will be reduced by four as they have been detained for four months.
The prosecutor, Alfian, who like many Indonesians uses only a single name, said he was not satisfied with the lighter sentence. But he said he will not appeal.
Aceh is the only province in Muslim-majority Indonesia allowed to observe a version of Islamic law. It allows up to 100 lashes for morality offenses including gay sex. Caning is also punishment for adultery, gambling, drinking and for women who wear tight clothes and men who skip Friday prayers.
Indonesia’s secular central government granted Aceh the right to implement the law in 2006 as part of a peace deal to end a separatist war. Aceh implemented an expansion in 2015 that extended the law to non-Muslims, who account for about 1% of the province’s population.
Human rights groups have criticized the law, saying it violates international treaties signed by Indonesia protecting the rights of minorities. Indonesia’s national criminal code doesn’t regulate homosexuality.
Monday’s verdict was the fifth time that Aceh has sentenced people to public caning for homosexuality since the Islamic law was implemented.
In February, the same court sentenced two men to public caning up to 85 times for gay sex after neighborhood vigilantes in Banda Aceh suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room to catch them naked and hugging each other.

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) — An Islamic court in Indonesia’s conservative Aceh province on Monday sentenced two men to public caning, 80 times each, after Islamic religious police caught them engaged in what the court deemed were sexual acts: hugging and kissing.
The trial at the Islamic Shariah District Court in Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, was held behind closed doors. Judges have the authority to limit public access in such a case and open it only for the verdict.
The two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested in April after residents saw them entering the same bathroom at Taman Sari city park and reported it to police patrolling the area. The police broke into the toilet and caught the men kissing and hugging, which the court considered to be a sexual act.
The lead judge, Rokhmadi M. Hum, said the two college students were “legally and convincingly” proven to have violated Islamic law by committing acts that lead to gay sexual relations. The court didn’t publicly identify the men.
Prosecutors previously sought 85 strokes of the cane for each, but the three-judge panel decided on what they described as lenient punishment because the men were outstanding students who were polite in court, cooperated with authorities and had no previous convictions.

The judges also ordered the time they have served to be deducted from their sentence. It means the number of lashes will be reduced by four as they have been detained for four months.
The prosecutor, Alfian, who like many Indonesians uses only a single name, said he was not satisfied with the lighter sentence. But he said he will not appeal.
Aceh is the only province in Muslim-majority Indonesia allowed to observe a version of Islamic law. It allows up to 100 lashes for morality offenses including gay sex. Caning is also punishment for adultery, gambling, drinking and for women who wear tight clothes and men who skip Friday prayers.
Indonesia’s secular central government granted Aceh the right to implement the law in 2006 as part of a peace deal to end a separatist war. Aceh implemented an expansion in 2015 that extended the law to non-Muslims, who account for about 1% of the province’s population.
Human rights groups have criticized the law, saying it violates international treaties signed by Indonesia protecting the rights of minorities. Indonesia’s national criminal code doesn’t regulate homosexuality.
Monday’s verdict was the fifth time that Aceh has sentenced people to public caning for homosexuality since the Islamic law was implemented.
In February, the same court sentenced two men to public caning up to 85 times for gay sex after neighborhood vigilantes in Banda Aceh suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room to catch them naked and hugging each other.

WASHINGTON (AP) — So-called mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic — and now scientists are using that Nobel Prize-winning technology to try to develop vaccines and treatments against a long list of diseases including cancer and cystic fibrosis.
But this week, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, canceled $500 million in government-funded research projects to create new mRNA vaccines against respiratory illnesses that might trigger another health emergency.
That dismays infectious disease experts who note that mRNA allows faster production of shots than older vaccine-production methods, buying precious time if another pandemic were to emerge.
Using older technology to target a pandemic flu strain would take 18 months to “make enough vaccine to vaccinate only about one-fourth of the world,” said Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, an expert on pandemic preparation. But using mRNA technology “could change that dramatically, such that by the end of the first year, we could vaccinate the world.”
Traditionally, making vaccines required growing viruses or pieces of viruses called proteins — often in giant vats of cells or, like most flu shots, in chicken eggs — and then purifying them. Injecting a small dose as a vaccine trains the body how to recognize when a real infection hits so it’s ready to fight back.
But that technology takes a long time. Using mRNA is a faster process.
The “m” stands for messenger, meaning mRNA carries instructions for our bodies to make proteins. Scientists figured out how to harness that natural process by making mRNA in a lab.
READ MORE: RFK Jr. pulls funding for vaccines being developed to fight respiratory viruses
They take a snippet of that genetic code that carries instructions for making the protein they want the vaccine to target. Injecting that snippet instructs the body to become its own mini-vaccine factory, making enough copies of the protein for the immune system to recognize and react.
Years of research show protection from COVID-19 vaccines — both the types made with mRNA and a type made with traditional technology — does wane over time. The vaccinations provide the strongest protection against severe infection and death, even if people still become infected.
But that’s a common feature with both the coronavirus and flu because both viruses continually mutate. That’s the reason we’re told to get a flu vaccine every year — using vaccines made with traditional methods, not mRNA.
Today’s COVID-19 vaccines made with mRNA by Pfizer and Moderna can be updated more quickly each year than traditional types, an advantage that now has multiple companies developing other vaccines using the technology.
Osterholm counts about 15 infectious disease vaccines that could benefit from mRNA technology, but that’s not the only potential. Many disease therapies take aim at proteins, making mRNA a potential technique for developing new treatments. Researchers already are testing an mRNA-based therapeutic vaccine for pancreatic cancer. Genetic diseases are another target, such as an experimental inhaled therapy for cystic fibrosis.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Summer’s most dazzling meteor shower, the Perseids, peaks early Wednesday. At the same time, Venus and Jupiter will converge in the sky — overlapping like a very bright star.
READ MORE: Hubble Space Telescope captures image of comet visiting from another solar system
If your focus is the meteor shower, it’s worth knowing that this year a bright moon will dampen viewing during the pre-dawn peak, so some experts recommend waiting a week or so to glimpse shooting stars against a darker sky.
The Perseids “are an incredible meteor shower,” said Thaddeus LaCoursiere, planetarium program coordinator at the Bell Museum in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Under dark skies with no moon, the Perseids can produce between 60 to 100 meteors per hour, he said. Since the moon will be around 84% full during the peak, skywatchers might expect between 10 to 20 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.
“This year I’m actually recommending that people go out a little bit later” — a week or so past the peak when the moon will not be as bright, LaCoursiere said.
Viewing of the Perseids lasts until August 23.
As the Earth orbits the sun, several times a year it passes through debris left by passing comets and sometimes asteroids.
The source of the Perseids is debris from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle.
When these fast-moving space rocks enter Earth’s atmosphere, the debris encounters new resistance from the air and becomes very hot, eventually burning up.
Sometimes the surrounding air glows briefly, leaving behind a fiery tail — the end of a “shooting star.”
You don’t need special equipment to see the various meteor showers that flash across annually, just a spot away from city lights.
The best time to watch a meteor shower is in the early predawn hours when the moon is low in the sky.
Competing sources of light — such as a bright moon or artificial glow — are the main obstacles to a clear view of meteors. Cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest are optimal viewing opportunities.
And keep looking up, not down. Your eyes will be better adapted to spot shooting stars if you aren’t checking your phone.
The next major meteor shower, the Orionids, peaks in late October.

The source of the Perseids is debris from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle.
When these fast-moving space rocks enter Earth’s atmosphere, the debris encounters new resistance from the air and becomes very hot, eventually burning up.
Sometimes the surrounding air glows briefly, leaving behind a fiery tail — the end of a “shooting star.”
You don’t need special equipment to see the various meteor showers that flash across annually, just a spot away from city lights.
The best time to watch a meteor shower is in the early predawn hours when the moon is low in the sky.
Competing sources of light — such as a bright moon or artificial glow — are the main obstacles to a clear view of meteors. Cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest are optimal viewing opportunities.
And keep looking up, not down. Your eyes will be better adapted to spot shooting stars if you aren’t checking your phone.
The next major meteor shower, the Orionids, peaks in late October.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Summer’s most dazzling meteor shower, the Perseids, peaks early Wednesday. At the same time, Venus and Jupiter will converge in the sky — overlapping like a very bright star.

If your focus is the meteor shower, it’s worth knowing that this year a bright moon will dampen viewing during the pre-dawn peak, so some experts recommend waiting a week or so to glimpse shooting stars against a darker sky.
The Perseids “are an incredible meteor shower,” said Thaddeus LaCoursiere, planetarium program coordinator at the Bell Museum in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Under dark skies with no moon, the Perseids can produce between 60 to 100 meteors per hour, he said. Since the moon will be around 84% full during the peak, skywatchers might expect between 10 to 20 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.
“This year I’m actually recommending that people go out a little bit later” — a week or so past the peak when the moon will not be as bright, LaCoursiere said.

Finally tonight, the black market trade in rhino horns is driving these species to near extinction. Now scientists at a rhino orphanage in the Bushveld of South Africa are trying to protect them from poaching in a rather surprising way.
John Yang (voice-over):
The first step is to carefully sedate beasts that can weigh up to two and a half tons. Then the scientists get to work with a drill. They insert radioactive isotopes into the rhino's horns in amounts too small to affect their health.
It's called the Rhizotope Project. James Larkin of the University of Witwatersrand set it up in 2021.
James Larkin, University of Witwatersrand: By making the horns radioactive, we are making those horns, devaluing those horns. In the eyes of the poacher and the end users, no one wants a radioactive horn.
South Africa has the world's largest population of rhinos, and hundreds of them are poached every year.
It's a major threat to the critically endangered rhinos driven by the lucrative black market for their horns, which are popular in some Asian countries, in traditional medicine and as status symbols. The goal of the Rhizotope project is to make horns virtually impossible to traffic.
Arrie Van Deventer, The Rhino Orphanage:
All these rhinos are here because they were orphaned, because their mothers were shot. They were poached because of the value of the rhino horn. Now with the Rhizotope Project, you can't take that horn anywhere. It is radioactive. You can't take it through any airport, any harbor, any customs office. Sirens go off. It is wonderful. I'm telling you, this could be the holy grail to save this species.
The effort is supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency. A pilot study involving 20 rhinos proved that it's safe and effective. Now scientists are working to expand to a broader scale and see if the idea can be applied to other species prized by poachers.

The iconic Mississippi River Delta is of enormous importance to the country, especially near the Gulf Coast. More than two million people live near that part of the Delta. It's an economic engine home to tourism, fisheries, and a shipping gateway to North America.
And it's also a key wildlife habitat. Nearly 40 percent of the coastal wetlands in the contiguous U.S. is found in the Delta in Louisiana. But it's shrinking considerably due to a number of factors, including engineering done some decades ago.
Our science correspondent, Miles O'Brien, looks at those problems and efforts to prevent further loss.

All right, ladies, let's get ready for our coring.

In the place where the Mississippi River drains into the Gulf…

We don't actually know what we're going to get here.

All right, do us the honors. Great job.
WOMAN:
Twenty-five, 27. Gray.
Sedimentologist Carol Wilson is an associate professor at Louisiana State University.
I have been doing it for 25 years of my life now, more than half of my life. I have been down here playing in the mud.
She and her team are studying the mud in the place they call the Bird's Foot, so named because of the way the Mississippi River spreads out into three canals at its mouth.
By the time the river wends its way here to its marshy mouth, where soil, river and sea mix in a swampy gumbo, the Mississippi is depleted of much of its famous mud.
It's really strangled the Delta. Like, this natural wetland, they're starved of sediment that they used to receive. So this area since the 1950s has been deteriorating.
River deltas grow and shrink naturally over time, but the mouth of the Mississippi is disappearing at an unnaturally rapid pace thanks to the way humans have engineered the river to answer their bidding. 0 Samuel Bentley, Louisiana State University: The engineering of the river over the last couple of centuries has had several unintended consequences.
Marine geologist Sam Bentley is a professor at LSU.
The trouble begins in a big tributary, the Missouri River. In the mid-20th century, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built six major dams there to control floods, ensure navigation and generate electricity.
Samuel Bentley:
The construction of dams for water control in the Upper Missouri Basin cut off sediment supply to the lower river in the first half of the 20th century. That essentially lowered the amount of sediment that's carried by the river by at least 50 percent.
The Corps has built and maintains about 3,500 miles of levees and flood walls along the Mississippi from Cape Girardeau to the Bird's Foot. The structures are there to prevent floods and keep commerce flowing.
Those levees and those hardening structures have prevented sediment to go from the river to the deltaic wetlands, which require sediment to sustain themselves.
The oil and gas industry is also to blame locally and globally. Sea level is rising more than three-quarters-of-an-inch a year here due to the climate crisis, and all the fossil fuel extraction that occurs in the region leads to the dredging of deep channels and the construction of pipelines.
It all hastens the sinking of the Mississippi River Delta, so-called subsidence. On average, the Delta loses about a football field of wetlands every 100 minutes.
The combination of these factors has driven the entirety of the Delta, not just the Bird's Foot, but much of the Mississippi River Delta, into a catastrophic state of decline.
Carol Wilson is part of a multidisciplinary team led by Bentley that is studying this catastrophe on multiple fronts. The work is funded, ironically, by the $20 billion settlement from BP to atone for its Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.
What we are out here to study is the natural dynamics, but also is it keeping pace or not with that relative sea level rise? So think about, land surface is going down. Can the marsh fill in that gap, in that space?
Nearby, her colleagues coastal hydrologist Matt Hiatt and river scientist Kory Konsoer are gathering data to better understand how the river delivers sediment from the channel to the marsh. They use an acoustic instrument that measures the speed of small particles suspended in the water.
Matt Hiatt, Louisiana State University:
We can make a prediction of how much sediment is actually moving through the river channel and into those wetland environments through small secondary channels that connect to the main channels.
When the water is too shallow to use the acoustic device, they release photodegradable dye and measure its spread with a drone.
Kory Konsoer, Louisiana State University:
What's really important about that is it not only gives us the water velocity through the wetlands, but it shows us how that water and sediment interact with the vegetation within the wetland.
The challenge is to find ways to divert Mississippi mud into the marshland without affecting navigation on the river.
Jeff Corbino, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The idea that the Mississippi River could be unleashed and magically nourish all these areas, it sounds very romantic. It just doesn't work that way in practice.
Biologist Jeff Corbino is an environmental resource specialist for the Army Corps of Engineers. He helps manage a complex dredging campaign to keep the river channel 50 feet deep from Baton Rouge to the mouth year-round.
Jeff Corbino:
My other nature is always going to win. We are in no way controlling the Mississippi River. We react to it. We are playing the cards that we are dealt with.
Right now, the Corps is dealing with orders to save as much of the dredge sediment as it can to nourish and sustain healthier wetlands.
Scientists on Sam Bentley's team are also hoping their data will inform efforts to design and build diversions to reroute and spread Mississippi sediment throughout the dying wetlands.
They're controversial in many ways, but the science supporting diversions as a tool for coastal restoration has been very solid for many decades.
So why would a diversion project be controversial at all? Let's take a look at one of them to try to understand why. This is New Orleans here. Here's the Bird's Foot, and the river, which runs between the two of them.
In 2023, construction began on the $2.9 billion Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion. The idea, when the Mississippi had enough water to spare, water would be diverted into Barataria Bay right about here to make these wetlands more healthy.
But the problem is down here is a big oyster area, and the salinity of the water for oysters is very critical. This would have a great impact on those businesses. The oyster industry led the charge of opposition. Governor Jeff Landry withdrew state support, and the project is now dead.
In order for our wetlands to have a chance, they have got to have some kind of supply of sediment to them. If a diversion is not the exact mechanism, then let's come up with another plan.
Over the past century, Louisiana has lost a land mass roughly the size of Delaware. Without a viable plan to restore balance between nature and navigation, between ecology and economy, the next 100 years could erase what's left.

She and her team are studying the mud in the place they call the Bird's Foot, so named because of the way the Mississippi River spreads out into three canals at its mouth.
By the time the river wends its way here to its marshy mouth, where soil, river and sea mix in a swampy gumbo, the Mississippi is depleted of much of its famous mud.
It's really strangled the Delta. Like, this natural wetland, they're starved of sediment that they used to receive. So this area since the 1950s has been deteriorating.
River deltas grow and shrink naturally over time, but the mouth of the Mississippi is disappearing at an unnaturally rapid pace thanks to the way humans have engineered the river to answer their bidding. 0 Samuel Bentley, Louisiana State University: The engineering of the river over the last couple of centuries has had several unintended consequences.
Marine geologist Sam Bentley is a professor at LSU.
The trouble begins in a big tributary, the Missouri River. In the mid-20th century, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built six major dams there to control floods, ensure navigation and generate electricity.
Samuel Bentley:
The construction of dams for water control in the Upper Missouri Basin cut off sediment supply to the lower river in the first half of the 20th century. That essentially lowered the amount of sediment that's carried by the river by at least 50 percent.
The Corps has built and maintains about 3,500 miles of levees and flood walls along the Mississippi from Cape Girardeau to the Bird's Foot. The structures are there to prevent floods and keep commerce flowing.
Those levees and those hardening structures have prevented sediment to go from the river to the deltaic wetlands, which require sediment to sustain themselves.
The oil and gas industry is also to blame locally and globally. Sea level is rising more than three-quarters-of-an-inch a year here due to the climate crisis, and all the fossil fuel extraction that occurs in the region leads to the dredging of deep channels and the construction of pipelines.
It all hastens the sinking of the Mississippi River Delta, so-called subsidence. On average, the Delta loses about a football field of wetlands every 100 minutes.
The combination of these factors has driven the entirety of the Delta, not just the Bird's Foot, but much of the Mississippi River Delta, into a catastrophic state of decline.
Carol Wilson is part of a multidisciplinary team led by Bentley that is studying this catastrophe on multiple fronts. The work is funded, ironically, by the $20 billion settlement from BP to atone for its Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.
What we are out here to study is the natural dynamics, but also is it keeping pace or not with that relative sea level rise? So think about, land surface is going down. Can the marsh fill in that gap, in that space?
Nearby, her colleagues coastal hydrologist Matt Hiatt and river scientist Kory Konsoer are gathering data to better understand how the river delivers sediment from the channel to the marsh. They use an acoustic instrument that measures the speed of small particles suspended in the water.
Matt Hiatt, Louisiana State University:
We can make a prediction of how much sediment is actually moving through the river channel and into those wetland environments through small secondary channels that connect to the main channels.
When the water is too shallow to use the acoustic device, they release photodegradable dye and measure its spread with a drone.
Kory Konsoer, Louisiana State University:
What's really important about that is it not only gives us the water velocity through the wetlands, but it shows us how that water and sediment interact with the vegetation within the wetland.
The challenge is to find ways to divert Mississippi mud into the marshland without affecting navigation on the river.
Jeff Corbino, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The idea that the Mississippi River could be unleashed and magically nourish all these areas, it sounds very romantic. It just doesn't work that way in practice.
Biologist Jeff Corbino is an environmental resource specialist for the Army Corps of Engineers. He helps manage a complex dredging campaign to keep the river channel 50 feet deep from Baton Rouge to the mouth year-round.
Jeff Corbino:
My other nature is always going to win. We are in no way controlling the Mississippi River. We react to it. We are playing the cards that we are dealt with.
Right now, the Corps is dealing with orders to save as much of the dredge sediment as it can to nourish and sustain healthier wetlands.
Scientists on Sam Bentley's team are also hoping their data will inform efforts to design and build diversions to reroute and spread Mississippi sediment throughout the dying wetlands.
They're controversial in many ways, but the science supporting diversions as a tool for coastal restoration has been very solid for many decades.
So why would a diversion project be controversial at all? Let's take a look at one of them to try to understand why. This is New Orleans here. Here's the Bird's Foot, and the river, which runs between the two of them.
In 2023, construction began on the $2.9 billion Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion. The idea, when the Mississippi had enough water to spare, water would be diverted into Barataria Bay right about here to make these wetlands more healthy.
But the problem is down here is a big oyster area, and the salinity of the water for oysters is very critical. This would have a great impact on those businesses. The oyster industry led the charge of opposition. Governor Jeff Landry withdrew state support, and the project is now dead.
In order for our wetlands to have a chance, they have got to have some kind of supply of sediment to them. If a diversion is not the exact mechanism, then let's come up with another plan.
Over the past century, Louisiana has lost a land mass roughly the size of Delaware. Without a viable plan to restore balance between nature and navigation, between ecology and economy, the next 100 years could erase what's left.

The iconic Mississippi River Delta is of enormous importance to the country, especially near the Gulf Coast. More than two million people live near that part of the Delta. It's an economic engine home to tourism, fisheries, and a shipping gateway to North America.
And it's also a key wildlife habitat. Nearly 40 percent of the coastal wetlands in the contiguous U.S. is found in the Delta in Louisiana. But it's shrinking considerably due to a number of factors, including engineering done some decades ago.

With summer in full swing, you might be wondering what books to take along on vacation or enjoy right at home.
Amna Nawaz:
Senior arts correspondent Jeffrey Brown talks with two ""News Hour"" regulars who have answers to that question.
It's part of our arts and culture series, Canvas.
Jeffrey Brown:
And for ideas for your summer reading, we have two of our favorite readers and recommenders, Maureen Corrigan, a professor at Georgia University and book critic for NPR's ""Fresh Air,"" and Ann Patchett, acclaimed author, most recently of the novel ""Tom Lake,"" and owner of Parnassus Books in Nashville, where she joins us.
Maureen and Ann, it's really nice to talk to you both again.
Ann, you want to start with maybe two or three novels, fiction?
Ann Patchett, Owner, Parnassus Books:
Yes, absolutely.
All right, I'm starting off with a book called ""The Correspondent"" by Virginia Evans. This is an epistolary novel. Epistolary novels usually don't work, but this one does. It's about a grouchy, older woman who lives alone, who in the course of the book makes more and more connections to neighbors, to friends. It's a really beautiful, beautiful book, a debut.
Way to go, Virginia. And then..
And it says a cause for celebration by Ann Patchett on the cover.
Ann Patchett:
Yes, right? Exactly. Everything — that's the thing about owning a bookstore and being an author. My name winds up on a lot of books.
Kathy Wang's ""The Satisfaction Cafe"" just came out. And, again, it's a very quiet, funny, smart book in which you don't think a whole lot is going on. And then more and more and more happens. It follows one woman over the course of her life in the Bay Area. Think Anne Tyler, just beautifully written, quiet, simple, and very, very smart, very entertaining.
Maureen, what do you have?
Maureen Corrigan, NPR Book Critic:
Oh, gosh.
Summer to me is mystery and suspense fiction. So, S.A. Cosby, who is one of the greatest crime writers alive today, his latest book is called ""King of Ashes."" And it's about a young man, a successful financier who returns to his hometown in Virginia, where his father has been the victim of a mysterious hit-and-run.
This young man has to figure out how to save the family business, which is a crematory. His father is the king of ashes. He's the owner of the crematory. How to save it from the clutches of a mob that now controls the town. Cosby is tough, he's rough, and that crematory gets a lot of action. So I warn readers who don't like the grisly stuff, that's there, but he is fantastic.
They do go for it, right?
Maureen Corrigan:
He goes for it, and it feels very authentic.
Another book that I would recommend is ""El Dorado Drive"" by Megan Abbott. Megan Abbott is an amazing suspense writer who seems to specialize in closed communities of women that turn very weird very quickly. And this book is set in Detroit, which is Abbott's hometown, early 2000s. Detroit is down on its luck. A bunch of women get together and join a finance club and they spout all these slogans about female empowerment.
And yet this club also turns out to be a Ponzi scheme. So there's that.
OK, how about nonfiction, Ann? Give us two, OK?
All right, two.
""Who Is Government?"" Michael Lewis, I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. One, it is a pure pleasure to read. He has a great group of authors that he's working with, Geraldine Brooks, Casey Cep, Dave Eggers, whole group, each one writing about a specific person in a particular branch of government, the Food and Drug Administration, the IRS, the Department of Justice, and talks about the work that they are doing and the enormous impact it makes on all of our lives.
And we never knew that these people were doing these amazing things. This is absolutely the book for right now. And it pairs beautifully with another book I love, John Green's ""Everything is Tuberculosis."" John Green, our most famous young adult author, is obsessed with tuberculosis, tuberculosis in history, but also tuberculosis here and now.
Why is it that this completely curable disease is still killing so many people, and what will happen when we no longer are giving money to the World Health Organization to save those people's lives?
OK, Maureen?
OK, summer sea stories. So one of my recommendations is ""A Marriage at Sea"" by Sophie Elmhirst, which is a fantastic true story about a young couple in the 1970s in England who decide that they want to build a boat.
They're not wealthy, lower middle class. They want to build a boat, chuck everything, and live at sea. Everything is wonderful.
Not at the beach, but really at sea, right?
No, out there. Out there. Everything is terrific until about a year into the voyage. They're in the middle of the Pacific, and they encounter a whale who breaches the boat. The boat sinks within minutes, and they are left for four months out on a rubber raft in the middle of the Pacific. So it tests the marriage. It also tests endurance, right?
So that's one. And then a land story…
It's like, you think you got troubles in your marriage, right?
(Laughter)
Well, it does make you wonder, would I really eat raw birds to survive?
The other story is definitely on firm ground, ""The Salt Stones"" by Helen Whybrow.
And Whybrow was an editor earlier in her life, worked in publishing. And then — but for the last 20 years, she and her husband have been on a farm in Vermont, and she has been raising Icelandic sheep. This is not my fantasy. This is not my world. But, boy, does she take me as a reader out there into the meadow with her and make me feel how everything is interconnected in that meadow.
So I strongly recommend that one.
OK, now I asked you both for either a children's book or something that you go back to reread, an old classic. And I understand you have been talking on the side here and come up with a surprise.
I know we both love it.
""Mister Dog"" lives by my desk at home. It's by Helen (sic) Wise Brown, who gave us ""Goodnight Moon,"" which is a weird story.
Sure.
This is an even weirder story, I think. It's the last book she wrote before her untimely death. And it's about a dog named Crispin's Crispian. And he's named that because he owns himself, he belongs to himself.
And it does what great children's books, what great books, period, do. It takes you into a world you would never have imagined. And you just want to stay there.
All right, I wasn't expecting that.
Well, Ann, give us one last children's book or young adult. What have you think you got?
Yes, OK.
""In the Wild"" by Zadie Smith and Nick Laird, right? Zadie Smith, our greatest writer, has written about a weird little guinea pig in a judo suit. This is the sequel to her book ""The Surprise."" And in this one, the guinea pig's owner, Maud, is going camping. Guinea pig gets into the backpack, the way they do, and goes off into the wilderness.
It is such a strange, terrific book. Love it. Love it.
All right, I know this could go on a long time, but we have to stop somewhere.
Ann Patchett and Maureen Corrigan, thank you both very much.

With summer in full swing, you may be wondering what books to take along on vacation or enjoy right at home. Senior arts correspondent Jeffrey Brown has answers to that question from two of our regulars, Ann Patchett and Maureen Corrigan. It's for our arts and culture series, CANVAS.

Senior arts correspondent Jeffrey Brown talks with two ""News Hour"" regulars who have answers to that question.
It's part of our arts and culture series, Canvas.
Jeffrey Brown:
And for ideas for your summer reading, we have two of our favorite readers and recommenders, Maureen Corrigan, a professor at Georgia University and book critic for NPR's ""Fresh Air,"" and Ann Patchett, acclaimed author, most recently of the novel ""Tom Lake,"" and owner of Parnassus Books in Nashville, where she joins us.
Maureen and Ann, it's really nice to talk to you both again.
Ann, you want to start with maybe two or three novels, fiction?
Ann Patchett, Owner, Parnassus Books:
Yes, absolutely.
All right, I'm starting off with a book called ""The Correspondent"" by Virginia Evans. This is an epistolary novel. Epistolary novels usually don't work, but this one does. It's about a grouchy, older woman who lives alone, who in the course of the book makes more and more connections to neighbors, to friends. It's a really beautiful, beautiful book, a debut.
Way to go, Virginia. And then..
And it says a cause for celebration by Ann Patchett on the cover.
Ann Patchett:
Yes, right? Exactly. Everything — that's the thing about owning a bookstore and being an author. My name winds up on a lot of books.
Kathy Wang's ""The Satisfaction Cafe"" just came out. And, again, it's a very quiet, funny, smart book in which you don't think a whole lot is going on. And then more and more and more happens. It follows one woman over the course of her life in the Bay Area. Think Anne Tyler, just beautifully written, quiet, simple, and very, very smart, very entertaining.
Maureen, what do you have?
Maureen Corrigan, NPR Book Critic:
Oh, gosh.
Summer to me is mystery and suspense fiction. So, S.A. Cosby, who is one of the greatest crime writers alive today, his latest book is called ""King of Ashes."" And it's about a young man, a successful financier who returns to his hometown in Virginia, where his father has been the victim of a mysterious hit-and-run.
This young man has to figure out how to save the family business, which is a crematory. His father is the king of ashes. He's the owner of the crematory. How to save it from the clutches of a mob that now controls the town. Cosby is tough, he's rough, and that crematory gets a lot of action. So I warn readers who don't like the grisly stuff, that's there, but he is fantastic.
They do go for it, right?
Maureen Corrigan:
He goes for it, and it feels very authentic.
Another book that I would recommend is ""El Dorado Drive"" by Megan Abbott. Megan Abbott is an amazing suspense writer who seems to specialize in closed communities of women that turn very weird very quickly. And this book is set in Detroit, which is Abbott's hometown, early 2000s. Detroit is down on its luck. A bunch of women get together and join a finance club and they spout all these slogans about female empowerment.
And yet this club also turns out to be a Ponzi scheme. So there's that.
OK, how about nonfiction, Ann? Give us two, OK?
All right, two.
""Who Is Government?"" Michael Lewis, I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. One, it is a pure pleasure to read. He has a great group of authors that he's working with, Geraldine Brooks, Casey Cep, Dave Eggers, whole group, each one writing about a specific person in a particular branch of government, the Food and Drug Administration, the IRS, the Department of Justice, and talks about the work that they are doing and the enormous impact it makes on all of our lives.
And we never knew that these people were doing these amazing things. This is absolutely the book for right now. And it pairs beautifully with another book I love, John Green's ""Everything is Tuberculosis."" John Green, our most famous young adult author, is obsessed with tuberculosis, tuberculosis in history, but also tuberculosis here and now.
Why is it that this completely curable disease is still killing so many people, and what will happen when we no longer are giving money to the World Health Organization to save those people's lives?
OK, Maureen?
OK, summer sea stories. So one of my recommendations is ""A Marriage at Sea"" by Sophie Elmhirst, which is a fantastic true story about a young couple in the 1970s in England who decide that they want to build a boat.
They're not wealthy, lower middle class. They want to build a boat, chuck everything, and live at sea. Everything is wonderful.
Not at the beach, but really at sea, right?
No, out there. Out there. Everything is terrific until about a year into the voyage. They're in the middle of the Pacific, and they encounter a whale who breaches the boat. The boat sinks within minutes, and they are left for four months out on a rubber raft in the middle of the Pacific. So it tests the marriage. It also tests endurance, right?
So that's one. And then a land story…
It's like, you think you got troubles in your marriage, right?
(Laughter)
Well, it does make you wonder, would I really eat raw birds to survive?
The other story is definitely on firm ground, ""The Salt Stones"" by Helen Whybrow.
And Whybrow was an editor earlier in her life, worked in publishing. And then — but for the last 20 years, she and her husband have been on a farm in Vermont, and she has been raising Icelandic sheep. This is not my fantasy. This is not my world. But, boy, does she take me as a reader out there into the meadow with her and make me feel how everything is interconnected in that meadow.
So I strongly recommend that one.
OK, now I asked you both for either a children's book or something that you go back to reread, an old classic. And I understand you have been talking on the side here and come up with a surprise.
I know we both love it.
""Mister Dog"" lives by my desk at home. It's by Helen (sic) Wise Brown, who gave us ""Goodnight Moon,"" which is a weird story.
Sure.
This is an even weirder story, I think. It's the last book she wrote before her untimely death. And it's about a dog named Crispin's Crispian. And he's named that because he owns himself, he belongs to himself.
And it does what great children's books, what great books, period, do. It takes you into a world you would never have imagined. And you just want to stay there.
All right, I wasn't expecting that.
Well, Ann, give us one last children's book or young adult. What have you think you got?
Yes, OK.
""In the Wild"" by Zadie Smith and Nick Laird, right? Zadie Smith, our greatest writer, has written about a weird little guinea pig in a judo suit. This is the sequel to her book ""The Surprise."" And in this one, the guinea pig's owner, Maud, is going camping. Guinea pig gets into the backpack, the way they do, and goes off into the wilderness.

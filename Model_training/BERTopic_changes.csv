University High's Lamar Brown committed to LSU football over Texas A&M, Texas and Miami, he announced at Pennington McKernan Gymnasium on Thursday afternoon.
The five-star defensive lineman in the 2026 class is the highest-rated player at his position and the No. 5 overall player in the country, according to the 247Sports composite rankings. On ESPN, he’s listed as the No. 1 player in the nation.
""It always started off with coach (Brian) Kelly,"" Brown said during a commitment that aired on ESPN. ""That was my first offer. He always believed in me. Just the coaches here, playing for Baton Rouge, playing for the state of Louisiana, it meant a lot.""
The 6-foot-4, 285-pound Brown also plays on the offensive line in high school, though he said he wants to play defensive line as he moves forward. He is described as a stout and explosive athlete who “projects as a high-major impact player on either side of the ball” and has “legitimate high-round NFL Draft potential,” according to a 247Sports scouting report.
The two-way player is also a decorated track and field athlete. He was the 2025 Louisiana 3A State Champion in the discus with a winning throw of 151 feet and 6 inches. He took gold in the event as a sophomore and finished second in 2023 as a freshman.
LSU’s recruiting class jumped to No. 7 nationally, according to 247Sports, after Brown's commitment. He is now the second-highest-rated player who has committed to Kelly and his staff behind wide receiver Tristen Keys, who is the No. 3 player in the country on the 247Sports composite.
If LSU holds onto Brown and Keys, it would sign two of the top 5 recruits on the 247Sports composite rankings. The last time that happened was 2011 with offensive lineman La'el Collins and defensive lineman Anthony Johnson.
Brown would be the first No. 1 overall recruit on ESPN's rankings to sign with the Tigers since running back Leonard Fournette in 2014.",The Advocate,[],"['Louisiana', 'Baton Rouge', 'Lamar Brown', 'LSU', 'Texas A&M', 'Texas', 'Miami', 'ESPN', 'Brian', 'Kelly', 'Brown', 'ESPN', 'Baton Rouge', 'Louisiana', 'Brown', 'NFL Draft', 'Louisiana 3A State Champion', 'LSU', 'Brown', 'Kelly', 'Tristen Keys', 'LSU', 'Brown', 'Keys', ""La'el Collins"", 'Anthony Johnson', 'Brown', 'ESPN', 'Tigers', 'Leonard Fournette']","LSU football lands Lamar Brown, the best recruit in Louisiana and top-5 player in 2026 class.

At Eagle Point High School, I exceeded my own expectations by getting involved in various activities, such as Leadership, National Honor Society, Varsity Sports, Yearbook Editor and Editor in Chief, Junior Class Representative, Senior Class Secretary, Top 5% of my class all four years and Prom Committee. I also took college classes, tutored, and joined the Latinx Student Union. These positions required a significant amount of dedication, hard work, and year-round commitment. Although I cannot predict the future, I aspire to continue to challenge myself and strive for excellence in all that I do.
Why I Chose Oregon Tech and My Major
In fourth grade, I had an X-ray for back issues that sparked my interest in pursuing Radiology. After researching and consulting with educators, Oregon Tech emerged as the ideal college choice, notably due to its externship program that offers a practical experience to supplement theoretical learning.
My Influential Professors
In the fall term, I enrolled in MIT103 under the tutelage of Professor Carrie Giacomelli. Professor Giacomelli was a knowledgeable and professional instructor who invited guest speakers to provide real-world insights into our future careers. Likewise, I hold Professor Tricia Elliott in high regard for her unwavering commitment to her students' educational development. Professor Elliott's engaging teaching style made the difficult subject of Anatomy and Physiology more accessible, using animal analogies to enhance comprehension.

Relocating to a new location inevitably entails learning about oneself and others. In particular, effective time management became a critical skill that I had to develop. Despite having accrued college credits while still in high school, adapting to college coursework necessitated a challenging but ultimately rewarding adjustment process.
My Plans After Graduation
After college, I aim to join a program that lets me travel across the United States to provide medical aid to patients.

We hear it from the time we're little
“Find your purpose.”
It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?
This is “purpose anxiety” — the gnawing sense that one’s life should have an overarching purpose, but it’s unclear how to discover it.
“There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.
The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?
Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help “close that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,” he said.
People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.
There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.
But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.
The term “purpose anxiety” appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.”
People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose.
“Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.”
“But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.”
Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center).
Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don’t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.
As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit.""
You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life.
It entails “understanding who you are and what you have to work with, understanding what you care about, what you’d like to see be better, either in yourself or in the world” and then figuring out if you can make an impact, he added.
“In our culture, we are so outcome-focused and process-adverse,” he said. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.”
For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second.
“Big ‘P’ Purpose is goal-oriented — it’s usually big and audacious, and often unattainable,” he said. Social media, he said, “is full of people trying to voice that version of purpose on you so that they can make money.”
Better, he said, to focus on little “p” purpose and pursuits that some might simply call hobbies — gardening, singing, collecting baseball cards. Or it can be found in a job, or volunteering.
“What could I do that would light me up and fill me up and be a good use of my time?” Grumet said.
It’s not just for self-improvement, he said. When people do something they love, they attract people to them, which can help create communities.
Not all agree that hobbies and passions are the same as purpose. Reading books, Kashdan said, isn’t a purpose in itself but can be a tool to discovering it. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.”
Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children
“I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.
But she ended up creating an online community for childless women called Gateway Women.com. In rural Ireland, where she lives, she is also helping build an in-person group that brings people without children together as they age.
“I feel that to be alive in this time, and to have a platform and to be awake is an incredible privilege, and that is my purpose,” she said.

More than 470 fires across the country are currently classified as “out of control”, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).
7,318,421 hectares of land in Canada have burned due to wildfires this year – close to 78% more than the five-year average of 4,114,516 hectares, according to the CIFFC’s latest data.
The 2025 fire season is only behind the explosive 2023 wildfire season, which resulted in an astounding 17,203,625 hectares burned.
“This is our new reality… the warmer it gets, the more fires we see,” said Mike Flannigan, the BC research chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops.
A June analysis on the 2025 fire season in Canada published by United Nations University in Shibuya, Japan, concluded that the fires are a “stark manifestation” of climate change and that warm, dry weather in the spring resulted in temperatures 2.5C above average.
The warmer temperatures extend the fire season and increase the frequency of lightning that sparks fires, said Flannigan. A hotter climate also causes the atmosphere to suck moisture out of fuel, dead vegetation and the forest floor – creating ideal conditions for fires to start, he explained.
“It means more of the material is dried out, is available to burn when the fire does come, it leads to bigger flames, higher intensity, which gets to be difficult to impossible to extinguish,” he said.
So far, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which together account for about 60% of the hectares burned so far this year in Canada.
Tens of thousands of people in communities across the country have been evacuated due to the wildfires. In Saskatchewan, the Canadian Red Cross reported it had assisted more than 17,000 people in the province from over 6,700 households to evacuate.
Thirteen communities in north-west Saskatchewan are under an evacuation order, several of which are First Nations, according to the province. One of the most affected areas of this year’s wildfire season in the province is Denare Beach, a north-eastern village that was mostly destroyed in June due to a blaze.
The season has also now hit the east coast of Canada, as wildfires are currently raging across Newfoundland and Labrador and several towns are under evacuation orders.
John Abatzoglou, a professor of complex systems management at the University of California, Merced, co-authored the June report from United Nations University.
Abatzoglou said this year’s fire season is the third year in a row Canada has seen fire activity that is well above average. The fires are also causing widespread smoke to cascade from the country into the United States as well, prompting severe air quality warnings in several states this month, is also an indication of how the fires are hurting populations beyond evacuations.
It’s an international element of the fires that officials are having to contend with on a wider scale, Abatzoglou said.
“This is a really key point that’s different from other natural hazards and its ability to impact everything from quality of life to … human health and even mortality,” he said.
Governments and public health officials will have to address how to change public behaviour and public policy to contend with “smoke days”, where you have to stay inside, he said.

The man, who remained anonymous in the case study, told doctors he had eliminated sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt, from his diet after reading about its negative health effects. He said he could only find sources telling him how to reduce salt, but not eliminate it completely.
Inspired by his nutrition studies in college, the man decided to completely eliminate sodium chloride from his diet as a personal experiment, with consultation from Chat GPT, researchers wrote. He maintained multiple dietary restrictions and even distilled his own water at home.
“For 3 months, he had replaced sodium chloride with sodium bromide obtained from the internet after consultation with ChatGPT, in which he had read that chloride can be swapped with bromide, though likely for other purposes, such as cleaning,” the case study read.
While excess sodium can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of health issues, it is still necessary to consume a healthy amount of it.
The man, who had no psychiatric history, eventually ended up at the hospital, worried that his neighbor was poisoning him. He told doctors he was very thirsty, but paranoid about the water he was offered.
“In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability,” the study read.
Doctors concluded that the man was suffering from bromism, or bromide toxicity, a condition that is rare today but was more common in the early 20th century. The research noted that bromide was found in several over-the-counter medicines back then and contributed to up to 8% of bromism-related psychiatric admissions at that time.
The hospital treated the man for psychosis and discharged him weeks later. His case highlights the potential pitfalls of using AI to seek medical tips.

""At first I was shocked, then it turned into panic,"" said the 20-year-old, describing the ordeal as a ""wound that will leave a scar"".
C was one of three women who exposed an AI porn scandal at Hong Kong's oldest university last month, sparking huge debate around what had largely been seen as an overseas phenomenon.
The victims, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, and experts said the city was ill-prepared to counter the fast-growing threat.
In the University of Hong Kong (HKU) case, hundreds of images of at least 20 women were discovered on the student's laptop.
""B"", another of those who spoke out, said she felt betrayed as she had considered the perpetrator a friend.
""I felt like my privacy was violated... like I couldn't trust the people around me,"" she said.
The university's initial response was to give the student a warning letter and make him apologise.
The third woman, ""A"", said she was told by staff the case couldn't be heard before a disciplinary committee.
""They were concerned but didn't know what they could do... We felt that was a bit ridiculous.""
HKU told AFP it ""has been in contact with the students involved"" but cannot comment further with the case under active review.
- Damage may 'never end' -
While the HKU case has thrust AI-made porn into the spotlight, it is not the city's first.
Janice, a woman in her late 20s who also asked to use a pseudonym, told AFP she was devastated a few years ago when fake obscene images were sent to her friends.
She never found the culprit and worried that the damage might ""never end"".
""I tried skipping work and didn't dare to go out on the street,"" she said, adding that she had suicidal thoughts and would suddenly burst into tears.
""I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would wake up to see the whole internet filled with (pornographic) images of me.""
Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women received 11 similar requests for help in 2024-25.
""We have observed an uptick... Some cases may be hidden if (victims) don't know how to seek help,"" executive director Doris Chong said.
Janice doubted she had enough evidence to persuade police to help, adding that she felt society will ""never find a way"" to punish canny offenders.
- Type of 'sexual violence' -
An estimated 90 percent of AI-made porn victims are women, Susanne Choi from the Chinese University of Hong Kong told AFP, ""suggesting that it is a form of gender-based sexual violence"".
Asked for the number of recent cases involving deepfake pornography, police said they did not maintain such figures.
Lawmakers and universities need to ""expand and revise existing laws and procedures to better cope with... technology-facilitated sexual harassment"", Choi argued.
Discussions in Britain and Singapore show a growing willingness to penalise its creation, though opinion is split on possession, according to Hong Kong barrister Stephen Keung.
Hong Kong currently criminalises the distribution of ""intimate images"", including AI-made ones, but not their creation or possession.
That made legal action in the HKU case difficult as there was no evidence that the pictures were circulated.
After the women went public with the scandal, however, Hong Kong's privacy watchdog launched a criminal investigation, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is handling a related complaint.
- Dignity 'undermined' -
The three students said they have had to deal with public backlash.
Once an avid social media user, C temporarily stopped posting, worried about who else ""would screengrab my photos for what purpose"".
""Many commenters said... 'You are ruining the guy's future, you should apologise to him',"" she said, saying she endured periods of self-doubt.
The student has not been named and AFP was unable to reach him for comment.
B said the trio did not want to ""play judge"" but believed offenders should face long-term consequences.
""The mere creation (of AI porn) is a problem... My bodily autonomy, my privacy, my dignity were undermined by it,"" B said.
""If a line must be drawn, it should be drawn at creation.""

""I tried skipping work and didn't dare to go out on the street,"" she said, adding that she had suicidal thoughts and would suddenly burst into tears.
""I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would wake up to see the whole internet filled with (pornographic) images of me.""
Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women received 11 similar requests for help in 2024-25.
""We have observed an uptick... Some cases may be hidden if (victims) don't know how to seek help,"" executive director Doris Chong said.
Janice doubted she had enough evidence to persuade police to help, adding that she felt society will ""never find a way"" to punish canny offenders.
- Type of 'sexual violence' -
An estimated 90 percent of AI-made porn victims are women, Susanne Choi from the Chinese University of Hong Kong told AFP, ""suggesting that it is a form of gender-based sexual violence"".
Asked for the number of recent cases involving deepfake pornography, police said they did not maintain such figures.
Lawmakers and universities need to ""expand and revise existing laws and procedures to better cope with... technology-facilitated sexual harassment"", Choi argued.
Discussions in Britain and Singapore show a growing willingness to penalise its creation, though opinion is split on possession, according to Hong Kong barrister Stephen Keung.
Hong Kong currently criminalises the distribution of ""intimate images"", including AI-made ones, but not their creation or possession.
That made legal action in the HKU case difficult as there was no evidence that the pictures were circulated.
After the women went public with the scandal, however, Hong Kong's privacy watchdog launched a criminal investigation, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is handling a related complaint.
- Dignity 'undermined' -
The three students said they have had to deal with public backlash.
Once an avid social media user, C temporarily stopped posting, worried about who else ""would screengrab my photos for what purpose"".
""Many commenters said... 'You are ruining the guy's future, you should apologise to him',"" she said, saying she endured periods of self-doubt.
The student has not been named and AFP was unable to reach him for comment.
B said the trio did not want to ""play judge"" but believed offenders should face long-term consequences.
""The mere creation (of AI porn) is a problem... My bodily autonomy, my privacy, my dignity were undermined by it,"" B said.
""If a line must be drawn, it should be drawn at creation.""

As a former school leader and as a parent to teenagers, I know the range of emotions that come with exams and the reassurances we try to offer our children, or the students in our lives, as they navigate their journey into higher education.
While more than three quarters of students are accepted at their first choice (their Ucas “firm” choice) every year, we are also seeing increasing activity in clearing — from those whose Plan A hasn’t worked out, those who would like to revisit their choices, as well as those who have just decided to apply for the first time. If you are supporting someone waiting for their results this summer, or who wants to enter higher education, and you are not quite sure what clearing is about, Ucas has a wealth of information and practical tips to guide you.
What exactly is clearing?
Clearing is the final stage of the Ucas admissions process. It allows students who have received their results to find university or college places that are yet to be filled. It’s available to anyone who may not have received the grades they need for their firm or insurance choice — but also to those who do have a place and are considering another option, or those who only decide to apply after the last main scheme Ucas deadline in June. Last year 38,935 UK 18-year-olds secured a place at university or college through clearing.
Clearing opened on July 5 and runs until October 20, although the busiest activity happens in mid-August just after the results for A-level, Btec and other qualifications are released. There are plenty of options in clearing once again this year, with about 28,000 courses available across the country.
At Ucas we always advise students to do their research, so they can be prepared for whatever happens. Our advice this year includes encouraging applicants to build a results day action plan by reflecting on their research and reconnecting with their choices. Students might want to look back at their original five choices on the Ucas application and revisit them as a potential option, as we know many students return to one of the original universities or colleges they applied to earlier in the cycle. In other words, don’t start making a whole new playlist when you already have good reasons to choose your favourite songs.
Who else is clearing for?
If a student hasn’t applied to university or college yet but is starting to wish that they had, it’s not too late. They may have just realised that they do want to start a degree this autumn, or they may be a few years into their careers but are looking to get back into education. Whatever the reason, they can still apply to university or college through Ucas by applying directly into clearing. This is an increasingly popular route, with more students choosing to apply direct to clearing every year, in addition to the traditional clearing users who find themselves there having just missed out on the grades needed for their firm or insurance choices.
Last year 67 per cent of those who found a place at university or college in clearing told Ucas that they started their research before August, which shows the importance of getting prepared before results day. For any students who are potentially rethinking their firm choice, I would always suggest getting in touch with that university in the first instance to discuss options. The university might be able to offer a place on a different course if they have changed their mind about what subject they want to study and can share more information about available support.
It’s clear that clearing has evolved, with growing numbers of students now using it as a planned route to find the right course or university for them.
How does it work?
The best way for students to use clearing is to start by creating an account on the Ucas website. They can then search for available courses and, once they have found one they are interested in, contact the university or college directly (making sure they have their clearing number and personal ID on hand) to check they meet the entry requirements. If they are offered a place that they want to accept, they can add the clearing choice in their application via their Ucas account.
Applicants will be able to add a clearing choice from 1pm on Level 3 Results Day, which this year is Thursday, August 14 — or for students in Scotland, from 10am on SQA Results Day on Tuesday, August 5.
Is extra support available?
Ucas has a range of digital tools to support applicants during this time, with our Clearing Plus tool offering personalised matches to available courses based on the information students have submitted in their application. Students can get a taster of different subjects or different careers with virtual work experience on ucas.com. We also have a team of experts on hand who can be reached on the phone, on our social media channels and via our website.
This year we have worked with Clementine Wade, the university and school coach, to create resources specifically for parents, carers and guardians to help you understand what you can do to best support your child through the process.
Results day is a cause for huge celebration, for students, their parents and carers, their teachers, and everyone else who has supported them through their education so far. At Ucas we are committed to ensuring as many people as possible can benefit from the life-changing opportunity of higher education. Together this summer we can help students to make informed choices so they can progress with excitement and confidence.",GDeltProject,[],"['Ucas', 'UK', 'n’t', 'Ucas', 'Ucas', 'Scotland', 'SQA Results Day', 'Clearing Plus', 'Clementine Wade']","A-level results day 2025: full guide to Ucas clearing.

NIH has recently announced a new policy that will continue to support originality, creativity, and fairness in the research application process. NIH has noticed that some Principal Investigators (PIs) have been submitting a large number of research applications that far exceed the numbers we traditionally expect and may have been prepared using artificial intelligence (AI) tools.
While AI may be a helpful tool in preparing applications, the rapid submission of large numbers of research applications from a single PI may undermine the fairness and originality of the research application process and unfairly strain NIH’s application review processes.
As use of AI tools becomes more commonplace, it is important to remember that applicants may use AI in limited aspects to reduce administrative burden while preparing applications. However, applicants should be mindful of the concerns around research misconduct or lack of originality when using such tools. Remember, NIH peer reviewers are prohibited from using AI for their critiques.
To address these issues, the new policy is effective for the September 25, 2025, receipt date and beyond:
Applications that are either substantially developed by AI or containing sections substantially developed by AI are not considered the original ideas of applicants and will not be considered by NIH.
-
NIH will also only accept up to six new, renewal, resubmission, or revision applications from an individual PD/PI (Program Director/Principal Investigator) or Multiple Principal Investigator for all council rounds in a calendar year.

Last month was muggier than usual for the majority of the Lower 48. Parts of the Midwest, East Coast and mid-Atlantic regions, in particular, were intensely humid in July, according to preliminary data compiled by researchers at Oregon State University.
Hot and humid conditions are to be expected in the summer, but heat index values — what conditions “feel like” when humidity and air temperatures are combined — soared well into the triple digits for extended periods of time in places such as Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Florida last month.
Cities such as Pittsburgh; Roanoke, Virginia; and Washington, D.C., all registered their most humid July in recorded history, according to figures compiled by the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, which collects and tracks data on precipitation, soil temperature and other environmental conditions. New York City and Raleigh, North Carolina, had their second-most-humid July, while humidity in Detroit and Cincinnati reached their third-highest levels last month.
In Paducah, Kentucky, a brutal stretch of high heat and humidity from July 16 to 30 set a slew of new records for the city.
“We have reached the end to the longest stretch of continuously high humidity that Paducah has witnessed in the past 75 years,” the local branch of the National Weather Service said Thursday in a post on X, adding that the number of hours at “oppressive levels” of humidity exceeded 300% of the city’s normal amount for the month of July.
Humid days are expected to be more common as a result of climate change, because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. But beyond the discomfort of a sticky summer, soaring humidity levels pose serious threats to health and public safety.
High heat index values increase the risk of heat-related illness and death, particularly among children, older adults and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. A 2022 study by the nonprofit organization Climate Central found that the combination of high heat and humidity can affect the body’s ability to cool itself down through sweating.
“In many parts of the country and the globe, dangerous heat often occurs along with high humidity — and the pair of conditions multiplies the health risks,” the researchers wrote in their analysis.

The 2017 “megaflash” stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City — a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.
“Over time, as the data record continues to expand, we will be able to observe even the rarest types of extreme lightning on Earth and investigate the broad impacts of lightning on society,” study lead author Michael Peterson, an atmospheric scientist in the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said in a statement.

An enormous, 515-mile-long flash of lightning that crossed at least three states has been named the longest in recorded history in the world.
The 2017 “megaflash” stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City — a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.

Losses of land-based water could have profound implications for access to safe drinking water","Overpumping groundwater, worsening droughts and more rapid evaporation due to higher temperatures have caused a drastic decline in the amount of available freshwater, according to a new study.
“Continental drying” has redirected the planet’s total water to the oceans to such degree that it has now surpassed melting ice sheets as the biggest contributor to global sea level rise, the research found.
Losses of land-based water could have profound implications for access to safe drinking water and the ability to grow food in some of the world’s richest agricultural regions.
“We use a lot of water to grow food,” said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at Arizona State University’s School of Sustainability and one of the authors of the study. “If things don’t change, we’ll see impacts on our food security and just our general water availability.”
The findings “should be of paramount concern to the general public, to resource managers, and to decision-makers around the world,” the researchers wrote in the study, adding that the identified trends “send perhaps the direst message on the impact of climate change to date.”
“The continents are drying, freshwater availability is shrinking, and sea level rise is accelerating,” they wrote.
The study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, assessed changes in terrestrial water sources, such as lakes, underground aquifers and moisture in soil, over the past two decades. The researchers found that several factors, including climate change, are disrupting Earth’s natural water cycle, upsetting how moisture circulates between the ground, oceans and atmosphere.
The researchers used data from a suite of four NASA satellites to analyze changes in terrestrial water storage over the past 22 years. The satellites were designed to track the movement of Earth’s water, including changes to the planet’s ice sheets, glaciers and underground reservoirs.
The researchers found, for instance, that parts of the world that are already dry have been rapidly getting drier since 2014. These drought-ridden regions increased by an area twice the size of California each year, Famiglietti said.
In several cases, drought-ridden hotspots expanded to create giant, interconnected “mega-drying” regions, according to the study. One such area covers parts of Central America, Mexico, California, the southwestern United States, the lower Colorado River basin and the southern High Plains.
“The key message here is that water is really a key driver of the changes we see both on land and in the ocean,” said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Earth Sciences Section at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who served on the science team for the NASA missions that produced the decades of data used in the new study.
The study found that every large land mass, except for Greenland and Antarctica, has experienced unprecedented drying since 2002.
Widespread continental drying is expected to have major consequences for people. Three quarters of the world’s population lives in countries where freshwater resources are being depleted, according to the researchers.
Meanwhile, rising seas threaten to creep up on coastal regions around the globe, making them less habitable and adding to the mounting pressures caused by extreme storms and floods. In the U.S., severe weather has helped trigger an insurance crisis in coastal cities that are prone to extreme weather events.
The link between sea-level rise and the loss of water locked up in the ground is a consequence of throwing the planet’s water cycle into chaos. Many of these changes, such as overpumping groundwater, are thought to be permanent — or, at the very least, irreversible for thousands or tens of thousands of years, said Alexander Simms, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved with the study.
“If you pull water off the continents, the only place it has to go is in the ocean,” he said. “Water goes in the atmosphere, then 88% of that water rains down on Earth and ends up in the ocean.”
Simms said the study was fascinating in its ability to estimate the global scale of these water losses, but he was skeptical of the claim that water loss from the continents has now surpassed ice sheet melt as the biggest contributor to sea level rise.
Still, Hamlington said the study shows how the movement of water around the planet has enormous ripple effects. It also suggests that the consequences could intensify in the future, if groundwater is further depleted, freshwater resources shrink and drought conditions worsen.

“The key message here is that water is really a key driver of the changes we see both on land and in the ocean,” said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Earth Sciences Section at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who served on the science team for the NASA missions that produced the decades of data used in the new study.
The study found that every large land mass, except for Greenland and Antarctica, has experienced unprecedented drying since 2002.
Widespread continental drying is expected to have major consequences for people. Three quarters of the world’s population lives in countries where freshwater resources are being depleted, according to the researchers.
Meanwhile, rising seas threaten to creep up on coastal regions around the globe, making them less habitable and adding to the mounting pressures caused by extreme storms and floods. In the U.S., severe weather has helped trigger an insurance crisis in coastal cities that are prone to extreme weather events.
The link between sea-level rise and the loss of water locked up in the ground is a consequence of throwing the planet’s water cycle into chaos. Many of these changes, such as overpumping groundwater, are thought to be permanent — or, at the very least, irreversible for thousands or tens of thousands of years, said Alexander Simms, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved with the study.
“If you pull water off the continents, the only place it has to go is in the ocean,” he said. “Water goes in the atmosphere, then 88% of that water rains down on Earth and ends up in the ocean.”
Simms said the study was fascinating in its ability to estimate the global scale of these water losses, but he was skeptical of the claim that water loss from the continents has now surpassed ice sheet melt as the biggest contributor to sea level rise.
Still, Hamlington said the study shows how the movement of water around the planet has enormous ripple effects. It also suggests that the consequences could intensify in the future, if groundwater is further depleted, freshwater resources shrink and drought conditions worsen.
“This kind of tracking of terrestrial water storage is a critical piece of the puzzle,” he said. “If we can track that water, if we know where it’s going, we can improve our understanding of future drought, flooding and water resource availability over land.”",-1.0,0.0,Climate Infrastructure Risks,1.611,,0.0,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 23:19:34 GMT",20.0,,-1664.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,5.0,1.611,Climate Infrastructure Risks,,2025-08-16 00:29:07.503909+00:00,1,2025-08-16 00:29:07.503885+00:00,,,448.0,,Climate Infrastructure Risks,climate infrastructure risks,Climate Infrastructure Risks,1.0

New college graduates are facing one of the most challenging markets for entry-level jobs in a decade.

John Yang:
New college graduates are facing one of the most challenging markets for entry level jobs in a decade. In June, the most recent data available, the unemployment rate for recent grads was nearly 5 percent. That's higher than the overall unemployment rate. We asked recent graduates to tell us about their job searches.
Jack O’Connor:
My hope after graduating college was to go straight into a full time job in reporting.
Anjoleigh Schindler:
My initial plans were to find a local job in a magazine. I just wanted to find a job where I could write.
Michael Lavin:
I had aspirations of working for the GSA, General Services Administration. I was going into a third round interview with them around November, December, and that is when the federal hiring freeze took over.
I would often be what I would consider ghosted by employers. Wouldn't get any feedback at all, not even a rejection, just nothing.
I must have started applying for jobs in April, and I know I've sent 85 job applications since. It's been really difficult.
When I wasn't getting any feedback from my applications, was really dejected. So it made me feel like I was unqualified for any job in journalism, like maybe I wasn't good enough.
The experience has definitely been discouraging. But I don't know. I like to take the mindset of I just got to keep plugging away, keep sending in applications, keep trying to revamp my resume.
I think I'm a little too stubborn to switch career paths right now. So I, you know, I'm going to keep at it, keep applying, and we'll just hope for the best, I suppose.
Christine Cruzvergara is the Chief Education Officer at Handshake, which is an online platform that connects young job seekers and employers. Christine, we just heard from three young people. You heard disappointment, you heard a little frustration. How typical is that from what you hear?
Christine Cruzvergara, Chief Education Officer, Handshake:
It's very common right now. The job market is tough, it's competitive. We've seen in our data that jobs are down 15 percent from last year, but applications are up 30 percent.
What makes it so tough?
Christine Cruzvergara:
Well, there are a number of different factors that make it difficult right now. One would obviously be the overall economy, the second would be the government, and the third would be what's happening with AI, disrupting what entry level jobs look like right now.
Talk a little bit about the AI part of that. We've heard some people say that AI is taking over the many of the tasks that entry level workers would normally do.
So employers are going to have new expectations around how you use AI, how it's integrated into your role, the amount of productivity you have. I think that altogether is going to mean that the skill set for an entry level worker will change and evolve and it will look different.
So for someone trying to graduate and find work, right now, they're in the middle of a very messy process where employers are trying to figure out what they want and what that looks like.
We heard one of the young men talking about he wanted to become a reporter, thinking about shifting fields, but wanted to avoid that. He said he was stubborn enough that he didn't want to do it. What are some of the sorts of tough choices or hard decisions that young people are having to face now as they look for their first jobs?
We see in our data that over 40 percent are willing to actually explore other industries that perhaps do have more hiring right now. For example, health care is still rising in terms of number of opportunities, and there aren't enough people who want to go into health care.
So some folks that have tech skills, for example, instead of working in a traditional tech industry, are thinking about, how might I do health tech, how can I pivot in that way? So that's one type of difficult decision.
The second would be location. Where do I want to live? This generation, this class knows that it's extremely expensive to live in certain cities. So the cost of living is factoring into their choices about where they choose to apply, what locations they want to live in.
I think a third piece is really considering what types of skills are they able to build and are they able to build it fast enough for what employers are looking for? And employers are still figuring that out, so it could change from one year to another.
You mentioned health care is a place where there are a lot of opportunities. Are there fields where that are sort of oversubscribed? There are more people chasing after fewer jobs.
Well, I think what we've seen just in the past year or two is that big tech, for example, has certainly slowed down in their hiring. The class of 2025 in particular, has been watching headlines for the better part of two years since seeing major layoffs happen. It is also the industry that is adopting Gen AI the fastest.
And so they are the ones kind of on the forefront of experimenting with what that looks like. How much headcount do you really need? How much could be paired with technology? What will the future of engineering teams look like? So that is certainly an industry where we have seen some slowdown.
What's your advice for the members of the class of 25 who are still out there looking for their first jobs?
Well, I think first you have to find a support group, a support network that's going to keep you positive through the process. It is tough, it is competitive, it is easy to feel rejected and dejected as you go through this process. That can be your family, that can be your friends, it could be your coaches, it could be your peers. Doesn't matter who, you just need to find someone.
I think the second piece is think about how you can upskill, so you have your degree. Fantastic. Are there other skills that you need to pair with that right now and take the advantage of all the online resources and all the free resources that are available to you and find ways to upskill yourself in the downtime while you are looking for a job?
And then lastly, remember that your first job is not your forever job. So keep in mind that whatever that first job is, it's going to teach you some skills. It's going to give you a chance to step up into the next thing. But it doesn't have to be perfect. And sometimes just releasing some of those expectations can help you find that next job a little faster.
Good advice. From Christine Cruzvergara of Handshake, thank you very much.
Thank you so much for having me.

Well, I think what we've seen just in the past year or two is that big tech, for example, has certainly slowed down in their hiring. The class of 2025 in particular, has been watching headlines for the better part of two years since seeing major layoffs happen. It is also the industry that is adopting Gen AI the fastest.
And so they are the ones kind of on the forefront of experimenting with what that looks like. How much headcount do you really need? How much could be paired with technology? What will the future of engineering teams look like? So that is certainly an industry where we have seen some slowdown.
What's your advice for the members of the class of 25 who are still out there looking for their first jobs?
Well, I think first you have to find a support group, a support network that's going to keep you positive through the process. It is tough, it is competitive, it is easy to feel rejected and dejected as you go through this process. That can be your family, that can be your friends, it could be your coaches, it could be your peers. Doesn't matter who, you just need to find someone.
I think the second piece is think about how you can upskill, so you have your degree. Fantastic. Are there other skills that you need to pair with that right now and take the advantage of all the online resources and all the free resources that are available to you and find ways to upskill yourself in the downtime while you are looking for a job?
And then lastly, remember that your first job is not your forever job. So keep in mind that whatever that first job is, it's going to teach you some skills. It's going to give you a chance to step up into the next thing. But it doesn't have to be perfect. And sometimes just releasing some of those expectations can help you find that next job a little faster.
Good advice. From Christine Cruzvergara of Handshake, thank you very much.
Thank you so much for having me.

John Yang:
In Geneva, negotiators from 175 nations are trying to hammer out the first ever legally binding treaty on plastic pollution. The key sticking point is whether it should mandate cuts in plastic production. Oil producing nations including the United States oppose that as fossil fuels are a key ingredient in plastics.
The urgency of the talks was underscored this week by a new study published in the medical journal The Lancet. It calls plastics a grave growing and under recognized danger to human and planetary health. Tracey Woodruff is a professor at the UC San Francisco Medical School and one of the authors of the Lancet study. Tracey, A grave, growing and under recognized danger. What is that danger? Explain the danger to us.
Tracey Woodruff, UC San Francisco School of Medicine: Plastic contains thousands of toxic chemicals. Some of them we know something about and some of them we don't know anything about. But the ones that we do know about, we know that they can lead to increased risk of multiple different types of chronic health effects.
For example, one chemical that's used commonly in plastics to which we are all exposed are phthalates. These are chemicals that are used in everything from vinyl flooring, curtains, plastic couches, even in your car, cosmetics, fragrances. These chemicals are ubiquitous. They're measured in everybody.
And we know they increase the risk of multiple adverse health conditions like obesity and diabetes and they can increase the risk of preterm birth. There's also an increased production of plastics. Currently planned plastic production will triple in the next 30 years. That means more plastic products and more plastic chemicals to which we will be exposed.
Talk about the production picking up the pace. Why is it accelerating?
Tracey Woodruff:
Plastics are made from fossil fuels, oil and gas. And the fossil fuel industry is turning to plastics to stay profitable making plastic and the petrochemicals used in plastic is more profitable than using it for fuel and energy and electricity.
So as the world uses less oil in some cases to address climate change concerns, the fossil fuel industry is shifting its focus to producing more plastic and plastic related chemicals to maintain and increase their profits.
You know, we see recycling bins everywhere now on the street and offices. What impact or what effect does recycling have?
Well, recycling is pretty much a myth that's been sold to us by the fossil fuel industry. And in fact, a report just came out this week talking about how those that the fossil fuel industry knew that you can't actually really recycle plastic. The fact is that less than 10 percent of plastic is recycled and only 1 percent is recycled twice.
And what that means is that a lot of this plastic we're being told, is being recycled to make us feel better, but it's really going into the waste stream. It's degrading in the environment, it's degrading into all of these, varied in the oceans, in fish, and then it's getting into us. So the reality is recycling is not the solution.
There's been a lot of talk about microplastics being so pervasive. Help us understand what that is and do we know what the effects are of having microplastics in our bodies?
Yeah, microplastics, they're essentially little plastics and they're very small, usually smaller than the human eye can see. And they're basic. They come from the degradation of all these many plastics that are being produced by these fossil fuel companies.
And we know that people carry little bits of microplastics in their body because they've been measured in every part of the body that they've been looked at. So everything from breast milk to blood to feces, even in your brain.
These talks in Geneva, they had hoped to conclude this by the end of 2024. Obviously they haven't. What's at stake in these talks?
Well, the health of everybody on this planet is at stake in these talks. The goal of the pla — of the countries that want to see something done about plastic pollution is to identify the hazardous chemicals in the plastics and reduce or eliminate them. The goal of the fossil fuel producing countries is to basically increase plastic production. And they are deviating the plastic negotiation treaties by focusing on recycling, which I have said is not really the solution to plastic production.
And so because these countries or the projected estimates are to triple by 26 plastic production, it really is an important inflection point in how we as well really as part of the global community, decide how we want to address plastics and the plastic related chemicals which we already know are already resulting in adverse human health effects around the globe.

The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.
UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.
President Donald Trump’s administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as with Harvard University.

The White House official did not detail any additional demands the administration has made to UCLA or elaborate on the settlement amount. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Trump administration suspended $584 million in federal grants for UCLA, the university said this week. The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.”
The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. Jewish students said demonstrators in the encampment blocked them from getting to class. One night, counterprotesters attacked the encampment, throwing traffic cones and firing pepper spray, with fighting that continued for hours, injuring more than a dozen people, before police stepped in. The next day, after hundreds defied orders to leave, more than 200 people were arrested.
The University of California’s president, James B. Milliken, said in a statement Friday that the university was reviewing a document it “just received” from the Department of Justice.
“Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” Milliken said. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”
This would not be the university’s first settlement over the 2024 protests. Last month, UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued, arguing that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.
The settlement comes nearly a year after a preliminary injunction was issued, marking the first time a U.S. judge had ruled against a university over their handling of on-campus demonstrations against Israel’s war in Gaza.
UCLA initially had argued that it had no legal responsibility over the issue because protesters, not the university, blocked Jewish students’ access to areas. The university also worked with law enforcement to thwart attempts to set up new protest camps.
But U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi disagreed and ordered UCLA to create a plan to protect Jewish students on campus. The University of California, one of the nation’s largest public university systems, has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests and has said it is committed to campus safety and inclusivity and will continue to implement recommendations.

As part of the settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university’s Jewish community. It also has created an Office of Campus and Community Safety, instituting new policies to manage protests on campus.
UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.
The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.
Last month Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government’s allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restores more than $400 million in research grants.
The Trump administration plans to use its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation.

The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.
UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.
President Donald Trump’s administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as with Harvard University.

A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.
Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.
The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.
A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump’s first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities’ investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.
The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.
The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.
“The tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,” said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.”
The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.
Some universities are on the edge of the law’s parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.
Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.
Despite the colleges’ wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.
“They’re looking for savings wherever possible,” Levine said, which could impact financial aid. “One of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.”
For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.
In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.
Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.
Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.
No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country’s wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it’s also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.
The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard’s research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard’s efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.
“It’s not like Harvard is going to go from one of the best institutions in the world to just a mediocre institution. That’s probably not going to happen,” Levine said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a bad thing — that there won’t be pain and that students won’t suffer.”

For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.
In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.
Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.
Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.
No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country’s wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it’s also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.
The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard’s research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard’s efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.
“It’s not like Harvard is going to go from one of the best institutions in the world to just a mediocre institution. That’s probably not going to happen,” Levine said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a bad thing — that there won’t be pain and that students won’t suffer.”

University High's Lamar Brown committed to LSU football over Texas A&M, Texas and Miami, he announced at Pennington McKernan Gymnasium on Thursday afternoon.
The five-star defensive lineman in the 2026 class is the highest-rated player at his position and the No. 5 overall player in the country, according to the 247Sports composite rankings. On ESPN, he’s listed as the No. 1 player in the nation.
""It always started off with coach (Brian) Kelly,"" Brown said during a commitment that aired on ESPN. ""That was my first offer. He always believed in me. Just the coaches here, playing for Baton Rouge, playing for the state of Louisiana, it meant a lot.""
The 6-foot-4, 285-pound Brown also plays on the offensive line in high school, though he said he wants to play defensive line as he moves forward. He is described as a stout and explosive athlete who “projects as a high-major impact player on either side of the ball” and has “legitimate high-round NFL Draft potential,” according to a 247Sports scouting report.
The two-way player is also a decorated track and field athlete. He was the 2025 Louisiana 3A State Champion in the discus with a winning throw of 151 feet and 6 inches. He took gold in the event as a sophomore and finished second in 2023 as a freshman.
LSU’s recruiting class jumped to No. 7 nationally, according to 247Sports, after Brown's commitment. He is now the second-highest-rated player who has committed to Kelly and his staff behind wide receiver Tristen Keys, who is the No. 3 player in the country on the 247Sports composite.
If LSU holds onto Brown and Keys, it would sign two of the top 5 recruits on the 247Sports composite rankings. The last time that happened was 2011 with offensive lineman La'el Collins and defensive lineman Anthony Johnson.
Brown would be the first No. 1 overall recruit on ESPN's rankings to sign with the Tigers since running back Leonard Fournette in 2014.",The Advocate,[],"['Louisiana', 'Baton Rouge', 'Lamar Brown', 'LSU', 'Texas A&M', 'Texas', 'Miami', 'ESPN', 'Brian', 'Kelly', 'Brown', 'ESPN', 'Baton Rouge', 'Louisiana', 'Brown', 'NFL Draft', 'Louisiana 3A State Champion', 'LSU', 'Brown', 'Kelly', 'Tristen Keys', 'LSU', 'Brown', 'Keys', ""La'el Collins"", 'Anthony Johnson', 'Brown', 'ESPN', 'Tigers', 'Leonard Fournette']","LSU football lands Lamar Brown, the best recruit in Louisiana and top-5 player in 2026 class.

At Eagle Point High School, I exceeded my own expectations by getting involved in various activities, such as Leadership, National Honor Society, Varsity Sports, Yearbook Editor and Editor in Chief, Junior Class Representative, Senior Class Secretary, Top 5% of my class all four years and Prom Committee. I also took college classes, tutored, and joined the Latinx Student Union. These positions required a significant amount of dedication, hard work, and year-round commitment. Although I cannot predict the future, I aspire to continue to challenge myself and strive for excellence in all that I do.
Why I Chose Oregon Tech and My Major
In fourth grade, I had an X-ray for back issues that sparked my interest in pursuing Radiology. After researching and consulting with educators, Oregon Tech emerged as the ideal college choice, notably due to its externship program that offers a practical experience to supplement theoretical learning.
My Influential Professors
In the fall term, I enrolled in MIT103 under the tutelage of Professor Carrie Giacomelli. Professor Giacomelli was a knowledgeable and professional instructor who invited guest speakers to provide real-world insights into our future careers. Likewise, I hold Professor Tricia Elliott in high regard for her unwavering commitment to her students' educational development. Professor Elliott's engaging teaching style made the difficult subject of Anatomy and Physiology more accessible, using animal analogies to enhance comprehension.

Relocating to a new location inevitably entails learning about oneself and others. In particular, effective time management became a critical skill that I had to develop. Despite having accrued college credits while still in high school, adapting to college coursework necessitated a challenging but ultimately rewarding adjustment process.
My Plans After Graduation
After college, I aim to join a program that lets me travel across the United States to provide medical aid to patients.

We hear it from the time we're little
“Find your purpose.”
It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?
This is “purpose anxiety” — the gnawing sense that one’s life should have an overarching purpose, but it’s unclear how to discover it.
“There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.
The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?
Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help “close that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,” he said.
People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.
There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.
But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.
The term “purpose anxiety” appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.”
People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose.
“Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.”
“But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.”
Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center).
Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don’t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.
As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit.""
You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life.
It entails “understanding who you are and what you have to work with, understanding what you care about, what you’d like to see be better, either in yourself or in the world” and then figuring out if you can make an impact, he added.
“In our culture, we are so outcome-focused and process-adverse,” he said. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.”
For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second.
“Big ‘P’ Purpose is goal-oriented — it’s usually big and audacious, and often unattainable,” he said. Social media, he said, “is full of people trying to voice that version of purpose on you so that they can make money.”
Better, he said, to focus on little “p” purpose and pursuits that some might simply call hobbies — gardening, singing, collecting baseball cards. Or it can be found in a job, or volunteering.
“What could I do that would light me up and fill me up and be a good use of my time?” Grumet said.
It’s not just for self-improvement, he said. When people do something they love, they attract people to them, which can help create communities.
Not all agree that hobbies and passions are the same as purpose. Reading books, Kashdan said, isn’t a purpose in itself but can be a tool to discovering it. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.”
Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children
“I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.
But she ended up creating an online community for childless women called Gateway Women.com. In rural Ireland, where she lives, she is also helping build an in-person group that brings people without children together as they age.
“I feel that to be alive in this time, and to have a platform and to be awake is an incredible privilege, and that is my purpose,” she said.

More than 470 fires across the country are currently classified as “out of control”, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).
7,318,421 hectares of land in Canada have burned due to wildfires this year – close to 78% more than the five-year average of 4,114,516 hectares, according to the CIFFC’s latest data.
The 2025 fire season is only behind the explosive 2023 wildfire season, which resulted in an astounding 17,203,625 hectares burned.
“This is our new reality… the warmer it gets, the more fires we see,” said Mike Flannigan, the BC research chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops.
A June analysis on the 2025 fire season in Canada published by United Nations University in Shibuya, Japan, concluded that the fires are a “stark manifestation” of climate change and that warm, dry weather in the spring resulted in temperatures 2.5C above average.
The warmer temperatures extend the fire season and increase the frequency of lightning that sparks fires, said Flannigan. A hotter climate also causes the atmosphere to suck moisture out of fuel, dead vegetation and the forest floor – creating ideal conditions for fires to start, he explained.
“It means more of the material is dried out, is available to burn when the fire does come, it leads to bigger flames, higher intensity, which gets to be difficult to impossible to extinguish,” he said.
So far, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which together account for about 60% of the hectares burned so far this year in Canada.
Tens of thousands of people in communities across the country have been evacuated due to the wildfires. In Saskatchewan, the Canadian Red Cross reported it had assisted more than 17,000 people in the province from over 6,700 households to evacuate.
Thirteen communities in north-west Saskatchewan are under an evacuation order, several of which are First Nations, according to the province. One of the most affected areas of this year’s wildfire season in the province is Denare Beach, a north-eastern village that was mostly destroyed in June due to a blaze.
The season has also now hit the east coast of Canada, as wildfires are currently raging across Newfoundland and Labrador and several towns are under evacuation orders.
John Abatzoglou, a professor of complex systems management at the University of California, Merced, co-authored the June report from United Nations University.
Abatzoglou said this year’s fire season is the third year in a row Canada has seen fire activity that is well above average. The fires are also causing widespread smoke to cascade from the country into the United States as well, prompting severe air quality warnings in several states this month, is also an indication of how the fires are hurting populations beyond evacuations.
It’s an international element of the fires that officials are having to contend with on a wider scale, Abatzoglou said.
“This is a really key point that’s different from other natural hazards and its ability to impact everything from quality of life to … human health and even mortality,” he said.
Governments and public health officials will have to address how to change public behaviour and public policy to contend with “smoke days”, where you have to stay inside, he said.

The man, who remained anonymous in the case study, told doctors he had eliminated sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt, from his diet after reading about its negative health effects. He said he could only find sources telling him how to reduce salt, but not eliminate it completely.
Inspired by his nutrition studies in college, the man decided to completely eliminate sodium chloride from his diet as a personal experiment, with consultation from Chat GPT, researchers wrote. He maintained multiple dietary restrictions and even distilled his own water at home.
“For 3 months, he had replaced sodium chloride with sodium bromide obtained from the internet after consultation with ChatGPT, in which he had read that chloride can be swapped with bromide, though likely for other purposes, such as cleaning,” the case study read.
While excess sodium can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of health issues, it is still necessary to consume a healthy amount of it.
The man, who had no psychiatric history, eventually ended up at the hospital, worried that his neighbor was poisoning him. He told doctors he was very thirsty, but paranoid about the water he was offered.
“In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability,” the study read.
Doctors concluded that the man was suffering from bromism, or bromide toxicity, a condition that is rare today but was more common in the early 20th century. The research noted that bromide was found in several over-the-counter medicines back then and contributed to up to 8% of bromism-related psychiatric admissions at that time.
The hospital treated the man for psychosis and discharged him weeks later. His case highlights the potential pitfalls of using AI to seek medical tips.

""At first I was shocked, then it turned into panic,"" said the 20-year-old, describing the ordeal as a ""wound that will leave a scar"".
C was one of three women who exposed an AI porn scandal at Hong Kong's oldest university last month, sparking huge debate around what had largely been seen as an overseas phenomenon.
The victims, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, and experts said the city was ill-prepared to counter the fast-growing threat.
In the University of Hong Kong (HKU) case, hundreds of images of at least 20 women were discovered on the student's laptop.
""B"", another of those who spoke out, said she felt betrayed as she had considered the perpetrator a friend.
""I felt like my privacy was violated... like I couldn't trust the people around me,"" she said.
The university's initial response was to give the student a warning letter and make him apologise.
The third woman, ""A"", said she was told by staff the case couldn't be heard before a disciplinary committee.
""They were concerned but didn't know what they could do... We felt that was a bit ridiculous.""
HKU told AFP it ""has been in contact with the students involved"" but cannot comment further with the case under active review.
- Damage may 'never end' -
While the HKU case has thrust AI-made porn into the spotlight, it is not the city's first.
Janice, a woman in her late 20s who also asked to use a pseudonym, told AFP she was devastated a few years ago when fake obscene images were sent to her friends.
She never found the culprit and worried that the damage might ""never end"".
""I tried skipping work and didn't dare to go out on the street,"" she said, adding that she had suicidal thoughts and would suddenly burst into tears.
""I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would wake up to see the whole internet filled with (pornographic) images of me.""
Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women received 11 similar requests for help in 2024-25.
""We have observed an uptick... Some cases may be hidden if (victims) don't know how to seek help,"" executive director Doris Chong said.
Janice doubted she had enough evidence to persuade police to help, adding that she felt society will ""never find a way"" to punish canny offenders.
- Type of 'sexual violence' -
An estimated 90 percent of AI-made porn victims are women, Susanne Choi from the Chinese University of Hong Kong told AFP, ""suggesting that it is a form of gender-based sexual violence"".
Asked for the number of recent cases involving deepfake pornography, police said they did not maintain such figures.
Lawmakers and universities need to ""expand and revise existing laws and procedures to better cope with... technology-facilitated sexual harassment"", Choi argued.
Discussions in Britain and Singapore show a growing willingness to penalise its creation, though opinion is split on possession, according to Hong Kong barrister Stephen Keung.
Hong Kong currently criminalises the distribution of ""intimate images"", including AI-made ones, but not their creation or possession.
That made legal action in the HKU case difficult as there was no evidence that the pictures were circulated.
After the women went public with the scandal, however, Hong Kong's privacy watchdog launched a criminal investigation, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is handling a related complaint.
- Dignity 'undermined' -
The three students said they have had to deal with public backlash.
Once an avid social media user, C temporarily stopped posting, worried about who else ""would screengrab my photos for what purpose"".
""Many commenters said... 'You are ruining the guy's future, you should apologise to him',"" she said, saying she endured periods of self-doubt.
The student has not been named and AFP was unable to reach him for comment.
B said the trio did not want to ""play judge"" but believed offenders should face long-term consequences.
""The mere creation (of AI porn) is a problem... My bodily autonomy, my privacy, my dignity were undermined by it,"" B said.
""If a line must be drawn, it should be drawn at creation.""

""I tried skipping work and didn't dare to go out on the street,"" she said, adding that she had suicidal thoughts and would suddenly burst into tears.
""I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would wake up to see the whole internet filled with (pornographic) images of me.""
Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women received 11 similar requests for help in 2024-25.
""We have observed an uptick... Some cases may be hidden if (victims) don't know how to seek help,"" executive director Doris Chong said.
Janice doubted she had enough evidence to persuade police to help, adding that she felt society will ""never find a way"" to punish canny offenders.
- Type of 'sexual violence' -
An estimated 90 percent of AI-made porn victims are women, Susanne Choi from the Chinese University of Hong Kong told AFP, ""suggesting that it is a form of gender-based sexual violence"".
Asked for the number of recent cases involving deepfake pornography, police said they did not maintain such figures.
Lawmakers and universities need to ""expand and revise existing laws and procedures to better cope with... technology-facilitated sexual harassment"", Choi argued.
Discussions in Britain and Singapore show a growing willingness to penalise its creation, though opinion is split on possession, according to Hong Kong barrister Stephen Keung.
Hong Kong currently criminalises the distribution of ""intimate images"", including AI-made ones, but not their creation or possession.
That made legal action in the HKU case difficult as there was no evidence that the pictures were circulated.
After the women went public with the scandal, however, Hong Kong's privacy watchdog launched a criminal investigation, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is handling a related complaint.
- Dignity 'undermined' -
The three students said they have had to deal with public backlash.
Once an avid social media user, C temporarily stopped posting, worried about who else ""would screengrab my photos for what purpose"".
""Many commenters said... 'You are ruining the guy's future, you should apologise to him',"" she said, saying she endured periods of self-doubt.
The student has not been named and AFP was unable to reach him for comment.
B said the trio did not want to ""play judge"" but believed offenders should face long-term consequences.
""The mere creation (of AI porn) is a problem... My bodily autonomy, my privacy, my dignity were undermined by it,"" B said.
""If a line must be drawn, it should be drawn at creation.""

As a former school leader and as a parent to teenagers, I know the range of emotions that come with exams and the reassurances we try to offer our children, or the students in our lives, as they navigate their journey into higher education.
While more than three quarters of students are accepted at their first choice (their Ucas “firm” choice) every year, we are also seeing increasing activity in clearing — from those whose Plan A hasn’t worked out, those who would like to revisit their choices, as well as those who have just decided to apply for the first time. If you are supporting someone waiting for their results this summer, or who wants to enter higher education, and you are not quite sure what clearing is about, Ucas has a wealth of information and practical tips to guide you.
What exactly is clearing?
Clearing is the final stage of the Ucas admissions process. It allows students who have received their results to find university or college places that are yet to be filled. It’s available to anyone who may not have received the grades they need for their firm or insurance choice — but also to those who do have a place and are considering another option, or those who only decide to apply after the last main scheme Ucas deadline in June. Last year 38,935 UK 18-year-olds secured a place at university or college through clearing.
Clearing opened on July 5 and runs until October 20, although the busiest activity happens in mid-August just after the results for A-level, Btec and other qualifications are released. There are plenty of options in clearing once again this year, with about 28,000 courses available across the country.
At Ucas we always advise students to do their research, so they can be prepared for whatever happens. Our advice this year includes encouraging applicants to build a results day action plan by reflecting on their research and reconnecting with their choices. Students might want to look back at their original five choices on the Ucas application and revisit them as a potential option, as we know many students return to one of the original universities or colleges they applied to earlier in the cycle. In other words, don’t start making a whole new playlist when you already have good reasons to choose your favourite songs.
Who else is clearing for?
If a student hasn’t applied to university or college yet but is starting to wish that they had, it’s not too late. They may have just realised that they do want to start a degree this autumn, or they may be a few years into their careers but are looking to get back into education. Whatever the reason, they can still apply to university or college through Ucas by applying directly into clearing. This is an increasingly popular route, with more students choosing to apply direct to clearing every year, in addition to the traditional clearing users who find themselves there having just missed out on the grades needed for their firm or insurance choices.
Last year 67 per cent of those who found a place at university or college in clearing told Ucas that they started their research before August, which shows the importance of getting prepared before results day. For any students who are potentially rethinking their firm choice, I would always suggest getting in touch with that university in the first instance to discuss options. The university might be able to offer a place on a different course if they have changed their mind about what subject they want to study and can share more information about available support.
It’s clear that clearing has evolved, with growing numbers of students now using it as a planned route to find the right course or university for them.
How does it work?
The best way for students to use clearing is to start by creating an account on the Ucas website. They can then search for available courses and, once they have found one they are interested in, contact the university or college directly (making sure they have their clearing number and personal ID on hand) to check they meet the entry requirements. If they are offered a place that they want to accept, they can add the clearing choice in their application via their Ucas account.
Applicants will be able to add a clearing choice from 1pm on Level 3 Results Day, which this year is Thursday, August 14 — or for students in Scotland, from 10am on SQA Results Day on Tuesday, August 5.
Is extra support available?
Ucas has a range of digital tools to support applicants during this time, with our Clearing Plus tool offering personalised matches to available courses based on the information students have submitted in their application. Students can get a taster of different subjects or different careers with virtual work experience on ucas.com. We also have a team of experts on hand who can be reached on the phone, on our social media channels and via our website.
This year we have worked with Clementine Wade, the university and school coach, to create resources specifically for parents, carers and guardians to help you understand what you can do to best support your child through the process.
Results day is a cause for huge celebration, for students, their parents and carers, their teachers, and everyone else who has supported them through their education so far. At Ucas we are committed to ensuring as many people as possible can benefit from the life-changing opportunity of higher education. Together this summer we can help students to make informed choices so they can progress with excitement and confidence.",GDeltProject,[],"['Ucas', 'UK', 'n’t', 'Ucas', 'Ucas', 'Scotland', 'SQA Results Day', 'Clearing Plus', 'Clementine Wade']","A-level results day 2025: full guide to Ucas clearing.

NIH has recently announced a new policy that will continue to support originality, creativity, and fairness in the research application process. NIH has noticed that some Principal Investigators (PIs) have been submitting a large number of research applications that far exceed the numbers we traditionally expect and may have been prepared using artificial intelligence (AI) tools.
While AI may be a helpful tool in preparing applications, the rapid submission of large numbers of research applications from a single PI may undermine the fairness and originality of the research application process and unfairly strain NIH’s application review processes.
As use of AI tools becomes more commonplace, it is important to remember that applicants may use AI in limited aspects to reduce administrative burden while preparing applications. However, applicants should be mindful of the concerns around research misconduct or lack of originality when using such tools. Remember, NIH peer reviewers are prohibited from using AI for their critiques.
To address these issues, the new policy is effective for the September 25, 2025, receipt date and beyond:
Applications that are either substantially developed by AI or containing sections substantially developed by AI are not considered the original ideas of applicants and will not be considered by NIH.
-
NIH will also only accept up to six new, renewal, resubmission, or revision applications from an individual PD/PI (Program Director/Principal Investigator) or Multiple Principal Investigator for all council rounds in a calendar year.

Last month was muggier than usual for the majority of the Lower 48. Parts of the Midwest, East Coast and mid-Atlantic regions, in particular, were intensely humid in July, according to preliminary data compiled by researchers at Oregon State University.
Hot and humid conditions are to be expected in the summer, but heat index values — what conditions “feel like” when humidity and air temperatures are combined — soared well into the triple digits for extended periods of time in places such as Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Florida last month.
Cities such as Pittsburgh; Roanoke, Virginia; and Washington, D.C., all registered their most humid July in recorded history, according to figures compiled by the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, which collects and tracks data on precipitation, soil temperature and other environmental conditions. New York City and Raleigh, North Carolina, had their second-most-humid July, while humidity in Detroit and Cincinnati reached their third-highest levels last month.
In Paducah, Kentucky, a brutal stretch of high heat and humidity from July 16 to 30 set a slew of new records for the city.
“We have reached the end to the longest stretch of continuously high humidity that Paducah has witnessed in the past 75 years,” the local branch of the National Weather Service said Thursday in a post on X, adding that the number of hours at “oppressive levels” of humidity exceeded 300% of the city’s normal amount for the month of July.
Humid days are expected to be more common as a result of climate change, because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. But beyond the discomfort of a sticky summer, soaring humidity levels pose serious threats to health and public safety.
High heat index values increase the risk of heat-related illness and death, particularly among children, older adults and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. A 2022 study by the nonprofit organization Climate Central found that the combination of high heat and humidity can affect the body’s ability to cool itself down through sweating.
“In many parts of the country and the globe, dangerous heat often occurs along with high humidity — and the pair of conditions multiplies the health risks,” the researchers wrote in their analysis.

The 2017 “megaflash” stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City — a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.
“Over time, as the data record continues to expand, we will be able to observe even the rarest types of extreme lightning on Earth and investigate the broad impacts of lightning on society,” study lead author Michael Peterson, an atmospheric scientist in the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said in a statement.

An enormous, 515-mile-long flash of lightning that crossed at least three states has been named the longest in recorded history in the world.
The 2017 “megaflash” stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City — a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.

Losses of land-based water could have profound implications for access to safe drinking water","Overpumping groundwater, worsening droughts and more rapid evaporation due to higher temperatures have caused a drastic decline in the amount of available freshwater, according to a new study.
“Continental drying” has redirected the planet’s total water to the oceans to such degree that it has now surpassed melting ice sheets as the biggest contributor to global sea level rise, the research found.
Losses of land-based water could have profound implications for access to safe drinking water and the ability to grow food in some of the world’s richest agricultural regions.
“We use a lot of water to grow food,” said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at Arizona State University’s School of Sustainability and one of the authors of the study. “If things don’t change, we’ll see impacts on our food security and just our general water availability.”
The findings “should be of paramount concern to the general public, to resource managers, and to decision-makers around the world,” the researchers wrote in the study, adding that the identified trends “send perhaps the direst message on the impact of climate change to date.”
“The continents are drying, freshwater availability is shrinking, and sea level rise is accelerating,” they wrote.
The study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, assessed changes in terrestrial water sources, such as lakes, underground aquifers and moisture in soil, over the past two decades. The researchers found that several factors, including climate change, are disrupting Earth’s natural water cycle, upsetting how moisture circulates between the ground, oceans and atmosphere.
The researchers used data from a suite of four NASA satellites to analyze changes in terrestrial water storage over the past 22 years. The satellites were designed to track the movement of Earth’s water, including changes to the planet’s ice sheets, glaciers and underground reservoirs.
The researchers found, for instance, that parts of the world that are already dry have been rapidly getting drier since 2014. These drought-ridden regions increased by an area twice the size of California each year, Famiglietti said.
In several cases, drought-ridden hotspots expanded to create giant, interconnected “mega-drying” regions, according to the study. One such area covers parts of Central America, Mexico, California, the southwestern United States, the lower Colorado River basin and the southern High Plains.
“The key message here is that water is really a key driver of the changes we see both on land and in the ocean,” said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Earth Sciences Section at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who served on the science team for the NASA missions that produced the decades of data used in the new study.
The study found that every large land mass, except for Greenland and Antarctica, has experienced unprecedented drying since 2002.
Widespread continental drying is expected to have major consequences for people. Three quarters of the world’s population lives in countries where freshwater resources are being depleted, according to the researchers.
Meanwhile, rising seas threaten to creep up on coastal regions around the globe, making them less habitable and adding to the mounting pressures caused by extreme storms and floods. In the U.S., severe weather has helped trigger an insurance crisis in coastal cities that are prone to extreme weather events.
The link between sea-level rise and the loss of water locked up in the ground is a consequence of throwing the planet’s water cycle into chaos. Many of these changes, such as overpumping groundwater, are thought to be permanent — or, at the very least, irreversible for thousands or tens of thousands of years, said Alexander Simms, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved with the study.
“If you pull water off the continents, the only place it has to go is in the ocean,” he said. “Water goes in the atmosphere, then 88% of that water rains down on Earth and ends up in the ocean.”
Simms said the study was fascinating in its ability to estimate the global scale of these water losses, but he was skeptical of the claim that water loss from the continents has now surpassed ice sheet melt as the biggest contributor to sea level rise.
Still, Hamlington said the study shows how the movement of water around the planet has enormous ripple effects. It also suggests that the consequences could intensify in the future, if groundwater is further depleted, freshwater resources shrink and drought conditions worsen.

“The key message here is that water is really a key driver of the changes we see both on land and in the ocean,” said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Earth Sciences Section at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who served on the science team for the NASA missions that produced the decades of data used in the new study.
The study found that every large land mass, except for Greenland and Antarctica, has experienced unprecedented drying since 2002.
Widespread continental drying is expected to have major consequences for people. Three quarters of the world’s population lives in countries where freshwater resources are being depleted, according to the researchers.
Meanwhile, rising seas threaten to creep up on coastal regions around the globe, making them less habitable and adding to the mounting pressures caused by extreme storms and floods. In the U.S., severe weather has helped trigger an insurance crisis in coastal cities that are prone to extreme weather events.
The link between sea-level rise and the loss of water locked up in the ground is a consequence of throwing the planet’s water cycle into chaos. Many of these changes, such as overpumping groundwater, are thought to be permanent — or, at the very least, irreversible for thousands or tens of thousands of years, said Alexander Simms, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved with the study.
“If you pull water off the continents, the only place it has to go is in the ocean,” he said. “Water goes in the atmosphere, then 88% of that water rains down on Earth and ends up in the ocean.”
Simms said the study was fascinating in its ability to estimate the global scale of these water losses, but he was skeptical of the claim that water loss from the continents has now surpassed ice sheet melt as the biggest contributor to sea level rise.
Still, Hamlington said the study shows how the movement of water around the planet has enormous ripple effects. It also suggests that the consequences could intensify in the future, if groundwater is further depleted, freshwater resources shrink and drought conditions worsen.
“This kind of tracking of terrestrial water storage is a critical piece of the puzzle,” he said. “If we can track that water, if we know where it’s going, we can improve our understanding of future drought, flooding and water resource availability over land.”",-1.0,0.0,Climate Infrastructure Risks,1.611,,0.0,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 23:19:34 GMT",20.0,,-1664.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,5.0,1.611,Climate Infrastructure Risks,,2025-08-16 00:29:07.503909+00:00,1,2025-08-16 00:29:07.503885+00:00,,,448.0,,Climate Infrastructure Risks,climate infrastructure risks,Climate Infrastructure Risks,1.0

New college graduates are facing one of the most challenging markets for entry-level jobs in a decade.

John Yang:
New college graduates are facing one of the most challenging markets for entry level jobs in a decade. In June, the most recent data available, the unemployment rate for recent grads was nearly 5 percent. That's higher than the overall unemployment rate. We asked recent graduates to tell us about their job searches.
Jack O’Connor:
My hope after graduating college was to go straight into a full time job in reporting.
Anjoleigh Schindler:
My initial plans were to find a local job in a magazine. I just wanted to find a job where I could write.
Michael Lavin:
I had aspirations of working for the GSA, General Services Administration. I was going into a third round interview with them around November, December, and that is when the federal hiring freeze took over.
I would often be what I would consider ghosted by employers. Wouldn't get any feedback at all, not even a rejection, just nothing.
I must have started applying for jobs in April, and I know I've sent 85 job applications since. It's been really difficult.
When I wasn't getting any feedback from my applications, was really dejected. So it made me feel like I was unqualified for any job in journalism, like maybe I wasn't good enough.
The experience has definitely been discouraging. But I don't know. I like to take the mindset of I just got to keep plugging away, keep sending in applications, keep trying to revamp my resume.
I think I'm a little too stubborn to switch career paths right now. So I, you know, I'm going to keep at it, keep applying, and we'll just hope for the best, I suppose.
Christine Cruzvergara is the Chief Education Officer at Handshake, which is an online platform that connects young job seekers and employers. Christine, we just heard from three young people. You heard disappointment, you heard a little frustration. How typical is that from what you hear?
Christine Cruzvergara, Chief Education Officer, Handshake:
It's very common right now. The job market is tough, it's competitive. We've seen in our data that jobs are down 15 percent from last year, but applications are up 30 percent.
What makes it so tough?
Christine Cruzvergara:
Well, there are a number of different factors that make it difficult right now. One would obviously be the overall economy, the second would be the government, and the third would be what's happening with AI, disrupting what entry level jobs look like right now.
Talk a little bit about the AI part of that. We've heard some people say that AI is taking over the many of the tasks that entry level workers would normally do.
So employers are going to have new expectations around how you use AI, how it's integrated into your role, the amount of productivity you have. I think that altogether is going to mean that the skill set for an entry level worker will change and evolve and it will look different.
So for someone trying to graduate and find work, right now, they're in the middle of a very messy process where employers are trying to figure out what they want and what that looks like.
We heard one of the young men talking about he wanted to become a reporter, thinking about shifting fields, but wanted to avoid that. He said he was stubborn enough that he didn't want to do it. What are some of the sorts of tough choices or hard decisions that young people are having to face now as they look for their first jobs?
We see in our data that over 40 percent are willing to actually explore other industries that perhaps do have more hiring right now. For example, health care is still rising in terms of number of opportunities, and there aren't enough people who want to go into health care.
So some folks that have tech skills, for example, instead of working in a traditional tech industry, are thinking about, how might I do health tech, how can I pivot in that way? So that's one type of difficult decision.
The second would be location. Where do I want to live? This generation, this class knows that it's extremely expensive to live in certain cities. So the cost of living is factoring into their choices about where they choose to apply, what locations they want to live in.
I think a third piece is really considering what types of skills are they able to build and are they able to build it fast enough for what employers are looking for? And employers are still figuring that out, so it could change from one year to another.
You mentioned health care is a place where there are a lot of opportunities. Are there fields where that are sort of oversubscribed? There are more people chasing after fewer jobs.
Well, I think what we've seen just in the past year or two is that big tech, for example, has certainly slowed down in their hiring. The class of 2025 in particular, has been watching headlines for the better part of two years since seeing major layoffs happen. It is also the industry that is adopting Gen AI the fastest.
And so they are the ones kind of on the forefront of experimenting with what that looks like. How much headcount do you really need? How much could be paired with technology? What will the future of engineering teams look like? So that is certainly an industry where we have seen some slowdown.
What's your advice for the members of the class of 25 who are still out there looking for their first jobs?
Well, I think first you have to find a support group, a support network that's going to keep you positive through the process. It is tough, it is competitive, it is easy to feel rejected and dejected as you go through this process. That can be your family, that can be your friends, it could be your coaches, it could be your peers. Doesn't matter who, you just need to find someone.
I think the second piece is think about how you can upskill, so you have your degree. Fantastic. Are there other skills that you need to pair with that right now and take the advantage of all the online resources and all the free resources that are available to you and find ways to upskill yourself in the downtime while you are looking for a job?
And then lastly, remember that your first job is not your forever job. So keep in mind that whatever that first job is, it's going to teach you some skills. It's going to give you a chance to step up into the next thing. But it doesn't have to be perfect. And sometimes just releasing some of those expectations can help you find that next job a little faster.
Good advice. From Christine Cruzvergara of Handshake, thank you very much.
Thank you so much for having me.

Well, I think what we've seen just in the past year or two is that big tech, for example, has certainly slowed down in their hiring. The class of 2025 in particular, has been watching headlines for the better part of two years since seeing major layoffs happen. It is also the industry that is adopting Gen AI the fastest.
And so they are the ones kind of on the forefront of experimenting with what that looks like. How much headcount do you really need? How much could be paired with technology? What will the future of engineering teams look like? So that is certainly an industry where we have seen some slowdown.
What's your advice for the members of the class of 25 who are still out there looking for their first jobs?
Well, I think first you have to find a support group, a support network that's going to keep you positive through the process. It is tough, it is competitive, it is easy to feel rejected and dejected as you go through this process. That can be your family, that can be your friends, it could be your coaches, it could be your peers. Doesn't matter who, you just need to find someone.
I think the second piece is think about how you can upskill, so you have your degree. Fantastic. Are there other skills that you need to pair with that right now and take the advantage of all the online resources and all the free resources that are available to you and find ways to upskill yourself in the downtime while you are looking for a job?
And then lastly, remember that your first job is not your forever job. So keep in mind that whatever that first job is, it's going to teach you some skills. It's going to give you a chance to step up into the next thing. But it doesn't have to be perfect. And sometimes just releasing some of those expectations can help you find that next job a little faster.
Good advice. From Christine Cruzvergara of Handshake, thank you very much.
Thank you so much for having me.

John Yang:
In Geneva, negotiators from 175 nations are trying to hammer out the first ever legally binding treaty on plastic pollution. The key sticking point is whether it should mandate cuts in plastic production. Oil producing nations including the United States oppose that as fossil fuels are a key ingredient in plastics.
The urgency of the talks was underscored this week by a new study published in the medical journal The Lancet. It calls plastics a grave growing and under recognized danger to human and planetary health. Tracey Woodruff is a professor at the UC San Francisco Medical School and one of the authors of the Lancet study. Tracey, A grave, growing and under recognized danger. What is that danger? Explain the danger to us.
Tracey Woodruff, UC San Francisco School of Medicine: Plastic contains thousands of toxic chemicals. Some of them we know something about and some of them we don't know anything about. But the ones that we do know about, we know that they can lead to increased risk of multiple different types of chronic health effects.
For example, one chemical that's used commonly in plastics to which we are all exposed are phthalates. These are chemicals that are used in everything from vinyl flooring, curtains, plastic couches, even in your car, cosmetics, fragrances. These chemicals are ubiquitous. They're measured in everybody.
And we know they increase the risk of multiple adverse health conditions like obesity and diabetes and they can increase the risk of preterm birth. There's also an increased production of plastics. Currently planned plastic production will triple in the next 30 years. That means more plastic products and more plastic chemicals to which we will be exposed.
Talk about the production picking up the pace. Why is it accelerating?
Tracey Woodruff:
Plastics are made from fossil fuels, oil and gas. And the fossil fuel industry is turning to plastics to stay profitable making plastic and the petrochemicals used in plastic is more profitable than using it for fuel and energy and electricity.
So as the world uses less oil in some cases to address climate change concerns, the fossil fuel industry is shifting its focus to producing more plastic and plastic related chemicals to maintain and increase their profits.
You know, we see recycling bins everywhere now on the street and offices. What impact or what effect does recycling have?
Well, recycling is pretty much a myth that's been sold to us by the fossil fuel industry. And in fact, a report just came out this week talking about how those that the fossil fuel industry knew that you can't actually really recycle plastic. The fact is that less than 10 percent of plastic is recycled and only 1 percent is recycled twice.
And what that means is that a lot of this plastic we're being told, is being recycled to make us feel better, but it's really going into the waste stream. It's degrading in the environment, it's degrading into all of these, varied in the oceans, in fish, and then it's getting into us. So the reality is recycling is not the solution.
There's been a lot of talk about microplastics being so pervasive. Help us understand what that is and do we know what the effects are of having microplastics in our bodies?
Yeah, microplastics, they're essentially little plastics and they're very small, usually smaller than the human eye can see. And they're basic. They come from the degradation of all these many plastics that are being produced by these fossil fuel companies.
And we know that people carry little bits of microplastics in their body because they've been measured in every part of the body that they've been looked at. So everything from breast milk to blood to feces, even in your brain.
These talks in Geneva, they had hoped to conclude this by the end of 2024. Obviously they haven't. What's at stake in these talks?
Well, the health of everybody on this planet is at stake in these talks. The goal of the pla — of the countries that want to see something done about plastic pollution is to identify the hazardous chemicals in the plastics and reduce or eliminate them. The goal of the fossil fuel producing countries is to basically increase plastic production. And they are deviating the plastic negotiation treaties by focusing on recycling, which I have said is not really the solution to plastic production.
And so because these countries or the projected estimates are to triple by 26 plastic production, it really is an important inflection point in how we as well really as part of the global community, decide how we want to address plastics and the plastic related chemicals which we already know are already resulting in adverse human health effects around the globe.

The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.
UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.
President Donald Trump’s administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as with Harvard University.

The White House official did not detail any additional demands the administration has made to UCLA or elaborate on the settlement amount. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Trump administration suspended $584 million in federal grants for UCLA, the university said this week. The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.”
The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. Jewish students said demonstrators in the encampment blocked them from getting to class. One night, counterprotesters attacked the encampment, throwing traffic cones and firing pepper spray, with fighting that continued for hours, injuring more than a dozen people, before police stepped in. The next day, after hundreds defied orders to leave, more than 200 people were arrested.
The University of California’s president, James B. Milliken, said in a statement Friday that the university was reviewing a document it “just received” from the Department of Justice.
“Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” Milliken said. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”
This would not be the university’s first settlement over the 2024 protests. Last month, UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued, arguing that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.
The settlement comes nearly a year after a preliminary injunction was issued, marking the first time a U.S. judge had ruled against a university over their handling of on-campus demonstrations against Israel’s war in Gaza.
UCLA initially had argued that it had no legal responsibility over the issue because protesters, not the university, blocked Jewish students’ access to areas. The university also worked with law enforcement to thwart attempts to set up new protest camps.
But U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi disagreed and ordered UCLA to create a plan to protect Jewish students on campus. The University of California, one of the nation’s largest public university systems, has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests and has said it is committed to campus safety and inclusivity and will continue to implement recommendations.

As part of the settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university’s Jewish community. It also has created an Office of Campus and Community Safety, instituting new policies to manage protests on campus.
UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.
The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.
Last month Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government’s allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restores more than $400 million in research grants.
The Trump administration plans to use its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation.

The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.
UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.
President Donald Trump’s administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as with Harvard University.

A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.
Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.
The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.
A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump’s first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities’ investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.
The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.
The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.
“The tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,” said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.”
The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.
Some universities are on the edge of the law’s parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.
Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.
Despite the colleges’ wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.
“They’re looking for savings wherever possible,” Levine said, which could impact financial aid. “One of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.”
For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.
In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.
Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.
Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.
No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country’s wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it’s also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.
The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard’s research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard’s efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.
“It’s not like Harvard is going to go from one of the best institutions in the world to just a mediocre institution. That’s probably not going to happen,” Levine said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a bad thing — that there won’t be pain and that students won’t suffer.”

For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.
In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.
Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.
Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.
No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country’s wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it’s also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.
The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard’s research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard’s efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.
“It’s not like Harvard is going to go from one of the best institutions in the world to just a mediocre institution. That’s probably not going to happen,” Levine said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a bad thing — that there won’t be pain and that students won’t suffer.”

A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.
Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.
The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.
A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump’s first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities’ investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.
The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.
The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.
“The tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,” said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.”
The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.
Some universities are on the edge of the law’s parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.
Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.
Despite the colleges’ wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.
“They’re looking for savings wherever possible,” Levine said, which could impact financial aid. “One of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.”
For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio’s research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard’s fight with the Trump administration.

“It’s like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, ‘Poof. You’re being cut off.’”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world’s most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard’s lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country’s top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country’s oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.

The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,” the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.

The funding cuts have left Harvard’s research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find nongovernment funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year’s delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,” Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. “It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.”
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
WATCH: The possible long-term impact of Trump’s cuts to medical research funding
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were canceled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university’s fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,” she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country’s reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio’s research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard’s fight with the Trump administration.

“It’s like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, ‘Poof. You’re being cut off.’”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world’s most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard’s lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country’s top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country’s oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.

The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,” the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.

The funding cuts have left Harvard’s research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find nongovernment funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year’s delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,” Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. “It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.”
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
WATCH: The possible long-term impact of Trump’s cuts to medical research funding
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were canceled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university’s fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,” she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country’s reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio’s research is literally frozen.
Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard’s fight with the Trump administration.

“It’s like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don’t have money to launch it,” said Ascherio. “We built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, ‘Poof. You’re being cut off.’”
The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world’s most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.
And despite Harvard’s lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.
The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country’s top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country’s oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.

The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.
Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
“Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,” the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.

The funding cuts have left Harvard’s research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find nongovernment funding to replace lost money.
In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead.
Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers’ salaries until next June. But he’s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year’s delay can put his research back five years, he said.
“It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.
At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.
“Just thinking about all the knowledge that’s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,” Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. “It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.”
John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.
WATCH: The possible long-term impact of Trump’s cuts to medical research funding
In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were canceled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.
“I’m in a position where I have to really think about, ‘Can I revive this research?’” he said. “Can I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?”
The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university’s fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.
Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.”
Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.”
But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense.
“I don’t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,” she said. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.”
Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country’s reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.
“We’re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,” Quackenbush said. “We’re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.”

The Trump administration has launched numerous investigations into colleges and universities and withheld billions of dollars in funding, accusing the schools of not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus. About 60 schools have been notified of possible investigations.
Last week, Columbia University settled with the administration in a major deal that could be a blueprint for other battles — or, rather, battles with other schools.
Ali Rogin looked into one of the key players behind the administration's approach.
Ali Rogin:
This is all part of a broader push that the White House says is meant to get elite schools to better address antisemitism. But how did this effort start?
To help answer that question, we're joined by Arno Rosenfeld, an enterprise reporter for The Forward, where he's also the author of the Antisemitism Decoded newsletter.
Arno, thank you so much for joining us.
First of all, how does this administration define antisemitism and how is it that it's become so central to its targeting of universities?
Arno Rosenfeld, Enterprise Reporter, The Forward:
So the administration's understanding of antisemitism is really rooted in hostility toward Israel, so be that anti-Zionism or these other sort of protests. It sort of lumps that in with what they consider to be support for terrorism, support for Hamas.
But I would say that they go a little bit further than that in kind of limiting their focus to what you might consider left-wing antisemitism.
But not really saying as much about antisemitism on the right?
Arno Rosenfeld:
Correct.
I mean, sometimes, they give a little bit more or less rhetorical attention to that, but in terms of substance, it's not their focus. And there are number of people in the administration with ties to right-wing antisemites or who have expressed antisemitism themselves of sort of the right-wing variety.
You have reported on one of the blueprints of the administration's efforts on this. It's called Project Esther. What is it and who's behind it?
So Project Esther was created by The Heritage Foundation, which also created Project 2025, another blueprint in advance of Trump taking office with the sort of hope that it would be a blueprint for a second Trump administration, when we didn't know who was going to be president.
But it's a plan that lays out a strategy that the White House and other sort of federal agencies can take to combat, again, this kind of left-wing antisemitism. They talk about a Hamas support network that is basically a variety of anti-Zionist groups and some groups that aren't even anti-Zionist, but sort of progressive organizations that are critical of Israel, they lump into this antisemitic network.
And then they have a variety of tools that they want the government to use to crack down on that network.
And as you have noted, there were not many Jewish groups involved in the writing of this Project Esther. Why is that and what does it tell you about this endeavor?
You know, The Heritage Foundation doesn't have a lot of Jewish partnerships. There are conservative Jewish groups, but they aren't really in the Heritage broader universe.
And so they had some groups on their task force that was working on Project Esther that were Jewish, but when the report came out, the core groups were these evangelical conservative organizations and some conservative think tanks. And the Jewish groups that were sort of on the list, the bigger list of Jewish groups on the task force, kind of tried to distance themselves from the project.
And how does this project in particular view and talk about critics of Israel's policies and supporters of Palestinian causes?
Well, it's really this idea that they are supporters of Hamas. So it's not just antisemitism. It's support for terrorism.
And I think the reason — or one of the reasons that they use that framework is that opens a whole new avenue of legal options to deal with them. So if you're a foundation that is providing, for example, material support to a terrorist organization, you can be shut down or sanctioned or face other consequences that you couldn't face even if the government sort of officially declared you were antisemitic.
That's legal, but supporting Hamas is not. And so that's one way that they set this up. And the other is that they take even kind of tenuous connections to campus protests or other demonstrations against Israel and equate all of that with antisemitism.
How exactly has the Trump administration implemented Project Esther so far?
So they haven't really commented on whether they're using Project Esther specifically or whether they're just using the same tactics.
And I'm not sure that it matters that much, but we have seen the defunding of universities to pressure them to address civil rights violations against Jewish students or alleged civil rights violations. That's one area. We have also seen immigration crackdowns, which have overlapped with campuses, but trying to deport and arrest foreign students, who they say are engaging in antisemitism.
These are all sort of tools that we saw suggested within Project Esther. There's a lot more vague stuff that it's a little bit hard to pin down, but those are two of the big examples.
So certainly the American Jewish population is not a monolith, but based on your reporting, what do American Jews think of this approach? Do they feel safer?
So we know in general from public opinion polling that Jews do not support President Trump's approach to antisemitism. He doesn't have majority support on really any of the tactics that he's implemented in the name of protecting American Jews, although in some areas we do see that more Jews support a couple of his strategies on college campuses, say, than support his job performance overall.
So there is a little segment that is open to it, even if they're skeptical of him as a president. But I think there's also a sense that, especially on college campuses, Jews are being used as sort of a pawn. So we saw, right, when Columbia University reached the settlement with the federal government, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, described it as a momentous conservative victory.
And she pointed to things that she said conservatives have been trying to do for many years around DEI and affirmative action and addressing left-wing bias on campus that didn't really have to do with Jews. And so there's a sense that Jews are being used as the excuse to launch this crackdown on colleges and universities, and that Jews are then going to be blamed as a result of that.
So I think there's a lot of anxiety that, rather than keeping Jews safe, some of these things may be inflaming those sort of tensions. On the other hand, some folks are really eager to see this address, to see the campus protests addressed more forcefully.
So it's a mixed opinion, but that's some of what I'm hearing from American Jews.
Arno Rosenfeld with The Forward, thank you so much.
Thanks.

These are all sort of tools that we saw suggested within Project Esther. There's a lot more vague stuff that it's a little bit hard to pin down, but those are two of the big examples.
So certainly the American Jewish population is not a monolith, but based on your reporting, what do American Jews think of this approach? Do they feel safer?
So we know in general from public opinion polling that Jews do not support President Trump's approach to antisemitism. He doesn't have majority support on really any of the tactics that he's implemented in the name of protecting American Jews, although in some areas we do see that more Jews support a couple of his strategies on college campuses, say, than support his job performance overall.
So there is a little segment that is open to it, even if they're skeptical of him as a president. But I think there's also a sense that, especially on college campuses, Jews are being used as sort of a pawn. So we saw, right, when Columbia University reached the settlement with the federal government, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, described it as a momentous conservative victory.
And she pointed to things that she said conservatives have been trying to do for many years around DEI and affirmative action and addressing left-wing bias on campus that didn't really have to do with Jews. And so there's a sense that Jews are being used as the excuse to launch this crackdown on colleges and universities, and that Jews are then going to be blamed as a result of that.
So I think there's a lot of anxiety that, rather than keeping Jews safe, some of these things may be inflaming those sort of tensions. On the other hand, some folks are really eager to see this address, to see the campus protests addressed more forcefully.
So it's a mixed opinion, but that's some of what I'm hearing from American Jews.
Arno Rosenfeld with The Forward, thank you so much.
Thanks.

BOSTON (AP) — Harvard University appeared in federal court Monday in a pivotal case in its battle with the Trump administration, as the storied institution argued the government illegally cut $2.6 billion in federal funding.
President Donald Trump’s administration has battered the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university with sanctions for months as it presses a series of demands on the Ivy League school, which he decries as a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism.

Harvard has resisted, and the lawsuit over the cuts to its research grants represents the primary challenge to the administration in a standoff that is being widely watched across higher education and beyond.
A lawyer for Harvard, Steven Lehotsky, said at Monday’s hearing the case is about the government trying to control the “inner workings” of Harvard. The funding cuts, if not reversed, could lead to the loss of research, damaged careers and the closing of labs, he said.
The case is before U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, who is presiding over lawsuits brought by Harvard against the administration’s efforts to keep it from hosting international students. In that case, she temporarily blocked the administration’s efforts.
At Monday’s hearing Harvard is asking her to reverse a series of funding freezes. Such a ruling, if it stands, would revive Harvard’s sprawling scientific and medical research operation and hundreds of projects that lost federal money.
A lawyer for the government, Michael Velchik, said the government has authority to cancel research grants when an institution is out of compliance with the president’s directives. He said episodes at Harvard violated Trump’s order combating antisemitism.
“Harvard wants billions of dollars and that is the only reason we are here,” Velchik said.
Burroughs pushed back, questioning how the government could make “ad-hoc” decisions to cancel grants and do so across Harvard without offering evidence that any of the research is antisemitic.
She also argued the government had provided “no documentation, no procedure” to “suss out” whether Harvard administrators “have taken enough steps or haven’t” to combat antisemitism.
“The consequences of that in terms of constitutional law are staggering,” she said. “I don’t think you can justify a contract action based on impermissible suppression of speech? Where do I have that wrong.”
Harvard’s lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university after it rejected a series of demands in an April 11 letter from a federal antisemitism task force. A second lawsuit over the cuts filed by the American Association of University Professors and its Harvard faculty chapter has been consolidated with the university’s.
The April letter demanded sweeping changes related to campus protests, academics and admissions. For example, the letter told Harvard to audit the viewpoints of students and faculty and admit more students or hire new professors if the campus was found to lack diverse points of view.
Harvard President Alan Garber has said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism but said no government “should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”
The same day Harvard rejected the demands, Trump officials moved to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants. Education Secretary Linda McMahon declared in May that Harvard would no longer be eligible for new grants, and weeks later the administration began canceling contracts with Harvard.
As Harvard fought the funding freeze in court, individual agencies began sending letters announcing that the frozen research grants were being terminated. They cited a clause that allows grants to be scrapped if they no longer align with government policies.
Harvard, which has the nation’s largest endowment at $53 billion, has moved to self-fund some of its research, but warned it can’t absorb the full cost of the federal cuts.
In court filings, the school said the government “fails to explain how the termination of funding for research to treat cancer, support veterans, and improve national security addresses antisemitism.”
The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the April demand letter was sent. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel contracts for policy reasons.
“It is the policy of the United States under the Trump Administration not to fund institutions that fail to adequately address antisemitism in their programs,” it said in court documents.
The research funding is only one front in Harvard’s fight with the federal government. The Trump administration also has sought to prevent the school from hosting foreign students, and Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.
Finally, last month, the Trump administration formally issued a finding that the school tolerated antisemitism — a step that eventually could jeopardize all of Harvard’s federal funding, including federal student loans or grants. The penalty is typically referred to as a “death sentence.”

The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.
A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.
“It’s an incredibly strange phenomenon,” he said. “We only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.”
Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.
When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.
The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.
“They are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,” he said.
The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
“These new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.
The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.
With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.
The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.
“When the original studies were done, we didn’t have the technology that we have today,” Cerveny said. “Now we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.”
Experts said it’s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.
“Over time, as the data record continues to expand, we will be able to observe even the rarest types of extreme lightning on Earth and investigate the broad impacts of lightning on society,” study lead author Michael Peterson, an atmospheric scientist in the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said in a statement.

Columbia University and the Trump administration have reached a deal that restores federal funding and research grant money to the university. As part of the agreement, Columbia will pay $200 million to the federal government over three years and an additional $21 million to resolve alleged civil rights violations against Jewish employees.
The university agreed to suspend, expel, or revoke degrees from some 70 students who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and it will issue a report to a monitor to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion is not promoted on campus.
Columbia, which was at risk of losing billions of dollars from the government, says it retains its academic freedom.
For a closer look at this agreement and what it means for a higher education in the U.S., I'm joined by Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University.
President Roth, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Thanks for joining us.
Michael Roth, President, Wesleyan University:
Thanks for having me.
So let's just start with your initial reaction. When you heard the news and the details of this settlement, what did you think?
Michael Roth:
Well, I felt like one must feel when you have paid a ransom in a kidnapping situation and the person who's been kidnapped is returned safely.
You think, thank goodness, the kid's OK, or the person kidnapped is OK. But I wouldn't phrase the agreement that led to the liberation of the kidnapped person. And so, in this case, I was pleased that this particular moment of assault on higher education by the Trump administration has been resolved, at least for now, although who knows. These agreements come and go with this White House.
I was and I am distressed that, in this country today, the executive branch of the federal government wants to be able to dictate terms to private universities, law firms, newspapers, TV stations. And so all of these things are evidence that the current administration is trying to erode support for institutions in civil society.
Let me put to you, if I may, what the acting president of Columbia University, Claire Shipman, said in an interview on CNN this morning defending the terms of the deal.
Claire Shipman, Acting President, Columbia University:
I think there are a couple of really important things about this agreement from our point of view. One, it doesn't cross the red lines that we laid out. It protects our academic integrity. That was, of course, essential to us.
And, two, it does reset our relationship with the federal government in terms of research funding. And it's not just money for Columbia. I mean, this is about science. It's about curing cancer, cutting-edge, boundary-breaking science that actually benefits the country and humanity.
President Roth, do you believe that, after this deal, Columbia can move forward with full academic freedom, as President Shipman there is saying? And what do you believe the downstream effects of making a deal like this are for other universities?
Well, it's very clear that if you annoy the White House in this regime, you could get sucked into a process of litigation or fines that bear no relation to the facts of the matter, but just become a way of expressing loyalty, of conforming to the wishes of the government.
We saw it at UVA just a week or two ago. You see it now at George Mason. This is an effort to tell universities, as they have told law firms, as they're telling newspapers and as they have done with TV stations, telling these organizations, you are not independent. If you contract with the federal government, we have a — we, the government, has the right to tell you what to do.
This agreement does protect many things at Columbia. And, again, I'm not criticizing them for signing it. I don't criticize the parent for paying a ransom to get their kids back. They're getting their science back. But they're also telling the federal government, you can tell us how to run our Middle East studies program, telling the federal government, you can tell us how many police officers we should have at a minimum on campus or how students should be disciplined.
The White House has determined how students should be disciplined at a private university. This is massive overreach. This is an assault on the independence of civil society in America. And conservatives, liberals, moderates, they should all be concerned when a White House tells you how to run your private associations.
So you're saying they should be concerned.
As you note, Columbia is not the only university that's been targeted by this administration. Harvard, as we have been covering, has actually been fighting the administration in court, but we know there's also settlement talks going on. Do you believe universities and colleges will have no other choice but to make some kind of deal in order to move forward?
Well, I do think that, when you're dealing with a very, very powerful entity like the federal government, especially when it doesn't obey its own laws — I mean, there are no findings of fact here about what the specific actions of antisemitism were — or discrimination against white people.
There's no findings of facts there. It's just, you give us $221 million, and then we allow you to compete for grants. I mean, it's a very old-fashioned game. You pay the powerful figure so that you can go along and continue to operate.
Now, you operate in a way, of course, that you don't want to annoy that powerful figure or that powerful organization. And it sends a chilling message across America that, if you have a late-night comedy show, if you have a law firm, if you are working in an educational institution or a library, or, as we read today, in a museum like the Smithsonian, if you don't please the president, you are at risk.
And, again, I don't blame them for trying to make the best of that situation, but, as Americans, I'm not worried about Columbia. I'm not worried about Wesleyan. I'm worried about the country, where we are being subject to a White House that thinks it could tell us what to do at every turn.
As you know, the administration has long argued that this was about combating antisemitism on campus. This was a deal welcomed by Columbia's Hillel Jewish organization.
The executive director said in part: ""The announcement's an important recognition of what Jewish students and families have expressed with increasing urgency. Antisemitism at Columbia is real. It has a tangible impact on Jewish students' sense of safety, belonging, and their civil rights.""
I guess the question, President Roth, is if it makes Jewish students and staff feel safer, did the administration pressure and the deal do what it intended to do?
How does paying the government $220 million to do basic science make Jews safer? As a Jew, I find this horrific.
I know antisemitism is real, and I know it was real and is real at Columbia, as it is in Congress, as it is in most places in the United States. But the idea that you pay off the government in order to get them off your back so you can do cancer research, and that's good for the Jews, I think it's ridiculous.
We don't need the White House to tell us antisemitism is real two weeks after the Defense Department contracts with Grok, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence entity after it praised Hitler. This is an administration that is not concerned with Jewish welfare. I am concerned with Jewish welfare as a Jew, as a professor, as a college president. I think it's really important to call out antisemitism.
But to pay up basically protection money in a way that's supposed to make Jews safer, I think, in the long run, it's — as we say in my community, it's not good for the Jews.
That is Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University, joining us tonight.
President Roth, thank you for your time.
Thank you for having me.

But they're also telling the federal government, you can tell us how to run our Middle East studies program, telling the federal government, you can tell us how many police officers we should have at a minimum on campus or how students should be disciplined.
The White House has determined how students should be disciplined at a private university. This is massive overreach. This is an assault on the independence of civil society in America. And conservatives, liberals, moderates, they should all be concerned when a White House tells you how to run your private associations.
So you're saying they should be concerned.
As you note, Columbia is not the only university that's been targeted by this administration. Harvard, as we have been covering, has actually been fighting the administration in court, but we know there's also settlement talks going on. Do you believe universities and colleges will have no other choice but to make some kind of deal in order to move forward?
Well, I do think that, when you're dealing with a very, very powerful entity like the federal government, especially when it doesn't obey its own laws — I mean, there are no findings of fact here about what the specific actions of antisemitism were — or discrimination against white people.
There's no findings of facts there. It's just, you give us $221 million, and then we allow you to compete for grants. I mean, it's a very old-fashioned game. You pay the powerful figure so that you can go along and continue to operate.
Now, you operate in a way, of course, that you don't want to annoy that powerful figure or that powerful organization. And it sends a chilling message across America that, if you have a late-night comedy show, if you have a law firm, if you are working in an educational institution or a library, or, as we read today, in a museum like the Smithsonian, if you don't please the president, you are at risk.
And, again, I don't blame them for trying to make the best of that situation, but, as Americans, I'm not worried about Columbia. I'm not worried about Wesleyan. I'm worried about the country, where we are being subject to a White House that thinks it could tell us what to do at every turn.
As you know, the administration has long argued that this was about combating antisemitism on campus. This was a deal welcomed by Columbia's Hillel Jewish organization.
The executive director said in part: ""The announcement's an important recognition of what Jewish students and families have expressed with increasing urgency. Antisemitism at Columbia is real. It has a tangible impact on Jewish students' sense of safety, belonging, and their civil rights.""
I guess the question, President Roth, is if it makes Jewish students and staff feel safer, did the administration pressure and the deal do what it intended to do?
How does paying the government $220 million to do basic science make Jews safer? As a Jew, I find this horrific.
I know antisemitism is real, and I know it was real and is real at Columbia, as it is in Congress, as it is in most places in the United States. But the idea that you pay off the government in order to get them off your back so you can do cancer research, and that's good for the Jews, I think it's ridiculous.
We don't need the White House to tell us antisemitism is real two weeks after the Defense Department contracts with Grok, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence entity after it praised Hitler. This is an administration that is not concerned with Jewish welfare. I am concerned with Jewish welfare as a Jew, as a professor, as a college president. I think it's really important to call out antisemitism.
But to pay up basically protection money in a way that's supposed to make Jews safer, I think, in the long run, it's — as we say in my community, it's not good for the Jews.
That is Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University, joining us tonight.
President Roth, thank you for your time.
Thank you for having me.

Amna Nawaz:
Columbia University and the Trump administration have reached a deal that restores federal funding and research grant money to the university. As part of the agreement, Columbia will pay $200 million to the federal government over three years and an additional $21 million to resolve alleged civil rights violations against Jewish employees.
The university agreed to suspend, expel, or revoke degrees from some 70 students who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and it will issue a report to a monitor to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion is not promoted on campus.
Columbia, which was at risk of losing billions of dollars from the government, says it retains its academic freedom.
For a closer look at this agreement and what it means for a higher education in the U.S., I'm joined by Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University.
President Roth, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Thanks for joining us.
Michael Roth, President, Wesleyan University:
Thanks for having me.
So let's just start with your initial reaction. When you heard the news and the details of this settlement, what did you think?
Michael Roth:
Well, I felt like one must feel when you have paid a ransom in a kidnapping situation and the person who's been kidnapped is returned safely.
You think, thank goodness, the kid's OK, or the person kidnapped is OK. But I wouldn't phrase the agreement that led to the liberation of the kidnapped person. And so, in this case, I was pleased that this particular moment of assault on higher education by the Trump administration has been resolved, at least for now, although who knows. These agreements come and go with this White House.
I was and I am distressed that, in this country today, the executive branch of the federal government wants to be able to dictate terms to private universities, law firms, newspapers, TV stations. And so all of these things are evidence that the current administration is trying to erode support for institutions in civil society.
Let me put to you, if I may, what the acting president of Columbia University, Claire Shipman, said in an interview on CNN this morning defending the terms of the deal.
Claire Shipman, Acting President, Columbia University:
I think there are a couple of really important things about this agreement from our point of view. One, it doesn't cross the red lines that we laid out. It protects our academic integrity. That was, of course, essential to us.
And, two, it does reset our relationship with the federal government in terms of research funding. And it's not just money for Columbia. I mean, this is about science. It's about curing cancer, cutting-edge, boundary-breaking science that actually benefits the country and humanity.
President Roth, do you believe that, after this deal, Columbia can move forward with full academic freedom, as President Shipman there is saying? And what do you believe the downstream effects of making a deal like this are for other universities?
Well, it's very clear that if you annoy the White House in this regime, you could get sucked into a process of litigation or fines that bear no relation to the facts of the matter, but just become a way of expressing loyalty, of conforming to the wishes of the government.
We saw it at UVA just a week or two ago. You see it now at George Mason. This is an effort to tell universities, as they have told law firms, as they're telling newspapers and as they have done with TV stations, telling these organizations, you are not independent. If you contract with the federal government, we have a — we, the government, has the right to tell you what to do.
This agreement does protect many things at Columbia. And, again, I'm not criticizing them for signing it. I don't criticize the parent for paying a ransom to get their kids back. They're getting their science back. But they're also telling the federal government, you can tell us how to run our Middle East studies program, telling the federal government, you can tell us how many police officers we should have at a minimum on campus or how students should be disciplined.
The White House has determined how students should be disciplined at a private university. This is massive overreach. This is an assault on the independence of civil society in America. And conservatives, liberals, moderates, they should all be concerned when a White House tells you how to run your private associations.
So you're saying they should be concerned.

Harvard, as we have been covering, has actually been fighting the administration in court, but we know there's also settlement talks going on. Do you believe universities and colleges will have no other choice but to make some kind of deal in order to move forward?
Well, I do think that, when you're dealing with a very, very powerful entity like the federal government, especially when it doesn't obey its own laws — I mean, there are no findings of fact here about what the specific actions of antisemitism were — or discrimination against white people.
There's no findings of facts there. It's just, you give us $221 million, and then we allow you to compete for grants. I mean, it's a very old-fashioned game. You pay the powerful figure so that you can go along and continue to operate.

Geoff Bennett:
The president of the University of Virginia is resigning following a pressure campaign by the Trump administration, marking what appears to be the first time the White House has successfully forced out a university leader.
James Ryan announced his departure today amid a Justice Department investigation into UVA's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. In a statement, Ryan said he could not fight for his job in good conscience since that would knowingly and willingly risk federal funding, student aid, and jobs for the university.
For a closer look at the impact and President Trump's broader battle with higher education, we're joined by Peter McDonough, vice president of the American Council on Education. The group represents nearly 1,600 colleges and universities.
Thank you for joining us.
Peter McDonough, Vice President and General Counsel, American Council on Education: Thank you.
It appears James Ryan resigned earlier than planned amid this pressure from the Trump administration and a DOJ investigation into UVA's DEI policy. So what does this say to you about the Trump administration's influence over university governance?
Peter McDonough:
Well, first and foremost, I think we all can agree that universities should be receptive to thoughtful criticism. And they should be accountable when they fall short.
But Congress has mandated certain types of processes. We tend to call them due process that we're supposed to be imagining everybody follows. But in terms of control over a university by the executive branch of the federal government and using the purse strings that Congress is essentially holding in terms of federal funding, there are specific rules or specific requirements or specific types of due process that is supposed to be respected and utilized when there is a question about whether a college or a university, public or private, has complied with federal law.
There's nothing in our — the federal system of government that enables the executive branch to micromanage all aspects of a university. And there's certainly nothing that enables it to force out a leader of a college or university, public or private.
Does Mr. Ryan's resignation, does this represent a tipping point in higher ed autonomy?
Well, I hope it doesn't. But we should all be concerned that it may.
I wouldn't have seen this coming. but, frankly, I should have and maybe more of us should have. Back in 2021, the vice president, appearing at a National Conservatism Conference, said we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country. He said it in a speech titled, ""The Universities Are the Enemy.""
That should worry us all. That should worry us on all ends of the political spectrum. It should worry us whether we are in statehouses or state legislatures, whether we are on the boards of public universities or whether we are on the boards or in leadership positions of private colleges and universities, because we don't have a federal system of higher education.
We have a mosaic that's made up of publics and privates, small and large, religious-based and not. And I think we can all agree that, over the decades, this mosaic of higher education has really, truly been the envy of the world. It's why people come here to go to college. And it's produced the economic vitality that we have experienced here. It's enabled us to have a level of national security and health benefits.
It allowed us to address some of the largest problems in medicine with a power that, frankly, starts in most instances in the research labs on our college campuses. And all of this is at risk.
There are those who argue that James Ryan's resignation was necessary because UVA didn't fully comply with efforts to dismantle its DEI programs.
Our team spoke with Ilya Shapiro with the Manhattan Institute, and he makes that point.
Ilya Shapiro, Manhattan Institute:
The school pledged to dismantle its DEI structures and programs, and there's some doubt about whether they did that. So the Justice Department was investigating and wanted to make sure that people weren't being treated differently based on race and ethnic background and all these other issues that this school, among others, had been having.
So it told them what needed to be done. And one of those things, I think, because President Ryan was deeply involved in DEI programming, including in his previous job at Harvard, that having new leadership made sense.
So do you believe the university was being transparent, or was this more a matter of rebranding, rather than real reform on its part?
Well, let's start with the realization, which I believe is accurate, that there has been no outcome to any investigation of the University of Virginia at this stage.
The clip that you played sound as if there had been a verdict without a trial. If they have a branding of DEI or a branding of inclusion or a branding of equity or even — a branding of equity, that doesn't make them illegal. And it certainly shouldn't make it a mandate that the president of one of the major research universities in this country, one of the major universities in this country, part of that mosaic, must step down before there is a conclusion of an investigation.

We have a mosaic that's made up of publics and privates, small and large, religious-based and not. And I think we can all agree that, over the decades, this mosaic of higher education has really, truly been the envy of the world. It's why people come here to go to college. And it's produced the economic vitality that we have experienced here. It's enabled us to have a level of national security and health benefits.
It allowed us to address some of the largest problems in medicine with a power that, frankly, starts in most instances in the research labs on our college campuses. And all of this is at risk.
There are those who argue that James Ryan's resignation was necessary because UVA didn't fully comply with efforts to dismantle its DEI programs.
Our team spoke with Ilya Shapiro with the Manhattan Institute, and he makes that point.
Ilya Shapiro, Manhattan Institute:
The school pledged to dismantle its DEI structures and programs, and there's some doubt about whether they did that. So the Justice Department was investigating and wanted to make sure that people weren't being treated differently based on race and ethnic background and all these other issues that this school, among others, had been having.
So it told them what needed to be done. And one of those things, I think, because President Ryan was deeply involved in DEI programming, including in his previous job at Harvard, that having new leadership made sense.
So do you believe the university was being transparent, or was this more a matter of rebranding, rather than real reform on its part?
Well, let's start with the realization, which I believe is accurate, that there has been no outcome to any investigation of the University of Virginia at this stage.
The clip that you played sound as if there had been a verdict without a trial. If they have a branding of DEI or a branding of inclusion or a branding of equity or even — a branding of equity, that doesn't make them illegal. And it certainly shouldn't make it a mandate that the president of one of the major research universities in this country, one of the major universities in this country, part of that mosaic, must step down before there is a conclusion of an investigation.

The president of the University of Virginia is resigning following a pressure campaign by the Trump administration, marking what appears to be the first time the White House has successfully forced out a university leader.
James Ryan announced his departure today amid a Justice Department investigation into UVA's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. In a statement, Ryan said he could not fight for his job in good conscience since that would knowingly and willingly risk federal funding, student aid, and jobs for the university.
For a closer look at the impact and President Trump's broader battle with higher education, we're joined by Peter McDonough, vice president of the American Council on Education. The group represents nearly 1,600 colleges and universities.
Thank you for joining us.
Peter McDonough, Vice President and General Counsel, American Council on Education: Thank you.
It appears James Ryan resigned earlier than planned amid this pressure from the Trump administration and a DOJ investigation into UVA's DEI policy. So what does this say to you about the Trump administration's influence over university governance?
Peter McDonough:
Well, first and foremost, I think we all can agree that universities should be receptive to thoughtful criticism. And they should be accountable when they fall short.
But Congress has mandated certain types of processes. We tend to call them due process that we're supposed to be imagining everybody follows. But in terms of control over a university by the executive branch of the federal government and using the purse strings that Congress is essentially holding in terms of federal funding, there are specific rules or specific requirements or specific types of due process that is supposed to be respected and utilized when there is a question about whether a college or a university, public or private, has complied with federal law.
There's nothing in our — the federal system of government that enables the executive branch to micromanage all aspects of a university. And there's certainly nothing that enables it to force out a leader of a college or university, public or private.
Does Mr. Ryan's resignation, does this represent a tipping point in higher ed autonomy?
Well, I hope it doesn't. But we should all be concerned that it may.
I wouldn't have seen this coming. but, frankly, I should have and maybe more of us should have. Back in 2021, the vice president, appearing at a National Conservatism Conference, said we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country. He said it in a speech titled, ""The Universities Are the Enemy.""
That should worry us all. That should worry us on all ends of the political spectrum. It should worry us whether we are in statehouses or state legislatures, whether we are on the boards of public universities or whether we are on the boards or in leadership positions of private colleges and universities, because we don't have a federal system of higher education.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The president of the University of Virginia, facing heavy pressure from conservative critics and the Trump administration over the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices, announced Friday that he was resigning rather than “fight the federal government.”
The departure of James Ryan, who had led the school since 2018, represents a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration’s effort to reshape higher education. Doing it at a public university marks a new frontier in a campaign that has almost exclusively targeted Ivy League schools. It also widens the rationale behind the government’s aggressive tactics, focusing on DEI rather than alleged tolerance of antisemitism.
Ryan had faced conservative criticism that he failed to heed federal orders to eliminate DEI policies, and his removal was pushed for by the Justice Department as it investigated the school, according to a person who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.

Ryan referenced the Trump administration pressure in a statement to the university community Friday in which he said he had submitted his resignation with a “very heavy heart.”
“To make a long story short, I am inclined to fight for what I believe in, and I believe deeply in this University,” he said. “But I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my job.”
Ryan had already decided that next year would be his last, he said, and remaining in his position until then would be “knowingly and willingly sacrificing this community.”
The New York Times first reported on the resignation and the Justice Department’s insistence on it. The Justice Department declined to comment Friday.

Ryan’s removal is another example of the Trump administration using “thuggery instead of rational discourse,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents university presidents.
“This is a dark day for the University of Virginia, a dark day for higher education, and it promises more of the same,” Mitchell said. “It’s clear the administration is not done and will use every tool that it can make or invent to exert its will over higher education.”
In a joint statement, Virginia’s Democratic senators said it was outrageous that the Trump administration would demand Ryan’s resignation over “‘culture war’ traps.” “This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future,” Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine said.
After campaigning on a promise to end “wokeness” in education, Trump signed a January action ordering the elimination of DEI programs and “radical indoctrination” across the nation’s schools and universities. The Education Department has opened investigations into dozens of colleges, arguing that diversity initiatives discriminate against white and Asian American students.
The response from schools has been scattered. Some have closed DEI offices, ended diversity scholarships and no longer require diversity statements as part of the hiring process. Some others have rebranded DEI work under other names, while some have held firm on diversity policies.

The University of Virginia became a flashpoint after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives. The school’s governing body voted to shutter the DEI office in March and end diversity policies in admissions, hiring, financial aid and other areas. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin celebrated the action, declaring that “DEI is done at the University of Virginia.”
Among those drawing attention to the Charlottesville campus was America First Legal, a conservative group founded by Trump aide Stephen Miller. In a May letter to the Justice Department, the group said the university failed to dismantle DEI programs and chose to “rename, repackage, and redeploy the same unlawful infrastructure under a lexicon of euphemisms.”
The group directly took aim at Ryan, noting that he joined hundreds of other college presidents in signing a public statement condemning the “overreach and political interference” of the Trump administration.
On Friday, the group said it will continue to use every available tool to root out what it has called discriminatory systems.
“This week’s developments make clear: public universities that accept federal funds do not have a license to violate the Constitution,” Megan Redshaw, an attorney at the group, said in a statement. “They do not get to impose ideological loyalty tests, enforce race and sex-based preferences, or defy lawful executive authority.”
Ryan was hired to lead the University of Virginia in 2018 and previously served as the dean of Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. Earlier in his career he spent more than a decade as a law professor at the University of Virginia. A biography on Harvard’s website credits Ryan with increasing the “size, strength and diversity” of the faculty, adding that building a diverse community was a priority.
Until now, the White House had directed most of its attention at Harvard University and other elite institutions that Trump sees as bastions of liberalism. Harvard has lost more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants amid its battle with the government, which has also attempted to block the school from hosting foreign students and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status.
Harvard and its $53 billion endowment are uniquely positioned to weather the government’s financial pressure. Public universities, however, are far more dependent on taxpayer money and could be more vulnerable. The University of Virginia’s $10 billion endowment is among the largest for public universities, while the vast majority have far less.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The president of the University of Virginia, facing heavy pressure from conservative critics and the Trump administration over the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices, announced Friday that he was resigning rather than “fight the federal government.”
The departure of James Ryan, who had led the school since 2018, represents a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration’s effort to reshape higher education. Doing it at a public university marks a new frontier in a campaign that has almost exclusively targeted Ivy League schools. It also widens the rationale behind the government’s aggressive tactics, focusing on DEI rather than alleged tolerance of antisemitism.
Ryan had faced conservative criticism that he failed to heed federal orders to eliminate DEI policies, and his removal was pushed for by the Justice Department as it investigated the school, according to a person who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.

Ryan referenced the Trump administration pressure in a statement to the university community Friday in which he said he had submitted his resignation with a “very heavy heart.”
“To make a long story short, I am inclined to fight for what I believe in, and I believe deeply in this University,” he said. “But I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my job.”
Ryan had already decided that next year would be his last, he said, and remaining in his position until then would be “knowingly and willingly sacrificing this community.”
The New York Times first reported on the resignation and the Justice Department’s insistence on it. The Justice Department declined to comment Friday.

Ryan’s removal is another example of the Trump administration using “thuggery instead of rational discourse,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents university presidents.
“This is a dark day for the University of Virginia, a dark day for higher education, and it promises more of the same,” Mitchell said. “It’s clear the administration is not done and will use every tool that it can make or invent to exert its will over higher education.”
In a joint statement, Virginia’s Democratic senators said it was outrageous that the Trump administration would demand Ryan’s resignation over “‘culture war’ traps.” “This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future,” Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine said.
After campaigning on a promise to end “wokeness” in education, Trump signed a January action ordering the elimination of DEI programs and “radical indoctrination” across the nation’s schools and universities. The Education Department has opened investigations into dozens of colleges, arguing that diversity initiatives discriminate against white and Asian American students.
The response from schools has been scattered. Some have closed DEI offices, ended diversity scholarships and no longer require diversity statements as part of the hiring process. Some others have rebranded DEI work under other names, while some have held firm on diversity policies.

The University of Virginia became a flashpoint after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives. The school’s governing body voted to shutter the DEI office in March and end diversity policies in admissions, hiring, financial aid and other areas. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin celebrated the action, declaring that “DEI is done at the University of Virginia.”
Among those drawing attention to the Charlottesville campus was America First Legal, a conservative group founded by Trump aide Stephen Miller. In a May letter to the Justice Department, the group said the university failed to dismantle DEI programs and chose to “rename, repackage, and redeploy the same unlawful infrastructure under a lexicon of euphemisms.”
The group directly took aim at Ryan, noting that he joined hundreds of other college presidents in signing a public statement condemning the “overreach and political interference” of the Trump administration.
On Friday, the group said it will continue to use every available tool to root out what it has called discriminatory systems.
“This week’s developments make clear: public universities that accept federal funds do not have a license to violate the Constitution,” Megan Redshaw, an attorney at the group, said in a statement. “They do not get to impose ideological loyalty tests, enforce race and sex-based preferences, or defy lawful executive authority.”
Ryan was hired to lead the University of Virginia in 2018 and previously served as the dean of Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. Earlier in his career he spent more than a decade as a law professor at the University of Virginia. A biography on Harvard’s website credits Ryan with increasing the “size, strength and diversity” of the faculty, adding that building a diverse community was a priority.
Until now, the White House had directed most of its attention at Harvard University and other elite institutions that Trump sees as bastions of liberalism. Harvard has lost more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants amid its battle with the government, which has also attempted to block the school from hosting foreign students and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status.
Harvard and its $53 billion endowment are uniquely positioned to weather the government’s financial pressure. Public universities, however, are far more dependent on taxpayer money and could be more vulnerable. The University of Virginia’s $10 billion endowment is among the largest for public universities, while the vast majority have far less.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration’s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students, delivering the Ivy League school another victory as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.
READ MORE: Judge temporarily blocks Trump’s ban on foreign students attending Harvard
The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves Harvard’s ability to host foreign students while the case is decided, but it falls short of resolving all of Harvard’s legal hurdles to hosting international students. Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard’s ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.
Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school’s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students — about a quarter of its total enrollment — to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.
The university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House’s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government’s action hours after Harvard sued.
Less than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump’s proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.
“We expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,” Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. “Our Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.”
The stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America’s oldest and wealthiest university.
The Trump administration’s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of “profound fear, concern, and confusion,” the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.
WATCH: What Trump’s legal and political clash with Harvard means for higher education
Still, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they’ll be able to attend the university.
For one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard’s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
Harvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn’t refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration’s policies, she still hasn’t heard back.
“Your personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,” Huang said in a social media post. “Why does it have to be so hard to go to school?”
Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after the university rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.
On Friday, the president said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address “their largescale improprieties” and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. “They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,” Trump’s post said.
WATCH: Harvard professor calls Trump’s attacks on funding and students ‘authoritarianism’
Trump’s administration first targeted Harvard’s international students in April. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short and on May 22 revoked Harvard’s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.
The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world’s top students, the school said in its lawsuit, and it harmed Harvard’s reputation as a global research hub. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit said.
The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard’s students, including two universities in Hong Kong.
Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its “core, legally-protected principles,” even after receiving federal ultimatums.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration’s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students, delivering the Ivy League school another victory as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.

The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves Harvard’s ability to host foreign students while the case is decided, but it falls short of resolving all of Harvard’s legal hurdles to hosting international students. Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard’s ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.
Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school’s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students — about a quarter of its total enrollment — to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.
The university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House’s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government’s action hours after Harvard sued.
Less than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump’s proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.
“We expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,” Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. “Our Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.”
The stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America’s oldest and wealthiest university.
The Trump administration’s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of “profound fear, concern, and confusion,” the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.
WATCH: What Trump’s legal and political clash with Harvard means for higher education
Still, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they’ll be able to attend the university.
For one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard’s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
Harvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn’t refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration’s policies, she still hasn’t heard back.
“Your personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,” Huang said in a social media post. “Why does it have to be so hard to go to school?”
Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after the university rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.
On Friday, the president said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address “their largescale improprieties” and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. “They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,” Trump’s post said.
WATCH: Harvard professor calls Trump’s attacks on funding and students ‘authoritarianism’
Trump’s administration first targeted Harvard’s international students in April. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short and on May 22 revoked Harvard’s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.
The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world’s top students, the school said in its lawsuit, and it harmed Harvard’s reputation as a global research hub. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit said.
The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard’s students, including two universities in Hong Kong.
Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its “core, legally-protected principles,” even after receiving federal ultimatums.

This represents a rapidly developing situation that could affect Tulane's research funding within the next 30 days.
While the funding cuts to women's health research are significant, particularly for institutions with strong medical and public health programs like Tulane, they represent a moderate operational impact rather than a severe threat to the university's existence.
","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds",https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/06/womens-health-scientific-innovation-funding-challenge/?utm_campaign=rss,2025-08-06 18:49:01,Scientific breakthroughs are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.,"Scientific breakthroughs — from next-generation vaccines to long-acting medications to prevent HIV — are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.
At a STAT event this week, Ruanne Barnabas, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, described the potential for progress following a 2022 study she helped lead, in which researchers found that a single dose of the HPV vaccine could be just as effective as two. She said it was “no accident” or simple stroke of luck that the vaccine performed so well.
“We can now do bespoke antigen design to make new vaccines — we can make vaccines in a room just about the size of this stage — and they can be highly efficacious,” she said.
The results of Barnabas’ study, which was backed by the Gates Foundation, led the World Health Organization to recommend a one-dose schedule of the vaccine against the human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer, as well as two-dose schedules — a breakthrough that reduced costs and simplified vaccine delivery worldwide.
At the same time, however, gains in women’s health are being threatened by funding issues. Five of Barnabas’ grants were affected by federal funding changes and by cuts to Harvard University. She said that the hardest part for her has been losing the partnerships and connections she has developed over years of working together.
“The hardest things are all the deep relationships and partnerships that you build over many years in order to move science forward. To have those stopped — in the midst of clinical trials and other things — that is very hard for participants, for partners, for being able to safely transition people out,” Barnabas said at the event, which was held at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
Jo-Ann Passmore, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, pointed to another recent innovation: the development of lenacapavir, an injection that provides six months of protection against HIV infection. The drug is particularly promising for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections.
“That felt like a really transformative, good news story for women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa,” Passmore said. “All of the research we do focuses on the major drivers of that, but until game-changers come along, like lenacapavir, all of the work we do seems to be incremental in how we solve the problem. I came into 2025 with this real sense of optimism and pride in what the field had achieved.”
But there are open questions about how the drug will get to people in need. While the drug’s manufacturer, Gilead, has agreed to provide the treatment at cost to 2 million people in lower-income countries, with the help of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the agreement does not include the U.S. government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has long been the world’s leading provider of HIV prevention drugs.
PEPFAR funding has been slashed by the Trump administration. In 2024, South Africa received $332.6 million in funding from the program, which accounted for 17% of the nation’s HIV treatment and prevention budget. Although some funding has resumed, many programs have had to find new financial support, or else shut down.
“Coming into 2025 with this vision of hope, only to have massive cuts to the USAID, NIH funding, PEPFAR … it completely crippled, in the blink of an eye, things that people have fought hard for 30 years,” Passmore said. “So, I’m sitting here humbled. We’ve survived. Six months later, we’re trying to rebuild programs that are rebuildable, but many of them will be lost.”
While there has been enormous advancement in medicine, research and funding specifically targeted toward women’s health still lag far behind. In an article published in the BMJ last week, Ru Cheng, the Gates Foundation’s director of women’s heath innovations, noted that globally, only 1% of research and development funding is allocated toward women’s health issues outside of oncology, and just 2% of all venture capital health investments are focused on women. The Gates Foundation announced Monday that it will pledge $2.5 billion through 2030 to support dozens of different approaches for improving women’s health, particularly focusing on research and development.
Scott Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Comanche Biopharma, which will receive some of that funding, explained that historically, there has not been enough money for novel drug development in women’s health.
“We’ve had too many efforts, at least in the pharmaceutical industry, in drug development, to simply repurpose drugs,” he said. “To take drugs that are already available, and ‘Let’s give it a try, they seem to be safe, so maybe they’ll be effective.’”
His startup is developing an RNA-based therapy for preeclampsia — a pregnancy-related condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and fetus. Currently, there are no targeted treatments available for it. Johnson hopes Comanche’s drug will be the first.
“We need more true successes,” Johnson said. “Success attracts capital. Success attracts interest.”
Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s commissioner of public health, emphasized the importance of funding for behavioral science and implementation research — studying how lifesaving interventions can actually reach patients.
“If you don’t do this research, if you don’t invest in that, it sits on the shelf,” she said. “For many women, they don’t know anything about lenacapavir, and they are at very high risk of HIV infection.”
Community research and engagement must come hand in hand with drug development, Ojikutu said.
“There’s some amazing things that are happening that could be appropriate in sub-Saharan Africa, versus here in Boston, versus rural Georgia, rural Mississippi. But I think that we need to be spending time, effort, energy, money, building infrastructure in behavioral science research,” Ojikutu said. “We need to get into communities and actually know whether we’ll use any of this research, any of the interventions that are being developed.”",StatNews,"['harvard university', 'nih']","['Ruanne Barnabas', 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'HPV', 'Barnabas', 'the Gates Foundation', 'the World Health Organization', 'Barnabas', 'Harvard University', 'Barnabas', 'the Broad Institute', 'Cambridge', 'Mass.', 'Jo-Ann Passmore', 'the University of Cape Town', 'South Africa', 'Gilead', 'the Global Fund', 'Tuberculosis', 'Malaria', 'U.S.', 'PEPFAR', 'Trump', 'South Africa', '$332.6 million', 'USAID', 'NIH', 'PEPFAR', 'BMJ', 'Ru Cheng', 'the Gates Foundation’s', 'The Gates Foundation', '$2.5 billion', 'Scott Johnson', 'preeclampsia', 'Johnson', 'Comanche', 'Johnson', 'Success', 'Success', 'Bisola Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Georgia', 'Mississippi', 'Ojikutu']","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds.

Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s commissioner of public health, emphasized the importance of funding for behavioral science and implementation research — studying how lifesaving interventions can actually reach patients.
“If you don’t do this research, if you don’t invest in that, it sits on the shelf,” she said. “For many women, they don’t know anything about lenacapavir, and they are at very high risk of HIV infection.”
Community research and engagement must come hand in hand with drug development, Ojikutu said.
“There’s some amazing things that are happening that could be appropriate in sub-Saharan Africa, versus here in Boston, versus rural Georgia, rural Mississippi. But I think that we need to be spending time, effort, energy, money, building infrastructure in behavioral science research,” Ojikutu said. “We need to get into communities and actually know whether we’ll use any of this research, any of the interventions that are being developed.”",StatNews,"['harvard university', 'nih']","['Ruanne Barnabas', 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'HPV', 'Barnabas', 'the Gates Foundation', 'the World Health Organization', 'Barnabas', 'Harvard University', 'Barnabas', 'the Broad Institute', 'Cambridge', 'Mass.', 'Jo-Ann Passmore', 'the University of Cape Town', 'South Africa', 'Gilead', 'the Global Fund', 'Tuberculosis', 'Malaria', 'U.S.', 'PEPFAR', 'Trump', 'South Africa', '$332.6 million', 'USAID', 'NIH', 'PEPFAR', 'BMJ', 'Ru Cheng', 'the Gates Foundation’s', 'The Gates Foundation', '$2.5 billion', 'Scott Johnson', 'preeclampsia', 'Johnson', 'Comanche', 'Johnson', 'Success', 'Success', 'Bisola Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Georgia', 'Mississippi', 'Ojikutu']","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds. Scientific breakthroughs — from next-generation vaccines to long-acting medications to prevent HIV — are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.
At a STAT event this week, Ruanne Barnabas, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, described the potential for progress following a 2022 study she helped lead, in which researchers found that a single dose of the HPV vaccine could be just as effective as two. She said it was “no accident” or simple stroke of luck that the vaccine performed so well.
“We can now do bespoke antigen design to make new vaccines — we can make vaccines in a room just about the size of this stage — and they can be highly efficacious,” she said.
The results of Barnabas’ study, which was backed by the Gates Foundation, led the World Health Organization to recommend a one-dose schedule of the vaccine against the human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer, as well as two-dose schedules — a breakthrough that reduced costs and simplified vaccine delivery worldwide.
At the same time, however, gains in women’s health are being threatened by funding issues. Five of Barnabas’ grants were affected by federal funding changes and by cuts to Harvard University. She said that the hardest part for her has been losing the partnerships and connections she has developed over years of working together.
“The hardest things are all the deep relationships and partnerships that you build over many years in order to move science forward. To have those stopped — in the midst of clinical trials and other things — that is very hard for participants, for partners, for being able to safely transition people out,” Barnabas said at the event, which was held at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
Jo-Ann Passmore, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, pointed to another recent innovation: the development of lenacapavir, an injection that provides six months of protection against HIV infection. The drug is particularly promising for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections.
“That felt like a really transformative, good news story for women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa,” Passmore said. “All of the research we do focuses on the major drivers of that, but until game-changers come along, like lenacapavir, all of the work we do seems to be incremental in how we solve the problem. I came into 2025 with this real sense of optimism and pride in what the field had achieved.”
But there are open questions about how the drug will get to people in need. While the drug’s manufacturer, Gilead, has agreed to provide the treatment at cost to 2 million people in lower-income countries, with the help of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the agreement does not include the U.S. government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has long been the world’s leading provider of HIV prevention drugs.
PEPFAR funding has been slashed by the Trump administration. In 2024, South Africa received $332.6 million in funding from the program, which accounted for 17% of the nation’s HIV treatment and prevention budget. Although some funding has resumed, many programs have had to find new financial support, or else shut down.
“Coming into 2025 with this vision of hope, only to have massive cuts to the USAID, NIH funding, PEPFAR … it completely crippled, in the blink of an eye, things that people have fought hard for 30 years,” Passmore said. “So, I’m sitting here humbled. We’ve survived. Six months later, we’re trying to rebuild programs that are rebuildable, but many of them will be lost.”
While there has been enormous advancement in medicine, research and funding specifically targeted toward women’s health still lag far behind. In an article published in the BMJ last week, Ru Cheng, the Gates Foundation’s director of women’s heath innovations, noted that globally, only 1% of research and development funding is allocated toward women’s health issues outside of oncology, and just 2% of all venture capital health investments are focused on women. The Gates Foundation announced Monday that it will pledge $2.5 billion through 2030 to support dozens of different approaches for improving women’s health, particularly focusing on research and development.
Scott Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Comanche Biopharma, which will receive some of that funding, explained that historically, there has not been enough money for novel drug development in women’s health.
“We’ve had too many efforts, at least in the pharmaceutical industry, in drug development, to simply repurpose drugs,” he said. “To take drugs that are already available, and ‘Let’s give it a try, they seem to be safe, so maybe they’ll be effective.’”
His startup is developing an RNA-based therapy for preeclampsia — a pregnancy-related condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and fetus. Currently, there are no targeted treatments available for it. Johnson hopes Comanche’s drug will be the first.
“We need more true successes,” Johnson said. “Success attracts capital. Success attracts interest.”

Canceling NIH grants was unlawful, per watchdog
An independent government agency has found that the Trump administration, by abruptly canceling NIH grants, violated a law that blocks presidents from withholding congressionally approved funding. The Government Accountability Office said in a report issued yesterday that HHS “has not shown that the delay was a permissible programmatic one.”
The findings are nonbinding but could empower Congress to push back against the Trump administration’s efforts to use the NIH budget as leverage over institutions like Columbia and Harvard. Read more on the report and what it means from STAT’s Anil Oza and Megan Molteni.
Raw milk is still dangerous
Twenty-one people are sick with E. coli or bacterial infections called campylobacter after consuming raw milk from a farm in Florida, per the AP. That includes six children. Seven people have been hospitalized, and at least two are suffering severe complications.
As a reminder, unpasteurized “raw” milk has long been considered unsafe because it can transmit pathogens like these. Nevermind the fact that H5N1 bird flu swept through dairy cattle across the country last year. While some people believe that it’s possible to regulate the product enough to make it safe, the black market for raw milk in states where it’s restricted is currently operating unchecked by the FDA.
$500 million
That’s how much funding for vaccine development HHS is canceling, according to an announcement yesterday from health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA, is terminating 22 grants supporting the development of mRNA vaccines, delivering a crippling blow to the country’s capacity to develop vaccines during the next pandemic or public health emergency.

Rare disease patients caught in Trump’s crosshairs
Global partnerships are a critical part of research on rare diseases — with so few patients to study in any one country, scientists have to search far and wide to identify the causes and test potential treatments. But as the Trump administration began allowing NIH grant reviews to resume this spring after a months-long pause, it also quietly tightened its requirements for applications with a foreign component. Now, forgetting to include a single document regarding a project’s foreign collaborators is grounds for a withdrawal without review (meaning the grant application gets denied).
“In the grand scheme of things, it’s not that much money for the federal government,” said Ellyn Kodroff, pictured above. “But it’s so devastating for this community.” Kodroff’s daughter has a rare digestive disorder and recently was able to begin an experimental treatment at the NIH Clinical Center. But the group running the trial had its latest funding request withdrawn because of the forgotten document.
It’s not the only group that’s been affected, STAT’s Megan Molteni learned. And the move is just the first in a much more sweeping effort to limit funding for foreign scientists. Read more from Megan on what the effects will be.
Wildfire smoke is also still really bad for you
Hundreds of wildfires burning across the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are pushing smoke across Canada and the American northeast. Canadian towns close to the wildfires are experiencing the worst of the smoke pollution, but even here in Boston, there was a brief ground stop at the airport Monday due to smoke and haze.
It’s getting better, but here’s a reminder:
Wildfire smoke is particularly harmful to kids’ respiratory health. One study found that a 10-unit increase of fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke was associated with a 30% spike in pediatric admissions for respiratory problems. “It’s quite a big bit of a difference,” the lead author said.
-
Researchers have found that people who live in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter could have a greater risk of developing dementia, with a particularly strong link seen between the condition and exposure to wildfire emissions. Still, there are a lot of questions remaining about other long-term effects.
-
In California, between 2008 and 2010, somewhere between 52,480 and 55,710 people died prematurely due to chronic exposure to wildfire smoke. The economic impact of those deaths was at least $432 billion.

For doctors, patient complaints beget … industry payments?
The more unsolicited complaints from patients that doctors receive, the more likely they are to take higher payments from industry, according to a study published yesterday in JAMA Network Open.
Researchers analyzed data from almost 72,000 doctors whose clinics participate in the Patient Advocacy Reporting System Index. Complaints logged there were cross-referenced with data on the same physicians in the Open Payments Program database. Those who had higher PARS scores — which are calculated with the number and the severity of patient complaints — were significantly more likely to accept general payments (meaning not for research), particularly for higher amounts.
Male physicians and those practicing in nonacademic settings were also more likely to accept larger general payments. The results demonstrate an urgent need for clinics to address conflict and trust between physicians and patients and to strengthen the management of financial conflicts of interest.

Canceling NIH grants was unlawful, per watchdog
An independent government agency has found that the Trump administration, by abruptly canceling NIH grants, violated a law that blocks presidents from withholding congressionally approved funding. The Government Accountability Office said in a report issued yesterday that HHS “has not shown that the delay was a permissible programmatic one.”
The findings are nonbinding but could empower Congress to push back against the Trump administration’s efforts to use the NIH budget as leverage over institutions like Columbia and Harvard. Read more on the report and what it means from STAT’s Anil Oza and Megan Molteni.
Raw milk is still dangerous
Twenty-one people are sick with E. coli or bacterial infections called campylobacter after consuming raw milk from a farm in Florida, per the AP. That includes six children. Seven people have been hospitalized, and at least two are suffering severe complications.
As a reminder, unpasteurized “raw” milk has long been considered unsafe because it can transmit pathogens like these. Nevermind the fact that H5N1 bird flu swept through dairy cattle across the country last year. While some people believe that it’s possible to regulate the product enough to make it safe, the black market for raw milk in states where it’s restricted is currently operating unchecked by the FDA.
$500 million
That’s how much funding for vaccine development HHS is canceling, according to an announcement yesterday from health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA, is terminating 22 grants supporting the development of mRNA vaccines, delivering a crippling blow to the country’s capacity to develop vaccines during the next pandemic or public health emergency. Helen Branswell has more, including insight from a former director of BARDA.
Rare disease patients caught in Trump’s crosshairs
Global partnerships are a critical part of research on rare diseases — with so few patients to study in any one country, scientists have to search far and wide to identify the causes and test potential treatments. But as the Trump administration began allowing NIH grant reviews to resume this spring after a months-long pause, it also quietly tightened its requirements for applications with a foreign component. Now, forgetting to include a single document regarding a project’s foreign collaborators is grounds for a withdrawal without review (meaning the grant application gets denied).
“In the grand scheme of things, it’s not that much money for the federal government,” said Ellyn Kodroff, pictured above. “But it’s so devastating for this community.” Kodroff’s daughter has a rare digestive disorder and recently was able to begin an experimental treatment at the NIH Clinical Center. But the group running the trial had its latest funding request withdrawn because of the forgotten document.
It’s not the only group that’s been affected, STAT’s Megan Molteni learned. And the move is just the first in a much more sweeping effort to limit funding for foreign scientists. Read more from Megan on what the effects will be.
Wildfire smoke is also still really bad for you
Hundreds of wildfires burning across the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are pushing smoke across Canada and the American northeast. Canadian towns close to the wildfires are experiencing the worst of the smoke pollution, but even here in Boston, there was a brief ground stop at the airport Monday due to smoke and haze.
It’s getting better, but here’s a reminder:
Wildfire smoke is particularly harmful to kids’ respiratory health. One study found that a 10-unit increase of fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke was associated with a 30% spike in pediatric admissions for respiratory problems. “It’s quite a big bit of a difference,” the lead author said.
-
Researchers have found that people who live in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter could have a greater risk of developing dementia, with a particularly strong link seen between the condition and exposure to wildfire emissions. Still, there are a lot of questions remaining about other long-term effects.
-
In California, between 2008 and 2010, somewhere between 52,480 and 55,710 people died prematurely due to chronic exposure to wildfire smoke. The economic impact of those deaths was at least $432 billion.

For doctors, patient complaints beget … industry payments?
The more unsolicited complaints from patients that doctors receive, the more likely they are to take higher payments from industry, according to a study published yesterday in JAMA Network Open.
Researchers analyzed data from almost 72,000 doctors whose clinics participate in the Patient Advocacy Reporting System Index. Complaints logged there were cross-referenced with data on the same physicians in the Open Payments Program database. Those who had higher PARS scores — which are calculated with the number and the severity of patient complaints — were significantly more likely to accept general payments (meaning not for research), particularly for higher amounts.
Male physicians and those practicing in nonacademic settings were also more likely to accept larger general payments. The results demonstrate an urgent need for clinics to address conflict and trust between physicians and patients and to strengthen the management of financial conflicts of interest.

But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.,"Scientific breakthroughs — from next-generation vaccines to long-acting medications to prevent HIV — are fueling new hope in women’s health. But experts warn that persistent gaps in funding and access could stall that progress.
At a STAT event this week, Ruanne Barnabas, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, described the potential for progress following a 2022 study she helped lead, in which researchers found that a single dose of the HPV vaccine could be just as effective as two. She said it was “no accident” or simple stroke of luck that the vaccine performed so well.
“We can now do bespoke antigen design to make new vaccines — we can make vaccines in a room just about the size of this stage — and they can be highly efficacious,” she said.
The results of Barnabas’ study, which was backed by the Gates Foundation, led the World Health Organization to recommend a one-dose schedule of the vaccine against the human papillomavirus, which can lead to cervical cancer, as well as two-dose schedules — a breakthrough that reduced costs and simplified vaccine delivery worldwide.
At the same time, however, gains in women’s health are being threatened by funding issues. Five of Barnabas’ grants were affected by federal funding changes and by cuts to Harvard University. She said that the hardest part for her has been losing the partnerships and connections she has developed over years of working together.
“The hardest things are all the deep relationships and partnerships that you build over many years in order to move science forward. To have those stopped — in the midst of clinical trials and other things — that is very hard for participants, for partners, for being able to safely transition people out,” Barnabas said at the event, which was held at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
Jo-Ann Passmore, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, pointed to another recent innovation: the development of lenacapavir, an injection that provides six months of protection against HIV infection. The drug is particularly promising for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections.
“That felt like a really transformative, good news story for women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa,” Passmore said. “All of the research we do focuses on the major drivers of that, but until game-changers come along, like lenacapavir, all of the work we do seems to be incremental in how we solve the problem. I came into 2025 with this real sense of optimism and pride in what the field had achieved.”
But there are open questions about how the drug will get to people in need. While the drug’s manufacturer, Gilead, has agreed to provide the treatment at cost to 2 million people in lower-income countries, with the help of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the agreement does not include the U.S. government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has long been the world’s leading provider of HIV prevention drugs.
PEPFAR funding has been slashed by the Trump administration. In 2024, South Africa received $332.6 million in funding from the program, which accounted for 17% of the nation’s HIV treatment and prevention budget. Although some funding has resumed, many programs have had to find new financial support, or else shut down.
“Coming into 2025 with this vision of hope, only to have massive cuts to the USAID, NIH funding, PEPFAR … it completely crippled, in the blink of an eye, things that people have fought hard for 30 years,” Passmore said. “So, I’m sitting here humbled. We’ve survived. Six months later, we’re trying to rebuild programs that are rebuildable, but many of them will be lost.”
While there has been enormous advancement in medicine, research and funding specifically targeted toward women’s health still lag far behind. In an article published in the BMJ last week, Ru Cheng, the Gates Foundation’s director of women’s heath innovations, noted that globally, only 1% of research and development funding is allocated toward women’s health issues outside of oncology, and just 2% of all venture capital health investments are focused on women. The Gates Foundation announced Monday that it will pledge $2.5 billion through 2030 to support dozens of different approaches for improving women’s health, particularly focusing on research and development.
Scott Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Comanche Biopharma, which will receive some of that funding, explained that historically, there has not been enough money for novel drug development in women’s health.
“We’ve had too many efforts, at least in the pharmaceutical industry, in drug development, to simply repurpose drugs,” he said. “To take drugs that are already available, and ‘Let’s give it a try, they seem to be safe, so maybe they’ll be effective.’”
His startup is developing an RNA-based therapy for preeclampsia — a pregnancy-related condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and fetus. Currently, there are no targeted treatments available for it. Johnson hopes Comanche’s drug will be the first.
“We need more true successes,” Johnson said. “Success attracts capital. Success attracts interest.”
Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s commissioner of public health, emphasized the importance of funding for behavioral science and implementation research — studying how lifesaving interventions can actually reach patients.
“If you don’t do this research, if you don’t invest in that, it sits on the shelf,” she said. “For many women, they don’t know anything about lenacapavir, and they are at very high risk of HIV infection.”
Community research and engagement must come hand in hand with drug development, Ojikutu said.
“There’s some amazing things that are happening that could be appropriate in sub-Saharan Africa, versus here in Boston, versus rural Georgia, rural Mississippi. But I think that we need to be spending time, effort, energy, money, building infrastructure in behavioral science research,” Ojikutu said. “We need to get into communities and actually know whether we’ll use any of this research, any of the interventions that are being developed.”",StatNews,"['harvard university', 'nih']","['Ruanne Barnabas', 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'HPV', 'Barnabas', 'the Gates Foundation', 'the World Health Organization', 'Barnabas', 'Harvard University', 'Barnabas', 'the Broad Institute', 'Cambridge', 'Mass.', 'Jo-Ann Passmore', 'the University of Cape Town', 'South Africa', 'Gilead', 'the Global Fund', 'Tuberculosis', 'Malaria', 'U.S.', 'PEPFAR', 'Trump', 'South Africa', '$332.6 million', 'USAID', 'NIH', 'PEPFAR', 'BMJ', 'Ru Cheng', 'the Gates Foundation’s', 'The Gates Foundation', '$2.5 billion', 'Scott Johnson', 'preeclampsia', 'Johnson', 'Comanche', 'Johnson', 'Success', 'Success', 'Bisola Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Ojikutu', 'Boston', 'Georgia', 'Mississippi', 'Ojikutu']","Scientific innovation is driving hope for progress in women’s health, but experts warn of headwinds.

In early May, Harvard president Dr. Alan Garber received a letter from the National Institutes of Health notifying him that hundreds of scientific grants had been rescinded, as the next step in the escalating battle between Harvard and the Trump administration. In an instant, the years-long collective efforts of countless researchers to cure illness, protect against disease, and improve human knowledge were thrown into disarray.
Still, the letter did offer Garber one ray of hope: He could appeal the decision to the director of the NIH, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. It was a name Garber knew exceptionally well. For more than three decades, Garber had nurtured Bhattacharya’s career, first as his undergraduate honors thesis adviser, and later as a colleague and peer. Now their relationship had entered dramatically new territory. As the letter made clear, Garber could go to his former student as a supplicant and plead with him to reconsider.

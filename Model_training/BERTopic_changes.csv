University High's Lamar Brown committed to LSU football over Texas A&M, Texas and Miami, he announced at Pennington McKernan Gymnasium on Thursday afternoon.
The five-star defensive lineman in the 2026 class is the highest-rated player at his position and the No. 5 overall player in the country, according to the 247Sports composite rankings. On ESPN, he’s listed as the No. 1 player in the nation.
""It always started off with coach (Brian) Kelly,"" Brown said during a commitment that aired on ESPN. ""That was my first offer. He always believed in me. Just the coaches here, playing for Baton Rouge, playing for the state of Louisiana, it meant a lot.""
The 6-foot-4, 285-pound Brown also plays on the offensive line in high school, though he said he wants to play defensive line as he moves forward. He is described as a stout and explosive athlete who “projects as a high-major impact player on either side of the ball” and has “legitimate high-round NFL Draft potential,” according to a 247Sports scouting report.
The two-way player is also a decorated track and field athlete. He was the 2025 Louisiana 3A State Champion in the discus with a winning throw of 151 feet and 6 inches. He took gold in the event as a sophomore and finished second in 2023 as a freshman.
LSU’s recruiting class jumped to No. 7 nationally, according to 247Sports, after Brown's commitment. He is now the second-highest-rated player who has committed to Kelly and his staff behind wide receiver Tristen Keys, who is the No. 3 player in the country on the 247Sports composite.
If LSU holds onto Brown and Keys, it would sign two of the top 5 recruits on the 247Sports composite rankings. The last time that happened was 2011 with offensive lineman La'el Collins and defensive lineman Anthony Johnson.
Brown would be the first No. 1 overall recruit on ESPN's rankings to sign with the Tigers since running back Leonard Fournette in 2014.",The Advocate,[],"['Louisiana', 'Baton Rouge', 'Lamar Brown', 'LSU', 'Texas A&M', 'Texas', 'Miami', 'ESPN', 'Brian', 'Kelly', 'Brown', 'ESPN', 'Baton Rouge', 'Louisiana', 'Brown', 'NFL Draft', 'Louisiana 3A State Champion', 'LSU', 'Brown', 'Kelly', 'Tristen Keys', 'LSU', 'Brown', 'Keys', ""La'el Collins"", 'Anthony Johnson', 'Brown', 'ESPN', 'Tigers', 'Leonard Fournette']","LSU football lands Lamar Brown, the best recruit in Louisiana and top-5 player in 2026 class.

At Eagle Point High School, I exceeded my own expectations by getting involved in various activities, such as Leadership, National Honor Society, Varsity Sports, Yearbook Editor and Editor in Chief, Junior Class Representative, Senior Class Secretary, Top 5% of my class all four years and Prom Committee. I also took college classes, tutored, and joined the Latinx Student Union. These positions required a significant amount of dedication, hard work, and year-round commitment. Although I cannot predict the future, I aspire to continue to challenge myself and strive for excellence in all that I do.
Why I Chose Oregon Tech and My Major
In fourth grade, I had an X-ray for back issues that sparked my interest in pursuing Radiology. After researching and consulting with educators, Oregon Tech emerged as the ideal college choice, notably due to its externship program that offers a practical experience to supplement theoretical learning.
My Influential Professors
In the fall term, I enrolled in MIT103 under the tutelage of Professor Carrie Giacomelli. Professor Giacomelli was a knowledgeable and professional instructor who invited guest speakers to provide real-world insights into our future careers. Likewise, I hold Professor Tricia Elliott in high regard for her unwavering commitment to her students' educational development. Professor Elliott's engaging teaching style made the difficult subject of Anatomy and Physiology more accessible, using animal analogies to enhance comprehension.

Relocating to a new location inevitably entails learning about oneself and others. In particular, effective time management became a critical skill that I had to develop. Despite having accrued college credits while still in high school, adapting to college coursework necessitated a challenging but ultimately rewarding adjustment process.
My Plans After Graduation
After college, I aim to join a program that lets me travel across the United States to provide medical aid to patients.

We hear it from the time we're little
“Find your purpose.”
It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?
This is “purpose anxiety” — the gnawing sense that one’s life should have an overarching purpose, but it’s unclear how to discover it.
“There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.
The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?
Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help “close that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,” he said.
People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.
There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.
But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.
The term “purpose anxiety” appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.”
People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose.
“Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.”
“But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.”
Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center).
Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don’t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.
As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit.""
You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life.
It entails “understanding who you are and what you have to work with, understanding what you care about, what you’d like to see be better, either in yourself or in the world” and then figuring out if you can make an impact, he added.
“In our culture, we are so outcome-focused and process-adverse,” he said. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.”
For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second.
“Big ‘P’ Purpose is goal-oriented — it’s usually big and audacious, and often unattainable,” he said. Social media, he said, “is full of people trying to voice that version of purpose on you so that they can make money.”
Better, he said, to focus on little “p” purpose and pursuits that some might simply call hobbies — gardening, singing, collecting baseball cards. Or it can be found in a job, or volunteering.
“What could I do that would light me up and fill me up and be a good use of my time?” Grumet said.
It’s not just for self-improvement, he said. When people do something they love, they attract people to them, which can help create communities.
Not all agree that hobbies and passions are the same as purpose. Reading books, Kashdan said, isn’t a purpose in itself but can be a tool to discovering it. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.”
Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children
“I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.
But she ended up creating an online community for childless women called Gateway Women.com. In rural Ireland, where she lives, she is also helping build an in-person group that brings people without children together as they age.
“I feel that to be alive in this time, and to have a platform and to be awake is an incredible privilege, and that is my purpose,” she said.

More than 470 fires across the country are currently classified as “out of control”, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).
7,318,421 hectares of land in Canada have burned due to wildfires this year – close to 78% more than the five-year average of 4,114,516 hectares, according to the CIFFC’s latest data.
The 2025 fire season is only behind the explosive 2023 wildfire season, which resulted in an astounding 17,203,625 hectares burned.
“This is our new reality… the warmer it gets, the more fires we see,” said Mike Flannigan, the BC research chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops.
A June analysis on the 2025 fire season in Canada published by United Nations University in Shibuya, Japan, concluded that the fires are a “stark manifestation” of climate change and that warm, dry weather in the spring resulted in temperatures 2.5C above average.
The warmer temperatures extend the fire season and increase the frequency of lightning that sparks fires, said Flannigan. A hotter climate also causes the atmosphere to suck moisture out of fuel, dead vegetation and the forest floor – creating ideal conditions for fires to start, he explained.
“It means more of the material is dried out, is available to burn when the fire does come, it leads to bigger flames, higher intensity, which gets to be difficult to impossible to extinguish,” he said.
So far, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which together account for about 60% of the hectares burned so far this year in Canada.
Tens of thousands of people in communities across the country have been evacuated due to the wildfires. In Saskatchewan, the Canadian Red Cross reported it had assisted more than 17,000 people in the province from over 6,700 households to evacuate.
Thirteen communities in north-west Saskatchewan are under an evacuation order, several of which are First Nations, according to the province. One of the most affected areas of this year’s wildfire season in the province is Denare Beach, a north-eastern village that was mostly destroyed in June due to a blaze.
The season has also now hit the east coast of Canada, as wildfires are currently raging across Newfoundland and Labrador and several towns are under evacuation orders.
John Abatzoglou, a professor of complex systems management at the University of California, Merced, co-authored the June report from United Nations University.
Abatzoglou said this year’s fire season is the third year in a row Canada has seen fire activity that is well above average. The fires are also causing widespread smoke to cascade from the country into the United States as well, prompting severe air quality warnings in several states this month, is also an indication of how the fires are hurting populations beyond evacuations.
It’s an international element of the fires that officials are having to contend with on a wider scale, Abatzoglou said.
“This is a really key point that’s different from other natural hazards and its ability to impact everything from quality of life to … human health and even mortality,” he said.
Governments and public health officials will have to address how to change public behaviour and public policy to contend with “smoke days”, where you have to stay inside, he said.

The man, who remained anonymous in the case study, told doctors he had eliminated sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt, from his diet after reading about its negative health effects. He said he could only find sources telling him how to reduce salt, but not eliminate it completely.
Inspired by his nutrition studies in college, the man decided to completely eliminate sodium chloride from his diet as a personal experiment, with consultation from Chat GPT, researchers wrote. He maintained multiple dietary restrictions and even distilled his own water at home.
“For 3 months, he had replaced sodium chloride with sodium bromide obtained from the internet after consultation with ChatGPT, in which he had read that chloride can be swapped with bromide, though likely for other purposes, such as cleaning,” the case study read.
While excess sodium can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of health issues, it is still necessary to consume a healthy amount of it.
The man, who had no psychiatric history, eventually ended up at the hospital, worried that his neighbor was poisoning him. He told doctors he was very thirsty, but paranoid about the water he was offered.
“In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability,” the study read.
Doctors concluded that the man was suffering from bromism, or bromide toxicity, a condition that is rare today but was more common in the early 20th century. The research noted that bromide was found in several over-the-counter medicines back then and contributed to up to 8% of bromism-related psychiatric admissions at that time.
The hospital treated the man for psychosis and discharged him weeks later. His case highlights the potential pitfalls of using AI to seek medical tips.

""At first I was shocked, then it turned into panic,"" said the 20-year-old, describing the ordeal as a ""wound that will leave a scar"".
C was one of three women who exposed an AI porn scandal at Hong Kong's oldest university last month, sparking huge debate around what had largely been seen as an overseas phenomenon.
The victims, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, and experts said the city was ill-prepared to counter the fast-growing threat.
In the University of Hong Kong (HKU) case, hundreds of images of at least 20 women were discovered on the student's laptop.
""B"", another of those who spoke out, said she felt betrayed as she had considered the perpetrator a friend.
""I felt like my privacy was violated... like I couldn't trust the people around me,"" she said.
The university's initial response was to give the student a warning letter and make him apologise.
The third woman, ""A"", said she was told by staff the case couldn't be heard before a disciplinary committee.
""They were concerned but didn't know what they could do... We felt that was a bit ridiculous.""
HKU told AFP it ""has been in contact with the students involved"" but cannot comment further with the case under active review.
- Damage may 'never end' -
While the HKU case has thrust AI-made porn into the spotlight, it is not the city's first.
Janice, a woman in her late 20s who also asked to use a pseudonym, told AFP she was devastated a few years ago when fake obscene images were sent to her friends.
She never found the culprit and worried that the damage might ""never end"".
""I tried skipping work and didn't dare to go out on the street,"" she said, adding that she had suicidal thoughts and would suddenly burst into tears.
""I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would wake up to see the whole internet filled with (pornographic) images of me.""
Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women received 11 similar requests for help in 2024-25.
""We have observed an uptick... Some cases may be hidden if (victims) don't know how to seek help,"" executive director Doris Chong said.
Janice doubted she had enough evidence to persuade police to help, adding that she felt society will ""never find a way"" to punish canny offenders.
- Type of 'sexual violence' -
An estimated 90 percent of AI-made porn victims are women, Susanne Choi from the Chinese University of Hong Kong told AFP, ""suggesting that it is a form of gender-based sexual violence"".
Asked for the number of recent cases involving deepfake pornography, police said they did not maintain such figures.
Lawmakers and universities need to ""expand and revise existing laws and procedures to better cope with... technology-facilitated sexual harassment"", Choi argued.
Discussions in Britain and Singapore show a growing willingness to penalise its creation, though opinion is split on possession, according to Hong Kong barrister Stephen Keung.
Hong Kong currently criminalises the distribution of ""intimate images"", including AI-made ones, but not their creation or possession.
That made legal action in the HKU case difficult as there was no evidence that the pictures were circulated.
After the women went public with the scandal, however, Hong Kong's privacy watchdog launched a criminal investigation, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is handling a related complaint.
- Dignity 'undermined' -
The three students said they have had to deal with public backlash.
Once an avid social media user, C temporarily stopped posting, worried about who else ""would screengrab my photos for what purpose"".
""Many commenters said... 'You are ruining the guy's future, you should apologise to him',"" she said, saying she endured periods of self-doubt.
The student has not been named and AFP was unable to reach him for comment.
B said the trio did not want to ""play judge"" but believed offenders should face long-term consequences.
""The mere creation (of AI porn) is a problem... My bodily autonomy, my privacy, my dignity were undermined by it,"" B said.
""If a line must be drawn, it should be drawn at creation.""

""I tried skipping work and didn't dare to go out on the street,"" she said, adding that she had suicidal thoughts and would suddenly burst into tears.
""I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would wake up to see the whole internet filled with (pornographic) images of me.""
Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women received 11 similar requests for help in 2024-25.
""We have observed an uptick... Some cases may be hidden if (victims) don't know how to seek help,"" executive director Doris Chong said.
Janice doubted she had enough evidence to persuade police to help, adding that she felt society will ""never find a way"" to punish canny offenders.
- Type of 'sexual violence' -
An estimated 90 percent of AI-made porn victims are women, Susanne Choi from the Chinese University of Hong Kong told AFP, ""suggesting that it is a form of gender-based sexual violence"".
Asked for the number of recent cases involving deepfake pornography, police said they did not maintain such figures.
Lawmakers and universities need to ""expand and revise existing laws and procedures to better cope with... technology-facilitated sexual harassment"", Choi argued.
Discussions in Britain and Singapore show a growing willingness to penalise its creation, though opinion is split on possession, according to Hong Kong barrister Stephen Keung.
Hong Kong currently criminalises the distribution of ""intimate images"", including AI-made ones, but not their creation or possession.
That made legal action in the HKU case difficult as there was no evidence that the pictures were circulated.
After the women went public with the scandal, however, Hong Kong's privacy watchdog launched a criminal investigation, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is handling a related complaint.
- Dignity 'undermined' -
The three students said they have had to deal with public backlash.
Once an avid social media user, C temporarily stopped posting, worried about who else ""would screengrab my photos for what purpose"".
""Many commenters said... 'You are ruining the guy's future, you should apologise to him',"" she said, saying she endured periods of self-doubt.
The student has not been named and AFP was unable to reach him for comment.
B said the trio did not want to ""play judge"" but believed offenders should face long-term consequences.
""The mere creation (of AI porn) is a problem... My bodily autonomy, my privacy, my dignity were undermined by it,"" B said.
""If a line must be drawn, it should be drawn at creation.""

As a former school leader and as a parent to teenagers, I know the range of emotions that come with exams and the reassurances we try to offer our children, or the students in our lives, as they navigate their journey into higher education.
While more than three quarters of students are accepted at their first choice (their Ucas “firm” choice) every year, we are also seeing increasing activity in clearing — from those whose Plan A hasn’t worked out, those who would like to revisit their choices, as well as those who have just decided to apply for the first time. If you are supporting someone waiting for their results this summer, or who wants to enter higher education, and you are not quite sure what clearing is about, Ucas has a wealth of information and practical tips to guide you.
What exactly is clearing?
Clearing is the final stage of the Ucas admissions process. It allows students who have received their results to find university or college places that are yet to be filled. It’s available to anyone who may not have received the grades they need for their firm or insurance choice — but also to those who do have a place and are considering another option, or those who only decide to apply after the last main scheme Ucas deadline in June. Last year 38,935 UK 18-year-olds secured a place at university or college through clearing.
Clearing opened on July 5 and runs until October 20, although the busiest activity happens in mid-August just after the results for A-level, Btec and other qualifications are released. There are plenty of options in clearing once again this year, with about 28,000 courses available across the country.
At Ucas we always advise students to do their research, so they can be prepared for whatever happens. Our advice this year includes encouraging applicants to build a results day action plan by reflecting on their research and reconnecting with their choices. Students might want to look back at their original five choices on the Ucas application and revisit them as a potential option, as we know many students return to one of the original universities or colleges they applied to earlier in the cycle. In other words, don’t start making a whole new playlist when you already have good reasons to choose your favourite songs.
Who else is clearing for?
If a student hasn’t applied to university or college yet but is starting to wish that they had, it’s not too late. They may have just realised that they do want to start a degree this autumn, or they may be a few years into their careers but are looking to get back into education. Whatever the reason, they can still apply to university or college through Ucas by applying directly into clearing. This is an increasingly popular route, with more students choosing to apply direct to clearing every year, in addition to the traditional clearing users who find themselves there having just missed out on the grades needed for their firm or insurance choices.
Last year 67 per cent of those who found a place at university or college in clearing told Ucas that they started their research before August, which shows the importance of getting prepared before results day. For any students who are potentially rethinking their firm choice, I would always suggest getting in touch with that university in the first instance to discuss options. The university might be able to offer a place on a different course if they have changed their mind about what subject they want to study and can share more information about available support.
It’s clear that clearing has evolved, with growing numbers of students now using it as a planned route to find the right course or university for them.
How does it work?
The best way for students to use clearing is to start by creating an account on the Ucas website. They can then search for available courses and, once they have found one they are interested in, contact the university or college directly (making sure they have their clearing number and personal ID on hand) to check they meet the entry requirements. If they are offered a place that they want to accept, they can add the clearing choice in their application via their Ucas account.
Applicants will be able to add a clearing choice from 1pm on Level 3 Results Day, which this year is Thursday, August 14 — or for students in Scotland, from 10am on SQA Results Day on Tuesday, August 5.
Is extra support available?
Ucas has a range of digital tools to support applicants during this time, with our Clearing Plus tool offering personalised matches to available courses based on the information students have submitted in their application. Students can get a taster of different subjects or different careers with virtual work experience on ucas.com. We also have a team of experts on hand who can be reached on the phone, on our social media channels and via our website.
This year we have worked with Clementine Wade, the university and school coach, to create resources specifically for parents, carers and guardians to help you understand what you can do to best support your child through the process.
Results day is a cause for huge celebration, for students, their parents and carers, their teachers, and everyone else who has supported them through their education so far. At Ucas we are committed to ensuring as many people as possible can benefit from the life-changing opportunity of higher education. Together this summer we can help students to make informed choices so they can progress with excitement and confidence.",GDeltProject,[],"['Ucas', 'UK', 'n’t', 'Ucas', 'Ucas', 'Scotland', 'SQA Results Day', 'Clearing Plus', 'Clementine Wade']","A-level results day 2025: full guide to Ucas clearing.

NIH has recently announced a new policy that will continue to support originality, creativity, and fairness in the research application process. NIH has noticed that some Principal Investigators (PIs) have been submitting a large number of research applications that far exceed the numbers we traditionally expect and may have been prepared using artificial intelligence (AI) tools.
While AI may be a helpful tool in preparing applications, the rapid submission of large numbers of research applications from a single PI may undermine the fairness and originality of the research application process and unfairly strain NIH’s application review processes.
As use of AI tools becomes more commonplace, it is important to remember that applicants may use AI in limited aspects to reduce administrative burden while preparing applications. However, applicants should be mindful of the concerns around research misconduct or lack of originality when using such tools. Remember, NIH peer reviewers are prohibited from using AI for their critiques.
To address these issues, the new policy is effective for the September 25, 2025, receipt date and beyond:
Applications that are either substantially developed by AI or containing sections substantially developed by AI are not considered the original ideas of applicants and will not be considered by NIH.
-
NIH will also only accept up to six new, renewal, resubmission, or revision applications from an individual PD/PI (Program Director/Principal Investigator) or Multiple Principal Investigator for all council rounds in a calendar year.

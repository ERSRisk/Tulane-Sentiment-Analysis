The legal aid group Lambda Legal has raised $285 million at a time when attacks on the rights of gay, intersex and transgender people have again intensified
NEW YORK -- The nonprofit legal aid group Lambda Legal, which advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, has raised $285 million at a time when attacks on the rights of gay, intersex and transgender people have again intensified
Lambda Legal CEO Kevin Jennings announced the results on Thursday, saying the group exceeded its original fundraising goal by $105 million.
“I think this is a statement by the LGBTQ+ community that we will not go back,” said Lambda Legal CEO Kevin Jennings in an interview.
The nonprofit has won court cases that ended bans on gay marriage in 2015 and that abolished laws that criminalized sex between gay adults in 2003. It launched the fundraising campaign quietly in 2022 in response to a wave of bills in state legislatures that targeted LGBTQ+ rights.
Some of those laws sought to limit the discussion of sexuality and gender in schools, remove books featuring LGBTQ+ characters from school libraries, ban public drag shows, prohibit students from using their preferred pronouns and limit access to gender-affirming care for trans youth.
This year, President Donald Trump’s administration has focused on transgender people. It has ordered trans people to leave the military, sought to remove fair housing protections for them and denied the existence of trans, nonbinary and intersex people through an executive order recognizing only two sexes.
Trump has tried to cut federal funding for any gender-affirming medical care for trans children.
Lambda Legal has brought multiple legal cases against the administration, including challenges to its ban on trans members in the military and on gender-affirming care for trans youth.
Lambda Legal is a large nonprofit, spending more than $20 million annually since 2021 and holding assets exceeding $54 million in 2023, according to its tax filing.
But the scale of this campaign significantly increases its resources.
Jennings said since its founding in 1973, Lambda Legal had received three gifts of over $1 million. In this campaign, 14 individuals, two foundations and one law firm gave at least $1 million, with several giving tens of millions, he said.
“It was really individuals in the community who stepped up and made this campaign happen,"" he said. ""It wasn’t corporations. It wasn’t law firms. It wasn’t foundations.”
Among the donors is billionaire author MacKenzie Scott, who gave the nonprofit gifts in 2020 and 2021. The largest gift, $25 million, came from the Kathryn G. Graham Trust. Graham served as an early board member for Lambda Legal.
Some $80 million of the raised funds will be spent in the next five years, with the remaining $205 million pledged by donors in their estates, often called planned gifts.
Lambda Legal will use the infusion of cash to hire more attorneys, set up a new mechanism to coordinate pro bono representation from major law firms and hold public trainings about the rights of LGBTQ+ people.
“We’re not going to win every battle,” Jennings said. “We’re not going to win every fight, but we’re going to fight every fight and we will keep fighting and we will be able to keep fighting because of this campaign until we eventually win.”
Even with this new fundraising push, Lambda Legal's resources still fall short of the funding that has gone to conservative nonprofits that also use litigation to pursue public policy goals. For example, Alliance Defending Freedom has raised more than $100 million in each 2022 and 2023, according to its tax filings. The group has represented female athletes challenging sports participation by transgender women and girls and has challenged laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.
The acceptance and visibility of gay, trans, intersex and gender queer people has transformed dramatically within the living memory of many Americans.
In 1961, Illinois became the first state to decriminalize homosexuality. The American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1972. But fights for equal treatment across social arenas and to protect against discrimination continued for decades.
Two major Supreme Court decisions in the past 25 years reflect a rapid shift in public attitudes to support the rights of LGBTQ+ people. The first in 2003 struck down sodomy laws that criminalized sex between gay adults and the second, in 2015, eliminated bans on gay marriage.
Marc Stein, a historian and professor at San Francisco State University, attributed those and other wins to the LGBTQ+ movements' mobilization, court-based strategies and direct protests.
He also said over decades, the fundraising base of the movement changed significantly. In the 1950s and 60s, the movement largely was supported by its members.
“One main source was that they published magazines and newsletters and had subscribers and had members that paid membership fees,” Stein said, though some wealthy patrons also offered support. By the 1980s, the movement began pushing wealthy donors to give to LGBTQ+ causes, he said.
“I think there was a real change in that period from funding that kept the movement close to the community,” Stein said. “And then developments that led some, especially national organizations, to move away from the model of grassroots fundraising to a model of corporate and business fundraising.”
Now, numerous Pride events around the country — including San Francisco and New York City — are reporting budget shortfalls because corporate sponsors have withdrawn their support. Some experts say the corporate retreat from brand activism, which peaked between 2016 to 2022, is due to a changing cultural landscape and a growing number of consumers who don’t want companies to take positions on social issues.
Jennings of Lambda Legal noted the recent withdrawal of corporate money from supporting LGBTQ+ groups and credited his group's recent fundraising success to its individual donors, many of whom he said were motivated to prevent a rollback on the rights that had been won in their lifetimes.
“We’re seeing a lot of cowardice on the part of corporate America right now. A lot of people, who two years ago couldn’t wait to slap a rainbow on their logo, are no longer writing checks,” Jennings said. “I think Lambda turned to the community and the community responded. And sadly, corporate America, which a lot of groups have relied on, has given up the fight in some cases.”

"'I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.' He survived, and here's his advice",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 12:44:43 GMT",Paul Templer was living his best life.,"Paul Templer was living his best life.
He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris.
He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.”
Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos.
“It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.”
A good day for a river trek
March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.”
The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak.
And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.”
Possible trouble ahead
Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.”
Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened.
“Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow.
“Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked.
Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb.
Attempting a rescue
Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe.
“I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said.
“But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.”
He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf.
“I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.”
What happened next was nightmarish and surreal.
“My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on.
“From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t.
“I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.”
Hippos: Huge, territorial and dangerous
There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic.
They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees.
Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half.
They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie).
Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles.
Hippos and humans
They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported.
“The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview.
“I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.”
Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either.
While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%.
‘He spat me out’
Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer.
“I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ”
But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.”
He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time.
“This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself.
“I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.”
This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth.
Total fury
“And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said.
“For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart.
Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.”
He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes.
Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.”
The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though.
Who gets attacked and why
People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison.
“Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said.
Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said.
Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos.
“Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said.
“Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.”
Stuck on a rock and in a hard place
Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.”
Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.”
He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered.
“My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.”
Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks.
Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock.
He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back.
He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?”
“I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.”
Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him.
“Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.”
Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock.
“And that was my bad day at the office.”
Next ordeal: Getting medical help
Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods.
It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live.
But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation.
He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.”
But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.”
He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.”
How to stay safe in hippo country
Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place.
“Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said.
“Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.”
Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses.
Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said.
“Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.”
Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.”
“Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce.
Warning signals
Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting.
“These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said.
If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill.
Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said.
What if you’re in a small watercraft?
“Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.”
It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said.
Once an attack is underway
Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins.
“Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order.
“Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said.
Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.”
Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go.
‘You’re the sum of your choices’
Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).
How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life?
After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.”
Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.”
Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker.
Is a safari advisable?
Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s?
Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said.
Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run.
“My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.”",CNN,['visa'],"['Paul Templer', 'Zimbabwe', 'bush', 'Templer', 'Zimbabwe', 'CNN Travel', 'Templer', 'Air France', 'Germany', 'Templer', 'Zambezi', 'Templer', 'kayak', 'Templer', 'Evans', 'Evans', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'Templer', 'Evans', 'Templer', 'Evans', 'Hollywood', 'Templer', 'National Geographic', 'Colombia', 'Pablo Escobar’s', 'Rebecca Lewison', 'San Diego State University', 'CNN Travel', 'Philip Muruthi', 'the African Wildlife Foundation', 'AWF', 'Templer', 'Evans', 'Evans', 'Templer', 'Templer', 'Evans', 'Templer', 'Evans', 'Templer', 'berserk', 'Templer', 'Templer', 'Mack', 'Templer', 'Mack', 'Lewison', 'Lewison', 'Muruthi', 'Lewison', 'Zambezi', 'Templer', 'Mack', 'Evans', 'Mack', 'Templer', 'Blood', 'Templer', 'Saran Wrap', 'Templer', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'Templer', 'Evans', 'Zimbabwe', 'Templer', 'Templer', 'ICU', 'Zimbabwe', 'the United Kingdom', 'Templer', 'Muruthi', 'Lewison', 'Lewison', 'Muruthi', 'Muruthi', 'Muruthi', 'Muruthi', 'Muruthi', 'Muruthi', 'Muruthi', 'Muruthi', 'Lewison', 'Templer', 'Templer', 'Templer', 'Muruthi', 'Muruthi', 'Lewison', 'Templer', 'National Geographic', 'Templer', 'Templer', 'Templer', 'Templer', 'United States', 'Zambezi', 'safari', 'Templer', 'Muruthi', 'Muruthi', 'Kenya', 'Templer']",,0

Judge Blocks Undocumented Students In Texas From Receiving In-State Tuition,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-immigration-university-tuition_n_68410302e4b0280f75189ce3,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 22:49:09 -0400","A judge on Wednesday sided with the Trump administration in the ruling, which affects thousands of students who live in Texas but lack legal status.","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A federal judge on Wednesday blocked a Texas law that for decades has given college students without legal residency access to reduced in-state tuition, swiftly ruling in favor of the latest effort by the Trump administration to to crack down on immigration.
Within hours after the Justice Department filed a federal lawsuit to block the 2001 law, Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a motion in support of the lawsuit, and U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor issued a ruling that the law as applied to someone “not lawfully present in the United States .... (is) unconstitutional and invalid.”
“Ending this discriminatory and un-American provision is a major victory for Texas,” Paxton said.
Texas was the first state to pass a law allowing “Dreamers,” or young adults without legal status, to be eligible for in-state tuition if they meet certain residency criteria.
And while two dozen states now have similar laws, the Trump administration filed the lawsuit in conservative Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and state lawmakers have long sought to support the president’s hard-line goals on the border.
The lawsuit and ruling also come just two days after the end of the state legislative session, during which a repeal bill pushed by group of Republicans was considered but ultimately did not come up for a vote.
The lawsuit leaned heavily into recent executive orders signed by Trump designed to stop any state or local laws or regulations the administration feels discriminate against legal residents.
“Under federal law, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said. “The Justice Department will relentlessly fight to vindicate federal law and ensure that U.S. citizens are not treated like second-class citizens anywhere in the country.”
Texas has about 57,000 undocumented students enrolled in its public universities and colleges, according to the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a nonpartisan nonprofit group of university leaders focused on immigration policy. The state has about 690,000 students overall at its public universities.
Abbott did not immediately comment on the ruling.
The lawsuit was filed in the Wichita Falls division of the Northern District of Texas, where Paxton and conservative litigants have often challenged the federal government and issues such as health care and gay and transgender rights.
The Texas tuition policy was initially passed by sweeping majorities in the state Legislature and signed into law by then-Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, as a way to open access to higher education for students without legal residency already living in the state. Supporters then and now say it boosts the state’s economy by creating a better educated and better prepared work force.
“Targeted attacks on Texas students who are seeking an affordable college education, led by the Trump administration, won’t help anyone, they only hurt us all,” said Luis Figueroa of Every Texan, a left-leaning public policy group.
The difference in tuition rates is substantial. For example, at the flagship University of Texas at Austin, a state resident paid about $11,000 for the 2024-2025 academic year compared with about $41,000 for students from outside of Texas. Other expenses for housing, supplies and transportation can add nearly $20,000 more, according to school estimates.
The law allowed for students without legal resident status to qualify for in-state tuition if they have lived in the state for three years before graduating from high school, and for a year before enrolling in college. They must also sign an affidavit promising to apply for legal resident status as soon as possible.
But the policy soon came under fire as debates over illegal immigration intensified, and critics called it unfair to legal residents. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, Perry ended up apologizing after saying critics of the law “did not have a heart.”
Legislative efforts to repeal the Texas law have repeatedly failed, but have started to gain traction elsewhere. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed a bill this year that will repeal that state’s in-state tuition law in July.
“Ending Texas’s in-state tuition policy is a direct attack on the educational aspirations of thousands of students who have grown up in our communities and call Texas home,” said Judith Cruz, Assistant Director for the Houston Region for EdTrust in Texas, which advocates for education access for minority and low-income students.",Huffington Post,"['executive order', 'executive order', 'lawsuit', 'legal status', 'legislature']","['AUSTIN', 'Texas', 'AP', 'Texas', 'Trump', 'the Justice Department', 'Texas', 'Ken Paxton', 'U.S.', 'Reed O’Connor', 'the United States', 'Texas', 'Paxton', 'Texas', 'Trump', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Pam Bondi', 'The Justice Department', 'U.S.', 'Texas', 'the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration', 'Abbott', 'Wichita Falls', 'Texas', 'Paxton', 'Texas', 'Legislature', 'Rick Perry', 'Texas', 'Trump', 'Luis Figueroa', 'University of Texas', 'Austin', 'about $11,000', 'about $41,000', 'Texas', 'nearly $20,000', 'Perry', 'Texas', 'Florida', 'Ron DeSantis', 'Texas', 'Judith Cruz', 'the Houston Region', 'Texas']",Value & Future of Higher Education,1
"Major data broker hack impacts 364,000 individuals’ data",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/major-data-broker-hack-impacts-over-364000-individuals-data,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:00:34 -0400","Personal information from 364,000 people was compromised in a LexisNexis data breach that went undetected for months, highlighting privacy risks.","Americans’ personal data is now spread across more digital platforms than ever. From online shopping habits to fitness tracking logs, personal information ends up in hundreds of company databases. While most people worry about social media leaks or email hacks, a far less visible threat comes from data brokers.
I still find it hard to believe that companies like this are allowed to operate with so little legal scrutiny. These firms trade in personal information without our knowledge or consent. What baffles me even more is that they aren’t serious about protecting the one thing that is central to their business model: data.
Just last year, we saw news of a massive data breach at a data broker called National Public Data, which exposed 2.7 billion records. And now another data broker, LexisNexis, a major name in the industry, has reported a significant breach that exposed sensitive information from more than 364,000 people.
LexisNexis breach went undetected for months after holiday hack
LexisNexis filed a notice with the Maine attorney general revealing that a hacker accessed consumer data through a third-party software development platform. The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files. It remains unclear whether this person was responsible for the breach or merely came across the exposed data.
MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS
A spokesperson for LexisNexis confirmed that the hacker gained access to the company’s GitHub account. This is a platform commonly used by developers to store and collaborate on code. Security guidelines repeatedly warn against storing sensitive information in such repositories; however, mistakes such as exposed access tokens and personal data files continue to occur.
The stolen data varies from person to person but includes full names, birthdates, phone numbers, mailing and email addresses, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. LexisNexis has not confirmed whether it received any ransom demand or had further contact with the attacker.
CUSTOM DATA REMOVAL: WHY IT MATTERS FOR PERSONAL INFO ONLINE
Why the LexisNexis hack is a bigger threat than you realize
LexisNexis isn’t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.
In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.
Law enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure. And as the recent breach shows, that failure is no longer hypothetical.

7 expert tips to protect your personal data after a data broker breach
Keeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands:
1. Remove your data from the internet: The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.
Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.
2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.
3. Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers (such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger). You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn’t log your queries. Consider using a browser’s ""incognito"" or private mode when you don’t want your history saved, and regularly clear your cookies and cache. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.

4. Beware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may try to get access to your financial details and other important data using phishing links. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.
5. Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don’t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don’t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores and check app permissions.
6. Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC’s consumer guide, ""Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online,"" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.
7. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.
HR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK
Kurt’s key takeaway
For many, the LexisNexis breach may be the first time they realize just how much of their data is in circulation. Unlike a social media platform or a bank, there is no clear customer relationship with a data broker, and that makes it harder to demand transparency. This incident should prompt serious discussion around what kind of oversight is necessary in industries that operate in the shadows. A more informed public and stronger regulation may be the only things standing between personal data and permanent exposure.

Social media platform Reddit has sued the artificial intelligence company Anthropic, alleging that it is illegally “scraping” the comments of Reddit users to train its chatbot Claude
Social media platform Reddit has sued the artificial intelligence company Anthropic, alleging that it is illegally ""scraping"" the comments of Reddit users to train its chatbot Claude.
Reddit claims that Anthropic has used automated bots to access Reddit's content despite being asked not to do so, and “intentionally trained on the personal data of Reddit users without ever requesting their consent.”
Anthropic didn’t immediately return a request for comment Wednesday. Reddit filed the lawsuit Wednesday in California Superior Court in San Francisco, where both companies are based.
“AI companies should not be allowed to scrape information and content from people without clear limitations on how they can use that data,” said Ben Lee, Reddit's chief legal officer, in a statement Wednesday.
Reddit has previously entered licensing agreements with Google, OpenAI and other companies to enable them to train their AI systems on Reddit commentary.
Those agreements “enable us to enforce meaningful protections for our users, including the right to delete your content, user privacy protections, and preventing users from being spammed using this content,” Lee said.
Anthropic was formed by former OpenAI executives in 2021 and its flagship Claude chatbot remains a key competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Much like other AI companies, it's relied heavily on websites such as Wikipedia and Reddit that are full of rich sources of written materials to teach an AI assistant the patterns of human language
In a 2021 paper co-authored by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei — cited in the lawsuit — researchers at the company identified the subreddits, or subject-matter forums, that contained the highest quality data, such as those focused on gardening, history or thoughts people have in the shower.
Anthropic in 2023 argued in a letter to the U.S. Copyright Office that the ""way Claude was trained qualifies as a quintessentially lawful use of materials,” by making copies of information to perform a statistical analysis of a large body of data.
But Reddit's lawsuit is different from others brought against AI companies because it doesn’t allege copyright infringement. Instead, it focuses on the alleged breach of Reddit's terms of use, and the unfair competition, it says, was created.",ABC News,"['dei', 'lawsuit']","['AI', 'Reddit', 'Claude\nSocial', 'Reddit', 'Claude', 'Anthropic', 'Reddit', 'California Superior Court', 'San Francisco', 'Ben Lee', 'Reddit', 'Reddit', 'Google', 'OpenAI', 'AI', 'Reddit', 'Lee', 'OpenAI', 'OpenAI', 'AI', 'Wikipedia', 'Reddit', 'AI', 'Dario Amodei', 'the U.S.', 'Claude', 'Reddit', 'AI', 'Reddit']","Cyber Security, Inadequate Infrastructure, Data Management, Quality and Accessibility in Higher Education",2

The South Park residents’ outrage is in response to two ICE raids that occurred Friday at the South Park restaurants Buona Forchetta and Enoteca Buona Forchetta, the Los Angeles Times reports. Locals responded to the terrifying scene by protesting, calling federal agents “Nazis” and “fascists.”
Eventually, agents used flash-bang grenades to get away, at least according to what Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe, a spokesperson for HSI, a branch within ICE, told the Times.
“The demonstrators became unruly and as a result less lethal noise flash diversionary devices were deployed to allow law enforcement to exit the scene as safely as possible,” O’Keefe said. “When gatherings like these are formed, it not only places law enforcement in danger but also the demonstrators and onlookers attempting to impede law enforcement activity.”
O’Keefe also told the Times that four people living in the country illegally were taken into custody.
Renato Ametrano, the general manager of Buona Forchetta in South Park, told local news station KSWB/KUSI that ICE agents arrived at 4 p.m. before his restaurant opened and put all 15 workers in handcuffs — including himself — before releasing most of them.
“It was very, very uncomfortable. They handcuffed everybody. The first 10 minutes, they don’t give any explanation,” Ametrano said.
San Diego city officials condemned the raids.
“Like many San Diegans, I was deeply upset by Friday night’s immigration enforcement operation at Buona Forchetta and Enoteca Buona Forchetta in South Park,” San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said in a statement Sunday. “Federal actions like these are billed as a public safety measure, but it had the complete opposite effect.”
Gloria added, “What we saw undermines trust and creates fear in our community.”
Councilmember Stephen Whitburn, whose district includes South Park, was also alarmed.
“Last Friday was completely unnecessary,” Whitburn told the Times. “And residents had every right to be furious about what they were witnessing and to make their anger known, and they did that, and I’m proud of it.”
Social media users who watched the footage also found the footage deeply concerning, yet powerful. See some of their remarks below.

The Justice Department’s emergency appeal to the high court said U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston exceeded his authority last month when he issued a preliminary injunction reversing the layoffs of nearly 1,400 people and putting the broader plan on hold.

Judge Rules Hundreds of Migrants Sent to El Salvador Deserve Due Process,https://truthout.org/articles/judge-rules-hundreds-of-migrants-deported-to-el-salvador-deserve-due-process/,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 17:37:42 +0000","Migrants deported under Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act were &ldquo;plainly deprived…of their right[s],&rdquo; the judge ruled.","A United States district judge has ruled that the Trump administration must provide hundreds of migrants sent to an El Salvador megaprison under the Alien Enemies Act the ability to challenge their deportation.
U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling on Wednesday, determining that allowing those deportations to stand without recognizing migrants’ due process would not only violate their rights, but also create an unacceptable precedent. Boasberg also noted that President Donald Trump issued the order for deportations against individuals who his administration had determined were part of the Venezuelan-based Tren de Aragua gang.
An independent examination of migrants who were deported to the El Salvador CECOT prison complex on March 15 and 16 shows that there is no evidence of any criminal history for around three-quarters of those individuals. Many family members of those who have been deported there also deny that they have links to gangs.
By refusing to allow these individuals the ability to challenge their deportations, the administration “plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling.
The judge’s decree does not apply to all immigrants who were deported to El Salvador, but is narrowly focused on those who were removed from the U.S. based on the Alien Enemies Act proclamation that Trump made earlier this year — individuals like Kilmar Abrego García, whose deportation is similarly questionable but was based on other rationales, are not affected by Boasberg’s ruling.
Boasberg left open the possibility that some deportations could be viewed as justifiable if the administration allowed individuals to challenge their deportations.
“Perhaps the President lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act. Perhaps, moreover, Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs are gang members. But — and this is the critical point — there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government’s say-so,” Boasberg wrote.
How to provide the deported migrants their due process “will be determined in future proceedings,” the judge added.
Boasberg was also mindful of the incredibly dangerous precedent that could be created by allowing the administration’s actions to remain unchallenged.
“Absent this relief” from his ruling, Boasberg said, “The Government could snatch anyone off the street, turn him over to a foreign country, and then effectively foreclose any corrective course of action.”
It’s unclear what appellate courts may do next with the case. While the Supreme Court has authorized, at least temporarily, the administration to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants living in the U.S., the high court also ruled in April that those subjected to his actions must be given the ability to challenge his ability to do so.
Several legal experts praised Boasberg’s ruling.
“[This is an] important moment for the rule of law and against government lawlessness,” Ryan Goodman, co-editor-in-chief of Just Security, wrote in a Bluesky post.
Noting that “details [of the case still need] to be worked out” — chiefly, how the deported migrants may see their individual cases remedied — constitutional law professor and political commentator Harry Litman applauded Boasberg for stating in his ruling that “violations must be remedied.”
This was a “big important decision,” Litman added.
Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the organizations that is representing the migrants in the lawsuit, also celebrated the order by Boasberg.
“Today’s ruling affirms what every American knows: in the United States, people are entitled to due process and no one should be removed from the country without it,” Perryman said. “We will continue to oppose this administration’s attempts to re-write the Constitution.”

Federal prosecutors have charged two Chinese researchers with smuggling a crop-killing fungus into the U.S. last summer
NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors charged two Chinese researchers on Tuesday with smuggling a crop-killing fungus into the U.S. last summer — charges that come amid heightened political tensions between the two countries and as the Trump administration moves to revoke visas from visiting Chinese students.
Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu are charged with conspiracy, smuggling, making false statements and visa fraud for allegedly bringing the fungus Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. Jian, 33, was booked in a Detroit federal court. Liu, 34, is thought to be in China.
According to the FBI, Liu had small baggies of the fungus stashed in his backpack when he flew to the U.S. last year and, after claiming ignorance about the plant material inside them, said he was planning to use it for research at a University of Michigan lab where Jian worked and where Liu previously worked.
Fusarium graminearum causes a disease called Fusarium head blight that can wipe out cereal crops such as wheat, barley and maize and rice — it inflicts $1 billion in losses annually on U.S. wheat and barley crops, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
It isn’t the only fungus to cause Fusarium head blight, but it’s the most common culprit in the U.S. The fungus infects plants early in the growing season, shriveling wheat grains and blanching crop heads a whitish-tan color. It also causes a toxin to accumulate in wheat kernels that can make them unsafe for people and livestock to eat.
Nicknamed “vomitoxin” because it’s most known for causing livestock to throw up, it can also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and fever in animals and people.
Wheat and other grain crops are screened for various toxins, including Fusarium graminearum, before they can be used to feed animals and humans. Farmers have to throw out any infected grains, which can cause devastating losses.
“It’s one of the many problems that farmers have to deal with that risks their livelihood,” said David Geiser, a Fusarium expert at Penn State.
Although Jian and Liu are accused of smuggling Fusarium graminearum into the country, the fungus is already prevalent in the U.S. — particularly in the east and Upper Midwest — and scientists have been studying it for decades.
Researchers often bring foreign plants, animals and even strains of fungi to the U.S. to study them, but they must file certain permits before moving anything across state or national borders. Studying the genes of a foreign fungus strain, for example, can help scientists learn how it tolerates heat, resists pesticides or mutates.
“We look at variations among individuals just like we do humans,” said Nicole Gauthier, a plant pathologist at the University of Kentucky who studies Fusarium.
That said, it’s unclear why the Chinese researchers might have wanted to bring that strain of Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. and why they didn’t fill out the proper paperwork to do so.

A former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump says he wants to become governor in the president’s adopted home state of Florida, and he’s running as a Democrat
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump says he wants to become governor in the president’s adopted home state of Florida, and that he’s running as a Democrat.
David Jolly formally announced his bid Thursday, becoming the latest party convert hoping to wrest back control of what had been the country’s premier swing state that in recent years has made a hard shift to the right. Under state law, term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis can’t run for reelection in 2026.
Even as Florida serves as a place for the Trump administration to poach staff and test policies, Jolly says he’s confident that issues such as affordability, funding public schools, and strengthening campaign finance and ethics laws will resonate with all voters in 2026. He predicts elections next year will herald nationwide change.
“I actually think Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us. I think we should get politicians out of the classrooms, out of the doctor’s offices,” Jolly said.
“I think enough people in Florida, even some Republicans, now understand that. That the culture wars have gone too far,” he said.
Jolly was first elected to his Tampa Bay-area congressional seat during a 2014 special election, and was reelected for one full term. The attorney and former lobbyist underwent a political evolution that spurred him to leave the Republican Party in 2018 to become an independent and then a registered Democrat. And he has built a national profile for himself as an anti-Trump political commentator on MSNBC.
Jolly said he has considered himself “part of the Democratic coalition” for five or so years, and believes in what he sees as the party’s “fundamental values” — that government can help people, that the economy should be “fair” to all, and that immigrants should be celebrated.
“I struggled to exercise those values in the Republican Party,” Jolly said, continuing: “The actual registration as a Democrat wasn’t a pivot. It was a kind of a formality.”
Jolly has broken from his old party on immigration, as Florida lawmakers race to help Trump fulfill his promise of mass deportations. Jolly skewered Republicans who he said have ”conflated immigration and crime,” which he described as wrong and immoral.
“If you were born here or if you immigrated here, or if you’re a Tallahassee politician who steals Medicaid money, we’re going to be tough on crime,” Jolly added, referring to a probe into the use of Medicaid settlement funds by a charity associated with first lady Casey DeSantis.
Jolly’s gubernatorial run as a Democrat draws comparisons to the failed bid of former Republican congressman-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, who lost to DeSantis in 2022 by 19 points. It was Crist, running as a Democrat, who ousted Jolly from his congressional seat in 2016.
Jolly joined the Florida Democratic Party at what is arguably one of its most vulnerable points in years. Florida currently has no Democrats elected to statewide office, and there are now 1.2 million more registered Republicans than Democrats, according to the state’s active voter rolls. The GOP has made significant inroads in formerly Democratic strongholds in the state, such as Miami-Dade County.
The day that Jolly announced his new affiliation, the-then top Democrat in the Florida Senate, Jason Pizzo, revealed he was leaving the party, declaring that “the Democratic Party in Florida is dead.” Pizzo, a former prosecutor, has said he’ll launch his own run for governor as a candidate with no party affiliation.
On the Republican side, Jolly will face Trump-backed Rep. Byron Donalds, who is also a frequent presence on cable news as a surrogate for the president. Among the other names floated as potential GOP candidates are former Rep. Matt Gaetz and Casey DeSantis.

Little connects Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, all targeted for a total ban, or Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela, all targeted for restrictions. The reasoning stated in the order is that they all pose security threats measured by “whether each country has a significant terrorist presence within its territory, its visa-overstay rate, and its cooperation with accepting back its removable nationals”.
Visa overstays, the order elaborates, “indicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws”. Yet the latest data on overstays from Customs and Border Protection does show these countries high on the list, along with others not included.
If we sit with this list a little longer, though, with attention to the history of the world we share, we can see a different unifying logic. All of these countries are in the global south, their citizens are racialized as Black or brown and Muslim. Most have high poverty rates that hover at or above half their population. Several have recently been sites of social upheaval or horrific wars. Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan, for example, all appear on the World Food Program’s list of the world’s most dire food crises.
These facts do not, as the travel ban assumes, tell of the inherent violence of people from these nations, nor of a penchant to “disregard” law. In fact, even the data on overstays says nothing of people’s legal status. Nationals of Afghanistan, Burma, El Salvador, Haiti, Somalia, Sudan and Venezuela have long had a right to apply for temporary protected status due to the insecurity of their countries. We do not know how many of the so-called “overstayers” applied for other protections like asylum.
The poverty and insecurity of these nations are mainly an indication that they have been subject to imperialism, including US military and economic intervention and coercion.
You cannot understand the endemic violence or economic destitution that forces people to leave Haiti without attending to both the French extortion of the island nation in exchange for their freedom from enslavement, and the United States’ occupation of it. You cannot understand the mass exodus of people from Afghanistan, one of the world’s largest refugee populations, without understanding the United States’ funding of the mujahideen, or the so-called “war on terror”, that did little more than further destabilize the nation. Iran’s current regime is only possible because the US supported British efforts in destroying Iranian democracy to save British Petroleum.
US sanctions, whether in Iran or Venezuela or in Cuba, have not contributed to pressuring regime change, but rather to economic devastation and mass displacement. American shrapnel has been pulled from the bodies of Yemeni children. Since March, 250 people have been killed in US strikes on Saada and Sanaa, at least 68 of whom were detained African migrants.
Time and time again data shows that African countries such as oil-rich Equatorial Guinea and Chad, ravaged by companies such as ExxonMobil, and gold-rich Sudan, are not victims of poverty, but victims of theft. The United Nations estimates that $86bn leaves the continent each year in “illicit financial flows”, or theft through criminal activities and tax evasion. What’s more, between 1970 and 2022, countries in the global south, including those on this list, are estimated to have paid more than $2.5tn in interest alone to the benefit of the global north. Thomas Sankara, a former president of Burkina Faso, once called debt a “skillfully managed reconquest of Africa”.
The wealthiest nations in the world are causing the climate crisis that the poorest nations pay for. Climate activists estimate that governments in the global north owe $5tn each year to countries in the global south for the devastation they are causing them.
Seen from this vantage, Trump’s travel ban, which proudly cites what came to be known as the “Muslim ban” of his first administration in its opening paragraphs, is a cruel escalation of a longstanding policy of profiting off Black and brown lives and disposing of the most vulnerable among them.
In displacement camps in New York and Tijuana and the Aegean islands of Greece, I have met pharmacists, artists, DJs and journalists from many of the targeted countries. Just this week I spoke to a political activist who, forced to flee a massacre in one of the targeted countries, left her three young children behind. Speaking to me after the issuance of this ban, she worried whether she would be able to secure her asylum, which is currently being adjudicated, and whether she could ever reunify her family. Her voice broke as she said: “I wish they could understand that I never wanted to come here.”
Trump justified the ban by referencing a recent incident in which an Egyptian man in Boulder, Colorado, injured 12 people calling for the release of Israeli hostages (though notably Egypt is not on the list). That this one act justifies the banning of millions of people is absurd. This latest ban is simply another installment in a series of policies meant to “Make America white again”, following a ban on asylum and a cancellation of humanitarian parole. It comes as attacks on our immigrant students continue, particularly those who dare speak out against the US funding of Gaza’s decimation.
It is not the people of these nations that are a threat to the security of the United States. It is the United States that has long been a threat to them, robbing them of their wealth, destroying their institutions and environments, and then denying them participation in the safety built at their expense. We should be atoning for our sins, not exacerbating them.",The Guardian,"['legal status', 'visa']","['Trump', 'Afghanistan', 'Myanmar', 'Chad', 'the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea', 'Eritrea', 'Haiti', 'Iran', 'Libya', 'Somalia', 'Sudan', 'Yemen', 'Burundi', 'Cuba', 'Laos', 'Sierra Leone', 'Togo', 'Turkmenistan', 'Venezuela', 'Visa', 'United States', 'Customs and Border Protection', 'Yemen', 'Sudan', 'Somalia', 'Afghanistan', 'the World Food Program’s', 'Afghanistan', 'Burma', 'El Salvador', 'Haiti', 'Somalia', 'Sudan', 'Venezuela', 'US', 'Haiti', 'the United States', 'Afghanistan', 'the United States', 'Iran', 'US', 'British Petroleum', 'US', 'Iran', 'Venezuela', 'Cuba', 'US', 'Sanaa', 'Time', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'Chad', 'ExxonMobil', 'Sudan', 'The United Nations', '86bn', 'more than $2.5tn', 'Thomas Sankara', 'Burkina Faso', '5tn', 'Trump', 'New York', 'Tijuana', 'Greece', 'DJs', 'Trump', 'Boulder', 'Colorado', 'Egypt', 'US', 'Gaza', 'the United States', 'the United States']","Attract & Retain, Recruiting Research Talent and Key Person Dependence in Higher Education",2

Due to its remoteness and short summer season, Mongolia has long been a destination overlooked by travelers.
But as the country moves to further open up to tourism by easing its entry conditions for international visitors and upgrading its infrastructure, 2023 might just be the best time yet to get there.
Here are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now.
A growing visa-free list
With the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025.
The addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61.
The full list is here.
A new $650 million airport opens its doors
After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021.
With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism.
Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway.
A modern new museum
The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history.
With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost.
The museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge.
Mongolia’s answer to Coachella
When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind.
But that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience.
Placing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia’s eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world’s most underrated places for festival lovers.
Celebrate Naadam as it turns the century
The annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend.
While the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago.
Today, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan.
A seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town.
Try your hand at archery the Mongolian way
Mounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa.
Here, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level.
In the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport.
Learn about Mongolian calligraphy from a master
Speaking of giving life to Mongolia’s most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years.
Visit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you’re there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir’s works.
Ditch the horse for horsepower
Pair the release of Husqvarna’s new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road’s newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia.
The tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia’s famous eagle hunters.
The only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road’s tours sell out.
Winter tours offer new insights
Professional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years.
With fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience.
Rauzy’s company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy’s lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey.
Scandinavian design hits Mongolia at Yeruu Lodge
Nestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017.
With a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two pétanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers.
Completely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property’s water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use.

"Trump preparing large-scale cancellation of federal funding for California, sources say",https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-preparing-large-scale-cancellation-160108315.html,2025-06-06T20:18:27Z,,"Trump preparing large-scale cancellation of federal funding for California, sources say
The Trump administration is preparing to cancel a large swath of federal funding for California, an effort that could begin as soon as Friday, according to multiple sources.
Agencies are being told to start identifying grants the administration can withhold from California. Sources said the administration is specifically considering a full termination of federal grant funding for the University of California and California State University systems.
“No taxpayer should be forced to fund the demise of our country,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement Friday afternoon, criticizing California for its energy, immigration and other policies. “No final decisions, however, on any potential future action by the Administration have been made, and any discussion suggesting otherwise should be considered pure speculation.”
Singling out one state for massive cuts would be an unusual move, but President Donald Trump has long made Democratic-led California a target.
Just last month, he threatened to withhold federal funding from California over a transgender athlete’s participation in a sporting event — the latest example of the president trying to use funding as leverage to enact his agenda. The administration recently cut $126.4 million in flood prevention funding projects, and Trump repeatedly went after the state’s handling of devastating wildfires earlier this year. The president and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have also publicly feuded for years.
Two sources said that the administration is targeting California universities over alleged antisemitism on campus, an issue the schools have made efforts to address over the past year. The administration has already taken steps to punish Harvard and Columbia universities for similar reasons.
The UC system is the state’s third largest employer, and both systems are major engines of research in the biotechnology and medical fields, among others.
It is unclear how the school systems plan to fight back, though it is possible they could be represented by the state’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, a Democrat.
CNN has reached out to Bonta’s office, the UC system and the CSU system for comment.
California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the Science, Space and Technology Committee, said, “Trump is a bully. We’ve now heard from sources that he may be intending to cut grants to California because we didn’t vote for him and we’re Democratically inclined. … I will fight back on this. This will be immediately challenged in court.” Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, another California Democrat, said: “Whatever cruel crusade the President may announce against California, we will fight back.”
California’s state legislature appropriated $25 million in its budget for efforts to fight Trump administration policies and has spent only approximately $5 million of that so far, a source said.
GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California, who said he was unaware of the imminent grant cancellations, told CNN he recently met with university representatives who were concerned about the future of their funding.
More in Politics
“Every university, every research organization, pretty much I saw them passing through here the last two days,” Issa said.
Issa told CNN his message to the fearful university representatives was, “We’re going to advocate for essentials, but I sent them back and said come to me with specifics. Come to me with the grant and the justification, and I’ll advocate for that. But I’m not going to advocate for no cuts; you just get more money every year. That’s how we got in this problem.”

Trump announces travel ban and restrictions on 19 countries set to go into effect Monday,https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-announces-travel-ban-affecting-235257056.html,2025-06-04T23:52:57Z,,"Trump announces travel ban and restrictions on 19 countries set to go into effect Monday
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term, announcing that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions.
The ban takes effect Monday at 12:01 a.m., a cushion that may avoid the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice in 2017. Trump, who signaled plans for a new ban upon taking office in January, appears to be on firmer ground this time after the Supreme Court sided with him.
Some, but not all, 12 countries also appeared on the list of banned countries in Trump's first term. The new ban includes Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
There will be heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
In a video released on social media, Trump tied the new ban to Sunday's terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The suspect in the attack is from Egypt, a country that is not on Trump’s restricted list. The Department of Homeland Security says he overstayed a tourist visa.
Trump said some countries had “deficient” screening and vetting or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. His findings rely extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of visa overstays of tourists, business visitors and students who arrive by air and sea, singling out countries with high percentages of remaining after their visas expired.
“We don't want them,” Trump said.
The inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who have worked to resettle its people. The ban makes exceptions for Afghans on Special Immigrant Visas, generally people who worked most closely with the U.S. government during the two-decade-long war there.
Afghanistan was also one of the largest sources of resettled refugees, with about 14,000 arrivals in a 12-month period through September 2024. Trump suspended refugee resettlement his first day in office.
“To include Afghanistan — a nation whose people stood alongside American service members for 20 years — is a moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold,” said Shawn VanDiver, president and board chairman of #AfghanEvac.
Trump wrote that Afghanistan “lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.” He also cited its visa overstay rates.
Haiti, which avoided the travel ban during Trump’s first term, was also included for high overstay rates and large numbers who came to the U.S. illegally. Haitians continue to flee poverty, hunger and political instability deepens while police and a U.N.-backed mission fight a surge in gang violence, with armed men controlling at least 85% of its capital, Port-au-Prince.

“Haiti lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and dissemination of law enforcement information necessary to ensure its nationals do not undermine the national security of the United States,” Trump wrote.
The Iranian government government offered no immediate reaction to being included. The Trump administration called it a “state sponsor of terrorism,” barring visitors except for those already holding visas or coming into the U.S. on special visas America issues for minorities facing persecution.
Other Mideast nations on the list — Libya, Sudan and Yemen — all face ongoing civil strife and territory overseen by opposing factions. Sudan has an active war, while Yemen’s war is largely stalemated and Libyan forces remain armed.
International aid groups and refugee resettlement organizations roundly condemned the new ban. ""This policy is not about national security — it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,"" said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America.
The travel ban results from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the departments of State and Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence to compile a report on “hostile attitudes” toward the U.S. and whether entry from certain countries represented a national security risk.
During his first term, Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries — Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.
It was one of the most chaotic and confusing moments of his young presidency. Travelers from those nations were either barred from getting on their flights to the U.S. or detained at U.S. airports after they landed. They included students and faculty as well as businesspeople, tourists and people visiting friends and family.
The order, often referred to as the “Muslim ban” or the “travel ban,” was retooled amid legal challenges, until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.
The ban affected various categories of travelers and immigrants from Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya, plus North Koreans and some Venezuelan government officials and their families.
Trump and others have defended the initial ban on national security grounds, arguing it was aimed at protecting the country and not founded on anti-Muslim bias. However, the president had called for an explicit ban on Muslims during his first campaign for the White House.

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to pause a court order to reinstate Education Department employees who were fired in mass layoffs as part of President Donald Trump’s plan to dismantle the agency.
The Justice Department’s emergency appeal to the high court said U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston exceeded his authority last month when he issued a preliminary injunction reversing the layoffs of nearly 1,400 people and putting the broader plan on hold.

The top law enforcement officials from 19 states filed a federal lawsuit after the Republican president signed the executive order in March, arguing that its provisions would step on states’ power to set their own election rules and that the executive branch had no such authority. In a filing supporting that argument, a bipartisan group of former secretaries of state said Trump’s directive would upend the system established by the Constitution’s Elections Clause, which gives states and Congress control over how elections are run. They said the order seeks to “unilaterally coronate the President as the country’s chief election policymaker and administrator.” If the court does not halt the order, they argued, “the snowball of executive overreach will grow swiftly and exponentially.” Trump’s election directive was part of a flurry of executive orders he has issued in the opening months of his second term, many of which have drawn swift legal challenges. It follows years of him falsely claiming that his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election was due to widespread fraud and an election year in which he and other Republicans promoted the notion that large numbers of noncitizens threatened the integrity of U.S. elections. In fact, voting by noncitizens is rare and, when caught, can lead to felony charges and deportation. Trump’s executive order would require voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections, prohibit mail or absentee ballots from being counted if they are received after Election Day, set new rules for voting equipment and prohibit non-U.S. citizens from being able to donate in certain elections. It also would condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the strict ballot deadline. The hearing Friday in U.S. District Court in Boston comes in one of three lawsuits filed against the executive order. One is from Oregon and Washington, where elections are conducted almost entirely by mail and ballots received after Election Day are counted as long as they are postmarked by then. The provision that would create a proof-of-citizenship requirement for federal elections already has been halted in a lawsuit filed by voting and civil rights groups and national Democratic organizations. In that case, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the judge said the president’s attempt to use a federal agency to enact a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voting usurped the power of states and Congress, which at the time was considering legislation that would do just that. That bill, called the SAVE Act, passed the U.S. House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Trump’s executive order said its intent was to ensure “free, fair and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion.” The Justice Department, in arguing against the motion by the attorneys general for a preliminary injunction, said the president is within his rights to direct agencies to carry out federal voting laws.

The plane manufacturer has secured a deal – agreed in principle last month – with the US Department of Justice (DoJ), which includes paying $444.5m to the families of those who died in the crashes of 737 Max jetliners in 2018 and 2019.
The company has also agreed to invest $445m towards improving its compliance, safety and quality programmes, according to an agreement signed by the DoJ and Boeing last week, detailed in a US court filing. On top of this, Boeing has already paid $243m of a $487.2m criminal penalty agreed in 2021.
Sanjiv Singh, the counsel for family members of some of the victims of the plane crash in Indonesia in 2018, told the BBC the deal allowed Boeing to “sidestep true criminal accountability”.
The aerospace company has previously said it was “deeply sorry” for the families’ losses and was committed to honouring the memories of the victims by pursuing broad and deep changes within the business.
If the deal is approved by a federal judge, the fraud charge in the criminal case against Boeing will be dismissed.
Two Boeing planes crashed off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019. Many relatives of the victims have spent years pursuing a public trial, more severe penalties for Boeing and the prosecution of former company officials.
In October 2018, 189 people were killed when Lion Air flight 610 fell into the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa airport, which killed 157 people.
Both incidents were linked to faulty flight control systems. The second crash prompted the grounding of the 737 Max plane for almost two years.
The company avoided prosecution in 2021 after it reached a settlement with the US DoJ, which included the $243.6m fine.
However, last year prosecutors argued that Boeing had violated the terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Last July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring what may have been a lengthy public trial.
However, in December, the US district judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worth rejected the deal. The judge said the diversity, equity and inclusion policies in government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in picking an independent monitor to oversee Boeing’s compliance with the agreement. Boeing was approached for comment.
A company spokesperson told the BBC regarding the new agreement with the DoJ: “Boeing is committed to complying with its obligations under this resolution, which include a substantial additional fine and commitments to further institutional improvements and investments.”",The Guardian,['compliance'],"['Boeing', '1.1bn', '812', 'the US Department of Justice (DoJ', '444.5', 'Max', '445', 'DoJ', 'Boeing', 'US', 'Boeing', '243', '487.2', 'Sanjiv Singh', 'Indonesia', 'BBC', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', 'Indonesia', 'Ethiopia', 'Boeing', 'Lion Air', 'Indonesia', 'Ethiopian Airlines', 'Addis Ababa', 'Max', 'the US DoJ', '243.6', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', 'US', 'Reed O’Connor', 'Fort Worth', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', 'BBC', 'DoJ', 'Boeing']",,0

The nighttime assault lasted for hours and killed three emergency responders in the capital Kyiv, according to authorities. The barrage included 407 drones and 44 ballistic and cruise missiles, Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said. Ukrainian forces said they shot down about 30 of the cruise missiles and up to 200 of the drones. The latest Russian attack came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a while” before pulling them apart and pursuing peace. Trump’s comments were a remarkable detour from his often-stated appeals to stop the war and signaled he may be giving up on recent peace efforts. Ukrainian cities have come under regular bombardment since Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022. The attacks have killed more than 12,000 civilians, according to the United Nations. “Russia doesn`t change its stripes,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy, as well as the Ukrainian Interior Ministry and the general prosecutor’s office, said three emergency workers were killed in Kyiv while responding to the Russian strikes. “They were working under fire to help people,” the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The war has continued unabated even as a U.S.-led diplomatic push for a settlement has brought two rounds of direct peace talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine. The negotiations delivered no significant breakthroughs, however, and the sides remain far apart on their terms for an end to the fighting. Ukraine has offered an unconditional 30-day ceasefire and a meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian leader Vladimir Putin to break the deadlock. But the Kremlin has effectively rejected a truce and hasn’t budged from its demands. “The Kremlin continues efforts to falsely portray Russia as willing to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, despite Russia’s repeated refusal to offer any concessions,” the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said late Thursday. Putin said in a phone call with Trump earlier this week that he would respond to Ukraine’s daring long-range attack on Russian air bases on Sunday. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed it had aimed at Ukrainian military targets with “long-range precision weapons” and successfully struck arms depots, drone factories and repair facilities, among other targets. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said the attacks demonstrated key differences between Russia and Ukraine. “The difference … is that Ukraine hits legitimate military targets—such as aircraft equipped to bomb our children. Russia targets residential areas, civilians, and critical infrastructure,” Sybiha wrote on X. “Putting Ukraine and Russia on equal footing is unacceptable.” Russia also reports drone attacks In Russia, air defenses shot down 10 Ukrainian drones heading toward the capital early Friday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. Flights at Moscow airports were temporarily suspended during the night as a precaution.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia bombarded six regions of Ukraine in one of its largest aerial attacks of the three-year war, Ukrainian officials said Friday. The nighttime assault lasted for hours and killed three emergency responders in the capital Kyiv, according to authorities. The barrage included 407 drones and 44 ballistic and cruise missiles, Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said. Ukrainian forces said they shot down about 30 of the cruise missiles and up to 200 of the drones. The latest Russian attack came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a while” before pulling them apart and pursuing peace. Trump’s comments were a remarkable detour from his often-stated appeals to stop the war and signaled he may be giving up on recent peace efforts. Ukrainian cities have come under regular bombardment since Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022. The attacks have killed more than 12,000 civilians, according to the United Nations. “Russia doesn`t change its stripes,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy, as well as the Ukrainian Interior Ministry and the general prosecutor’s office, said three emergency workers were killed in Kyiv while responding to the Russian strikes. “They were working under fire to help people,” the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The war has continued unabated even as a U.S.-led diplomatic push for a settlement has brought two rounds of direct peace talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine. The negotiations delivered no significant breakthroughs, however, and the sides remain far apart on their terms for an end to the fighting. Ukraine has offered an unconditional 30-day ceasefire and a meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian leader Vladimir Putin to break the deadlock. But the Kremlin has effectively rejected a truce and hasn’t budged from its demands. “The Kremlin continues efforts to falsely portray Russia as willing to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, despite Russia’s repeated refusal to offer any concessions,” the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said late Thursday. Putin said in a phone call with Trump earlier this week that he would respond to Ukraine’s daring long-range attack on Russian air bases on Sunday. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed it had aimed at Ukrainian military targets with “long-range precision weapons” and successfully struck arms depots, drone factories and repair facilities, among other targets. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said the attacks demonstrated key differences between Russia and Ukraine. “The difference … is that Ukraine hits legitimate military targets—such as aircraft equipped to bomb our children. Russia targets residential areas, civilians, and critical infrastructure,” Sybiha wrote on X. “Putting Ukraine and Russia on equal footing is unacceptable.” Russia also reports drone attacks In Russia, air defenses shot down 10 Ukrainian drones heading toward the capital early Friday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. Flights at Moscow airports were temporarily suspended during the night as a precaution. Ukrainian drones also targeted three other regions of Russia, authorities said, damaging apartment buildings and industrial plants. Three people were injured, officials said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 174 Ukrainian drones over 13 regions early Friday. It added that three Ukrainian Neptune missiles were also shot down over the Black Sea.

Judge temporarily blocks Trump admin's entry ban for international Harvard students,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harvard-sues-trump-admin-foreign-student-ban-describes-government-vendetta,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 22:33:41 -0400",A federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked a Trump admin ban on international students entering Harvard hours after the school filed an amended complaint in court.,"A federal judge late Thursday blocked the Trump administration's decision to ban foreign students from attending Harvard University.
The decision from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs came hours after the Ivy League filed an amended complaint in court, arguing that the administration's move was unconstitutional. Over 7,000 students at Harvard hold F-1 or J-1 visas. Without those certifications, they can’t study, teach, or conduct research in the U.S. The ban also affects their families and dependents.
According to the university's lawsuit, the proclamation ""lacks any lawful basis"" and does not apply to any broad group of immigrants.
""Nonimmigrants may enter the country unabated, as long as they do not attend Harvard,"" the complaint states.
TRUMP IS DOWN BUT NOT OUT IN COURT BATTLE OVER HARVARD'S FOREIGN STUDENT VISAS
Harvard argues the measure does not target a ""class of aliens,"" but instead singles out Harvard-bound students, calling it a ""government vendetta"" rather than a national security measure.
In April, a federal task force led by the Trump administration sent the university a list of demands, including ideological screening of students and faculty, ""viewpoint diversity"" quotas in hiring and admissions, and punishment of student activist groups.
The administration also demanded Harvard report foreign funding sources and allow government oversight of internal policies.
When Harvard refused, the government froze $2.2 billion in research funding. Trump later posted on Truth Social that Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status if it continued to ""push radical ideology."" In another post, he accused the school of hiring ""woke, Radical Left, idiots"" and claimed it was no longer a great university.
TRUMP ACCUSES HARVARD OF BEING 'VERY SLOW' TO TURN OVER FOREIGN STUDENT INFO
The Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard’s SEVP (Student and Exchange Visitor Program) certification a few days later, which allows the school to sponsor international students, but a federal judge blocked that decision.
Harvard now says that the administration is using Trump's proclamation to do what the courts have already stopped.
The government claims Harvard failed to provide complete information on its international student population, but the university says it has submitted all records required by law and that the revocation is a pretext.
""There is no lawful justification for the government’s unprecedented actions,"" the university said in Thursday's filing.
The amended complaint also reveals that Harvard is being represented by Robert Hur, the former special counsel who interviewed former President Joe Biden.
DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded to the lawsuit by saying it ""seeks to kneecap the President’s constitutionally vested powers under Article II. It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students.
""The Trump administration is committed to restoring common sense to our student visa system; no lawsuit, this or any other, is going to change that. We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.""

International students now face uncertainty as the legal battle wages on. Jing, a 23-year-old Chinese graduate student interning in Asia, told The Associated Press: ""It is tiring; we all feel numb now.""
Another student, Yonas Nuguse from Ethiopia, who was accepted after surviving war and a school shutdown, also told The AP, ""I hope the situation is temporary and I can enroll on time.""

Broader campaign spending with less public disclosure still looms in Louisiana

The Louisiana Legislature is advancing legislation that would allow politicians to spend their campaign funds on a broader group of expenses, including country club memberships and gym fees, while providing less transparency about who provided the money.
House Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Wright, R-Covington, is the sponsor of House Bill 693 and said several elected officials and campaign finance experts had input on the proposal.
The 101-page legislation makes “little to no change in substantive law” and mostly brings “practices that have been followed for decades” into the state code, Wright said at a Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee meeting Wednesday.
Louisiana’s Ethics Administration David Bordelon, who is in charge of enforcing the state’s campaign finance laws, had a different take. While the legislation reinforces some of the state ethics board’s guidance on campaign finance, it also “undoes” previous instruction the board has issued about political spending, he said at the same meeting.
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry is the driving force behind this massive campaign finance rewrite. Two private attorneys for Landry, Stephen Gelé and Charles Spies, helped draft the proposal.
Gelé and Spies are representing the governor in charges he faces from the ethics board over failing to disclose trips he took on a political donor’s private plane to Hawaii in 2021. That case isn’t affected by Wright’s legislation.
Gele said the bill is meant to correct over-enforcement of campaign finance laws. The ethics board’s aggressive posture has impeded on the public’s right to free speech and political expression, he said.
“That right is burdened when you have to pay lawyers and accountants significant amounts of money to make sure you are complying with the law or to fight ethics complaints over the law,” Gele told lawmakers in the committee hearing.
Landry, as governor, stands to benefit more from the loosening of campaign finance restrictions than any other elected official in the state. He has more money in his campaign accounts, and his reelection campaign in 2027 will likely be the most expensive. YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.
Wright’s legislation makes it easier for politicians to raise money and curbs existing public disclosure of that fundraising. It also explicitly permits politicians to spend their campaign cash on expenses the ethics board has been scrutinizing.
Spending more freely
As one example, the bill would enshrine the right to spend campaign money on “events related to the Mardi Gras celebration in Washington D.C.,” a five-day celebration that takes place every year in January. Lawmakers have complained in recent months that the ethics board was questioning their Washington Mardi Gras expenses. But who the board might be scrutinizing hasn’t been disclosed publicly because its investigations are confidential.
Senate committee members pushed back on other carve outs for campaign spending in the bill. On Wednesday, the committee removed a provision that would have allowed political funds to go toward paying parts of candidates’ home mortgages and utility bills.
They also tweaked language in the bill permitting politicians to cover their country club dues, gym memberships and Louisiana Mardi Gras krewe fees with campaign funds. YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.
The Senate committee replaced the words “country club” and “health club” with “private club” in the legislation. They also added a clause requiring politicians who want to use their money for club memberships to produce “a preponderance of evidence that the expense was not for personal use.”
This means dues for country clubs, gyms and Mardi Gras krewes could still be covered with campaign cash, but the politician might be asked to justify the expense.
“Be very careful about using campaign funds for subsidizing your lifestyle,” said Sen. Greg Miller, R-Norco, who offered the amendment at the committee meeting. “I don’t think we want to encourage that.”
Less disclosure on campaign spending
While allowing candidates to spend more freely, the bill includes provisions that would lessen the amount of information available to the public about political donations and spending.
Wright’s legislation raises the dollar-amount threshold at which a political donation or expense has to be included on a public campaign finance report more than 20 times.
For example, the current law requires campaign contributions and expenditures that are over $200 and given within 20 days ahead of an election to be reported on a public campaign finance report within 48 hours. The proposed law would increase that threshold to $5,000.
Individuals who are not political candidates or explicitly with a political committee could also spend money on an election without disclosing contributions they accepted for the politicking under the legislation.
These nontraditional political campaigns would also only have to disclose campaign spending if it was over $1,000 and included “express advocacy.” In the bill, “express advocacy” is defined as political communication that features phrases like “vote for” and “defeat” or that includes the candidate’s name and the office they are seeking.
More subtle campaign expenditures – those that don’t mention an election or involve public advertising – wouldn’t have to be disclosed by sources that aren’t overtly political.
Initially, this legislation also eliminated all campaign finance reporting requirements for ballot proposition campaigns, such as state constitutional amendments and tax millages. Wright backed off those changes when they proved unpopular.
The bill needs at least three more votes to pass, including from the full House and Senate. Those must be taken before the legislative session ends Thursday.

Ukraine's massive drone attack deep inside Russia shows how the battlefield has changed,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/russia/russia-ukraine-war-drone-strikes-bases-uavs-civilian-attacks-rcna210559,"Tue, 03 Jun 2025 20:30:33 GMT","Dubbed operation “Spiderweb,” Ukraine’s audacious drone attack on Russian air bases has brought the use of unmanned aerial vehicles sharply into focus.","Dubbed operation “Spiderweb,” Ukraine’s audacious drone attack Sunday on four Russian air bases — one of them deep inside Siberia — has brought the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in modern warfare sharply into focus.
While accounts differ on the extent of the damage caused by the drones, which were reportedly smuggled to the perimeter of the bases in the backs of trucks, Ukraine’s security service, the SBU, put the estimated cost to the Kremlin at $7 billion. Russia has said little about the attacks, although its Defense Ministry acknowledged in a statement that some planes caught fire.
The strikes have highlighted the increasing importance of drones for both Russia and Ukraine in the war, which entered its fourth year in February. And experts told NBC News that both sides are increasingly turning to cheap, commercially available first-person view or quadcopter drones that can often be purchased from online retailers and easily converted into deadly weapons — simple technology that is having a huge impact on the battlefield in Ukraine and farther afield.
Their use is “going to become very, very common,” Robert Lee, a senior fellow at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank, said in an interview.
Drones were used when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime was overthrown in December, he said. “They’re here ... because they’re ubiquitous, because they are quite useful, and they’re demonstrating that every day in Ukraine,” he said.
“There’s no doubt that they’re going to be used by all sorts of groups, whether it’s criminal groups or terrorist groups, and they pose a quite significant threat,” he said, adding, “I think we’re a little bit behind the power curve on this and actually getting ready to counter them.”
Targeting civilians
Anastasia Pavlenko, 23, said she noticed a drone “hunting” her as she was riding her bicycle to a cosmetology appointment in Antonivka, a rural community in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region.
“It took off, followed me, and I zigzagged on the bike,” Pavlenko, the mother of two, said of the attack in September, adding that a second drone suddenly appeared with “a shell attached to it.”
Despite her best attempts to escape, she said, the second drone dropped the shell “right on my head,” and it bounced down onto her thigh and exploded on the asphalt next to her.
“Blood was coming from my neck, and there were fragments under my ribs,” Pavlenko said, adding she somehow managed to keep cycling and take cover under a bridge, where she screamed for help until she started to lose consciousness.
“I just had a small purse, shorts, a T-shirt and long loose hair, so it was clear that I was a girl,” she said, adding that she was not wearing military colors or carrying any weapons when she was hit.
Doctors were unable to remove shrapnel fragments from her neck, ribs or leg, she said, adding she had been unable to return to work at her coffee shop because she “can’t handle physical stress.”
Russia has repeatedly denied that it targets civilians in Ukraine. The Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about whether its forces or groups allied with them had used commercial drones to carry out strikes on nonmilitary targets in the Kherson region.
But drone video posted on a Russian military blogger’s Telegram channel appears to show the attack on Pavlenko.
NBC News was able to determine that the video was taken in late September and geolocate it to a specific section of a road in Antonivka where Pavlenko said everything went dark.
‘Hunted from above’
The strike on Pavlenko was one of at least 45 Russian attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine from June to December that Human Rights Watch has documented.
Belkis Wille, an associate director in the nongovernmental organization’s Crisis, Conflict and Arms Division, said it was the first time it had “ever documented the use of these commercial quadcopter drones used at wide scale in a precise campaign to target civilians.”
The majority of the attacks were carried out with modified commercial drones manufactured by the Chinese companies DJI and Autel Robotics, according to a report co-authored by Wille and released Monday, called “Hunted from Above: Russia’s Use of Drones to Attack Civilians in Kherson, Ukraine.”
Lee, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, analyzed pictures of some of the drones posted to Telegram channels associated with bloggers affiliated with Russia’s military.
Some were “all homemade” munitions, he said, adding that some of the parts, including a plastic tail, could be created with 3D printers. Another photo showed parts of a rocket-propelled grenade attached to a drone with duct tape, Lee said.
But despite their DIY appearance, he said, “you have a guided weapon that operates at significantly greater distances, and this can be operated at a very tactical level, in a very cheap way.”
Both Autel Robotics and DJI have policies on their websites that explicitly prohibit using their drones in combat. Autel Robotics say all customers are required to sign a “compliance commitment letter” and “end-user statement” to that effect. DJI says that, as part of its terms of use, users “agree not to: attempt to ‘hack,’ ‘crack,’ reverse engineer or modify the product.”
Both companies stopped direct sales in Russia when the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, and DJI says it stopped direct sales in Ukraine. Autel Robotics says it added geofencing restrictions “to prevent the operation” of Autel drones “in Russia, Ukraine, and other embargoed regions.”
DJI did not respond to a question about geofencing capabilities of its drones. It said in a statement that it “does not manufacture military-grade products, nor does it market or sell its products for use in combat,” and that it strongly opposes “any outside attempts to modify our products for combat.”
“Just like any global consumer electronics company selling off-the-shelf products, we cannot control how our products are used once purchased,” the statement added. “However, we have taken proactive steps to mitigate the use of our products for harm.”
Autel Robotics did not respond to a request for additional comment.
Since Russian forces invaded it in February 2022, Ukraine has also been retrofitting cheap and readily available commercial drones so they can be deployed on the battlefield.
While Russia has accused Ukrainian forces of targeting civilians, HRW has said there was no verifiable evidence of their doing so.
Changing warfare
Lee and Wille said the availability of cheap, easy-to-use drones is changing the nature of warfare, making once-expensive strikes far easier to pull off. They also expressed concerns that criminal organizations, like Mexican drug cartels, were able to use them for nefarious purposes, too.
“They’re changing the nature of the fight,” said Lee, adding that in the future, artificial intelligence could lead to a point “where one pilot can operate maybe four or five UAVs at a time.”
He added that AI could “replace some of those targeting functions where AI can locate a target on its own,” with a pilot operating it.
For Wille, the fear is that others will be able to copy the methods used by Russians and Ukrainians to create drones “cheap and easy to operate” and subject them to similar attacks.

Taiwan is offering aid to its lone Central American diplomatic ally, Guatemala, as it guards against efforts by China to win away its last remaining partners
TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan is offering aid to its lone Central American diplomatic ally, Guatemala, as it attempts to stave off efforts by China to win away its last remaining partners.
During a meeting Thursday with his visiting Guatemalan counterpart Bernardo Arevalo, President Lai Ching-te said the two countries would “strengthen exchanges and cooperation as well as scholarship programs for young people, provide training for high-tech and information and communication talents.so as to push forward prosperity and development.”
Arevalo identified public health, education, agriculture, technology and infrastructure as key areas where Guatemala was seeking to increase its capacity.
”In the future, we shall continue to strengthen bilateral relations based on the solid foundations built in the past,” the president said.
Such assistance is key as Taiwan attempts to hold the line against advances by China, which typically offers big-ticket items such as highways, railways and stadiums to lure away Taiwan's allies, often expecting repayment at market rates.
Winning over Taiwan's allies brings China closer to its goal of diplomatically isolating Taiwan in order to demoralize the population and aid Beijing in its goal of “peacefully unifying” with the island it claims as its own territory.
Taiwan's offerings tend to be more modest and pragmatic, largely because it is a parliamentary democracy where all such spending must be approved by the legislature. It also offers the model of a functioning democracy in a world increasingly leaning toward hardline authoritarian regimes.
Still, China has steadily reduced the number of Taiwan's diplomatic allies to just 12 after launching campaigns in the Caribbean and Central America to win over countries such as Peru.",ABC News,['legislature'],"['Taiwan', 'Guatemala', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'Guatemala', 'China', 'TAIPEI', 'Taiwan', 'Taiwan', 'Guatemala', 'China', 'Guatemalan', 'Bernardo Arevalo', 'Lai Ching-te', 'Arevalo', 'Guatemala', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'Beijing', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'Peru']",,0
Human Rights Watch Calls for War Crime Investigation Into Deadly US Bombing,https://truthout.org/articles/human-rights-watch-calls-for-war-crime-investigation-into-deadly-us-bombing/,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 19:53:36 +0000",US airstrikes on the Ras Isa oil port in Yemen last April killed 84 people and wounded more than 150 others.,"The April bombing of a Yemeni oil port by U.S. forces that killed and wounded hundreds of civilians and disrupted the delivery of lifesaving aid to one of the world’s most war-torn nations was “an apparent war crime” that should be investigated, a leading international human rights group said Wednesday.
On April 17, a series of U.S. airstrikes destroyed the Ras Isa oil Port on the Red Sea north of Hodeidah, killing 84 people and wounding more than 150 others, according to first responders, local officials, and a probe by the U.K.-based independent monitor Airwars.
The bombings were part of the Trump administration’s response to resistance by Houthi rebels to Israel’s annihilation of Gaza, which has included ballistic missile strikes targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping related to the key U.S. ally.
“U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years,” U.S. Central Command said at the time, adding that “this strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen.”
However, the first four U.S. strikes on the port happened while workers were still on the job. Officials said first responders including paramedics and rescue workers who rushed to the scene were killed in subsequent strikes, known as “double taps” in military parlance.
Human Rights Watch said Wednesday that of the strikes’ victims, “49 were people who worked at the port, several were truck drivers, and two were civil defense personnel. Others may have been workers’ family members. Three were identified as children.”
“The list contained one person identified as a ‘colonel,’ but who was not necessarily a military member,” HRW continued. “The Hodeidah branch of the government-owned Yemen Oil Company posted photographs of 49 employees they said were killed.”
In new investigation, @hrw finds that the US attack on Ras Issa Port in #Yemen in April is an apparent war crime. The port is critical as an entry point for aid + commercial imports. According to @airwars, at least 84 civilians were killed, 150 injured.https://t.co/97CksDJPp3

HRW Yemen and Bahrain researcher Niku Jafarnia said Wednesday that “the U.S. government’s decision to strike Ras Isa Port, a critical entry point for aid in Yemen, while hundreds of workers were present demonstrates a callous disregard for civilians’ lives.”
“At a time when the majority of Yemenis don’t have adequate access to food and water, the attack’s impact on humanitarian aid could be enormous, particularly after Trump administration aid cutbacks,” Jafarnia added.
U.S. airstrikes on Yemen, which averaged around a dozen per month during the final year of the Biden administration, soared to more than 60 in March under President Donald Trump, according to the Yemen Data Project.
Other recent U.S. massacres in Yemen include a series of March 15 strikes on residential areas in the capital Sanaa that killed at least 53 people including numerous women and children, an April 20 strike on the Farwah market in the Shuub neighborhood of the capital Sanaa that killed at least 12 people and wounded 30 others, and the April 28 bombing of a detention center for African migrants in the city of Sa’ada that left at least 68 people dead and dozens more wounded.
These strikes came after President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth loosened the U.S. military’s rules of engagement to allow the bombing of a wider range of targets and people. In March, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon’s Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Office and Civilian Protection Center of Excellence, which was established during the Biden administration, would be closed.
Hegseth — who has supported pardons for convicted U.S. war criminals — lamented during his Senate confirmation hearing that “restrictive rules of engagement” have “made it more difficult to defeat our enemies,” who “should get bullets, not attorneys,” according to his 2024 book The War on Warriors.
The U.S has been bombing and conducting ground raids in Yemen since the beginning of the so-called War on Terror launched by the George W. Bush administration in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Airwars says hundreds of Yemeni civilians have been killed in 181 declared U.S. actions since 2002.
In 2015, then-President Barack Obama announced that U.S. forces would provide “logistical and intelligence support” to the Saudi-led coalition intervening in the ongoing Yemeni civil war on behalf of the national government as it battled Iran-backed Houthi rebels. That assistance included refueling Saudi and Emirati warplanes that were bombing Yemeni targets and killing thousands of civilians while a blockade fueled famine and illness that claimed hundred of thousands of lives.
“The U.S. has been implicated in laws-of-war violations in Yemen since it began ‘targeted killing operations’ in 2002 against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,” HRW said Wednesday. “Those strikes continued until at least 2019 and killed many civilians, including 12 people attending a wedding in 2013. To Human Rights Watch’s knowledge, the U.S. has never acknowledged or provided compensation for civilians harmed in this or other unlawful attacks.”
The Pentagon has only acknowledged 13 civilian deaths caused by U.S. military action in Yemen since 2002. The Trump administration has been especially tight-lipped about civilian casualties resulting from its operations, a stance some critics have called ironic given that top administration officials including Hegseth discussed highly sensitive plans for attacking Yemen on a Signal group chat in which a journalist was inadvertently included.
“The recent U.S. airstrikes in Yemen are just the latest causing civilian harm in the country over the past two decades,” Jafarnia said. “The Trump administration should reverse past U.S. practice and provide prompt compensation to those unlawfully harmed.”

Social issues could complicate the GOP’s attempt to keep the Virginia governorship,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/earle-sears-record-social-issues-complicates-bid-follow-youngkins-path-rcna210707,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 09:00:41 GMT","Winsome Earle-Sears, the de facto Republican nominee in the Virginia governor’s race, has built the early stages of her campaign around being Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s partner.","Winsome Earle-Sears, the all-but-certain Republican nominee in the Virginia governor’s race this fall, has built the early stages of her campaign around being Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s partner.
Earle-Sears, the state’s lieutenant governor, has largely attempted to frame her candidacy as an extension of the current administration, an attempt to replicate the term-limited governor’s path to victory in the blue-leaning state four years ago.
“Together, we’ve fought for parents, backed the blue, and delivered real results for Virginians. Now, it’s time to keep that momentum going,” Earle-Sears, referring to Youngkin, wrote in a Facebook post earlier this year.
But there has been notable daylight between Earle-Sears and Youngkin on several fronts, particularly on social issues, complicating her strategy to follow in the footsteps of her more popular governing partner.
“She is definitely trying to have it all ways,” said a Republican operative in Virginia, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about Earle-Sears.
Most prominently, Earle-Sears has made clear she is not fully aligned with Youngkin on a pair of hot-button social issues: same-sex marriage and abortion rights.
Last year, Youngkin signed legislation protecting marriage equality in Virginia. But Earle-Sears left a handwritten note on the bill stating she was “morally opposed” to the legislation.
Following the bill’s passage through both chambers of the Legislature, Earle-Sears wrote on the physical copy, “As the Lt. Governor, I recognize and respect my constitutional obligation to adhere to the procedures laid out in the Constitution of Virginia. However, I remain morally opposed to the contents of HB174 as passed by the General Assembly.”
Earle-Sears doubled down on separating herself from Youngkin’s position on the issue in a recent interview, telling a local news outlet in Richmond last month that she was “fine” with civil unions but refused to say she supported same-sex marriage.
She’s also out of step with Youngkin’s positioning on abortion rights.
In 2023, Youngkin proposed a 15-week ban on abortion in the state, which included exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother, in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to help the GOP carve out a less severe “consensus” bill restricting reproductive rights.
For her part, Earle-Sears has supported a ban at six weeks, or when fetal cardiac activity is detected — a point at which most women don’t even know they are pregnant — and with fewer exceptions.
While she got behind Youngkin’s 15-week ban in 2023, she left another handwritten note on a measure passed by the Legislature earlier this year to send to voters a proposed constitutional amendment that would enshrine the state’s abortion protections.
“I am morally opposed to this bill; no protection for the child,” she wrote. She has also in the past called abortion “genocide” and vowed to “do everything in my power” to end abortion in Virginia.
Youngkin managed to shift the focus elsewhere during his 2021 campaign — and has largely had to continue doing so as governor, as he’s dealt with a Democratic-controlled Legislature. But the fact that he staked out middle ground on social issues has only further highlighted Earle-Sears’ more conservative positioning.
In addition, Earle-Sears has faced criticism for her approach to the plight of federal workers in Virginia who have been affected by President Donald Trump’s moves to shrink the size of government via the Department of Government Efficiency.
She praised those efforts earlier this year, saying she was “glad” Trump was “getting to the bottom” of alleged waste and fraud in the federal government. While she has often pointed to the Youngkin administration’s investments in the private sector of the Virginia economy as a reason workers need not worry, she has also said she would help Trump “get the job done” on the issue. And she downplayed the federal layoffs at an event in March, saying, “The media is making it out to be a huge, huge thing — and I don’t understand why.”
Youngkin, on the other hand, has said he wants to “cushion” his state’s economy from the effects of DOGE and earlier this year was frequently touting a website his administration created that effectively serves as a job board — while also praising DOGE.
Earle-Sears’ positions stand in contrast to the relative political middle ground Youngkin has famously staked out in Virginia — efforts that have contributed to a record of strong approval ratings for the Republican governor in a state that Kamala Harris carried last year by about 6 percentage points.
Last month, though, a Roanoke College poll found a 44% favorability rating for Youngkin among registered voters, versus 50% who view him unfavorably — his worst showing in that particular poll, and a possible indication that the broader GOP brand could be facing trouble in Virginia.
But Earle-Sears had lower marks, with only 32% viewing her favorably and 48% saying they had an unfavorable view. Another 20% of respondents said they had no opinion of her. And the poll showed Democrat Abigail Spanberger leading Earle-Sears in the governor’s race by 17 points.
Political operatives in the state from both parties told NBC News these notable departures by Earle-Sears — particularly on social issues — risk turning off large chunks of voters in the political center that she’d need to hold together Youngkin’s winning coalition from four years ago.
“What’s her core promise to the voter? It should be pretty simple: ‘Things are going good. Let’s keep it going’ — but she gets distracted,” the Republican operative said.
Democratic Party of Virginia spokesperson Maggie Amjad said these issues, and others, show that Earle-Sears “is a far-right candidate with a long record that’s out of step with Virginians.”
Representatives for both Earle-Sears and Youngkin downplayed any differences in their political views and emphasized that Youngkin’s strengths as governor still extended to Earle-Sears and other Republicans on the ballot in Virginia this fall.
“The media’s obsession with creating division where there isn’t any won’t change the fact that the Youngkin-Sears Administration is one of the most popular in Virginia’s history — that’s no accident,” Earle-Sears campaign press secretary Peyton Vogel said in an email to NBC News. “They share a commitment to common-sense leadership, individual liberty, and getting government out of the way. Winsome has been a vital part of this administration, and will continue to bring ideas to the table that better the lives of Virginians across the Commonwealth as Governor just as she has during her time as Lieutenant Governor.”
Justin Discigil, a spokesperson for Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC, said in an email that “Youngkin has delivered for Virginians with record tax relief, record job growth, and record investments in education, law enforcement, behavioral health, and other shared priorities,” and that Earle-Sears “and all Virginia Republicans have a record to run on with proven results.”
A challenging political landscape
Earle-Sears’ positioning on social issues and DOGE could further complicate what had already emerged as an uphill climb for Republicans to keep control of the governorship.
Earle-Sears has already faced a torrent of criticism for running an undisciplined campaign. And Spanberger, her opponent, is widely seen as a strong candidate who has won several competitive House races.
The GOP also faces historical headwinds: In 11 of the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial races, voters elected the candidate of the party out of power in the White House.
Republicans view Youngkin’s 2021 victory as the product of a unique candidate who was able to benefit from the anger and fatigue over the Covid-19 pandemic and remote learning in public schools. Strategists said that will be difficult to replicate this year.
“He just simply makes the main thing the main thing, and he’s extremely disciplined about it. Everything fits into ‘make Virginia the best place to live, work and raise a family.’ He puts everything into the common sense bucket, the kitchen-table issue bucket. That’s where he lives. That’s why his approval ratings are always pretty high,” said Virginia-based Republican strategist Zack Roday, who previously worked with Youngkin through his Spirit of Virginia PAC but is not working with the Earle-Sears campaign.
Roday, along with other Virginia GOP strategists, suggested that Earle-Sears hadn’t yet displayed the same political strengths.
Meanwhile, Democrats signaled they were preparing to seize on another difference they said would be meaningful to Virginia voters: how each candidate handled Trump during their campaign.
Throughout the 2021 campaign, Youngkin notably kept his distance from Trump, who was at a political low point following his loss to Joe Biden and the fallout from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. While Youngkin has since cultivated a much more public and close relationship with Trump in the years since, operatives from both major parties credited that distance during that campaign as another reason he won.
Earle-Sears has so far voiced full-throated support for Trump.

(AP) — President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation’s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health. Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products — including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service — in ways that put money in her own pocket. WATCH: The background and career of Casey Means, Trump’s pick for surgeon general A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses. In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found. Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn’t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a “material connection” to a product they promote. Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health. “I fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees. The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government’s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users’ glucose levels, could benefit from this administration’s health guidance and policy. Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients. The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being “bought off” or “corrupt” because of ties to industry. Means’ use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry. A compelling origin story Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine. “During my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,” she wrote on her website. Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors. Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures. “At the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we’re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we’d want it,” she said on Megyn Kelly’s podcast last year. But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests. During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn’t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest. Growing an audience, and selling products Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to “encompass more and more of our lives,” said Emily Hund, author of “The Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.” With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness. Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don’t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry. “A lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,” said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don’t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added. Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer. Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, “Good Energy”; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements. She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included “affiliate” or “partner” coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a “metabolic health collection.” On a “My Faves” page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links “are affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.” It’s not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process. Disclosing conflicts Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast “Let’s Be Honest” that “relationships are influential.” “There’s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,” Means said. “We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.” In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was “insanity” to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, “We need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren’t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.” On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, “I do understand how it’s messy.” Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a “Clean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations” guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales. Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company. Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an “Investor and/or Advisor.” The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship. Though the “About” page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that’s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it. Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives’ LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil’s founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means’ business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means’ advice “transformational,” saying her teachings reversed Niazi’s prediabetes and other ailments. “I am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,” Niazi said in an email. While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair. “What you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,” Sylvain said, adding, “Should there be any doubt about claims you make about products?” Potential conflicts pose new ethical questions Means isn’t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows. Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job — among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle. He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time. Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role. Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict. Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties. “This is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,” Hund said. “Is this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?” Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health. “I fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees. The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government’s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users’ glucose levels, could benefit from this administration’s health guidance and policy. Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients. The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being “bought off” or “corrupt” because of ties to industry. Means’ use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry. A compelling origin story Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine. “During my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,” she wrote on her website. Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors. Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures. “At the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we’re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we’d want it,” she said on Megyn Kelly’s podcast last year. But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests. During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn’t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest. Growing an audience, and selling products Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to “encompass more and more of our lives,” said Emily Hund, author of “The Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.” With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness. Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don’t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry. “A lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,” said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don’t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added. Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer. Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, “Good Energy”; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements. She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included “affiliate” or “partner” coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a “metabolic health collection.” On a “My Faves” page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links “are affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.” It’s not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process. Disclosing conflicts Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast “Let’s Be Honest” that “relationships are influential.” “There’s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,” Means said. “We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.” In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was “insanity” to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, “We need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren’t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.” On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, “I do understand how it’s messy.” Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a “Clean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations” guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales. Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company. Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an “Investor and/or Advisor.” The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship. Though the “About” page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that’s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it. Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives’ LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil’s founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means’ business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means’ advice “transformational,” saying her teachings reversed Niazi’s prediabetes and other ailments. “I am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,” Niazi said in an email. While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair. “What you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,” Sylvain said, adding, “Should there be any doubt about claims you make about products?” Potential conflicts pose new ethical questions Means isn’t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows. Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job — among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle. He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time. Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role. Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict. Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties. “This is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,” Hund said. “Is this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?” Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

"South Sudan deportations have placed migrants, and ICE officials, in danger: new court filing",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/south-sudan-deportations-have-placed-migrants-ice-officials-danger-new-court-filing,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 13:28:10 -0400","ICE officials and migrants deported to South Sudan face grave dangers including extreme heat, malaria exposure, and rocket attack threats while detained in converted shipping containers at a U.S. military base in Djibouti.","Nearly a dozen ICE officials and a group of migrants deported to South Sudan by the Trump administration are currently being housed in a converted shipping container and face grave dangers to their physical health, according to a new court filing.
The filing, submitted by senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Mellisa Harper, cites a combination of blistering-high heat conditions, exposure to malaria and ""imminent danger"" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen as threats to both the migrants and ICE officials. It comes after U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ordered the Trump administration to keep in U.S. custody a group of eight migrants who were deported to South Sudan without due process or the ability to challenge their removals to a third country.
He ordered they remain in U.S. custody until each could be given a ""reasonable fear interview,"" or a chance to explain to U.S. officials any fear of persecution or torture, should they be released.
But the filing makes clear that the migrants, and ICE officials, face dangers in the meantime.
US JUDGE ACCUSES TRUMP ADMIN OF ‘MANUFACTURING CHAOS’ IN SOUTH SUDAN DEPORTATIONS, ESCALATING FEUD
According to Harper, ICE officials were not given anti-malaria medication prior to traveling to Djibouti – subjecting them to unknown levels of disease exposure in a war-torn region, where there has been an uptick in deadly clashes over resource scarcity, including cattle and access to potable water. The president of the country declared a state of emergency in certain parts of South Sudan just days ago.
And even within the confines of the U.S. base, there are significant risks.
According to ICE's submission, the migrants are being housed in a converted Conex shipping container at the U.S. military base in Djibouti, the only permanent military base the U.S. currently operates in Africa. Since their arrival, daily temperatures there have exceeded 100 degrees – searing conditions that they said make detention ""of any length,"" especially longer term.
Nearby burn pits used by Djibouti to burn off trash and human waste form a giant ""smog cloud"" that hangs over the base for much of the day, exposing the group to unknown hazardous materials burned off under breezeless, blistering hot skies.
Some ICE officers have started to sleep in N-95 masks for additional protection, Harper noted.
APPEALS COURT BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN'S DEPORTATION FLIGHTS IN ALIEN ENEMIES ACT IMMIGRATION SUIT
""Within 72 hours of landing in Djibouti, the officers and detainees began to feel ill,"" Harper noted, with symptoms such as coughing, difficulty breathing, and achy joints – though they lack the testing or medication necessary for treatment.
Other, more imminent risks also remain.
Upon arrival, ICE officials were notified by Defense Department officials of the ""imminent danger"" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen, Harper noted, though ICE officers lack body armor or other gear appropriate in the case of an attack.
The new filing could add pressure on the Trump administration to relocate the detainees and ICE officials in question.
JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA
Murphy had stated in a previous order that migrants deported to South Sudan need not be held there, in a country where recent infighting and deadly conflict have displaced more than 150,000 people this year alone.
He said then that the government had mischaracterized his order, ""while at the same time manufacturing the very chaos they decry.""
His order requires the Trump administration to keep the six deported migrants in South Sudan under the custody of U.S. officials for a length of time needed to carry out the so-called ""reasonable fear interviews,"" and make a determination over whether the migrants' concerns are adequate.
""The court never said that defendants had to convert their foreign military base into an immigration facility,"" Murphy wrote in that order.

Supreme Court Gives Win To Majority Group Claims Of Discrimination,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-ames-reverse-discrimination-ruling_n_683865b3e4b06202aa913f79,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:15:04 -0400",The Supreme Court just made “reverse discrimination” a lot easier to prove.,"“Reverse discrimination” just got a lot easier to prove.
The Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling Thursday that reduces the burden of proof that people who are part of a “majority group” must provide when they sue for discrimination and remanded the decision back to the Sixth Circuit.
“This Court’s precedents reinforce that understanding of the statute, and make clear that the standard for proving disparate treatment under Title VII does not vary based on whether or not the plaintiff is a member of a majority group,” the opinion states.
Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson wrote the opinion for the court on Thursday.
At question was the standard of proof that members of majority groups must bring when claiming discrimination, and whether they should be held to a higher standard than members of “protected classes.” The ruling stems from a lawsuit that started in 2020, when Marlean Ames sued her former employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act for discrimination based on her sexual orientation. Ames, who is straight, alleged that she had been discriminated against by gay superiors.
Ames started working at the agency that oversees juvenile corrections in 2004 and, after a decade, she had moved up the ranks from the role of an executive secretary to program administrator. When a bureau chief position opened up at the department in 2019, she applied.
Just a year earlier, Ames underwent a performance evaluation by her boss, a gay woman. Her boss found Ames mostly met expectations but rarely exceeded them. According to court records, there were concerns that Ames lacked the “vision” and leadership skills required for the bureau chief role.
Ames was passed over for the promotion and then demoted to another role that paid less than she had previously been earning. According to Ames, this wasn’t due to her performance but because she was straight. The agency said it passed on Ames because of concerns over her leadership abilities and that, historically, she had been “abrasive and not collaborative” though her work ethic was considered strong.
When she sued for discrimination based on her sexual orientation, Ames noted that the person who evaluated her was gay and so was the person who got the promotion she had applied for. The individual who actually made the hiring decision for that position, however, was straight.
Initially, a federal district court in Ohio tossed Ames’ lawsuit, finding she had failed to prove there was a pattern of discrimination by gay people at the department against straight people.
As a heterosexual, the courts consider Ames part of a majority group, as opposed to people who are part of a protected class. Protected classes cover a person’s sex, sexual orientation, age, ancestry, color, religion and more. But for a person in the majority to successfully sue for discrimination, some courts — not all — require evidence of “background circumstances” to support their claim.
Background circumstances must show that the person or people outside the majority are engaged in an unusual pattern of discrimination against the majority. Ames never proved that pattern, according to the district court, and when she appealed, judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit didn’t think she had proved it either. (Currently, only a handful of circuits require background circumstances, including the 6th Circuit; others, like the uber-conservative 5th Circuit, don’t apply the standard at all. And notably, the background circumstances rule has also been rejected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission itself, the very body that oversees enforcement of laws that make discrimination illegal.)
When Ames’ lawyers came to the Supreme Court in February and asked the high court to reverse the 6th Circuit’s decisions, the justices seemed to signal how they would rule, as they asked questions about the fairness of requiring more burden of proof for one group of people versus another when they are suing for discrimination.
“For most plaintiffs,” Justice Jackson wrote, the initial steps they must take to provide a burden of proof “is not onerous.”
“A plaintiff may satisfy it simply by presenting evidence ‘that she applied for an available position for which she was qualified, but was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.’ But, under Sixth Circuit precedent, plaintiffs who are members of a majority group bear an additional burden at step one: They must also establish ‘background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.’”
The Sixth Circuit’s “background circumstances” rule, the justice added, can’t “be squared with the text of Title VII or our longstanding precedents.”
“And nothing Ohio has said, in its brief or at oral argument, persuades us otherwise,” she wrote.
In the concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said the “background circumstances rule also highlights how judge-made doctrines can be difficult for courts to apply.”
“Because courts lack an underlying legal authority on which to ground their analysis, there is no principled way to resolve doctrinal ambiguities. The ‘background circumstances’ rule suffers from this flaw. A number of courts have described the rule as ‘vague and ill-defined,’” he wrote, citing a series of rulings in reverse discrimination from years past. “Most notably, the ‘background circumstances’ rule requires courts to perform the difficult — if not impossible — task of deciding whether a particular plaintiff qualifies as a member of the so-called ‘majority.’”
Thomas continued: “How a court defines the boundaries of a population can affect whether a particular person falls into a majority or minority group. Women, for example, make up the majority in the United States as a whole, but not in some States and counties.”
When trying to define the majority in terms of race, it becomes “even more difficult,” Thomas wrote, noting the growth of “multicultural families” throughout the U.S.
Attempts to “divide us all up into a handful of groups have only become more incoherent with time,” Thomas wrote, quoting directly from Justice Neil Gorsuch in the 2023 decision for Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. Presidents and Fellows of Harvard College. In that ruling, the Supreme Court found affirmative action processes for college admissions violated the Equal Protection clause.
“Thankfully, today’s decision obviates the need for courts to engage in the ‘sordid business’ of ‘divvying us up by race’ or any other protected trait,” Thomas wrote.
With the background circumstances doctrine unwound, the Supreme Court may have granted the Trump administration a huge gift: Since January, the administration has been dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs at a near constant clip.

The mixed responses came after Donald Trump signed a ban targeting 12 countries also including Afghanistan, Iran and Yemen in a revival of one of the most controversial measures from his first term.
“Being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans,” Diosdado Cabello, the interior minister in Caracas, said after the announcement, warning citizens against travel there and describing the US government as fascist. “They persecute our countrymen, our people, for no reason.”
Dahir Hassan Abdi, the Somali ambassador to the US, said: “Somalia values its longstanding relationship with the United States and stands ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised.”
Calls early on Thursday to the spokesperson of Myanmar’s military government were not answered. The foreign ministry of Laos did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported.
There was no immediate response from Iran, but Jamal Abdi, the president of the National Iranian American Council, said: “The impact of the ban will once again be felt by Americans who were denied the ability to see their loved ones at weddings, funerals, or the birth of a child.”
The move bans all travel to the US by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Trump imposed a partial ban on travellers from seven countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from these countries would be allowed, his administration said. The bans would come into effect on Monday 9 June, the White House said.
The African Union said the ban would harm “people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement and broader diplomatic relations” built with the US over decades. It appealed to Washington to adopt a “consultative approach and to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned”.
Trump said the bans were spurred by a makeshift flame-thrower attack on a Jewish protest in Colorado that US authorities blamed on a man they said was in the country illegally.
Several countries on the list – Myanmar, Libya, Sudan and Yemen – face continuing civil strife and territory overseen by opposing factions. Sudan has an active war, while Yemen’s war is largely stalemated and Libyan forces remain armed.
For citizens of war-stricken countries such as Myanmar, which has been gripped by violence since a military coup in 2021, the announcement is yet another blow. It follows a freeze on refugee resettlements announced by Trump in January, and cuts to scholarship programmes that provided rare opportunities for young people to go abroad and study in safety.
A 21-year-old student from Myanmar, who asked not be named, said his plan to study computer science at a community college in New York was in tatters. “[My] visa appointment is 25 June – but then there was this breaking news in the morning … I felt upset. I couldn’t do anything. This was my only hope, to study in the United States.”
He is now studying in Thailand but his visa will expire in October and he is unsure what he will do next, as it is not safe to return home.
He had been studying medicine in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, but fled after he was told he would be forcibly conscripted to join the military.
“I don’t want to go to the army. Going to the army would be like I’m already dead. My name is on their list so I [had to] sneak out of my country,” he said, adding that his family stayed in Myanmar.
Young people have desperately sought ways to leave Myanmar after the widely loathed military junta announced last year it would impose mandatory conscription to boost its numbers.
Aside from the fear of conscription, people are living with the constant threat of military airstrikes in many areas of the country, the aftermath of a devastating earthquake that struck in March and sky-high inflation.
“Most of the people are jobless, most of the students are hopeless, we have no future. I think our generation is just for sacrifice,” the student said.
The travel ban was yet more bad news for Myanmar refugees in neighbouring Thailand, some of whom had been close to moving to the US when Trump abruptly suspended refugee resettlements earlier this year, said Joe Freeman, Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher.
Since the 2021 military coup in Myanmar, 3.2 million people have been displaced within the country, while 176,400 have fled to neighbouring countries. “Some had already done their orientations for the US. They’ve already had their medical checkups. They’ve already gotten their flight tickets – and then just like [that] the hammer comes down,” Freeman said.
The inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who had worked to resettle its people. The ban makes exceptions for Afghans on special immigrant visas, generally people who worked most closely with the US government during the two-decade-long war there.
Afghanistan was also one of the largest sources of resettled refugees, with about 14,000 arrivals in a 12-month period through September 2024. Trump suspended refugee resettlement on his first day in office.
Shawn VanDiver, the president and board chair of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit, said: “To include Afghanistan – a nation whose people stood alongside American service members for 20 years – is a moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold,.”
International aid groups and refugee resettlement organisations roundly condemned the bans. “This policy is not about national security – it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,” said Abby Maxman, the president of Oxfam America.",The Guardian,['visa'],"['Venezuela', 'Trump', 'US', 'Somalia', 'Washington', 'Donald Trump', 'Afghanistan', 'Iran', 'Yemen', 'the United States', 'Diosdado Cabello', 'Caracas', 'US', 'Dahir Hassan Abdi', 'US', 'Somalia', 'the United States', 'Myanmar', 'Laos', 'Reuters', 'Iran', 'Jamal Abdi', 'the National Iranian American Council', 'US', 'Afghanistan', 'Myanmar', 'Chad', 'the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea', 'Eritrea', 'Haiti', 'Iran', 'Libya', 'Somalia', 'Sudan', 'Yemen', 'Burundi', 'Cuba', 'Laos', 'Sierra Leone', 'Togo', 'Turkmenistan', 'Venezuela', 'the White House', 'The African Union', 'US', 'Washington', 'Trump', 'Colorado', 'US', 'Myanmar', 'Libya', 'Sudan', 'Yemen', 'Sudan', 'Yemen', 'Myanmar', 'Trump', 'Myanmar', 'New York', 'the United States', 'Thailand', 'Mandalay', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar', 'Thailand', 'US', 'Trump', 'Joe Freeman', 'Amnesty International’s', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar', 'US', 'Freeman', 'Afghanistan', 'US', 'Afghanistan', 'Trump', 'Shawn VanDiver', 'AfghanEvac', 'Afghanistan', 'the United States', 'Abby Maxman']","Attract & Retain, Recruiting Research Talent and Key Person Dependence in Higher Education",1
Diabetes startup Omada Health finally went public after 14 years. Here's who made bank.,https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-who-got-rich-omada-healths-ipo-2025-6,2025-06-06T20:00:23Z,Diabetes care startup Omada Health went public Friday 14 years after its founding. Here's what its major investors' stakes are now worth.,"- Omada Health just became the second digital health company to IPO this year.
- The chronic care company saw its shares jump Friday morning by over 38% above its initial price.
- Here's what Omada's major investors' stakes are worth after the public market debut.
Omada Health just went public at a $1.1 billion valuation — 14 years after its founding.
It's the second digital health IPO of the year, following physical therapy company Hinge Health, which went public on May 21. The two IPOs come after a multiyear drought for healthcare public market debuts.
And so far, Omada's IPO hasn't disappointed. While the chronic care company priced its initial shares at $19, its stock opened at $23 a share and jumped as high as $28.40 Friday morning, nearly a 50% increase.
Omada Health launched in 2011 to provide virtual care for prediabetes, making its name in the years following for diabetes management.
In recent years, its business has surged in new areas beyond diabetes care. Omada's weight care business has boomed as more patients taking GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic for weight loss seek companion care. The San Francisco-based company says most of its new employer and health plan clients approach Omada initially, interested in its metabolic health track.
Omada's initial valuation of $1.1 billion is roughly where it was privately valued. Omada's last private fundraise, a $192 million Series E round announced in February 2022, put Omada's valuation over $1 billion.
It's perhaps the best outcome Omada's investors could've hoped for, given that many digital health startups now looking to IPO last raised at huge valuations during VC's ZIRP period. Those valuations could be difficult to realize in today's market. Hinge Health, for example, went public at a $2.6 billion valuation after being valued in its 2021 fundraise at $6.2 billion.
We don't know what Omada Health's investors paid for their shares, so we can't calculate their profit. However, since Omada's shares opened on the stock market at $23, we used that price to determine the worth of its investors' stakes. None of Omada's major investors sold any shares in its IPO.
Here's what the stakes of Omada Health's major investors and executives are worth after its IPO.
Revelation Partners, an investor: $120 million
Revelation Partners is a healthcare-focused investment firm that says it provides flexible capital to companies, especially to give liquidity to startups.
The firm first invested in Omada in September 2019, according to its website. Revelation Partners told Business Insider in an email that the firm invested in Omada through a series of secondary transactions.

At the time of A16z's 2015 investment, former general partner Balaji Srinivasan joined Omada's board of directors. It's unclear when he stepped down from the board; he moved into a part-time role at A16z that same year.
A16z owns about 4.6 million shares, or 8.3% of the company. At the $23 market debut price, the firm's stake is worth about $106 million.

Cigna Ventures owns about 3.4 million shares, or 6.2% of the company. At the $23 market debut price, the firm's stake is worth about $79 million.
aMoon Fund, an investor: $62 million
Israeli VC firm aMoon fund invests in healthcare and life sciences companies from early to late stages. Founded in 2016, it has backed a number of biotech companies that later went public, including Sophia Genetics, which went public in 2021, and Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, which went public in 2022.
The firm first invested in Omada Health in its $192 million Series E round in 2022.
""The entire space of all these clusters of diseases that includes diabetes, hypertension, and obesity is going through a major revolution right now,"" aMoon Fund managing partner Tomer Berkowitz told BI. ""The solution in the end will not just be based on drugs, but it'll be a combination of drugs and behavioral change. I think Omada plays a significant role in that.""

Its healthcare portfolio also includes hospital operations AI company Qventus, which raised $105 million in January led by private equity firm KKR, and behavioral health site Talkspace, which went public in a 2021 SPAC deal.
The firm led Omada's $48 million Series C round in 2015 and put additional funding into Omada's Series C-1 and D rounds.
Norwest owns about 2.5 million shares, or 4.5% of the company. At the $23 market debut price, the firm's stake is worth about $58 million.
Sean Duffy, CEO: $46 million
Sean Duffy cofounded Omada Health alongside Adrian James, Omada's former president, and Andrew DiMichele, former chief technology officer, in 2011. The startup sought to use technology to deliver care for chronic conditions, initially focusing on prediabetes, to patients in between visits with their primary care providers.
Duffy and James spun Omada out of the design and consulting firm IDEO, where they'd begun researching the challenges in prediabetes and metabolic disease care. For Duffy, the IDEO gig had begun as an internship while he was getting dual MD-MBA degrees at Harvard. Instead of returning to complete his studies, he turned his focus to the idea that would become Omada.
Before Omada, Duffy had created the interactive Microsoft Excel training tool Excel Everest, written about healthcare innovation for the medtech blog Medgadget, and worked in people analytics at Google.
Duffy owns about 2 million shares, or 3.5% of Omada Health. That number includes about 860,000 shares of common stock and 1.15 million stock options exercisable by May 30, according to Omada's S-1 filing.
At the $23 market debut price, his stake is worth about $46 million.

At the $23 market debut price, his stake is worth about $13 million.

Progressives Introduce “Block the Bombs Act” as Israel Escalates Gaza Genocide,https://truthout.org/articles/progressives-introduce-block-the-bombs-act-as-israel-escalates-gaza-genocide/,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 15:41:57 +0000","Backed by nearly two dozen House Democrats, the new bill would end the US supply of offensive weapons to Israel.","With over 54,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip killed by the Israeli assault and the 2 million survivors suffering from the ongoing bombings and blockade on essentials, nearly two dozens progressives in the U.S. Congress came together Thursday to call for passage of a bill that would withhold offensive weapons from Israel.
Like former Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden, Republican President Donald Trump has continued to provide diplomatic and weapons support to the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose forces have left the Palestinian enclave in ruins since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
“Netanyahu and Trump are a lethal, unaccountable, extremist duo. Trump has bypassed congressional oversight on weapons transfers. The Israeli government is currently escalating attacks on the civilian population of Gaza. They are both out of control. Congress needs to assert its oversight authority,” said Congresswoman Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) in a statement.
“Enough is enough,” Ramirez declared. “By introducing the Block the Bombs Act, a broad coalition is listening to the American people who don’t want their taxpayers’ money to continue supporting gross violations of U.S., international, and humanitarian law.”
Two former leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus — Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) — as well as Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) are spearheading the fight for the bill alongside Ramirez. Another 18 Democrats in the House of Representatives have signed on as co-sponsors, including current CPC Chair Greg Casar (D-Texas) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the only Palestinian American in either chamber.
“For the last year and a half, Benjamin Netanyahu has laid siege to Gaza, killing at least 54,000 people, repeatedly displacing the entire population, and cutting off access to desperately needed humanitarian aid,” said Pocan. “This commonsense bill will prevent more unchecked transfers of these offensive weapons systems that are used to violate international human rights laws and hopefully help bring this devastating conflict to an end.”
Although there was a cease-fire in place for nearly two months earlier this year, Netanyahu abandoned it in March. Since then, negotiations for an end to Israel’s annihilation of Gaza and the release of both Palestinians held in Israeli prisons and hostages taken by Palestinian militants in 2023 have been unsuccessful.
Throughout the war, efforts by progressives in both chambers of Congress — including multiple resolutions led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — to block U.S. weapons that Israel uses to massacre civilians in Gaza also have not been successful. A growing number of critics across the globe condemn the U.S.-backed Israeli assault as genocide.
The new bill is backed by dozens of advocacy groups that have spent the past 20 months sounding the alarm about the soaring death toll, starvation, and destruction of infrastructure in Gaza, including Amnesty International USA, Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), Council on American-Islamic Relations, Demand Progress, Human Rights Watch, IfNotNow Movement, IMEU Policy Project, Indivisible, Jewish Voice for Peace Action, Justice Democrats, Institute for Policy Studies, Progressive Democrats of America, Rabbis for Cease-Fire, Sunrise Movement, Win Without War, and Working Families Party.
“The Block the Bombs Act is a historic bill,” but also “a straightforward challenge to United States complicity in Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza as Israeli forces block humanitarian assistance and directly target schools, hospitals, and civilians,” said CCR associate director of policy Brad Parker. “As the Israeli government escalates the murder, starvation, and forcible transfer of Palestinians with President Trump’s full support, we recognize and appreciate the bold leadership of Reps. Ramirez, Jacobs, Jayapal, and Pocan.”
CCR also encouraged supporters of the bill to visit blockthebombs.org, which features a tool enabling U.S. voters to write to their members of Congress and ask them to co-sponsor the legislation, H.R. 3565.

(AP) — A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the government to immediately halt deportation proceedings against the family of a man charged in the firebombing attack in Boulder, Colorado, to ensure the protection of the family’s constitutional rights.
U.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher granted a request from the wife and five children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who are Egyptian, to block their deportation. U.S. immigration officials took the family into custody Tuesday.
Soliman, 45, has been charged with a federal hate crime and state counts of attempted murder in the attack in downtown Boulder on Sunday. Witnesses say he threw two Molotov cocktails at a group demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, and he confessed to the attack in custody.
His family members have not been charged.
Federal authorities have said Soliman has been living in the U.S. illegally, and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said earlier Wednesday that the family was being processed for removal. It’s rare that a criminal suspect’s family members are detained and threatened with deportation.
“It is patently unlawful to punish individuals for the crimes of their relatives,” attorneys for the family wrote in the lawsuit.
Eric Lee, one of the attorney’s representing the family, said efforts to deport them should not happen in a democracy.
“The punishment of a four-year-old child for something their parent allegedly did, who also has a presumption of innocence, is something that should outrage Americans regardless of their citizenship status,” he said.
A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Colorado referred requests for comment to an email account for the Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond.
Witnesses describe attack at vigil
Around 200 people squeezed into the local Jewish Community Center Wednesday evening for a vigil that featured prayer, songs and emotional testimony from a victim and witnesses to the attack.
Rachelle Halpern, who has been walking with the group since 2023, said she remembers thinking it was strange to see a man with a canister looking like he was going to spray pesticide on the grass. Then she heard a crash and screams and saw flames around her feet.
“A woman stood one foot behind me, engulfed in flames from head to toe, lying on the ground with her husband,” she said. “People immediately, three or four men immediately rushed to her to smother the flames.”
Her description prompted murmurs from the audience members. One woman’s head dropped into her hands.
Defendant’s family investigated
Soliman’s wife, Hayam El Gamal, a 17-year-old daughter, two minor sons and two minor daughters all are Egyptian citizens, according to El Gamal’s lawsuit. They were being held at an immigration detention center in Texas, Lee said.
“We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it,” Noem said in a statement.
Noem also said federal authorities would immediately crack down on people who overstay their visas, following the Boulder attack.
Soliman told authorities that no one, including his family, knew about his planned attack, according to court documents. El Gamal said she was “shocked” to learn her husband had been arrested in the attack, according to her lawsuit.
Victims increase to 15 people and a dog
Earlier Wednesday, authorities raised the number of people injured in the attack from 12 to 15, plus a dog.
Boulder County officials said in a news release that the victims include eight women and seven men ranging in age from 25 to 88. Details about how the victims were impacted would be explained in criminal charges set to be filed Thursday, according to Boulder County District Attorney’s office spokesperson Shannon Carbone.
Soliman had planned to kill all of the roughly 20 participants in Sunday’s demonstration at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, but he threw just two of his 18 Molotov cocktails while yelling “Free Palestine,” police said. Soliman didn’t carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” police wrote in an affidavit.
According to an FBI affidavit, Soliman told police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people” — a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel. Authorities said he expressed no remorse about the attack.
The family’s immigration status
Before moving to Colorado Springs three years ago, Soliman spent 17 years in Kuwait, according to court documents.
Soliman arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. She said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that has also expired.
Hundreds of thousands of people overstay their visas each year in the United States, according to Department of Homeland Security reports.
Soliman’s wife was born in Saudi Arabia and is an Egyptian national, according to her lawsuit. She is a network engineer and has a pending EB-2 visa, which is available to professionals with advanced degrees, the suit said. She and her children all are listed as dependents on Soliman’s asylum application.
The case against Soliman
Soliman told authorities that he had been planning the attack for a year, the affidavit said.
Soliman is being held in a county jail on a $10 million cash bond and is scheduled to make an appearance in state court on Thursday. His attorney, Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after a state court hearing Monday. Public defenders’ policy prohibits speaking to the media.
The attack unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. It happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

Lawsuit Challenges “Unlawful” Detention of Migrants at Guantánamo Bay,https://truthout.org/articles/lawsuit-challenges-unlawful-detention-of-migrants-at-guantanamo-bay/,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:46:15 +0000","The point of holding people in the notorious prison is &ldquo;to instill fear in the immigrant population,&rdquo; the filing states.","Immigrant rights advocates on Wednesday launched a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration for detaining migrants at the U.S. naval station in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba — the site of a “notorious” prison where several foreign men and boys were indefinitely held and tortured as part of the so-called War on Terror.
The class action suit was filed in the District of Columbia by the ACLU’s national and D.C. arms, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the International Refugee Assistance Project against the secretaries of defense, homeland security, and state, as well as their departments, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and ICE’s acting director.
The coalition brought the case on behalf of two Nicaraguan men previously detained a facilities in Virginia and Louisiana — Yamil Luna Gutierrez and Rafael Angel Lopez Ocon — and other noncitizens the Trump administration is now holding under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) in “disturbing” conditions at Guantánamo.
Rather than keeping these migrants in the United States “while making arrangements to effectuate their removal, the government has flown them hundreds of miles away to detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, for no legitimate purpose,” the complaint states. “Plaintiffs are surrounded by military officials, deprived of in-person contact with legal counsel, and subject to punitive conditions of confinement, including in facilities previously used by the military to hold law-of-war detainees.”
The plaintiffs, the filing says, “do not challenge the government’s authority to detain them on U.S. soil or to directly remove them to their home country or to another statutorily authorized country. What they challenge is the government’s unprecedented and unlawful decision to hold them in a detention facility at Guantánamo — which, under the INA, and for purposes of the application of that statute, is not the United States. Immigration detention outside the United States is straightforwardly illegal under the statute.”
“Moreover,” the document argues, “the government’s use of Guantánamo for immigration detention is arbitrary and capricious, lacks any legitimate purpose, and imposes punitive detention conditions on immigration detainees in violation of their constitutional rights.”
“Never before this administration has the federal government moved noncitizens apprehended and detained in the United States on civil immigration charges to Guantánamo, or to any other facility outside the United States, for the purpose of civil immigration detention. Nor is there any legitimate reason to do so,” the document notes. “The government has ample detention capacity inside the United States, which is far less costly and poses none of the logistical hurdles attendant to detaining people at Guantánamo.”
Specifically, according to the complaint, “since February 4, 2025, the government has held approximately 500 people in immigration detention at Guantánamo, at a reported cost of more than $40 million, or approximately $100,000 per day per detainee. In contrast, immigration detention at a U.S.-based detention facility costs, on average, $165 per day per detainee.”
Previewing the Trump administration’s likely arguments in court, the suit says that “in attempting to justify the transfers, the government has claimed that the individuals it is sending to Guantánamo are members of gangs and dangerous criminals — the ‘worst of the worst.’ That characterization has been proven wrong. Regardless, it is legally irrelevant.”
The filing also stresses that “the government’s real reason for holding immigration detainees at Guantánamo is to instill fear in the immigrant population. That is not conjecture; it is government policy.”
The coalition is asking the court to rule that detaining these migrants at Guantánamo violates the INA, Administrative Procedure Act, and Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and to block the Trump administration from continuing to do so.

Under Trump, it's becoming a liability
Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body
WASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.
Like other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world’s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation’s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.
Trump’s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His order applies only to Harvard, but it poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.
It’s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump’s gatekeeping powers.
“Columbia’s exposure to this ‘stroke of pen’ risk is uniquely high,” the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.
People from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia’s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.
Other highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.
America’s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.
It was part of a “gold rush” in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.
“Whether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,"" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.
The race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren’t eligible for financial aid, and at some schools they pay two or three times the tuition rate charged to U.S. students. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.
But the expansion wasn’t equal across all types of colleges — public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don’t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their numbers of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by the rising costs and student debt loads.
Proponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation’s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.
In the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard’s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia’s schools.
The Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.
“That was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, ‘If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,’” he said.
Last week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.
“We have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can’t get in because we have foreign students there,” Trump said at a news conference.
The university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.”
In a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of “a painstaking, decades-long project” to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school’s mission and reputation, it said.
“In our interconnected global economy,"" the school said, “a university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.”

Louisiana's House passed an anti-DEI bill after racially charged debate.

That was more than two weeks ago. Since then, House Bill 685 has remained stuck on the Senate calendar, dying on the vine, in the final days of the legislative session.
As she does when all House-passed bills first reach her chamber, Senate Secretary Yolanda Dixon announced the bill and its title on May 20. But Dixon, following instructions from Senate President Cameron Henry, then announced that HB685 was being returned to the calendar.
And it has sat there since then, unheard.
In an interview, Henry, R-Metairie, said he’s been trying to decide which committee to refer the bill to.
“I’m still working through that,” Henry said Thursday, declining to say more.
The legislative session ends at 6 p.m. Thursday.
Henry’s handling of HB685 stands out because he has had Dixon refer virtually all other House-passed bills to one Senate committee or another, the next step in the legislative process.
Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, said the House debate left bruised feelings that senators have been reluctant to revisit.
“Everyone in the building observed the painful debate that took place on the House floor,” Boudreaux said. “It did not go unnoticed. I am confident that the Senate will continue to preserve the integrity of the institution that I have been blessed to be part of for the last 10 years.”
The bill by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, prohibits state agencies from maintaining or initiating DEI programs, employing people to perform functions related to DEI or requiring any applicants or employees to provide a statement regarding DEI.
Her bill also prohibits “any preferential treatment based on race, color, ethnicity, sex, national origin, gender identity, or sexual orientation in making decisions at public postsecondary education institutions on admissions, state-supported financial aid, scholarships, or other services or benefits.”
Chenevert said when she presented HB685 that it followed up on an anti-DEI executive order last year by Gov. Jeff Landry and had the governor’s support. She said it was needed to ensure that Louisiana universities do not run afoul of the Trump Administration’s crackdown on DEI programs.
“This bill makes sure we are in line with First Amendment rights and academic freedom of speech,” Chenevert told her colleagues.
Black legislators did not buy that argument.
In an extraordinary move, some two dozen Black and two White Democrats walked to the front of the chamber and lined up in solidarity besides each member speaking against the bill.
Rep. Denise Marcelle, D-Baton Rouge, called the bill “divisive.”
Rep. Wilford Carter, D-Lake Charles, said DEI programs exist to give opportunities to those who might be left behind without a helping hand.
Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, said bills like this one created an unhealthy racial climate that could have made LSU President William Tate, who is Black, want to take over the top spot at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
On Thursday, Chenevert reiterated what she told House colleagues: that her bill would have ensured that DEI courses could not be mandated for graduation and colleges and universities “while also protecting the rights of every person – no matter their race, nationality or background as it pertains to state agencies.”
“Unfortunately, there was a lot of misinformation surrounding the bill,” she added. “We’ll see if the governor wants to bring it back next session.”",The Advocate,"['executive order', 'dei', 'executive order', 'rutgers university', 'rutgers university']","['Louisiana', 'House of Representatives', 'House', 'Senate', 'House', 'Senate', 'Yolanda Dixon', 'Dixon', 'Senate', 'Cameron Henry', 'HB685', 'Henry', 'Henry', 'Henry’s', 'HB685', 'Dixon', 'House', 'Senate', 'Gerald Boudreaux', 'House', 'House', 'Boudreaux', 'Senate', 'Emily Chenevert', 'DEI', 'DEI', 'DEI', 'Chenevert', 'HB685', 'Jeff Landry', 'Louisiana', 'the Trump Administration’s', 'DEI', 'First Amendment', 'Chenevert', 'solidarity', 'Denise Marcelle', 'D-Baton Rouge', 'Wilford Carter', 'DEI', 'Edmond Jordan', 'D-Baton Rouge', 'LSU', 'William Tate', 'Rutgers University', 'New Jersey', 'Chenevert', 'House', 'DEI']","New Orleans infrastructure, crime, and public image; Threats to Research and Higher Education Funding from Heightened Regulatory Change and Scrutiny",3

At a news conference, the US attorney general, Pamela Bondi, just announced that Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order, has been returned to the United States and charged with criminal charges related to smuggling undocumented immigrants inside the United States.
Bondi said that the US government presented an arrest warrant for Ábrego García to El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele.
She also said that the grand jury indictment on 21 May was based on recently discovered facts and that the grand jury “found that over the past nine years, Ábrego García has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring.”
“Upon completion of his sentence, we anticipate he will be returned to his country of El Salvador”, Bondi said.
Bondi suggested that Ábrego García was involved in other crimes, based on what unnamed co-conspirators allege, but he was only indicted on two counts related to the alleged smuggling.
In response to a reporter’s question, Bondi said that Ábrego García would serve a prison sentence in the US if convicted, on charges that carry a possible sentence of 10 years, and then be deported to El Salvador again.
US Supreme Court allows Doge broad access to Social Security data
The US Supreme Court on Friday permitted the so-called ‘department of government efficiency’, or Doge, a team set up by former Trump aide Elon Musk to take a chainsaw to the federal workforce, broad access to personal information on millions of Americans in Social Security Administration data systems while a legal challenge plays out, Reuters reports.
At the request of the Justice Department, the justices put on hold US district judge Ellen Hollander’s order that had largely blocked Doge’s access to “personally identifiable information” in data such as medical and financial records while litigation proceeds in a lower court. Hollander found that allowing Doge unfettered access likely would violate a federal privacy law.
The court’s brief, unsigned order did not provide a rationale for siding with Doge. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Its three liberal justices dissented from the order.
White House uses new charges against Ábrego García to attack Democrats who protested his deportation without due process
White House officials have wasted no time in using the newly announced criminal charges against Kilmar Ábrego García to attack Democrats who objected to his deportation without due process in violation of a previous court order.
Writing on Elon Musk’s social media platform X, the White House’s official account dedicated to partisan “rapid response” resurfaced an April post from Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat whose constituents include Ábrego García’s wife, to suggest that he should now be ashamed of having stood up for the undocumented Maryland resident’s due process rights.
“A grand jury found his full-time job was human smuggling, Chris”, the White House account commented. “He spent his entire life abusing people — including women and children. This is who you spent so much time defending. Shame on you.”
The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, also using the platform owned by a former Trump aide who called for the president to be impeached just yesterday, claimed that the indictment against Ábrego García “proves the unhinged Democrat Party was wrong, and their stenographers in the Fake News Media were once again played like fools.”
Apparently unaware that the allegations have yet to be tested in court, the president’s chief spokesperson insisted that “Democrat lawmakers” including Van Hollen, “and every single so-called ‘journalist’ who defended this illegal criminal abuser must immediately apologize to Garcia’s victims.”

US criminal indictment charges Kilmar Ábrego García with transporting undocumented immigrants in 2022
We are waiting for the start of a livestreamed justice department news conference, which is expected to deal with the indictment of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador and is reportedly on his way back to the United States to face new criminal charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee which prompted officers to suspect that he might have been transporting undocumented migrants.
The criminal indictment, which was filed on 21 May, accuses Ábrego García of being “a member and associate” of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 and charges him with taking part in a conspiracy to transport undocumented immigrants inside the United States.
The reportedly imminent return to the United States of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order that he should not be sent there because he had a reasonable fear of persecution in that country, comes nearly two months after the attorney general, Pamela Jo Bondi, insisted that it would never happen.
“He is not coming back to our country” Bondi told reporters at a news conference on 16 April. “President Bukele said he was not sending him back. That’s the end of the story.”
Asked if she could provide evidence that he was a member of the MS-13 gang, Bondi said only that the allegation was contained in a 2019 court hearing.
Kilmar Ábrego García on his way back to the US to face criminal charges - report
Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland man unlawfully deported to El Salvador, is on his way back to the US where he will face criminal charges, ABC News is reporting, citing sources.
A federal grand jury has indicted Ábrego García for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the US, according to the report.
The outlet, citing sources, reports that a two-count indictment, filed under seal in federal court in Tennessee last month, alleges that Ábrego García participated in a years-long conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to the interior of the country.
Among those allegedly transported were members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13, according to the report. The alleged conspiracy spanned nearly a decade, according to the report.
US and China to hold trade talks on 9 June in London, says Trump
A US trade delegation including three cabinet officials will meet with trade representatives from China in London on Monday “with reference to the trade deal”, Donald Trump has announced.
He posted on Truth Social:
I am pleased to announce that Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and United States Trade Representative, Ambassador Jamieson Greer, will be meeting in London on Monday, June 9, 2025, with Representatives of China, with reference to the Trade Deal. The meeting should go very well. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
It comes a day after Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinpingheld a “very good” phone call during which they discussed “some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, Trade Deal”, Trump said.
Trump also said Xi had invited him to visit China, an invitation he aid he reciprocated.
Xi said of the call that a “consensus has been reached”, adding that the two sides “should enhance consensus” as well as “reduce misunderstanding, strengthen cooperation” and “enhance exchanges”. “Dialogue, cooperation is the only right choice for China and the US,” the Chinese president said.
Analysis: Money can’t buy him love – Republicans give Elon Musk the cold shoulder
Robert Tait
Elon Musk may believe his money bought the presidential election and the House of the Representatives for the Republicans. But he is discovering painfully and quickly that it has not bought him love, loyalty or even fear among many GOP members of Congress on Capitol Hill.
Faced with the choice of siding with Musk, the world’s richest man, or Donald Trump, after the two staged a public relationship breakdown for the ages on Thursday, most Republicans went with the man in the Oval Office, who has shown an unerring grasp of the tactics of political intimidation and who remains the world’s most powerful figure even without the boss of Tesla and SpaceX by his side.
The billionaire tech entrepreneur, who poured about $275m into Trump’s campaign last year, tried to remind Washington’s political classes of his financial muscle on Thursday during an outpouring of slights against a man for whom he had once professed platonic love and was still showering with praise up until a week before.
One after another, Republican House members came out to condemn him and defend Trump, despite having earlier been told by Musk that “you know you did wrong” in voting for what has become Trump’s signature legislation that seeks to extend vast tax cuts for the rich.
Troy Nehls, a GOP representative from Texas, captured the tone, addressing Musk before television cameras:
You’ve lost your damn mind. Enough is enough. Stop this.
It chimed with the sentiments of many others. “Nobody elected Elon Musk, and a whole lot of people don’t even like him, to be honest with you, even on both sides,” Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey congressman, told Axios.

Every tweet that goes out, people are more lockstep behind President Trump and [Musk is] losing favour.
Republicans were balancing the strength of Trump’s voice among GOP voters versus the power of the increasingly unpopular Musk’s money – and most had little doubt which matters most.

Trump administration preparing to strip federal funding from California – CNN
Lauren Gambino
The Trump administration is preparing to make good on the president’s threat to strip “large scale” federal funding from California, an effort that could begin as early as Friday, according to CNN.
The report says agencies have been directed to start identifying grantsthe administration can withhold from the state. A whistleblower reportedly told a congressional committee that the administration was planning to cut all research grants to California.
The White House has not commented on the plans. The timeline remains speculative, and it is unclear what grants would be targeted.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut federal funding as a way to force states, institutions and universities to comply with his agenda. Last week, he said California could lose “large scale” funding “maybe permanently” if the state continued to allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ and women’s sports.
The declaration appeared to be in reference to a transgender track-and-field star from southern California. On Saturday, she won two gold medals and a silver, which she shared with other teen athletes under a new rule by the state’s high school sports body.
Trump had also repeatedly threatened to withhold federal disaster aid, assailing the state’s Democratic leaders for their handling of the wildfires that devastated Los Angeles earlier this year.
More from House speaker Mike Johnson, who has told CNBC he has been texting with Elon Musk and hopes the dispute is resolved quickly.
He said of the “big, beautiful bill”:
I don’t argue with [Musk] about how to build rockets and I wish he wouldn’t argue with me about how to craft legislation and pass it.
Johnson earlier issued a warning: “Do not second-guess and don’t ever challenge the president of the United States, Donald Trump.”
He had also projected confidence that the Trump-Musk dispute won’t affect prospects for the tax and border bill. “Members are not shaken at all,” he said. “We’re going to pass this legislation on our deadline.”",The Guardian,"['transgender athletes', 'deportation', 'research grants']","['US', 'Kilmar Ábrego García', 'US', 'US', 'Pamela Bondi', 'Kilmar Ábrego García', 'Maryland', 'El Salvador', 'the United States', 'the United States', 'Bondi', 'US', 'Ábrego García', 'El Salvador’s', 'Nayib Bukele', 'Ábrego García', 'El Salvador', 'Bondi', 'Bondi', 'Ábrego García', 'Bondi', 'Ábrego García', 'US', 'El Salvador', 'US Supreme Court', 'Doge', 'Social Security', 'The US Supreme Court', 'Doge', 'Trump', 'Elon Musk', 'Social Security Administration', 'Reuters', 'the Justice Department', 'US', 'Ellen Hollander', 'Doge', 'Hollander', 'Doge', 'Doge', 'White House', 'Ábrego García', 'White House', 'Kilmar Ábrego García', 'the White House’s', 'Chris Van Hollen', 'Maryland', 'Ábrego García’s', 'Maryland', 'Chris', 'the White House', 'The White House', 'Karoline Leavitt', 'Trump', 'Ábrego García', 'Democrat Party', 'Van Hollen', 'Garcia', 'US', 'Kilmar Ábrego García', 'US', 'US', 'Pamela Bondi', 'Kilmar Ábrego García', 'Maryland', 'El Salvador', 'the United States', 'the United States', 'Bondi', 'US', 'Ábrego García', 'El Salvador’s', 'Nayib Bukele', 'Ábrego García', 'El Salvador', 'Bondi', 'Bondi', 'Ábrego García', 'Bondi', 'Ábrego García', 'US', 'El Salvador', 'US', 'Kilmar Ábrego García', 'justice department news', 'Kilmar Ábrego García', 'Maryland', 'El Salvador', 'the United States', 'Tennessee', 'Ábrego García', 'the United States', 'the United States', 'Kilmar Ábrego García', 'Maryland', 'El Salvador', 'Pamela Jo Bondi', 'Bondi', 'Bukele', 'Bondi', 'Kilmar Ábrego García', 'US', 'Kilmar Ábrego García', 'Maryland', 'El Salvador', 'US', 'ABC News', 'Ábrego García', 'US', 'Tennessee', 'Ábrego García', 'Texas', 'US', 'China', 'London', 'Trump', 'US', 'China', 'London', 'Donald Trump', 'Truth Social', 'the Treasury Scott Bessent', 'Commerce', 'Howard Lutnick', 'United States Trade Representative', 'Jamieson Greer', 'London', 'Representatives of China', 'Trump', 'Xi Jinpingheld', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Xi', 'China', 'Xi', 'China', 'US', 'Elon Musk', 'Robert Tait', 'Elon Musk', 'the House of the Representatives', 'GOP', 'Congress', 'Capitol Hill', 'Donald Trump', 'the Oval Office', 'about $275', 'Trump', 'Washington', 'House', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Troy Nehls', 'GOP', 'Texas', 'Elon Musk', 'Jeff Van Drew', 'New Jersey', 'Trump', 'Kevin Hern', 'Oklahoma', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'GOP', 'Trump', 'California', 'CNN', 'Lauren Gambino', 'Trump', 'California', 'CNN', 'California', 'The White House', 'Trump', 'California', 'California', 'Trump', 'Los Angeles', 'House', 'Mike Johnson', 'CNBC', 'Elon Musk', 'Johnson', 'the United States', 'Donald Trump', 'the Trump-Musk']",,0

It was an unusual event. Multiple panelists told STAT on Wednesday they didn’t know what the agenda or goal of the meeting was. There was little debate. No details were hashed out, no specific promises made.
Guests from across academia, advocacy, and industry were told to each give a short statement on what the FDA “ought to know” about cell and gene therapy. That took two hours. Then health secretary Robert F.

President Donald Trump’s pick to be U.S. surgeon general has said the nation’s medical and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation’s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health.
Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products — including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service — in ways that put money in her own pocket.
A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.
In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.
Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn’t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a “material connection” to a product they promote.
Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.
“I fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.
The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government’s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users’ glucose levels, could benefit from this administration’s health guidance and policy.
Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.
The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being “bought off” or “corrupt” because of ties to industry.
Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.
Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.
“During my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,” she wrote on her website.
Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.
Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.
“At the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we’re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we’d want it,” she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.
But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.
During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn’t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.
Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to “encompass more and more of our lives,” said Emily Hund, author of “The Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.”
With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.
Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don’t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.
“A lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,” said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don’t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.
Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.
Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, “Good Energy""; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.
She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included “affiliate” or “partner” coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a “metabolic health collection.”
On a “My Faves” page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links “are affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.”
It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.
Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast “Let’s Be Honest” that “relationships are influential.”
“There’s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,"" Means said. ""We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.”
In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was “insanity” to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, “We need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren’t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.”
On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, “I do understand how it’s messy.”
Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a “Clean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations” guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.
Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.
Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an “Investor and/or Advisor.” The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.
Though the “About” page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that’s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.
Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice “transformational,” saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.
“I am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,” Niazi said in an email.
While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.
“What you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,” Sylvain said, adding, “Should there be any doubt about claims you make about products?”
Means isn’t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.
Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job — among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.
He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.
Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.
Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.
Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.
“This is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,” Hund said. “Is this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?”

Turkish authorities say they have suspended five elected mayors from duty, as the country’s opposition faces an ongoing crackdown
ISTANBUL -- Turkish authorities suspended five elected mayors from duty Thursday as part of an ongoing crackdown on the country's opposition.
Separately, prosecutors launched an investigation into the leader of the opposition Republican People’s Party, or CHP, over comments made in a speech Wednesday evening. Ozgur Ozel had criticized Istanbul’s chief prosecutor following the jailing of the mayors the previous day as part of a corruption investigation.
Officials from municipalities controlled by the CHP have faced waves of arrests this year, including Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who was detained in March over allegations of corruption.
Many consider the cases to be politically motivated although President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government insists the courts are impartial and free of political involvement.
Imamoglu is widely viewed as the main challenger to Erdogan’s two-decade rule and is the CHP’s candidate for a presidential election due in 2028, but which could be held earlier.
Istanbul and a clutch of major cities fell to the CHP in 2019, with the opposition extending its control in last year’s municipal elections.
The five suspended mayors represent the Istanbul districts of Avcilar, Buyukcekmece and Gaziosmanpasa, as well as Seyhan and Ceyhan in the Mediterranean province of Adana. Their suspensions were announced by the Interior Ministry after they were detained over claims of bribery and extortion.
A total of 11 mayors, including Imamoglu, have now been removed from office as part of investigations into CHP municipalities. Dozens of other officials have been imprisoned awaiting trial.
Imamoglu’s jailing led to the largest protests in Turkey for more than a decade, with demonstrators complaining of judicial abuses and wider democratic backsliding under Erdogan.
Speaking in Gaziosmanpasa on Wednesday evening, Ozel criticized Istanbul Chief Prosecutor Akin Gurlek, who has been the focus of opposition claims of political interference. This led to Gurlek’s office launching an investigation into charges of “threatening a judicial officer” and “insulting a public official.”",ABC News,['protests'],"['Turkey', 'ISTANBUL', 'People’s Party', 'CHP', 'Ozgur Ozel', 'Istanbul', 'CHP', 'Istanbul', 'Ekrem Imamoglu', 'Recep Tayyip Erdogan', 'Imamoglu', 'Erdogan', 'CHP', 'Istanbul', 'CHP', 'Istanbul', 'Avcilar', 'Buyukcekmece', 'Gaziosmanpasa', 'Seyhan', 'Ceyhan', 'Adana', 'the Interior Ministry', 'Imamoglu', 'CHP', 'Imamoglu', 'Turkey', 'Erdogan', 'Gaziosmanpasa', 'Ozel', 'Istanbul', 'Prosecutor Akin Gurlek', 'Gurlek']",,0

It has escalated recently after the Department of Homeland Security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students.

The dispute has been building for months after the Trump administration demanded a series of policy and governance changes at Harvard, calling it a hotbed of liberalism and accusing it of tolerating anti-Jewish harassment.

(AP) — President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation’s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health. Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products — including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service — in ways that put money in her own pocket. WATCH: The background and career of Casey Means, Trump’s pick for surgeon general A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses. In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found. Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn’t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a “material connection” to a product they promote. Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health. “I fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees. The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government’s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users’ glucose levels, could benefit from this administration’s health guidance and policy. Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients. The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being “bought off” or “corrupt” because of ties to industry. Means’ use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry. A compelling origin story Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine. “During my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,” she wrote on her website. Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors. Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures. “At the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we’re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we’d want it,” she said on Megyn Kelly’s podcast last year. But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests. During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn’t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest. Growing an audience, and selling products Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to “encompass more and more of our lives,” said Emily Hund, author of “The Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.” With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness. Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don’t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry. “A lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,” said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don’t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added. Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer. Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, “Good Energy”; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements. She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included “affiliate” or “partner” coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a “metabolic health collection.” On a “My Faves” page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links “are affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.” It’s not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process. Disclosing conflicts Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast “Let’s Be Honest” that “relationships are influential.” “There’s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,” Means said. “We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.” In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was “insanity” to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, “We need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren’t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.” On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, “I do understand how it’s messy.” Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a “Clean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations” guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales. Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company. Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an “Investor and/or Advisor.” The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship. Though the “About” page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that’s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it. Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives’ LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil’s founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means’ business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means’ advice “transformational,” saying her teachings reversed Niazi’s prediabetes and other ailments. “I am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,” Niazi said in an email. While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair. “What you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,” Sylvain said, adding, “Should there be any doubt about claims you make about products?” Potential conflicts pose new ethical questions Means isn’t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows. Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job — among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle. He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time. Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role. Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict. Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties. “This is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,” Hund said. “Is this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?” Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days.
Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday.
It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case.

It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way.
I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes.
The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before.
But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument.
Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air.
In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice.
Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.",CNN,['lawsuit'],"['Wilmington', 'Delaware', 'Dominion Voting Systems', '$1.6 billion', 'Murdoch Media', 'Fox News', 'Fox News', 'Fox News', 'Rupert Murdoch', 'Suzanne Scott', 'Tucker Carlson', 'Sean Hannity', 'Fox', 'Fox News', 'Fox News']",,0

President Donald Trump’s pick to be U.S. surgeon general has said the nation’s medical and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation’s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health.
Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products — including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service — in ways that put money in her own pocket.
A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.
In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.
Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn’t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a “material connection” to a product they promote.
Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.
“I fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.
The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government’s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users’ glucose levels, could benefit from this administration’s health guidance and policy.
Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.
The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being “bought off” or “corrupt” because of ties to industry.
Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.
Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.
“During my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,” she wrote on her website.
Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.
Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.
“At the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we’re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we’d want it,” she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.
But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.
During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn’t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.
Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to “encompass more and more of our lives,” said Emily Hund, author of “The Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.”
With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.
Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don’t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.
“A lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,” said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don’t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.
Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.
Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, “Good Energy""; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.
She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included “affiliate” or “partner” coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a “metabolic health collection.”
On a “My Faves” page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links “are affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.”
It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.
Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast “Let’s Be Honest” that “relationships are influential.”
“There’s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,"" Means said. ""We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.”
In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was “insanity” to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, “We need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren’t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.”
On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, “I do understand how it’s messy.”
Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a “Clean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations” guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.
Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.
Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an “Investor and/or Advisor.” The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.
Though the “About” page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that’s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.
Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice “transformational,” saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.
“I am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,” Niazi said in an email.
While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.
“What you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,” Sylvain said, adding, “Should there be any doubt about claims you make about products?”
Means isn’t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.
Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job — among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.
He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.
Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.
Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.
Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.
“This is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,” Hund said. “Is this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?”

Hedge funder Ken Griffin doesn’t get why Trump wants to take China’s jobs: ‘Why are we aspiring to be the nation of the lowest-cost workforce in the world?’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funder-ken-griffin-doesn-085600450.html,2025-06-06T08:56:00Z,,"Hedge funder Ken Griffin doesn’t get why Trump wants to take China’s jobs: ‘Why are we aspiring to be the nation of the lowest-cost workforce in the world?’
-
Citadel CEO Ken Griffin says President Donald Trump’s tariff policy on China is misguided as the jobs it would “reshore” are mostly those making low-value items. “There’s no money in there for anybody, and there’s certainly no money for doing those jobs,” Griffin said at a forum in New York.
Ken Griffin, the founder and CEO of Citadel Securities who backed Donald Trump in 2024 election, is taking issue with the president’s tariff policy.
Griffin tore into Trump’s tariffs during an appearance Thursday at the Forbes Iconoclast Summit in New York, describing tariffs as “protectionist policy” that “comes at a great price to the U.S. consumer.”
The president’s shifting tariff policy has resulted, for now, in a 30% tariff on most imports from China and the end of ultra-cheap imports from the likes of fast-fashion label Shein and Temu. And that pain for the U.S. consumer isn’t helping the American worker, Griffin said.
“Americans want to wear Nikes, not make them,” he said, quoting criticism from New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway.
“I don’t know why we strive to bring back low value-added products to the United States,” Griffin continued. “There’s no money in there for anybody, and there’s certainly no money for doing those jobs… Jobs are actually walking out of China into lower-cost jurisdictions.
“Why are we aspiring to be the nation of the lowest-cost workforce in the world?”
In fact, China is asking the same question, according to Griffin. Speaking with Forbes editor-at-large Maneet Ahuja at the summit, Griffin recounted his trip to China in March, when he met with multiple government officials to discuss investing in the country.
“China dreams to be like the United States—a nation of very high value-added jobs, a nation rich in services, rich in high development…[with] a stunning GDP per capita,” Griffin said.
“‘China aspires to be like the United States,’”Griffin said a Chinese government official told him. The person said, “‘We want to be like you. Why are you trying to be like us?’” and gave “a look of befuddlement,” according to Griffin.
Griffin said he does support reshoring jobs—but for high-technology, high-value products.
“It’s one thing to make Nikes, it’s another thing to make F-35 fighters,” he said.

Under Trump, it's becoming a liability
Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body
WASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.
Like other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world’s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation’s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.
Trump’s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His proclamation applies only to Harvard, and a federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked it. But Trump's order poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.
It’s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump’s gatekeeping powers.
“Columbia’s exposure to this ‘stroke of pen’ risk is uniquely high,” the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.
People from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia’s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.
Other highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.
As the middle class has grown in other countries, more families have been able to afford test prep and admissions guidance to compete for spots in the Ivy League, said Rajika Bhandari, who leads a firm of higher education consultants.
“The Ivy League brand is very strong overseas, especially in countries like India and China, where families are extremely brand-aware of top institutions in the U.S. and other competing countries,” Bhandari said in an email.
Over the last two decades, she said, U.S. universities have increasingly recognized the benefits of international exchange, seeing it as a crucial revenue source that subsidizes U.S. students and keeps enrollments up in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.
America’s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.
It was part of a “gold rush” in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.
“Whether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,"" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.
The race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren’t eligible for financial aid and, at some schools, they pay much higher tuition than their American counterparts. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.
Some wealthier universities — including Harvard — offer financial aid to foreign students. But students who get into those top-tier U.S. universities often have the means to pay higher tuition rates, Brustein said. That provides further incentive to enroll more foreign students, he said, saving more scholarship money for American students.
Still, international enrollment didn't expand equally across all types of colleges. Public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don’t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their enrollment of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by rising costs and student debt loads.
Proponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation’s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study STEM fields.
In the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard’s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia’s schools.
Harvard's undergraduate foreign population increased by about 100 students from 2013 to 2023, while graduate numbers increased by nearly 2,000. Part of that growth can be explained by increasing global competition at the graduate level, said William Kirby, a historian at Harvard who has written about the evolution of higher education.
“If you don’t recruit the very best students internationally in your most important graduate programs, particularly in science and engineering, then you will not be competitive,"" Kirby said.
The Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.
“That was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, ‘If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,’” he said.
Last week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.
“We have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can’t get in because we have foreign students there,” Trump said at a news conference.
The university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.”
In a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of “a painstaking, decades-long project” to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school’s mission and reputation, it said.
“In our interconnected global economy,"" the school said, “a university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.”

As a physician, I have witnessed firsthand the inefficiencies in our health care system that make it harder for patients to access the care they need. One of these complexities patients now have to navigate is a growing industry of insurance middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), whose practices meddling in our local health system increase health care costs and block access to critical medications.
PBMs work between health insurance companies and drug manufacturers to negotiate lower drug prices for the health plans they represent. Their function and influence in the health care industry have evolved significantly, and today, PBMs operate with very little oversight or transparency and their decisions are often based on what is most profitable for a health plan rather than what is best for a patient.
PBMs wield significant influence over what treatments patients can access and how much they will be required to pay. These middlemen receive significant rebates and discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers for the cost of medications and treatments after negotiations, but they don’t pass those savings on to patients receiving the care, increasing what patients are required to pay out of pocket when they pick up their medication at the pharmacy counter.
PBMs can also require only certain drugs be covered by a health plan, impose arbitrary rules around access to provider-prescribed medications, and PBM revenue is often directly linked to the list price of a medicine, so PBMs are incentivized to recommend treatments that would yield the most profit.
The three largest PBMs – CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx – manage nearly 80% of prescription drug claims for 270 million people across the country. To make matters worse, PBMs are increasingly integrating and consolidating with other health care services, including distributors and pharmacies, making the influence PBMs hold over the health care system even larger. As these for-profit entities merge and collaborate, it’s unclear if the system is actually functioning in the best interest of patients regarding quality and cost of care.
PBMs have flown under the radar for far too long, but scrutiny of these middlemen and their impact on our health care system has rightfully grown in recent years, with many federal and state policymakers and regulators calling attention to the outsized role PBMs play in driving up health care costs. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that PBM integration with chain pharmacies and insurers has allowed them to dominate the broader health system and that PBMs have significant control over what drugs are available to patients and how much they are required to pay.
The FTC even filed suit against the three of the nation’s largest PBMs, citing their anticompetitive tactics as a barrier to health care access. In addition, numerous investigations found that PBMs often act in their own financial interest, including pushing patients toward drugs with higher out-of-pocket costs because it’s more profitable for the PBM.
Access to consistent treatments is necessary for Louisiana patients, particularly those living with chronic health conditions or hard-to-treat illnesses such as cancer. Each year, more than 25,000 Louisianans receive a new cancer diagnosis. Alleviating access and financial barriers to care is a necessary step to improving health outcomes for patients.
It is overwhelmingly clear that we must take action to reform PBM practices to improve access to care for patients and stop letting middlemen meddle in our health system. There has never been a time when we can do more for patients as doctors, but at the same time, there has never been a time when we have more complexities in the health care systems impede healthcare access and affordability. This “profit over patients” business model is putting critical care out of reach for many Louisiana patients. Time is overdue to curb harmful PBM practices.

- Damian Williams is joining Jenner & Block, a Big Law firm fighting the Trump administration.
- Williams served as US Attorney in Manhattan, one of the most powerful Justice Department positions.
Damian Williams, one of the most prominent federal prosecutors in the country, is walking away from the law firm that struck a deal with Donald Trump — and joining one that's suing him.
Williams is leaving Paul Weiss five months after returning to the firm to work for Jenner & Block, a law firm actively challenging the Trump administration in court.
Jenner & Block announced the move Friday. Williams will serve as co-chair of both the firm's Litigation Department and its Investigations, Compliance, and Defense Practice.
The high-profile defection is a blow for Paul Weiss, an elite law firm that was the first to broker an agreement with President Donald Trump in March. As part of the deal, Paul Weiss said it would devote $40 million in pro bono hours toward Trump's political priorities. After it was announced, Trump rescinded an executive order that would have, among other sanctions, stripped Paul Weiss employees of security clearances and cut off government contracts.
Eight other firms have since made similar deals with the White House. Four — including Jenner & Block — opted to sue instead. All four have won court rulings blocking Trump's orders.
""Jenner & Block fearlessly advocates for its clients and provides outstanding strategic counsel through their most difficult challenges,"" Williams said in a press release. ""I've seen firsthand how this firm expertly tackles the toughest cases and lives its values.""
""I'm excited to join a team with an extraordinary depth of legal talent that doesn't shy away from hard fights — and delivers results that matter,"" his statement continued.
Williams isn't the only notable attorney to leave Paul Weiss in recent weeks. Karen Dunn, a prominent litigator who helped Kamala Harris prepare for her 2024 presidential debate with Trump, left along with three other top lawyers last month to start a new boutique law firm.
Williams previously served as the US Attorney in the Southern District of New York, one of the most powerful perches in the Justice Department. Williams brought criminal cases against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and now-former Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey.
Before that, Williams worked at Paul Weiss between 2009 and 2012 and clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens on the US Supreme Court and Merrick Garland on the federal appeals court in Washington, DC.
In Paul Weiss' January announcement about his return, Williams praised the firm's ""devotion to pro bono.""
""Damian is a transcendently talented lawyer who has led many of the government's highest-profile prosecutions and investigations,"" Paul Weiss's chair Brad Karp said at the time. ""He will be an exceptional addition to our already outstanding team of white collar and regulatory lawyers and a leader in the national legal community.""

Attorneys for a Guatemalan man deported to Mexico say he has landed in California
A Guatemalan man deported to Mexico, whom President Donald Trump's administration was working to bring back after a court order, landed in the United States on Wednesday, his attorneys confirmed.
The man, identified in court documents by initials O.C.G., landed in California via a commercial flight and made contact with his legal team while waiting in line to go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Trina Realmuto of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance.
He was later taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and was being transported to a detention facility in Arizona, she said in an email to The Associated Press.
The Trump administration said in court filings last month that it was working to bring him back after he was deported to Mexico, despite his fears of being harmed there, days after a federal judge ordered the administration to facilitate his return.
The U.S. Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to a request for comments and details from the AP.
The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge’s order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely “lacked any semblance of due process.”
Mexico later returned him to Guatemala, where he was in hiding, according to court documents.
In a court filing before his return, government lawyers said that a so-called significant public benefit parole packet had been approved. The designation allows people who aren’t eligible to enter the U.S. to do so temporarily, often for reasons related to law enforcement or legal proceedings.
An earlier court proceeding had determined that the man risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala. But he also feared returning to Mexico, where he says he was raped and extorted while seeking asylum in the U.S., according to court documents.
“As far as we know, it is the first time since January 20 that (Department of Homeland Security) has facilitated return following a district court order,” Realmuto said.
The case is among a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran man who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years.
The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House’s claim that it couldn’t retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him.",ABC News,"['department of homeland security', 'deportation']","['Guatemalan', 'Mexico', 'US', 'Guatemalan', 'Mexico', 'California', 'Guatemalan', 'Mexico', 'Donald Trump', 'the United States', 'O.C.G.', 'California', 'U.S. Customs and Border Protection', 'Trina Realmuto', 'the National Immigration Litigation Alliance', 'U.S. Immigration', 'Arizona', 'The Associated Press', 'Trump', 'Mexico', 'The U.S. Department of Justice', 'AP', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Mexico', 'U.S.', 'Brian Murphy', 'Mexico', 'Guatemala', 'n’t', 'U.S.', 'Guatemala', 'Mexico', 'U.S.', 'Department of Homeland Security', 'Trump', 'Kilmar Abrego Garcia', 'El Salvadoran', 'Maryland', 'The U.S. Supreme Court', 'Trump', 'Abrego Garcia’s', 'U.S.', 'the White House’s', 'the White House', 'El Salvadoran']",,0
Louisiana may finally buy new voting machines after Legislature approves new bidding process,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/legislature-approves-bidding-process-for-louisiana-voting-machines-system-procurement/article_af9f434c-8694-5dd6-aae0-b70456e7a8b2.html,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 04:00:00 -0500","After years of controversies, Louisiana may finally be on track to replace its decades-old voting machines.","Louisiana may finally be on track to replace its decades-old voting machines, after years of controversies over how to do so.
The Louisiana Legislature gave the Secretary of State the green light to use a new bidding process to pick a company that will replace the more than 10,000 machines that officials say are increasingly difficult to keep functioning.
“Our machines are 35 years old, it’s impossible to find parts, and they don’t produce an auditable paper record for each vote cast,” Secretary of State Nancy Landry told lawmakers on the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee last month.
“To put it bluntly, we’re in a dire situation, and we need a new voting system soon,” she said.
Under House Bill 577, the Secretary of State, which runs elections, will be authorized to purchase a new voting system using a bidding process called “invitation to negotiate” rather than a standard public bid process for state contracts.
The new process will hopefully allow the state to speed up how quickly it purchases a new voting system, Landry said.
But the Public Affairs Research Council Research of Louisiana says foregoing a public bidding process could lead to less transparency.
“We just want to make sure that there will be something available for the public to see at the end of this process to understand why the secretary of state’s office chose the vendor that it chose,” said PAR Research Director Melinda Deslatte.
“We’re not entirely certain yet if that information will be publicly available,” she added. “But we’re hopeful because the secretary of state’s office has indicated that they expect this to be a transparent process.”
The full Senate on Monday passed the measure on a 37-1 vote after the House earlier this month approved it without a single objection. The legislation now goes to the governor’s desk for signature.
Landry hopes to have a contract for the new voting system finalized by the end of 2025 and begin a “phased-in implementation” of the new system in 2026, said Secretary of State spokesperson Joel Watson.
The new bidding process
Under legislation passed in 2021, the Secretary of State must first certify that any voting machines to be considered in the procurement process comply with standards set out in state law. Bidding can then begin after certification.
Under the invitation to negotiate procedure in HB 577, the state invites vendors to submit competitive sealed responses as a starting point for negotiations. It is then empowered to select which vendors it wants to continue negotiations with.
In contrast, with a standard request for proposal, the state first defines detailed parameters of the product or service it needs and then solicits bids to meet those specs.
Bill sponsor Rep. Daryl Deshotel, R-Marksville, said invitation to negotiate gives the secretary of state the chance “to discuss with vendors their ability to provide needed and expected services,” and it gives the state more bargaining power in negotiations before making an award.
Deshotel told lawmakers on the Senate committee the concept is designed for large IT procurement. He sponsored legislation last year that added the new bidding process to the list of procurement methods authorized under state law.
“Invitation to negotiation is a public bid process,” Landry said. “It’s just more flexible … It allows you to exchange more information than an RFP does.”
The legislation also sets out an expedited timeline for any legal contest or appeal that arises related to the eventual voting system contract award.
“We can’t afford for that litigation to take years,” Nancy Landry told lawmakers last month.
Voting system controversies
Previous efforts to replace the voting system have stumbled at multiple junctures in the face of bid-rigging allegations.
And, in 2021 amid false claims of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election, state lawmakers added additional requirements to Louisiana’s voting system procurement effort.
Those included the creation of a Voting System Commission and a Voting System Proposal Evaluation Committee, the latter of which is required to “investigate and publicly test the voting systems” that are part of the bidding process and recommend a selection to the secretary of state.
“This bill does nothing to remove public input or transparency in the procurement process,” Landry said of this year’s House Bill 577.
Deslatte said PAR recognizes the challenges Landry faces in light of previous litigation over voting system contracts, and the organization plans to monitor the current effort.
“This contract is gonna be worth a lot of money,” she said, adding that any replacement voting system is “crucial to making sure election functions in this state.”
Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, a member of the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee, pressed Landry for more than a half hour, asking the secretary of state to promise that the Legislature would have “full oversight” of the entire process.

2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for 10 Years,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-132300756.html,2025-06-05T13:23:00Z,,"Warren Buffett may be stepping down from his role as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway by the end of the year, but the man's wisdom and investing philosophy remain timeless. Long after he's gone, people will look to the things he's said and the moves he's made for inspiration, an already popular habit on Wall Street.
Buffett's stock picks are carefully scrutinized because he's made a habit of beating the market over the long run, so for those looking for companies to invest in for a decade or more, it's not a bad idea to take a peek at his conglomerate's portfolio.
Here are two corporations in Berkshire Hathaway's list of holdings that are worth holding onto for a decade at least: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Visa(NYSE: V).
1. Amazon
Trade-related concerns have weighed on Amazon's stock this year. The company could experience decreased sales volume and increased costs within its e-commerce business if President Trump implements his plans for sweeping tariffs aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. Of course, Amazon would also suffer if the economy tanks. Even the company's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), would probably be affected.
Despite these issues, Amazon is an excellent stock to hold for the next decade. The company is capitalizing on two massive growth drivers: cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), both of which are still in their early stages, according to CEO Andy Jassy.
That statement should excite investors, considering that AWS has been one of Amazon's fastest-growing segments and a leading source of profit for a while now. Yet, a massive runway lies ahead. That's not all. Amazon's advertising business continues to grow rapidly. It ended 2024 with a $69 billion annual run rate, a figure that was just $29 billion four years ago -- that's a compound annual growth rate of 24.2%. Besides these fast-growing segments, Amazon's business is diversified. It has footprints in music and video streaming and grocery shopping and is increasingly making a move in healthcare with initiatives that are disrupting the field, such as Amazon Pharmacy.
The company may be a leader in several fast-growing markets, but its strongest qualities are its culture of innovation, which has enabled it to identify and pursue attractive opportunities multiple times, and its relentless focus on customer service. Amazon should be able to deliver market-beating results in the next decade thanks to these factors. That makes the stock a buy today despite the issues it faces.
2. Visa
Higher tariffs on imported goods could have an indirect impact on Visa. The company generates revenue by charging fees for the credit and debit card transactions it facilitates. If tariffs lead to higher prices for those items, that would be beneficial for the company, as the fees it charges are a percentage of the dollar transaction. It might also lead to less economic activity overall, which would harm the company. It's challenging to predict precisely how things will develop for Visa in the short run, given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policies.
However, the company's business has several advantages that investors should appreciate. Here are three. First, Visa generates juicy margins.
Gross margins in the neighborhood of 80%, while netting nearly $0.50 for every dollar it makes, is a dream come true for a company of this size. Visa's juicy margins stem from the fact that, since it has already built its payment network, additional transactions don't significantly increase the company's costs. Second, Visa doesn't directly issue credit cards. It simply operates a payment network that lets card transactions run smoothly on a global scale.
So, the company is not directly at risk of clients defaulting on their obligations. It lets issuing banks deal with that problem. Third, Visa benefits from a strong economic moat from the network effect. The more people hold credit or debit cards that bear its logo, the more attractive it is for businesses to accept them as a payment method.
These factors (and others) make Visa's business incredibly strong and consistently profitable. Regardless of what happens in the next few months, the company should continue to perform well as cash and checks increasingly fall out of favor. One factor driving this trend will be the growth of the e-commerce industry, where it's rare and difficult to execute transactions with cash.
However, even in the U.S., e-commerce sales accounted for just 16.2% of total retail sales in the first quarter. It hasn't peaked yet. It should provide ample growth fuel for Visa over the next decade and beyond. Lastly, the company is an excellent dividend stock, even with an unimpressive forward yield of 0.7% -- the S&P 500's average is 1.3%. Visa has increased its payouts by almost 392% in the past decade. The stock should appeal to both growth and dividend investors.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital in a statement that ""DHS has been working at a neck-breaking speed to secure our border"" and remove ""criminal illegal aliens out of our country.""
The waivers cover several projects, including filling gaps in the Yuma Sector and making developments on the wall in the El Paso Sector, according to a news release. In addition, 24 miles will be part of the Tucson Sonoita Project.

The gaps between barriers are also known to be used for cartel activity.

Critics of further wall construction have largely cited environmental concerns.

A federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked a proclamation by President Donald Trump that banned foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked a proclamation by President Donald Trump that banned foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University.
Trump's proclamation, issued Wednesday, was the latest attempt by his administration to prevent the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college from enrolling a quarter of its students, who accounts for much of Harvard’s research and scholarship.
Harvard filed a legal challenge the next day, asking for a judge to block Trump’s order and calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard’s rejection of White House demands. Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order.
A few hours later, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against Trump’s Wednesday proclamation. Harvard, she said, had demonstrated it would sustain “immediate and irreparable injury” before she would have an opportunity to hear from the parties in the lawsuit.
Burroughs also extended the temporary hold she placed on the administration's previous attempt to end Harvard's enrollment of international students. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork to them for their visas, only to have Burroughs block the action temporarily. Trump’s order this week invoked a different legal authority.
If Trump’s measure were to survive this court challenge, it would block thousands of students who are scheduled to come to Harvard's campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for the summer and fall terms.
“Harvard’s more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders — and their dependents — have become pawns in the government’s escalating campaign of retaliation,” Harvard wrote Thursday in a court filing.
While the court case proceeds, Harvard is making contingency plans so students and visiting scholars can continue their work at the university, President Alan Garber said in a message to the campus and alumni.
“Each of us is part of a truly global university community,” Garber said Thursday. “We know that the benefits of bringing talented people together from around the world are unique and irreplaceable.”
Harvard has attracted a growing number of the brightest minds from around the world, with international enrollment growing from 11% of the student body three decades ago to 26% today.
As those students wait to find out if they'll be able to attend the university, some are pursuing other options.
Rising international enrollment has made Harvard and other elite colleges uniquely vulnerable to Trump's crackdown on foreign students. Republicans have been seeking to force overhauls of the nation's top colleges, which they see as hotbeds of “woke” and antisemitic viewpoints.
Garber says the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its “core, legally-protected principles,” even after receiving federal ultimatums.
Trump's administration has also taken steps to withhold federal funding from Harvard and other elite colleges that have rejected White House demands related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Harvard's $53 billion endowment allows it to weather the loss of funding for a time, although Garber has warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” to come.
But cutting off students and visiting scholars could hamstring the university's research and global standing.

Will Trump’s 12-Country Travel Ban Trigger Protests Like His “Muslim Ban” Did?,https://truthout.org/articles/will-trumps-12-country-travel-ban-trigger-protests-like-his-muslim-ban-did/,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 19:15:10 +0000","The executive order places a travel ban or harsh restrictions on 19 nations, including some with Muslim majorities.","Progressive lawmakers, civil rights groups, and humanitarians responded with outrage and condemnation overnight and into Thursday after President Donald Trump announced a blanket travel ban on 12 countries and harsh restrictions on seven others, calling the move a hateful and “unlawful” regurgitation of a policy he attempted during his first term.
In total, the executive order from Trump’s White House would impact people and families from 19 countries. Twelve nations would face a total ban: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. People from seven other nations would face severe restrictions: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.
In a video posted to social media late Wednesday night, Trump cited this week’s attack, carried out by a lone individual in Colorado, to attempt to justify the need for the far-reaching restrictions, which the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, decried as “unnecessary, overbroad and ideologically motivated.”
While the order sparked fresh condemnation, it does not come as a surprise from the Trump administration, which has made xenophobic rhetoric and anti-immigrant policy a cornerstone of its tenure. As the Washington Post reports:
Reinstating a travel ban has been a long-standing campaign promise for Trump. During his first term,he initially barred travel from seven Muslim-majority countries — under what became known as “the Muslim ban.”
After legal challenges, updated versions expanded the list to eight countries, including North Korea and Venezuela. President Joe Biden revoked the policy in 2021.
“Automatically banning students, workers, tourists, and other citizens of these targeted nations from coming to the United States will not make our nation safer,” said Nihad Awad, the executive director of CAIR, in response to Trump’s new order. “Neither will imposing vague ideological screening tests that the government can easily abuse to ban immigrants based on their religious identity and political activism.”
Even with the exceptions outlined in Trump’s executive order, said Awad, “this new travel ban risks separating families, depriving students of educational opportunities, blocking patients from access to unique medical treatment, and creating a chilling effect on travelers.”
Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Pramila Jayapal of Washington spoke out forcefully against the presidential order.
“This discriminatory policy is beyond shameful,” said Omar in reaction to the news. “Just like his first Muslim Ban, this latest announcement flies in the face of basic morality and goes directly against our values. This racist policy will not make us safe; it will separate families and endanger lives. We cannot let it stand.”
In her statement, Jayapal said there “are a myriad of reasons that people come to the United States, from travel and tourism to fleeing violence and dangerous situations. This ban, expanded from Trump’s Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage.”
Jayapal continued by saying the “discriminatory policy,” which she noted is an attack on legal immigration processes, “not only flies in the face of what our country is supposed to stand for, it will be harmful to our economy and our communities that rely on the contributions of people who to America from this wide range of countries. Banning a whole group of people because you disagree with the structure or function of their government not only lays blame in the wrong place, it creates a dangerous precedent.”
Referencing the broader approach of Trump’s policies, Jayapal accused Trump of “indiscriminately taking a chainsaw to our government, destroying federal agencies that keep us safe, indiscriminately cutting jobs, and hindering our progress across research fields. This will only further hurt our country, and cannot be allowed to stand.”
Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) offered a similar assessment:
Oxfam America also slammed the announcement.
“A new travel ban marks a chilling return to policies of fear, discrimination, and division,” said Abby Maxman, the group’s president and CEO.
“By once again targeting individuals from Muslim-majority countries, countries with predominantly Black and brown populations, and countries in the midst of conflict and political instability, this executive order deepens inequality and perpetuates harmful stereotypes, racist tropes, and religious intolerance,” said Maxman. “This policy is not about national security — it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States.”
The travel ban on predominantly Muslim-majority nations attempted by Trump during his first term sparked large public protests as well as a wave of legal challenges. The new ban is likely to garner a similar response.
“This latest travel ban would deny entry to individuals and families fleeing war, persecution, and oppression, forcing them to remain in dangerous conditions. It will prevent family reunifications, and America’s historical legacy as a welcoming nation will be further eroded,” said Maxman. “Oxfam will continue to advocate to ensure that this ban is struck down. The U.S. must uphold the dignity and rights of all people, no matter their religion or country of origin.”

He accused Trump of betraying promises to cut federal spending, shared a suggestion that the president should be impeached and claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about his association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Perhaps most viciously, Musk insisted that Trump wouldn’t have won last year’s election without his help. Trump, not one to slouch from a fight, could hold back no longer. He posted that Musk had been “wearing thin,” that he had “asked him to leave” his administration, that the tech titan had “gone CRAZY.” Maybe, Trump threatened, he should save taxpayer money by canceling government contracts and subsidies for Musk’s companies.

Gulf Coast Communities Take on Insurers Backing Trump-Approved Fossil Fuels,https://truthout.org/articles/gulf-coast-communities-take-on-insurers-backing-trump-approved-fossil-fuels/,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 15:45:05 +0000",Organizers in Louisiana are fighting the Trump administration’s efforts to expand methane export infrastructure.,"Promising U.S. “energy dominance,” the Trump administration is moving to accelerate fossil fuel production. Key to this agenda is the approval of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities across Gulf Coast communities that are disproportionately Black, Brown, and low-income, long treated as expendable “sacrifice zones” by the fossil fuel industry.
Just recently, on May 23, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reauthorized the massive CP2 LNG in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which will be the biggest LNG export facility in the U.S.
Local organizers and climate groups have been fighting the expansion of these “methane export facilities” which they say will intensify climate chaos and environmental racism. To try to halt them, they’re focusing on key actors behind these fossil fuel projects: the big financiers and insurers whose services these projects need in order to gain regulatory approval and to be built and operated.
A new report by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) maps out the known insurers of the buildout of LNG export facilities in Southwest Louisiana and discusses the numerous financial and reputational risks these companies face in propping up an industry tied to a volatile market fueling climate crisis and threatening local communities.
“They’re financing and insuring environmental racism because these projects are overwhelmingly situated in Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities they feel are the path of least resistance,” Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project in Lake Charles, Louisiana, told Truthout.
Gulf Coast “Sacrifice Zones”
U.S. exports of LNG, or fracked gas that has been cooled into liquid to ship, have boomed over the past decade. LNG has been promoted by the fossil fuel industry as a cleaner “bridge fuel” toward renewable energy, a debunked claim that some view as a form of greenwashing. The production, transport, processing, and burning of fracked gas releases large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
The U.S. is the world’s top exporter of fracked gas. In recent years, the fossil fuel industry and its Wall Street investors have sought to expand U.S. LNG export facilities. Immediately after his January 2025 inauguration, Donald Trump restarted applications for new LNG export terminals that were paused by Joe Biden a year earlier.
The epicenter of the buildout has been the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, where there are currently around two dozen LNG expansion projects being constructed or proposed. These facilities are located in places like Port Arthur, Texas, and Cameron Parish, Louisiana, communities that are overwhelmingly Black, Brown, and low-income, and where clusters of toxic refining and petrochemical plants have long operated.
The United Nations has called areas like these “sacrifice zones,” defined as “extremely contaminated areas where vulnerable and marginalized groups bear a disproportionate burden of the health, human rights and environmental consequences of exposure to pollution and hazardous substances.” Research shows that local Black, Brown, and Indigenous workers do not benefit equitably from the jobs and other economic benefits the fossil fuel industry often promises when building new facilities.
A 2024 Greenpeace report found that the building of planned LNG projects would result annually in 149 premature deaths and $2.33 billion in health costs, with areas in Southwest Louisiana “slated to suffer the worst air pollution impacts per capita” and with air pollution from LNG terminals disproportionately affecting Black and Brown residents.
Environmental Racism and Climate Crisis
According to a new report by RAN, over 20 additional LNG expansion projects have been proposed in the Gulf Coast region in addition to six existing export terminals. These enormous projects have names like Sabine Pass LNG, Cameron LNG, and Calcasieu Pass LNG. Their corporate backers include Sempra, Energy Transfer, Cheniere, Kimmeridge, and Venture Global.
These facilities, however, are far from uncontested, facing major opposition from community organizers like Roishetta Ozane.
A mother of six who lives just outside Lake Charles, Louisiana, Ozane founded the Vessel Project in 2020 amid her efforts to help the community respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and displacement from Hurricanes Laura and Delta. The Vessel Project uses mutual aid to build community and create the conditions for sustained organizing for environmental justice.
“We make sure that people’s immediate needs are met before we talk about stopping an LNG facility,” she told Truthout. “That way, we’ve been able to grow our base of community members who show up at meetings and town halls and who travel with us to D.C. or New York City.”
Ozane spoke of the environmental and health fallouts her community has suffered living “right in the midst of a mixture of industries,” including explosions, fires, and smoke clouds at petrochemical plants, with consequences for her own family. “We get all the cumulative impacts living in a fenceline community,” she said. “My children have asthma and eczema. My son has epilepsy, which I believe was exacerbated by the pollution from the facilities.”
As Ozane responded to crisis after crisis, she started making connections between the environmental racism and extreme weather her community experienced and the wider climate crisis tied to local industries. “I was trying to connect the dots for people,” she said. “All of these facilities are releasing gas into the air, and it’s what’s warming our planet. It’s what’s causing these storms to be more severe.”
Going After the Insurers
Organizing to halt the buildout of LNG export facilities and other fossil fuel infrastructure has led Ozane and others toward a concerted strategy: pressuring big financiers and insurers to stop propping up these projects.
“The banks and the insurance companies are the ones actually supporting the fossil fuel industry behind the scenes,” Ruth Breech of RAN, and a coauthor of the RAN report, told Truthout.
The past decade has seen the climate and environmental justice movement target the money behind the fossil fuel industry, such as banks JPMorgan and Citi, asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and insurers like AIG and Liberty Mutual. While ExxonMobil or Chevron may cling to its core business of oil and gas production, these financial firms are more diversified, risk-averse and susceptible to public shaming.
“If our elected officials are going to approve these projects, then our hope lies in the banks and the investors and the insurance companies,” said Ozane.
Ozane co-leads the Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub, a coalition aimed at bringing pressure from local communities to bear on these financial giants. “We bring frontline folks in front of these banks and insurance companies to say you’re insuring and financing environmental racism,” she said.
More than any other financial backers, insurance corporations may be most vulnerable around fossil fuels, since climate chaos presents an existential threat to the industry’s business model.
The RAN report, which the Vessel Project and Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub signed onto, maps out some of the known insurers, based on information from FOIA requests and lawsuit filings, behind Southwest Louisiana’s LNG export buildout. For example, insurers behind Cameron LNG include Chubb, AIG, Allianz, Liberty Mutual, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Zurich, Tokio Marine, The Hartford, and others, according to RAN.
The report highlights the significant risks for insurers in underwriting the Gulf Coast LNG buildout, including financial instability tied to regulatory and construction delays and the problem of oversupply and overcapacity with these facilities. Multiple reports warn that U.S. shale production is facing decline in prices and market volatility.
The report also notes the reputational and financial risks to insurers that prop up an industry that perpetuates harmful health impacts, safety hazards, climate risks, and disruptions to local ecosystems. LNG export facilities have been plagued by thousands of permit violations and extensive operational problems and accidents, with one of the most infamous being a 2022 explosion and fire at Freeport LNG that led to an eight-month shutdown.
“They Know Me by Name”
Both Breech and Ozane emphasized the hypocrisy behind the insurance industry’s continued underwriting of fossil fuels. “We’re seeing people across the nation lose their home insurance coverage because of the impacts of climate change,” said Breech. “Then we’re seeing these insurance companies continue to provide insurance for new fossil fuel projects.”
Ozane said it’s frustrating to see insurers prop up an industry in her community that is driving the very climate chaos that’s making home insurance in Louisiana unaffordable. “For insurance companies to insure one of these climate monsters, and then turn around and not insure the people who live in the communities at a reasonable rate, is outright wrong,” she said.
For RAN and the Vessel Project, the global insurance powerhouse Chubb has been a key focus. Breech says Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg is “an influencer personality” within the insurance industry, similar to JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon in banking. Chubb has also been open to engaging with community members. Ozane has met with representatives from Chubb several times, bringing her children to the meetings. “They know me by name,” she says.
In 2024, Chubb reported dropping 32 major oil and gas clients who didn’t meet its methane emissions standards. Chubb has dropped its coverage of the Rio Grande LNG, a proposed LNG export terminal in Brownsville, Texas, and it ruled out insuring the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. As recently reported by Inside Climate News, Chubb also dropped its coverage of Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG.
But for organizers like Ozane, Chubb isn’t going far enough. She wants them to rule out insuring another LNG export terminal, Venture Global’s huge CP2, which just received FERC approval. Ozane told Truthout that she’s currently trying to arrange a “toxic tour” for FERC so the commission can see the cumulative impacts of the fossil fuel industry on her community.
According to the Sierra Club LNG Export Tracker, CP2’s annual emissions will be the equivalent of 54 coal burning power plants once two phases of expansion are completed.
CP2’s insurers are currently unknown, RAN reports.
“If you’re insuring this project, you’re ensuring this community’s destruction,” Ozane said. “It would be easy for Chubb to say, if CP2 gets all of its permits, we’re not going to insure them.”
Truthout contacted Chubb to ask if the company was insuring CP2, and also if its decision to drop coverage of Calcasieu Pass LNG could mean Chubb would decide to not insure CP2, but received no response.
RAN told Truthout that it’s demanding Chubb drop its coverage of Cameron LNG by June and Freeport LNG by October, and that it stops insuring all “methane terminals.”
Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg took in $82 million in total compensation between 2022 and 2024. By contrast, the per capita income in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is $35,847, with a poverty rate of 23.2 percent, according to census data.
“We Can’t Take Anymore”
The RAN report demands that banks and insurers stop supporting fossil fuel expansion projects. It also demands that banks and insurance companies “follow a human rights due diligence framework” and consult with community leaders and organizations from municipalities and parishes where LNG export facilities are being sited to identify and assess human rights risks, and for these companies to do their own site visits to conduct human rights, environmental and environmental justice assessments.
“We’re talking about serious human rights implications in these projects,” said Breech. “Southwest Louisiana is not an energy sacrifice zone, and it’s not acceptable to have all of these proposals in this area.”
With hurricane season approaching, Ozane stresses the urgency of halting the LNG export buildout that’s blanketing her community. She is hosting a hurricane preparedness festival highlighting the intersection of fossil fuel pollution and climate-induced disasters.
Truthout asked Ozane what she would say to Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg if she could speak directly to him.
“I would say that if you insure CP2 you are insuring the death of my children and my community,” she said. “We are already suffering from the pollution that’s coming from the surrounding facilities. We can’t take anymore.”
Truthout also asked Ozane what victory would ultimately look like for her.
“Victory looks like we are no longer dependent on fossil fuels here and that there’s another economy here,” she said. “We’re back to our fishermen being able to live off of fishing and oysters and shrimping. We see a beautiful coast free of the industry that’s now polluting the water.”
“Victory will look like my 7-year-old going outside to play without coming back into the house saying that he can’t breathe,” she says.

Education Secretary Won't Say If She Knows What The Tulsa Race Massacre Is,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/linda-mcmahon-summer-lee-tulsa-massacre_n_6840ce59e4b04981b63ab849,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 22:08:50 -0400","“I’d like to look into it more and get back to you on it,” Linda McMahon told a House committee.","Education Secretary Linda McMahon deflected when asked if she knew what the Tulsa Race Massacre was during a Wednesday congressional hearing, telling lawmakers that she intends to “look into it more.”
McMahon’s response comes as Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.) pressed her about history lessons that would be considered “illegal DEI” by the Trump administration. (DEI stands for diversity, equity and inclusion and has been used by Republicans as shorthand for initiatives addressing race and gender, among other topics.) The comments are also the latest to suggest that McMahon — a former pro wrestling executive who’s had little education policy experience — could use a lesson or two herself.
“Would it be ‘illegal DEI’ for a lesson plan on the Tulsa Race Massacre?” Lee asked McMahon during the Wednesday panel.
“I’d have to get back to you on that,” McMahon said.
“Do you know what the Tulsa Race Massacre is?” Lee asked.
“I’d like to look into it more and get back to you on it,” McMahon replied.
McMahon was similarly evasive when asked if lessons involving civil rights trailblazer Ruby Bridges would be deemed “illegal DEI.”
“How about the book ‘Through My Eyes,’ by Ruby Bridges, for instance?” Lee asked.
“I haven’t read that,” McMahon responded.
“Have you learned about Ruby Bridges?” Lee said.
“If you have specific examples, you’d like to –” McMahon countered.
“That was a specific example... I named a specific book,” Lee emphasized.
McMahon’s exchange with Lee stood out both for her refusal to acknowledge whether she knew about major historical events as well as her reluctance to answer if the White House would target lessons about them.
A January executive order from the Trump administration called for agencies to find ways to claw back resources from schools that advance “gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology” in their curriculum. And in April, the White House required K-12 schools to certify that they were not engaging in “illegal DEI practices” in order to receive federal funding, an act that’s been blocked by a federal judge.
The Department of Education did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment.
Both of Lee’s questions referred to significant events in U.S. history: The Tulsa Race Massacre took place in 1921 and was “one of America’s deadliest acts of domestic terrorism,” Taryn Finley previously wrote for HuffPost. During the attack, an armed white mob decimated a neighborhood in Tulsa known as Black Wall Street, killing as many as 300 people.
And in 1960, Bridges was the first Black child to desegregate an all-white elementary school in New Orleans. Iconic images from that time captured Bridges, at age 6, flanked by U.S. Marshals and white crowds jeering as she entered the building.
Lee emphasized that such lessons are critical for students as the Trump administration has sought to hold federal funding captive if schools advance programs that it disagrees with.
“Their lack of knowledge, denial of history, and open racism doesn’t mean students across America should be deprived of learning opportunities or access to a quality education,” she told HuffPost in a statement. “Clearly they’re still needed.”",Huffington Post,"['civil rights', 'education secretary', 'executive order', 'dei', 'executive order']","['Education', 'Linda McMahon', 'the Tulsa Race Massacre', 'McMahon', 'Summer Lee', 'DEI', 'Trump', 'DEI', 'McMahon', 'DEI', 'the Tulsa Race Massacre', 'Lee', 'McMahon', 'McMahon', 'the Tulsa Race Massacre', 'Lee', 'McMahon', 'McMahon', 'Ruby Bridges', 'DEI', 'Ruby Bridges', 'Lee', 'McMahon', 'Ruby Bridges', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'McMahon', 'Lee', 'the White House', 'Trump', 'the White House', 'DEI', 'The Department of Education', 'Lee', 'U.S.', 'The Tulsa Race Massacre', 'America', 'Taryn Finley', 'Tulsa', 'Black Wall Street', 'Bridges', 'New Orleans', 'Bridges', 'U.S. Marshals', 'Lee', 'Trump', 'America']",Value & Future of Higher Education,1
"Man Accused Of Boulder, Colorado, Firebombing Charged With 118 Criminal Counts",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-boulder-attack_n_68420f3de4b04e411be656d2,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 17:49:09 -0400","Mohamed Soliman, 45, is accused of yelling “Free Palestine” and throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.","BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — A man accused of yelling “Free Palestine” and throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza was charged Thursday with attempted murder, assault, cruelty to animals and explosives crimes in a Colorado court.
Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was advised of the charges during a court hearing in Boulder where he appeared in person. He has been jailed since his arrest following Sunday’s attack. Investigators say Soliman, who posed as a gardener, had planned it for a year.
Authorities have said 15 people and a dog were victims of the attack.
Soliman is charged with 118 counts, including attempt to commit murder, assault in the first and third degrees, use of explosive or incendiary devices, cruelty to animals and crime of violence. He has also been charged with a hate crime in federal court and is jailed on a $10 million cash bond.
Soliman’s attorney, Kathryn Herold, waived a formal reading of the charges Thursday in court. A preliminary hearing has been set for July 15.
Soliman had planned to kill all of the roughly 20 participants the weekly demonstration at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, but he threw just two of his 18 Molotov cocktails while yelling “Free Palestine,” police said. Soliman didn’t carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” police wrote in an affidavit.
According to an FBI affidavit, Soliman told police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people” — a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel. Authorities said he expressed no remorse about the attack.
Boulder County officials said in a news release that the victims include eight women and seven men ranging in age from 25 to 88, and a dog. Details about how the victims were impacted would be explained in criminal charges set to be filed Thursday, said Boulder County District Attorney’s office spokesperson Shannon Carbone.
Defendant’s Family Investigated
U.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher on Wednesday granted a request to block the deportation of Soliman’s wife and five children, who like Soliman are Egyptian. U.S. immigration officials took them into custody Tuesday, but they have not been charged in the attack.
U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Wednesday that the family was being processed for removal.
“It is patently unlawful to punish individuals for the crimes of their relatives,” attorneys for the family wrote in a lawsuit filed Wednesday afternoon.
Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the plaintiff’s claims “absurd” and “an attempt to delay justice.” She said the entire family was living in the U.S. illegally.
Soliman’s wife, Hayam El Gamal, a 17-year-old daughter, two minor sons and two minor daughters were being held at an immigration detention center in Texas, said Eric Lee, one of the attorney’s representing the family.
Soliman told authorities that no one, including his family, knew he was planning an attack, according to court documents. El Gamal said she was “shocked” to learn her husband had been arrested in the attack, according to her lawsuit.
The Family’s Immigration Status
Before moving to Colorado Springs three years ago, Soliman spent 17 years in Kuwait, according to court documents.
He arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, McLaughlin said in a post on X. She said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that has also expired.
Hundreds of thousands of people overstay their visas each year in the United States, according to Department of Homeland Security reports.
Soliman’s wife is an Egyptian national, according to her lawsuit. She is a network engineer and has a pending EB-2 visa, which is available to professionals with advanced degrees, the suit said. She and her children all are listed as dependents on Soliman’s asylum application.
A Vigil For The Victims
Hundreds of people squeezed into the Jewish Community Center in Boulder for a vigil Wednesday evening that featured prayer, singing and emotional testimony from a victim and witnesses of the firebombing attack in the city’s downtown.
Rachelle Halpern, who has participated in such demonstrations since 2023, said she remembers thinking it was strange to see a man with a canister looking like he was going to spray pesticide on the grass. Then she heard a crash and screams and saw flames around her feet.
“A woman stood one foot behind me, engulfed in flames from head to toe, lying on the ground with her husband,” she said. “People immediately, three or four men immediately rushed to her to smother the flames.”
Her description prompted murmurs from the audience members. One woman’s head dropped into her hands.
“I heard a loud noise, and the back of my legs burning, and don’t remember those next few moments,” said a victim, who didn’t want to be identified and spoke off camera, over the event’s speakers. “Even as I was watching it unfold before my eyes, even then, it didn’t seem real.”

The spectacular blow-up between the president of the United States and the world’s richest man played out on their respective social media platforms after Trump first broached the topic in a White House meeting with Germany’s new leader.

But Trump clapped back Thursday in the Oval Office, lamented their frayed relationship and said he was “very disappointed in Musk.” Musk responded on social media in real time. Trump ratcheted up the stakes when he turned to his own social media network, Truth Social, and threatened to use the U.S. government to hurt Musk’s bottom line with his internet company Starlink and rocket company SpaceX.

It also quickly hit Musk financially, even before Trump’s threat. READ MORE: Musk slams Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ bill as GOP senators race to meet July 4th deadline After Trump started speaking about Musk, shares of his electric vehicle company Tesla fell 9%, their latest notable move since the election. The shares doubled in the weeks after Trump was elected, gave back those gains and more during Musk’s time at DOGE and then rallied after he vowed in April to focus much more on Tesla and his other companies. Musk later offered up an especially stinging insult to a president sensitive about his standing among voters: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” Musk retorted. “Such ingratitude,” Musk said in a follow-up post. Politicians and their donor patrons rarely see eye to eye. But the magnitude of Musk’s support for Trump, spending at least $250 million backing his campaign, and the scope of free reign the president gave him to slash and delve into the government with the Department of Government Efficiency is eclipsed only by the speed of their falling out. Musk announced his support for Trump shortly after the then-candidate was nearly assassinated on stage at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally last July. News of Musk’s political action committee in support of Trump’s election came days later. Musk soon became a close adviser and frequent companion, memorably leaping in the air behind Trump on stage at a rally in October. Once Trump was elected, the tech billionaire stood behind him as he took the oath of office, flew with him on Air Force One for weekend stays at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, slept in the White House’s Lincoln Bedroom at the president’s invitation and joined his Cabinet meetings wearing a MAGA hat (sometimes more than one). “I’ll be honest, I think he missed the place,” Trump said Thursday. “He got out there, and all of a sudden he wasn’t in this beautiful Oval Office.” Musk bid farewell to Trump last week in a subdued news conference in the Oval Office, where he sported a black eye that he said came from his young son but that seemed to be a metaphor for his messy time in government service. Trump, who rarely misses an opportunity to zing his critics on appearance, brought it up Thursday. “I said, ‘Do you want a little makeup? We’ll get you a little makeup.’ Which is interesting,” Trump said. The Republican president’s comments came as Musk has stewed for days on social media about Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” warning that it will increase the federal deficit. Musk has called the bill a “disgusting abomination.” “He hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that will be next,” Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office. “But I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.” Observers had long wondered if the friendship between the two brash billionaires known for lobbing insults online would flame out in spectacular fashion. It did, in less than a year. “Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said. The president said some people who leave his administration “miss it so badly” and “actually become hostile.” “It’s sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it,” he said. He brushed aside the billionaire’s efforts to get him elected last year, including a $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes in Pennsylvania. The surge of cash Musk showed he was willing to spend seemed to set him up as a highly coveted ally for Republicans going forward, but his split with Trump, the party’s leader, raises questions about whether they or any others will see such a campaign windfall in the future. Trump said Musk, the CEO and founder of Tesla, “only developed a problem” with the bill because it rolls back tax credits for electric vehicles. “False,” Musk fired back on his social media platform as the president continued speaking. “This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!” In another post, he said Trump could keep the spending cuts but “ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.” The bill would unleash trillions of dollars in tax cuts and slash spending but also spike deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade and leave some 10.9 million more people without health insurance, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, which for decades has served as the official scorekeeper of legislation in Congress. Besides Musk being “disturbed” by the electric vehicle tax credits, Trump said another point of contention was Musk’s promotion of Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Trump withdrew Isaacman’s nomination over the weekend, days after Musk left his government role. “I didn’t think it was appropriate,” Trump said, calling Isaacman “totally a Democrat.” Musk, reverting to his main form of political activity before he joined forces with Trump, continued slinging his responses on social media. He shared some posts Trump made over a decade ago criticizing Republicans for their spending, musings made when he, too, was just a billionaire lobbing his thoughts on social media. “Where is the man who wrote these words?” Musk wrote. “Was he replaced by a body double!?” Chris Megerian and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report.

Trump said Musk, the CEO and founder of Tesla, “only developed a problem” with the bill because it rolls back tax credits for electric vehicles. “False,” Musk fired back on his social media platform as the president continued speaking. “This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!” In another post, he said Trump could keep the spending cuts but “ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.” The bill would unleash trillions of dollars in tax cuts and slash spending but also spike deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade and leave some 10.9 million more people without health insurance, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, which for decades has served as the official scorekeeper of legislation in Congress. Besides Musk being “disturbed” by the electric vehicle tax credits, Trump said another point of contention was Musk’s promotion of Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Trump withdrew Isaacman’s nomination over the weekend, days after Musk left his government role. “I didn’t think it was appropriate,” Trump said, calling Isaacman “totally a Democrat.” Musk, reverting to his main form of political activity before he joined forces with Trump, continued slinging his responses on social media. He shared some posts Trump made over a decade ago criticizing Republicans for their spending, musings made when he, too, was just a billionaire lobbing his thoughts on social media. “Where is the man who wrote these words?” Musk wrote. “Was he replaced by a body double!?” Chris Megerian and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report.

Chinese students hoping to study at Harvard, the US’s oldest and wealthiest university, are under particular pressure after the Trump administration announced on Wednesday that it was banning the school from enrolling new foreign students. The presidential proclamation cited Harvard’s links with China as a particular cause for concern.
For Jerry*, a 22-year-old applied mathematics student at the University of California, Los Angeles, the uncertainty started last month, when the Trump administration suddenly halted Harvard University’s ability to enrol any international students.
Jerry has a place on a health data science masters programme at Harvard, which is due to start in the autumn. The US government’s attempt to ban Harvard from accepting international students appears to have been blocked, at least temporarily, by the courts. But Trump’s announcement on Wednesday invokes a different legal authority.
Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, has announced that the authorities will be targeting Chinese students specifically, nationwide.
It is “total discrimination,” Jerry said. “I don’t think anyone would consider that reason sufficient. That’s just pushing Chinese students to go elsewhere”.
Unsure about whether or not he will be able to enrol at Harvard, Jerry is considering taking up a place on a DPhil (PhD) programme at Oxford University in the UK. He said on Thursday that following Trump’s latest attack on Harvard, Oxford seems like an even more likely option.
Although he hopes to study at Harvard, Jerry feels lucky to have a back-up plan. “A lot of the people who accepted Harvard offers don’t have other options. So it must be much more anxious for them”.
Across the US, universities have been scrambling to find ways to reassure the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students on their campuses about their academic future.
In a memo sent to Chinese students at University of Oregon, the school described the state department’s announcement about revoking the visas for Chinese students as “vague” and said: “A revoked passport does not impact your legal status in the US because it is only an entry document used when entering the US”. However, the university warned that a revoked visa could lead to removal proceedings by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).
Warning about being targeted by ICE have taken on a new gravity since the agency started targeting international students with the lawful right to remain in the country. They include Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestine activist who was detained despite holding a green card to reside in the US. Khalil is now fighting a deportation order.
Steven*, a 34-year-old Chinese PhD student at the University of Oregon, said that although he is not planning to apply for a new student visa soon, the prospect of an encounter with ICE concerned him. “Nowadays, even if you have a green card, you have legitimate status, you could get caught by ICE, because these guys are crazy”.
Steven has been in the US for a decade. In that time, the US has become a less attractive destination for Chinese students, he said, something he sees borne out in his part-time job helping Chinese students with their college applications. The numbers wanting to study in the US have declined, with people favouring countries in South-east Asia, such as Singapore, which are more culturally similar to China. The US is “just not that friendly” any more, Steven says.
The loss of top Chinese students in the US would be a blow to academic research, and to the funding for higher education institutions, experts say.
In the 2023-2024 academic year, there were about 277,400 Chinese students in the US, according to government statistics. That is a 25% drop compared to 2019-2020.
“By barring Chinese students and scholars from America, the Trump administration will strangle the pipeline of high-end talent into our universities, companies, and research institutes, sparking a serious deficit in talent and expertise that will damage American competitiveness,” said Denis Simon, non-resident fellow at the Quincy Institute, who specialises in science and technology policy in China.
The state department’s announcement last week specified that students with connections to the Chinese Communist party (CCP) or studying in “critical fields” would be included in the visa crackdown.
For years, the US has tried to root out Chinese espionage in academia, with concerns raised about CCP-backed programmes to recruit top talent in science and technology fields that are strategically important to China. But academics and campaigners say that this has bled over into racism, with all Chinese researchers or those of Chinese heritage being treated with suspicion.
Jerry, the mathematics student, said he has experienced discrimination in the US, but not on campus. But if Chinese researchers, staff and PhD students feel they have to leave the US because of an increasingly hostile environment, “it’s going to be a disaster for American universities,” he said.

Trump’s proclamation was the latest attempt by his Republican administration to prevent the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college from enrolling a quarter of its students, who account for much of its research and scholarship. Harvard filed a legal challenge on Thursday, asking for a judge to block Trump’s order and calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard’s rejection of White House demands. Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order. A few hours later, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against Trump’s proclamation. Harvard, she said, had demonstrated it would sustain “immediate and irreparable injury” before she would have an opportunity to hear from the parties in the lawsuit. Burroughs also extended the temporary hold she placed on the administration’s previous attempt to end Harvard’s enrollment of international students. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard’s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork to them for their visas, only to have Burroughs block the action temporarily. Trump’s order this week invoked a different legal authority. If Trump’s measure were to survive this court challenge, it would block thousands of students who are scheduled to go to Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for the summer and fall terms. “Harvard’s more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders — and their dependents — have become pawns in the government’s escalating campaign of retaliation,” Harvard wrote Thursday in a court filing. While the court case proceeds, Harvard is making contingency plans so students and visiting scholars can continue their work at the university, President Alan Garber said in a message to the campus and alumni. “Each of us is part of a truly global university community,” Garber said Thursday. “We know that the benefits of bringing talented people together from around the world are unique and irreplaceable.” Harvard has attracted a growing number of the brightest minds from around the world, with international enrollment growing from 11% of the student body three decades ago to 26% today. As those students wait to find out if they’ll be able to attend the university, some are pursuing other options. Rising international enrollment has made Harvard and other elite colleges uniquely vulnerable to Trump’s crackdown on foreign students. Republicans have been seeking to force overhauls of the nation’s top colleges, which they see as hotbeds of “woke” and antisemitic viewpoints. Garber says the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its “core, legally-protected principles,” even after receiving federal ultimatums. Trump’s administration has also taken steps to withhold federal funding from Harvard and other elite colleges that have rejected White House demands related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Harvard’s $53 billion endowment allows it to weather the loss of funding for a time, although Garber has warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” to come.

New York education officials have refused to rescind the state’s ban on Native American mascots and team names, despite threats from the Trump administration that it risks losing federal funding
NEW YORK -- New York education officials won't rescind the state's ban on Native American mascots and team names, despite threats from the Trump administration that it risks losing federal funding.
Instead, New York officials suggested in a letter to the U.S. Department of Education on Thursday that they could broaden the state ban to include names and mascots derived from other racial or ethnic groups that the department deems offensive.
The federal agency last week determined New York violated Title VI of the federal civil rights law by issuing a statewide ban on the use of Native American mascots and logos.
The department’s civil rights office found the state ban is discriminatory because names and mascots that are still permitted are also derived from other racial or ethnic groups, such as the “Dutchmen” and the “Huguenots.""
New York officials said they are willing to work with federal officials to “reach a resolution as to the appropriate standard,” wrote Daniel Morton-Bentley, legal counsel for the state education department.
Morton-Bentley also noted in his letter that the federal government's current stance in support of keeping Native American team names and mascots runs counter to the agency’s previous stance on the issue — not to mention those of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, tribal leaders, state governments, and professional organizations that have long deemed them harmful and offensive.
What's more, a federal judge in New York earlier this year dismissed a lawsuit brought by some local districts that have refused to comply with the state mandate to rid their schools of offensive Native American mascots and team names, Morton-Bentley wrote.
The education department and its civil rights office, he argued, is “not a court of last resort for unsuccessful litigants.”
Julie Hartman, a spokesperson for the federal education department, didn't comment on the state's offer to broaden its ban but pushed back at the state's assertion that the agency's finding was based on “internally inconsistent arguments.”
“What is internally inconsistent is that the New York Board of Regents prohibited mascots based on Native American race or national origin, but allowed mascots derived from other racial or ethnic groups, such as the ‘Dutchmen’ and the ‘Huguenots',” she wrote in an email.
U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon last week visited Massapequa, a Long Island town that refuses to get rid of its Native American chief mascot, and was among the local districts that unsuccessfully challenged the state in federal court.
McMahon said she would give New York 10 days to sign an agreement rescinding the ban and apologizing to Native Americans for having discriminated against them and attempting to “erase” their history.
New York school districts have until June 30 to commit to replacing offensive Native American mascots or team names, or risk losing state funding. They can be exempt from the mandate, however, if they reach an agreement with a local Native American tribe.
The state education department said as of Thursday, three districts have sought and received extensions as they work to comply with the mandate. Massapequa was not among them.",ABC News,"['civil rights', 'lawsuit']","['New York', 'Trump', 'New York', 'Trump', 'NEW YORK', 'New York', 'Trump', 'New York', 'the U.S. Department of Education', 'New York', 'Title VI of the federal civil rights', 'New York', 'Daniel Morton-Bentley', 'Morton-Bentley', 'the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights', 'New York', 'Morton-Bentley', 'Julie Hartman', 'the New York Board of Regents', 'U.S.', 'Education', 'Linda McMahon', 'Massapequa', 'Long Island', 'McMahon', 'New York', 'New York', 'Massapequa']",Discrimination updates,1
"Nelly Cheboi, who creates computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is CNN's Hero of the Year",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/us/cnn-heroes-all-star-tribute-hero-of-the-year/index.html,"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 10:38:27 GMT",Celebrities and musicians are coming together tonight to honor everyday people making the world a better place.,"Nelly Cheboi, who in 2019 quit a lucrative software engineering job in Chicago to create computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year.
Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes.
Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future.
Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up.
As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit.
“The world is your oyster when you are educated”
Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.”
A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.
Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major.
“When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN.
Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.
“I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said.
Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.
“We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said.
So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself.
“At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said.
A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals.
The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs.
“We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.”
The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.
“My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.”

“We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.”
Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.
Debra Vines – whose nonprofit The Answer Inc. supports families impacted by autism in underserved communities across Chicago – was honored by actress Holly Robinson Peete, a “fellow autism mom.”
Vines says her group has provided programming and guidance to more than 4,000 families. “Join me and be a servant for the change today,” Vines said when accepting her award.
And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue.
Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders:
Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started “Three Wishes for Ruby’s Residents,” which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn’t otherwise afford them.
Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started “Recycle My Battery,” which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins.
The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media.

The spirited celebration of WorldPride, the peripatetic biennial international festival in support of LGBTQ+ rights which kicks off this month and is taking place in Washington DC, was staged instead at the Strathmore Music Center in Maryland, just north of the capital.
Sequin-clad drag queen Peaches Christ acted as host and New York drag queen Thorgy Thor played a violin solo to Beyoncé’s Crazy in Love to an audience of 1,166 people.
The orchestra had hoped to play at the Kennedy Center, Washington’s premier performing arts center, but shortly after returning to the White House, Donald Trump pledged on social media that there would be, in all-caps: “No more drag shows, or other anti-American propaganda” at the public-private arts space.
The Trump administration has issued executive orders limiting transgender rights, banned transgender people from serving in the armed forces, and rescinded anti-discrimination policies for LGBTQ+ people as part of a campaign to repeal diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
Michael Roest, conductor and founder of the International Pride Orchestra, a non-profit, reminded the audience that “people don’t feel safe to live and love openly”.
“That is the reason why we have this orchestra,” he said.
During the event, the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington sang American the Beautiful, and a pianist, Sara Davis Buechner, who is transgender, dazzled while leading the orchestra on grand piano in the Gershwin favorite Rhapsody in Blue.
Both Stars and Stripes and rainbow flags were hoisted at the close.
Trump in February fired the leadership of the Kennedy Center, named himself chair and put a loyalist in charge.
The center then sent Roest a message that said: “We are not in a position at this time to advance a contract,” according to an email chain seen by Reuters, after months of prior negotiations. Considering themselves “disinvited”, event organizers began looking for alternative venues and the Strathmore offered its space, an orchestra spokesperson said.

Here's the real reason to turn on airplane mode when you fly,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airplane-mode-reasons-why/index.html,"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 12:52:23 GMT","We all know the routine by heart: ""Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.""","Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.

We all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.”
Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them.
And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask.
Technology has advanced a great deal
Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s.
The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference.
But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.)
The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014.
2.2 billion passengers
Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference.
Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here.
Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry.
Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft.
Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out.
Ultimately, we can’t forget air rage
Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight.
On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls.
For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience.
Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage.
In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve.
However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.

WASHINGTON — The Maryland federal judge overseeing the lawsuit concerning the wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia unsealed documents Wednesday that the Trump administration had asked to keep unavailable to the public under the so-called state secrets privilege.
The order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis unsealed three documents that she said did not contain any privileged information. Xinis questioned the Trump administration’s broad use of the privilege during a hearing last month.
The request to unseal the documents came from a coalition of news organizations, arguing First Amendment rights and the public’s right to information in a case that has become a flashpoint between the judiciary branch and the Trump administration.
“The Press Movants rightly contend that, at common law, the public enjoys a presumptive right to access court records, overcome only when outweighed by competing interests,” Xinis wrote Wednesday.
President Donald Trump has said Abrego Garcia, who was removed in March due to an “administrative error,” will not return to the U.S. and Department of Justice attorneys on behalf of the Trump administration have argued in court that the Maryland man is in the custody of El Salvador and the federal government has no authority to bring him back.
In a separate case of another wrongly deported immigrant to El Salvador, the Department of Justice submitted a document detailing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was personally working with the Salvadoran government to return a 20-year-old referred to in court documents as only “Cristian,” after another federal judge ordered his return.
Discovery documents
Some of the filings that were unsealed Wednesday had been public until the Trump administration moved to seal them.
One unsealed record related to an April discovery request Abrego Garcia’s attorneys made to the government seeking information about how the administration was facilitating Abrego Garcia’s return from El Salvador. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration must facilitate the Maryland man’s return, but stopped short of requiring it.
Another document related to the Trump administration’s request for more time in discovery proceedings.
“It does not disclose any potentially privileged or otherwise sensitive information for which a compelling government interest outweighs the right to access,” Xinis wrote.
One document was partially redacted, because it “includes some information potentially implicated by the state secrets privilege,” Xinis wrote.
The document, signed by Abrego Garcia attorney Jonathan G. Cooper, objected to the Trump administration’s attempt to pause discovery. The government had argued that complying with discovery in the lawsuit would hinder efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return.
“As we explained to the government, in our meet-and-confer, we do not understand why the production of documents or interrogatory responses — none of which has occurred in the public eye — has any bearing on efforts to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release and return,” Cooper wrote in the partially redacted document unsealed Wednesday.
A fourth document, a transcript from a late April hearing, will be released but redacted until the high-profile case is settled, Xinis wrote.
“Although the Court does not wholly agree with the Defendants’ overbroad characterizations of the government interests at stake, the Court does recognize that certain information touches upon Defendants’ asserted state secrets privilege as applied to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the State Department,” she wrote about the partially redacted transcript.

The eight deportees and 13 Ice staff have begun to “feel ill”, the US government said.
Eight men, from Latin America, Asia and South Sudan, and the Ice staff have been stuck at a US naval base since late May. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that the Ice officers began to fall ill “within 72 hours of landing” in Djibouti, and continue to suffer from suspected bacterial upper respiratory infections.
The Trump administration had attempted to send the eight detainees, who it said had been convicted of criminal offenses, to South Sudan, but a judge intervened to stop their flight in May, arguing that they were entitled to challenge the deportation in the courts.
Mellissa Harper, a top official at the DHS and Ice, said in a court declaration that the detainees are being held in a shipping container that was previously converted into a conference room. The Ice officers are “sharing very limited sleeping quarters”, Harper said, with only six beds between 13 people.
In the declaration, Harper said burn pits in Djibouti have led to Ice officials experiencing “throat irritation”. She said the outside temperature frequently exceeds 100F (38C) in the daytime, and said Ice officials were at risk of malaria because they did not take anti-malaria medication before arriving in Djibouti.
“Within 72 hours of landing in Djibouti, the officers and detainees began to feel ill,” Harper said, but they were unable to obtain proper testing for a diagnosis.
Harper added: “Upon arrival in Djibouti, officers were warned by US Department of Defense officials of imminent danger of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen. The Ice officers lack body armor or other gear that would be appropriate in the case of an attack.”
The declaration detailed the conditions that the detainees face, including only being allowed to shower once a day, and being subjected to “pat-downs and searches” during trips to the restroom, which is 40 yards from the shipping container where they are being held. Harper said there is limited lighting in the area, “which makes visibility difficult and creates a significant security risk for both the officers and aliens”.
The Trump administration had attempted to send the eight men to their home countries of Myanmar, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Mexico and South Sudan. Those countries declined to accept them, however, and US authorities then arranged to fly them to South Sudan in late May.

Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body
WASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.
Like other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world’s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation’s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.
Trump’s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His proclamation applies only to Harvard, and a federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked it. But Trump's order poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.
It’s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump’s gatekeeping powers.
“Columbia’s exposure to this ‘stroke of pen’ risk is uniquely high,” the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.
People from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia’s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.
Other highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.
As the middle class has grown in other countries, more families have been able to afford test prep and admissions guidance to compete for spots in the Ivy League, said Rajika Bhandari, who leads a firm of higher education consultants.
“The Ivy League brand is very strong overseas, especially in countries like India and China, where families are extremely brand-aware of top institutions in the U.S. and other competing countries,” Bhandari said in an email.
Over the last two decades, she said, U.S. universities have increasingly recognized the benefits of international exchange, seeing it as a crucial revenue source that subsidizes U.S. students and keeps enrollments up in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.
America’s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.
It was part of a “gold rush” in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.
“Whether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,"" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.
The race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren’t eligible for financial aid and, at some schools, they pay much higher tuition than their American counterparts. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.
Some wealthier universities — including Harvard — offer financial aid to foreign students. But students who get into those top-tier U.S. universities often have the means to pay higher tuition rates, Brustein said. That provides further incentive to enroll more foreign students, he said, saving more scholarship money for American students.
Still, international enrollment didn't expand equally across all types of colleges. Public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don’t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their enrollment of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by rising costs and student debt loads.
Proponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation’s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study STEM fields.
In the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard’s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia’s schools.
Harvard's undergraduate foreign population increased by about 100 students from 2013 to 2023, while graduate numbers increased by nearly 2,000. Part of that growth can be explained by increasing global competition at the graduate level, said William Kirby, a historian at Harvard who has written about the evolution of higher education.
“If you don’t recruit the very best students internationally in your most important graduate programs, particularly in science and engineering, then you will not be competitive,"" Kirby said.
The Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.
“That was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, ‘If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,’” he said.
Last week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.
“We have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can’t get in because we have foreign students there,” Trump said at a news conference.
The university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.”
In a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of “a painstaking, decades-long project” to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school’s mission and reputation, it said.
“In our interconnected global economy,"" the school said, “a university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.”

Veterans across the United States will gather on June 6, 2025, to protest the Trump administration’s cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as the slashing of staff and programs throughout the government. Veteran-led protests will be held at the National Mall, 16 state capitol buildings and over 100 other venues across 43 states. READ MORE: 5 reasons federal cuts are hitting veterans especially hard Veterans are disproportionately affected by federal cuts, in part because they make up only 6.1% of the U.S. population but, because of “veterans preference” in federal hiring, they compose 24% of the 3 million federal workers facing mass layoffs under the Trump administration. Veterans also depend on comprehensive, free, federally funded health care through VA clinics throughout the country. But that care is deteriorating due to cuts, rule changes and return-to-work policies that make it impossible for many VA workers to effectively provide care. Looming cuts to the VA may cause an irreversible blow if the VA stops providing comprehensive care to veterans and, instead, pushes veterans into seeing doctors in private practice. This is not the first time that veterans have engaged in mass mobilization. Veterans groups in the U.S. have successfully mobilized for centuries, crossing traditional political divisions such as race, class and gender. They are powerful messengers, and their actions in the past have helped secure back pay and pensions for veterans, a Social Security and welfare system for U.S. civilians, and foreign policy changes to end wars abroad. I’m a scholar of law, social movements and veterans benefits. Here’s a brief history of veterans’ campaigns that illustrates how veterans developed their political clout and effectively advocated to protect themselves, and many others, from harmful federal policies. Then-Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York chats with inmates of the Veterans’ hospital at Castle Point, near Beacon, New York. Photo via Getty Images Fighting for pensions Veterans were not always politically popular, nor were they treated well by the federal government. After the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, Gen. George Washington lobbied Congress to offer lifetime half-pay to officers who served until the end of the war. Given the federal government’s financial precariousness at the end of the war, this effort failed. Veterans were unable to successfully mobilize to advocate for the pensions, given their small numbers and internal divisions between more privileged officers and less privileged soldiers. During the Civil War, Congress passed numerous laws designed to support veterans. The 1862 pension law allocated payouts in proportion to a soldier’s permanent bodily injury or disability caused by their service. The benefits were generous in comparison with prior allocations, and more veterans began applying for them. READ MORE: Veterans say they feel betrayed after firing from federal jobs, including some who voted for Trump Yet, by 1875 only 6.5% of veterans had signed up for pensions. Veterans began to organize to increase awareness about these benefits and to lobby for more. The Grand Army of the Republic became a leading veterans organization that demanded better pension and disability benefits. At the end of the 1800s, earning veterans’ votes became a priority for aspiring politicians. The Grand Army of the Republic directly lobbied Congress to pass bills expanding veterans pensions, one of which Democratic President Grover Cleveland vetoed in 1887. The organization then successfully mobilized its members to vote against Cleveland in the 1888 election, securing victory for presidential candidate William Henry Harrison and for Republicans in both houses of Congress. This secured the 1890 Arrears Act, which expanded veterans’ pensions and disability payments. By the turn of the 19th century, over 40% of federal expenditures went to veterans. Getting back pay As more veterans returned in 1898 from fighting in the Spanish-American War, and with a huge influx of veterans 20 years later from World War I, veterans mobilized to streamline and expand pension and disability benefits. In the 1920s, the two most prominent veterans organizations, the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars, or VFW, formed a national legislative committee dedicated to lobbying for improved benefits. Each group boasted thousands of members whom they could call on to “barrage”– a veterans term – congressmen with letters. By 1929, even as the federal budget ballooned, veterans benefits still represented 20% of the total federal budget. The 1924 “Bonus Act,” which Congress passed after overruling Calvin Coolidge’s presidential veto, offered WWI veterans a deferred “bonus” payment available in 1945. But veterans suffered immensely in the Great Depression, along with the rest of the country. WATCH: VA Secretary Doug Collins on widespread cuts to his department and the impact on veterans Veterans tried a new campaign tactic in 1932, creating the “Bonus Expeditionary Forces,” or “Bonus Army,” march on Washington, D.C., to demand their promised pay be delivered sooner. Over the course of three months, from May through July 1932, 40,000 veterans set up encampments throughout the city. During their stay, they crowded congressional galleries and plazas during debates on the bill. When President Herbert Hoover called on the military to disband the encampments, he set himself up for electoral defeat later that year. It took another four years for Congress to pass a law offering an immediate payout, but the veterans got their bonuses in 1936, not 1945. Campaigning to prevent cuts Building from public support bolstered by the Bonus Army march, veterans fought publicly to protect their benefits in the Great Depression. In 1933, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sought to cut veterans’ benefits to help finance other relief programs during the Depression, but veterans successfully lobbied Congress to rescind the cuts. A 1933 VFW encampment in Milwaukee attracted 10,000 veterans who openly decried Roosevelt’s economic policies. The event featured left-wing Louisiana populist Sen. Huey P. Long and former Marine turned anti-Wall Street populist Smedley Butler. WATCH: Trump honors fallen service members in wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery The U.S. entered World War II in December 1941. To avoid another spectacle, FDR began developing a compensation program for World War II veterans even before the war’s end. During debates about these expenditures, veterans activism helped ensure the generous educational, housing and vocational benefits from the so-called GI Bill developed by FDR, and the soldier vote helped secure FDR’s fourth-term election in 1944. Scholars credit the GI Bill with creating a booming U.S. economy from the 1950s through the 1970s and creating the contemporary middle class, an economic and social group now shrinking and under threat.

"Trump and Musk break up, and Washington holds its breath",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-musk-break-washington-holds-breath-122563413,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 00:22:19 -0400",Insiders have speculated about a potential falling-out between Donald Trump and Elon Musk for months,"Trump and Musk break up, and Washington holds its breath
Insiders have speculated about a potential falling-out between Donald Trump and Elon Musk for months
WASHINGTON -- Maybe it was always going to end this way, with two billionaires angrily posting about each other on social media, fingers flying across pocket-sized screens as their incandescent feud burned hotter by the minute.
But even if the finale was predictable, that didn’t make it any less shocking. After long months when Donald Trump and Elon Musk appeared united in their chaotic mission to remake Washington, their relationship imploded this week like a star going supernova.
It began with Musk complaining about the centerpiece of Trump’s legislative agenda, which the president at first took in stride. Eventually Trump let slip that he was disappointed in his former adviser, prompting Musk to unleash a flood of insults and taunts.
He accused Trump of betraying promises to cut federal spending, shared a suggestion that the president should be impeached and claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about his association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Perhaps most viciously, Musk insisted that Trump wouldn’t have won last year’s election without his help.
Trump, not one to slouch from a fight, could hold back no longer. He posted that Musk had been “wearing thin,” that he had “asked him to leave” his administration, that the tech titan had “gone CRAZY.”
Maybe, Trump threatened, he should save taxpayer money by canceling government contracts and subsidies for Musk’s companies.
On and on it went, as liberals savored the spectacle of their most despised political opponents clawing at each other's digital throats and conservatives reeled at the prospect of having to pick sides. Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur and conspiracy theorist, saw an opportunity to position herself as the voice of reason.
“This fight should be taken offline,” she said — on social media, of course.
The question now is whether Trump and Musk find some way to step back from a battle that is tearing apart one of the most consequential relationships in modern American politics. If they don’t, there’s little telling how far the fallout could spread from a collision between the world’s most powerful man and its wealthiest.
At stake are the future of Musk's companies, including electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX; government programs that rely on the billionaire entrepreneur's technology; legislation for advancing tax cuts and Trump's other priorities in Congress; Republican chances in next year's midterm elections; and an entire political ecosystem that has orbited around Trump and Musk's deteriorating partnership.
“It’s like India and Pakistan,” said Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, referring to two nuclear-armed nations that recently skirmished along their border. “It just escalates and neither one of them seem to back down and understand the strength of each other.”
Trump and Musk were always an odd pairing, with contrasting world views and deep generational and stylistic differences.
Trump, 78, comes from old-school New York real estate and never appears in public without a suit and tie unless he's on the golf course. Before running for president, he became a household name as a reality television star.
Musk, 53, is an immigrant from South Africa who struck it rich in Silicon Valley. In addition to running Tesla and SpaceX, Musk owns the social media company X. He's fashioned himself as a black-clad internet edgelord, and his wealth vastly outstrips Trump's.
But Trump and Musk are kindred spirits in other ways. They're experts at generating attention who enjoy stirring the pot by riling up their opponents. Each has sought more power to accomplish existential quests. Trump assails the federal “deep state” that resisted him during his first term, while Musk warns about the country going bankrupt from excessive spending and promotes an interplanetary future powered by his rocket technology.
Musk endorsed Trump after the Republican candidate was nearly assassinated in Butler, Pennsylvania, and he began spending millions to support him. His social media megaphone was a powerful addition to Trump's comeback campaign, magnifying his efforts to court tech leaders and young, very online men.
Trump rarely tolerates sharing the spotlight, but he seemed enamored with his powerful backer, mentioning him in stump speeches and welcoming him onstage at rallies.
After the election, Musk was a fixture around Mar-a-Lago, posing for photos with Trump's family, joining them for dinner, sitting in on meetings. Instead of growing tired of his “first buddy,” Trump made plans to bring Musk along to Washington, appointing him to lead a cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency.
Musk tried to establish himself as the president's omniscient and omnipresent adviser. He held court in Cabinet meetings, slept over in the Lincoln Bedroom and helped himself to caramel ice cream from the White House kitchen.
The federal bureaucracy practically trembled before Musk, who oversaw layoffs and downsizing with his team of acolytes and engineers embedded in various agencies.
Musk appeared thrilled at his opportunity to tinker with the government and exulted in his bromance with Trump, posting on Feb. 7 that he loved the president “as much as a straight man can love another man.”
Trump returned the favor on March 11, allowing Musk to line up Tesla vehicles on the White House driveway as his company was struggling with declining sales. Trump made a show of choosing a cherry red electric car for himself.
But cracks were emerging, especially as Trump pursued tariffs that could raise costs for Musk's businesses. Musk said Peter Navarro, the president's trade adviser, was “truly a moron"" and “dumber than a sack of bricks"" on April 8.
The billionaire entrepreneur, who had never before worked in public service, seemed to be souring on government. He suggested there wasn't enough political will, either in Congress or in the White House, to adequately reduce spending.
Trump started signaling that it was time for him to leave even though Musk said he would be willing to stay.
Shortly before announcing his departure, Musk said he was “disappointed” by legislation that Trump called the “big beautiful bill"" because it would increase the deficit. The measure includes tax cuts, more money for border security and changes to Medicaid that would leave fewer people with health insurance.
“I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musk said. “But I don’t know if it could be both.”
The criticism didn't prevent Trump from giving Musk a send-off in the Oval Office, where he presented his outgoing adviser with a ceremonial key.
“Elon is really not leaving,” Trump said. “He’s going to be back and forth.”
Musk said, “I’ll continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president.""
It's hard to imagine that now.
Musk escalated his attacks on the legislation Tuesday, calling it a “disgusting abomination,"" and Trump tried to fend off the criticism.
“He hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that will be next,” the president said Thursday in the Oval Office during a meeting with the German chancellor.
It was.
Musk quickly took to X to vent his anger at Trump, saying his tariffs “will cause a recession in the second half of this year” and accusing him of lying. He also said it was “very unfair” that the legislation would eliminate tax incentives for electric vehicles.
Trump fired back in real time as he tried to maintain momentum for his legislation, which faces a difficult debate in the Senate.
“I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,” the president posted. “This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.”
Meanwhile, some of Trump's allies plotted revenge.
Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser who hosts an influential conservative podcast, said the president should direct the U.S. government to seize SpaceX. He also encouraged Trump to investigate allegations that Musk uses drugs and “go through everything about his immigration status"" in preparation for potential deportation.
“We’ll see how good Elon Musk takes a little of that pressure,"" Bannon said, ""because I happen to think a little of that pressure might be coming.”

The Trump administration has accused the Wisconsin Elections Commission of violating federal law by failing to provide a state-based complaint process for voters bringing allegations against the commission itself
MADISON, Wis. -- The Trump administration has accused the Wisconsin Elections Commission of failing to provide a state-based complaint process for voters bringing allegations against the commission itself, calling that a violation of federal law and threatening to withhold all federal funding.
But the commission's Democratic chairwoman said Thursday there is no federal funding to cut and she disputed accusations raised in a Department of Justice letter a day earlier, saying it would be nonsensical for the commission to determine whether complaints against it were valid.
“What they’re asking is, if someone files a complaint against us, we’re supposed to hold a hearing to determine if we messed up,"" Ann Jacobs said. “That is not functional.”
It marks the second time in a week that the Trump administration has targeted election leaders in battleground states.
Last week, the Justice Department accused North Carolina’s election board of violating federal law by failing to ensure voter registration records of some applicants contained identifying numbers.
The latest letter from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division accused Wisconsin of violating the Help America Vote Act for not having a state-based administrative complaint procedure to address alleged violations by the state elections commission of the 2002 federal law.
Actions by the Wisconsin Elections Commission “have left complainants alleging HAVA violations by the Commission without any recourse,” attorneys for the Justice Department wrote. “With no opportunity or means to appeal, complainants are left stranded with their grievances.”
The elections commission just received the letter and has no comment while it is being reviewed, spokesman John Smalley said.
But Jacobs, chairwoman of the commission, said the commission can’t decide complaints against itself. Jacobs said that position was backed up by a 2022 ruling by the Wisconsin Supreme Court when it was controlled by conservatives.
“It appears that they’re like, ‘How dare you follow state law,'"" Jacobs said. ""I don’t know what it is they want us to do.”
According to the letter, Wisconsin has received more than $77 million in federal funding from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and the Justice Department threatened to stop any future payments. But Jacobs said that money was allocated years ago and the state currently receives no funding from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and none is proposed, leaving nothing to cut.
Nonetheless, the letter could put state funding in jeopardy.
Republican leaders of the state Legislature’s budget committee delayed a scheduled Thursday vote on how much state funding the Wisconsin Elections Commission will receive over the next two years.
“Out of caution, we think we’re just going to wait and see,” the committee’s co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein said. “We need to analyze this and see what implications are made, maybe for the entire Elections Commission, and what impact that may have on the budget.”

Transgender troops face a deadline and a difficult decision: Stay or go?,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/transgender-troops-face-deadline-difficult-decision-stay-go-rcna211468,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 16:49:26 GMT","As transgender service members face a deadline to leave the U.S. military, hundreds are taking the financial bonus to depart voluntarily. But others say they will stay and fight.","WASHINGTON — As transgender service members face a deadline to leave the U.S. military, hundreds are taking the financial bonus to depart voluntarily. But others say they will stay and fight.
For many, it is a wrenching decision to end a career they love, and leave units they have led or worked with for years. And they are angry they are being forced out by the Trump administration's renewed ban on transgender troops.
Active duty service members had until Friday to identify themselves and begin to leave the military voluntarily, while the National Guard and Reserve have until July 7. Then the military will begin involuntary separations.
Friday's deadline comes during Pride Month and as the Trump administration targets diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying it's aiming to scrub the military of ""wokeness"" and reestablishing a ""warrior ethos.""
""They're tired of the rollercoaster. They just want to go,"" said one transgender service member, who plans to retire. ""It's exhausting.""
For others, it's a call to arms.
""I'm choosing to stay in and fight,"" a noncommissioned officer in the Air Force said. ""My service is based on merit, and I've earned that merit.""
The troops, who mainly spoke on condition of anonymity because they fear reprisals, said being forced to decide is frustrating. They say it's a personal choice based on individual and family situations, including whether they would get an infusion of cash or possibly wind up owing the government money.
""I'm very disappointed,"" a transgender Marine said. ""I've outperformed, I have a spotless record. I'm at the top of every fitness report. I'm being pushed out while I know others are barely scraping by.""
Some transgender troops decide to leave based on finances
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said this is President Donald Trump's directive and what America voted for. The Pentagon, he said, is ""leaving wokeness & weakness behind"" and that includes ""no more dudes in dresses.""
Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a veteran, and 22 other Democratic senators have written to Hegseth urging him to allow transgender troops to keep serving honorably.
Already, more than 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and are slated to begin leaving, according to rough Defense Department estimates. Defense officials say there are about 4,240 active duty transgender troops but acknowledge the numbers are fuzzy.
For many, the decision is financial.
Those who voluntarily leave will get double the amount of separation pay they would normally receive and won't have to return bonuses or tuition costs. Those who refuse to go could be forced to repay reenlistment or other bonuses as high as $50,000.
That was the tipping point for Roni Ferrell, an Army specialist at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington.
Ferrell, 28, lives on base with her wife and two children and had planned to stay in the Army for at least another decade. But she said she felt ""backed into a corner"" to sign the voluntary separation agreement, fearing she would have to repay an $18,500 reenlistment bonus.
""My commander basically said it was my only option in order to make sure my kids are taken care of,"" Ferrell said.
The Marine, who has served for more than 25 years, said she had planned to stay and fight, but changed her mind. Lawyers, she said, told her an involuntary separation would put a code in her record saying she was forced to leave ""in the interests of national security.""
That designation, she said, could mean those involuntarily separated could lose their security clearances, hurting future job prospects.
In a statement Friday, a defense official said the code ""is not intended"" to trigger clearance revocations and that gender dysphoria is not a security reporting requirement, according to the director of national intelligence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Cynthia Cheng-Wun Weaver, senior director of litigation for Human Rights Campaign, said it's important for troops to talk with judge advocates general in their services to ensure they understand the different procedures being implemented.
Other transgender troops plan to stay despite the ban
The Air Force service member and a transgender officer in the Army National Guard both said they plan to stay and fight. Lawsuits over the ban continue and could change or block the policy.
For troops involved in the court battles as plaintiffs, leaving voluntarily now would likely hurt their standing in the case. For others, it's simply dedication to their career.
""I've really embraced military culture, and it's embraced me,"" the Air Force member said. ""It's not about money. It's the career that I love.""
The Guard soldier echoed that sentiment, saying he will stay on ""because it is important to me to serve. Frankly, I'm good at it, I'm well trained so I want to continue.""
Others without bonuses to repay or who have been in the military only a short while and won't get much in separation bonus pay may opt to stay and see what happens.
National Guard troops face a particular problem
National Guard members who are heading to their monthly drill weekend or annual two-week drill in June could be required to go but serve as the gender they were assigned at birth.
That means they would have to wear uniforms and haircuts of that gender, use that bathroom and be referred to as ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" based on that gender.
For many, that could be close to impossible and create uncomfortable situations.
""If I were to show up to drill this weekend, I'd be expected to use all female facilities, I would be expected to wear a woman's uniform,"" said the Army Guard officer, who transitioned to male about five years ago and says others in his unit know him as a man. ""I don't look like a woman. I don't feel like a woman. It would be disruptive to good order and discipline for me to show up and to tell my soldiers, you have to call me 'ma'am' now.""
It's not clear if Guard units are handling it all the same way, and it could be up to individual states or commanders. Some may allow troops to postpone the drill or go on administrative leave.
What happens next for transgender troops?
The service members interviewed by The Associated Press said they don't know what will happen once the deadline passes to leave voluntarily.
Some believe that unit commanders will quickly single people out and start involuntary separations. Others say the process is vague, may involve medical review boards and could take months.
The defense official said Friday that as the Pentagon takes these steps, it ""will treat our service members with dignity and respect.""
Under Hegseth's directive, military commanders will be told to identify troops with gender dysphoria — when a person's biological sex does not match their gender identity — and send them to get medical checks to force them out of the service, defense officials have said. The order relies on routine annual health checks — so it could be months before that evaluation is scheduled.
""My real big sticking point is that this administration's whole push is to reform this country based around merit, and that gender, race, etc., should have no factor in hiring,"" the Air Force service member said. ""If that's true, I'm solely being removed for my gender, and merit is no longer a factor.""",NBC News,['lawsuit'],"['WASHINGTON', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'the National Guard and Reserve', 'Pride Month', 'Trump', 'the Air Force', 'Marine', 'Defense', 'Pete Hegseth', 'Donald Trump', 'America', 'Pentagon', 'Tammy Duckworth', 'Illinois', 'Hegseth', 'Defense Department', 'as high as $50,000', 'Roni Ferrell', 'Army', 'Tacoma', 'Washington', 'Ferrell', 'Army', '18,500', 'Ferrell', 'Marine', 'Cynthia Cheng-Wun Weaver', 'Human Rights Campaign', 'The Air Force', 'the Army National Guard', 'Air Force', 'National Guard', 'National Guard', 'Army Guard', 'Guard', 'The Associated Press', 'Pentagon', 'Hegseth', 'Air Force']",,0

And that’s just how the ruling Communist Party wants it. Security was tight Wednesday around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, where weeks of student-led protests shook the party in 1989. Under then-leader Deng Xiaoping, the military was sent in to end the protest on the night of June 3-4. Using live ammunition, soldiers forced their way through crowds that tried to block them from reaching the square. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed, including dozens of soldiers. The party has tried, with some success, to erase what it calls the “political turmoil” of 1989 from the collective memory. It bans any public commemoration or mention of the June 4 crackdown, scrubbing references from the internet. In recent years, that ban has been extended to Hong Kong, where a once-massive annual candlelight vigil is no longer permitted. Police said they brought 10 people on suspicion of breaching public peace to a police station for investigation. Three were still detained late Wednesday, while the rest were allowed to leave. Police also arrested a woman for failing to show her identity document and a man for obstructing police officers from performing their duties. It is only in Taiwan, a self-governing island that is claimed by China but runs its own affairs, that large June 4 gatherings can still take place. The crackdown reinforced Communist Party control Tiananmen Square is a vast space in the center of Beijing with monumental, communist-era buildings along two sides and the mausoleum of Mao Zedong, who founded the communist era in 1949, on the south end. University students occupied this symbolically important site in the spring of 1989. Their calls for freedoms divided the party leadership. The decision to send in troops marked a decisive turning point in the evolution of modern China, keeping the party firmly in control as it loosened economic restrictions. Chinese officials have said the country’s rapid economic development since then proves the decisions made at the time were correct.

Hong Kong authorities first shut down the vigil during the COVID-19 pandemic and arrested the organizers in 2021. The moves were part of a broader crackdown on dissent following monthslong anti-government protests in 2019 that turned violent and paralyzed parts of the city. A former district council member, Chan Kim-kam, said customs officers questioned her at her shop on the eve of June 4 after she advertised small white candles for sale in an Instagram post titled “June, we don’t forget.” “You know, Hong Kongers have become silent lambs after 2019,” said King Ng, who was at the park on Wednesday. Police were out in force to try to prevent any protest, and took several people away from the park on Wednesday. They included a young woman wearing a school uniform and holding flowers, a man who lowered his head in apparent prayer, and a man wearing a white T-shirt reading “Vindication for June 4. It’s getting closer and closer.” Police also questioned a woman who lit up a mosquito lamp, but eventually let her go. Rows of electronic candles lit up the windows of the U.S. consulate, and the British consulate projected “VIIV” — Roman numerals in reference to June 4 — on one of its walls.

The study, conducted by the Taiwan-based DoubleThink Lab, surveyed people across Taiwan in March, asking a series of questions about politics and democracy in Taiwan and China, and their views on unification of the two sides.
It found that among the respondents, agreement with criticisms of Taiwan’s domestic issues, and with the prospect of unifying with China, rose as TikTok use increased, before dropping again among the heaviest users of more than 14 hours a week.
China’s ruling Communist party (CCP) claims Taiwan is a province of China and has vowed to annex it under what it terms “reunification”, by force if necessary. Social media is a key battleground in China’s information warfare, as it seeks to convince or coerce Taiwan into accepting annexation without military conflict.
The DoubleThink Lab report claimed the more active TikTok users showed stronger correlations with an openness to Chinese propaganda and the idea that unification with China is inevitable and democracy should be sacrificed for peace.
There was also correlation with unhappiness about current domestic issues, including opposition-driven accusations of judicial unfairness and erosions of free speech. Differences were stark among supporters of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which the CCP has labelled illegal separatists.
“Our analysis suggests that active TikTok use is more likely to influence users’ political attitudes toward being more anti-democratic establishment and positive attitudes toward PRC governance, even among groups traditionally opposed to the CCP,” said the report’s author, Eric Hsu.
The percentage of DPP supporters who used TikTok and thought it was acceptable to give up Taiwan’s democratic system “for the sake of cross-strait peace” was 10 points higher than non-users, at 26.8%, the report said. And in response to statements that the DPP was “no different from the CCP and Taiwan lacks freedom of speech”, 23.9% of DPP supporters who used TikTok agreed, compared with 9.3% who were not active on the app.
TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and fears of it being used to spread pro-CCP propaganda have already resulted in restrictions or threats of outright bans in several countries, including the US. In Taiwan, there are rules against TikTok being used on government devices.
In 2019, the Guardian revealed how ByteDance used TikTok to advance Beijing’s foreign policy aims by moderating sensitive content. A 2023 study, by Rutgers University’s Network Contagion Research Institute in the US, found TikTok’s algorithms consistently amplify pro-CCP content and suppress anti-CCP narratives, with much of the pro-CCP content originating from state-linked entities.
ByteDance has long denied the allegations.
“From the CCP’s founding, there has always been a strong emphasis on both the ‘pen’ and the ‘gun’ – meaning propaganda and force,” said Yu-hui Tai, an assistant professor at Taiwan’s National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.
Tai said Taiwan was on the frontline of China’s propaganda efforts, and its digital environment was “complex”. She added: “TikTok is not the only app young people use”, noting that Douyin – the Chinese domestic version of TikTok, which some Taiwanese also use – is very different in content and moderation to TikTok.
The Guardian has reported previously on the popularity of other Chinese apps that have increased their cultural influence among young Taiwanese.
Titus C Chen, a research fellow at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, said the vast majority of TikTok users “aren’t actively seeking out political content when they use the platform”.
He said it could not be ruled out that users were just more inclined to agree with such views and so were being fed content that aligned with their interests.
“That said, it’s undeniably true that TikTok’s content – both its Chinese and international versions – is heavily influenced and controlled by the Chinese government,” said Chen. “So it’s very unlikely you’ll come across much content on TikTok that supports liberal democracy.”

The latest plot development – the epic falling-out between the title character and his best buddy, Elon Musk – was so predictable, and indeed predicted, that it counts as the opposite of a twist. Still, surprise can be overrated. Watching the two men – one the richest in the world, the other the most powerful – turn on each other in a series of ever-more venomous posts on their respective social media platforms has been entertainment of the highest order. X v Truth: it could be a Marvel blockbuster.
But this is more than mere popcorn fodder. Even if they eventually patch things up, the rift between the president and Musk has exposed a divide inside the contemporary right, in the US and beyond – and a fatal flaw of the Trump project.
Naturally, much of it is personal. That’s why so many declared from the start that this was a star-cross’d bromance, whose destiny was only ever heartbreak. Even as Musk was declaring, back in February, that “I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man,” wiser heads knew it was doomed. The egos were too large, the narcissism too strong, for their love to survive. In the Trump universe, as in the Musk galaxy, there is room for only one sun.
In their case, the personal combines with business. On this reading, Musk’s disenchantment began in his pocket, his opposition to Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”, or “BBB”, currently before Congress, fuelled chiefly by the legislation’s axing of a $7,500 tax credit on the purchase of electric vehicles. With Tesla sales plunging, Musk needed that incentive to lure potential Tesla customers and was furious with Trump for scrapping it. That’s certainly the story Trump is telling. “I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted … and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted.
The suggestion that Musk’s driving motive was profit seems to have particularly antagonised the billionaire, prompting him to call for his former paramour to be impeached and to claim that Trump is named in the Jeffrey Epstein files, in effect implicating the president in a paedophile ring. Musk wants to present his objection not as self-serving but as ideological, casting himself as the fiscal conservative appalled by Trump’s “disgusting abomination” of a bill because it will increase the already gargantuan US deficit by trillions of dollars.
Who’s right? It seems a stretch to argue that Trump’s hostility to electric cars was the problem: as Trump himself pointed out, Musk knew about that when he jumped on the Maga train last year. As for ballooning the deficit, you can see why that would irritate Musk. Adding trillions in red ink makes a mockery of the “cost-cutting” drive he headed up with his so-called department of government efficiency.
The billionaire was already smarting from the failure of Doge to cut anything like the $2tn in spending he promised would be easy. All he succeeded in doing by, for instance, feeding the US agency for international development, or USAID, into “the wood chipper” was to take the lives of 300,000 people, most of them children, who had depended on that agency and its grants, according to a Boston University study. Even if you are minded, charitably, to accept Musk’s own estimate, he only shrank the federal budget by about $150bn. To watch as that effort was cancelled out by a $600bn tax cut to people earning more than $1m a year would be a humiliation indeed.
Whatever its true cause, the Trump-Musk spat has illuminated a fault line in the right – and not only in the US. Battered and quieted by the Trump phenomenon, there still remain a few old-school conservatives with a vestigial presence in the Senate, for whom fiscal rectitude remains an article of faith. While Democrats oppose the “BBB” because its cuts to Medicaid will deprive more than 10 million Americans of basic health cover, these traditional Republicans are queasy about the Liz Truss-style risks of a massive unfunded tax giveaway. Overnight, Musk has become their champion.
Ranged against them are the forces of nationalist conservatism, embodied by former Trump strategist and ex-convict Steve Bannon. They don’t have a libertarian yearning for a minimal state; on the contrary, they quite like muscular displays of state power. Witness Trump’s insistence on a Pyongyang-style military parade to celebrate his birthday, and note Bannon’s response to Musk’s impudence in challenging the ruler – he called for Musk’s businesses, Starlink and SpaceX, to be nationalised. Indeed, nationalist conservatism might not be quite the right term for what Bannon offers: nationalist socialism might be more apt, though something close to that has already been taken.
There have been other manifestations of this divide. Musk opposed Trump’s tariffs; Bannon is for them. Musk wanted to see the US remain open to high-skilled, tech-savvy immigrants; Bannon wants to shut the door on them. These, then, are the two camps. (You can see similar faultlines on the British right, dividing Thatcherite Conservatives from Reform UK.) For a while, the anti-woke loathing of DEI policies was strong enough to keep the opposing blocs – free traders and protectionists; deficit hawks and big spenders – together. But that glue, as Trump said of Musk, is “wearing thin”.
That has some serious implications for US politics and Trump’s presidency. It is conceivable that Trump won’t have the numbers to pass this bill, his central legislative goal, in its current form: the Republican majority in the House is wafer-thin, and one more defecting Republican could sink the proposal in the Senate. Musk has given would-be dissenters cover. The gazillionaire had promised to spend big to help Republicans in the November 2026 midterm elections. Much can happen between now and then, but Trump may now need to look elsewhere for a patron. Who knows, Musk might even follow through on his threat to fund the president’s Democratic opponents. Even if he does not go that far, he controls a prime platform of the right: X could soon become hostile territory for Trump. The point is, Musk is not your usual Trump antagonist. He has as loud a megaphone, and more money, than the president.
It all adds up to a sad tale of two men who once had so much in common – perhaps one thing above all. Each has been lucky enough to find themselves in charge of a brand that once enjoyed global admiration and clout – and each man has systematically set about trashing that brand in the eyes of the world. Musk has done it more than once. He bought what had become an admittedly imperfect meeting place of some of the planet’s most influential people, Twitter, and turned it into a sewer of bigotry and lies, X. He built a company, Tesla, whose most obvious customers were high earners concerned about the planet and repelled them by association with a nationalist authoritarian who wants to “drill, baby, drill”.
Trump, meanwhile, has taken the US, once a magnet for talent from across the globe, and done his best to dismantle all that made it attractive: its stability, its protection of free speech, the independence of its institutions, the quality of its science and universities. This week’s moves – the travel ban, the suspicion of overseas students, the war on Harvard – to say nothing of the ongoing hostility to democratic allies and coddling of foreign dictators, are just the latest instances of Trump doing to the US brand what Musk has done to Twitter and Tesla. No wonder Trump and Musk have broken up: they were always far too alike.

Federal vs. state power at issue in a hearing over Trump's election overhaul executive order,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/federal-state-power-issue-hearing-trumps-election-overhaul-122566434,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 07:02:29 -0400",Democratic state attorneys general are seeking to block President Donald Trump&rsquo;s proposal for an overhaul of U.S. elections in a case that tests a constitutional bedrock &mdash; the separation of powers,"Federal vs. state power at issue in a hearing over Trump's election overhaul executive order
Democratic state attorneys general are seeking to block President Donald Trump’s proposal for an overhaul of U.S. elections in a case that tests a constitutional bedrock — the separation of powers
BOSTON -- Democratic state attorneys general on Friday will seek to block President Donald Trump's proposal for a sweeping overhaul of U.S. elections in a case that tests a constitutional bedrock — the separation of powers.
The top law enforcement officials from 19 states filed a federal lawsuit after the Republican president signed the executive order in March, arguing that its provisions would step on states' power to set their own election rules and that the executive branch had no such authority.
In a filing supporting that argument, a bipartisan group of former secretaries of state said Trump's directive would upend the system established by the Constitution's Elections Clause, which gives states and Congress control over how elections are run. They said the order seeks to “unilaterally coronate the President as the country’s chief election policymaker and administrator.”
If the court does not halt the order, they argued, “the snowball of executive overreach will grow swiftly and exponentially.""
Trump's election directive was part of a flurry of executive orders he has issued in the opening months of his second term, many of which have drawn swift legal challenges. It follows years of him falsely claiming that his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election was due to widespread fraud and an election year in which he and other Republicans promoted the notion that large numbers of noncitizens threatened the integrity of U.S. elections. In fact, voting by noncitizens is rare and, when caught, can lead to felony charges and deportation.
Trump's executive order would require voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections, prohibit mail or absentee ballots from being counted if they are received after Election Day, set new rules for voting equipment and prohibit non-U.S. citizens from being able to donate in certain elections. It also would condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the strict ballot deadline.
The hearing Friday in U.S. District Court in Boston comes in one of three lawsuits filed against the executive order. One is from Oregon and Washington, where elections are conducted almost entirely by mail and ballots received after Election Day are counted as long as they are postmarked by then.
The provision that would create a proof-of-citizenship requirement for federal elections already has been halted in a lawsuit filed by voting and civil rights groups and national Democratic organizations.
In that case, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the judge said the president's attempt to use a federal agency to enact a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voting usurped the power of states and Congress, which at the time was considering legislation that would do just that. That bill, called the SAVE Act, passed the U.S. House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate.
Trump's executive order said its intent was to ensure “free, fair and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion.” The Justice Department, in arguing against the motion by the attorneys general for a preliminary injunction, said the president is within his rights to direct agencies to carry out federal voting laws.
The order tasks the U.S. Election Assistance Commission with updating the federal voter registration form to require people to submit documentation proving they are U.S. citizens. Similar provisions enacted previously in a handful of states have raised concerns about disenfranchising otherwise eligible voters who can't readily access those documents. That includes married women, who would need both a birth certificate and a marriage license if they had changed their last name.
A state proof-of-citizenship law enacted in Kansas more than a decade ago blocked the registrations of 31,000 people later found to be eligible to vote.
The two sides will argue over whether the president has the authority to direct the election commission, which was created by Congress as an independent agency after the Florida ballot debacle during the 2000 presidential election.
In its filing, the Justice Department said Trump's executive order falls within his authority to direct officials “to carry out their statutory duties,” adding that “the only potential voters it disenfranchises are noncitizens who are ineligible to vote anyway.”",ABC News,"['civil rights', 'executive order', 'deportation', 'executive order', 'lawsuit']","['Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'U.S.', 'BOSTON', 'Donald Trump', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'Constitution', 'Congress', 'Trump', 'Joe Biden', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'District Court', 'Boston', 'Oregon', 'Washington', 'the District of Columbia', 'Congress', 'the SAVE Act', 'the U.S. House', 'Senate', 'Trump', 'The Justice Department', 'the U.S. Election Assistance Commission', 'U.S.', 'Kansas', 'Congress', 'Florida', 'the Justice Department', 'Trump']",,0

President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened Elon Musk’s federal contracts, a remarkable escalation in a public feud between the president and the world’s richest man, his former ally.
“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Thursday afternoon. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”
The president’s relationship with Musk has deteriorated rapidly since Musk left the White House last week. The acrimony went public when Musk publicly slammed Trump’s sweeping domestic policy package on Tuesday.
Musk responded to the broadside by announcing his company, SpaceX, will withdraw from service its Dragon spacecraft — which is critical to the American space program.
“In light of President Trump’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,” Musk wrote on X, the social media site he owns.
Musk’s threat would deprive the U.S. of its only assured way of supplying the International Space Station and bringing on and off astronauts. If executed, NASA would instead have to rely on Russia to bring supplies and astronauts to the station. NASA had contracted with Boeing on the Starliner, a competitor to the Dragon spacecraft, but that system is temporarily out of service following problems with the craft.
But he seemingly walked away from that threat late Thursday. Responding to an X user pleading for the two men to “cool off and take a step back for a couple days,” Musk said “ok, we won’t decommission Dragon.”
He’s continued to lash out at the White House in the days since — with Musk baiting Trump by name earlier Thursday, and Trump responding by chastising the Tesla CEO from the Oval Office later in the day.
Still, Trump’s criticism from the White House — where the two men less than a week ago shared a laudatory sendoff for Musk — was not as pointed as the president’s barbs on social media.
“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musk wrote on X Thursday. “Such ingratitude.”
Musk’s companies have significant ties to the federal government, even before the Trump administration. SpaceX is one of NASA’s largest contractors. And his car company Tesla benefitted from a clean energy subsidy that is on the chopping block in Republicans’ reconciliation package.
“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted.
“Such an obvious lie. So sad,” Musk fired back.
Trump has previously boosted Tesla because of his close relationship with Musk. In March, with the company’s stock at a low after public anger over job cuts fueled by Musk’s DOGE initiative, the president toured different Tesla models at a makeshift car show on the White House lawn. Trump later purchased his own Tesla, “a show of confidence and support” for Musk.
Tesla’s stock tanked on Thursday, falling more than 14 percent as the two traded barbs.
Trump has routinely wielded the power of the executive branch against institutions that he deems are misbehaving. He’s frozen billions in federal grants to some of the country’s top universities, Harvard chief among them, as punishment for alleged antisemitism and civil rights violations. And he’s secured multimillion dollar deals with law firms weary of his threats to tank their business.

"As World Pride flows straight into the military parade, DC officials say they're ready for anything",https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/world-pride-flows-straight-military-parade-dc-officials-122581806,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 13:02:24 -0400","Officials in the nation&rsquo;s capital generally express full confidence in their ability to handle large, complicated events and huge crowds","As World Pride flows straight into the military parade, DC officials say they're ready for anything
Officials in the nation’s capital generally express full confidence in their ability to handle large, complicated events and huge crowds
WASHINGTON -- Officials in the nation's capital generally express full confidence in their ability to handle large, complicated events and huge crowds. As Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith recently put it, “We are really the experts in this space when it comes to crowd management.”
Over the next eight days. in the sprawling city that is the nation's capital, that expertise will be put to the test.
The District of Columbia is playing host to massive events on back-to-back weekends. Two wildly divergent events each carry the extra possibility of counterprotests or disruption, adding a layer of anxiety to the usual logistical hassles.
June 7 and 8 brings the peak of the two-week World Pride celebration with two days of mass gatherings — a parade on Saturday and a rally and protest March Sunday. Both days culminate in a giant street party and concert covering a multi-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue.
Then as cleanup from World Pride wraps up, preparations will begin for the much-hyped June 14 military parade to celebrate the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army (and the 79th birthday of a certain White House resident).
And while D.C. officials can claim they have seen it all before in terms of mass events, June 14 will present some genuinely unique challenges — actual 60-ton M1 Abrams battle tanks and Paladin self-propelled howitzers rolling through the city streets.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has gone out of her way to stay on the good side of President Donald Trump, has not disguised her discomfort at the prospect of armored vehicles chewing up the downtown asphalt. And she is still openly leery, despite assurances from the military that it will cover the costs of all repairs, and a plan to install protective plates at intersections.
“I think that there has been time and attention paid to how to move this heavy equipment in a way that doesn’t hurt (roads),” Bowser said last week. ""I remain concerned about it. If they are rendered unusable, we have to make them usable and then go seek our money from the feds.”
For each of these high-profile weekends, police and security officials are on alert for any sort of counterprotest or attempts to disrupt the proceedings. Trump's campaign against transgender protections and oft-stated antipathy for drag shows have fueled fears of violence against World Pride participants; at one point earlier this spring, rumors circulated that the Proud Boys were planning to disrupt this weekend's celebrations.
Those fears have proven to be unfounded so far, although one D.C. queer bar was vandalized last week. With those fears in mind, organizers will install security fencing around the entire two-day street party.
“We wanted to provide some extra safety measures (based on) concerns from some people in the community,” said Ryan Bos, executive director of the Capital Pride Alliance.
The bi-annual World Pride has, in the past, drawn as many as 1 million visitors to its host city. It remains to be seen just how large the final influx will be for the nation’s capital. Early hotel reservation numbers had indicated that attendance would be down somewhat, a possible result of international participants staying away out of either fear of harassment or in protest of Trump's policies.
But Elliott Ferguson, president of Destination D.C. — which tracks hotel reservations — told reporters last week they were witnessing “a surge at the last minute” of people coming in for the final World Pride weekend.
The military parade, meanwhile, is expected to draw as many as 200,000 people, according to Army estimates. A large counterprotest against Trump — dubbed the No Kings rally — will march down 16th Street to within sight of the White House but isn't expected to get close enough to the military parade to disrupt things.
Lindsey Appiah, the deputy mayor for public safety, acknowledges that longstanding plans for the Army's 250th birthday “got a lot bigger on short notice” when Trump got involved.
“You have to be very flexible, very nimble. Things change and you have plans and then those plans change,"" she said. ""I think we’ve really learned to do that.”
Appiah points out an example of the District's capabilities from early this year, when the city hosted the congressional certification of Trump’s electoral win, the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter and then Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 — all in the span of two weeks and in the midst of a huge winter storm.
D.C. officials also point out that the logistical challenge facing the capital city doesn't actually end on June 14. The military parade will be followed by three matches for the FIFA Club World Cup starting on June 18 and running through June 26, which will then roll straight into preparations for the traditional July 4 fireworks extravaganza.

"Trump Orders Investigation Into Biden's Actions As President, Ratcheting Up Targeting Of Predecessor",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-investigation-congress-biden_n_6840e07be4b00b2e94c588da,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 20:11:55 -0400","Biden responded in a statement Wednesday night: “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency.""","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday directed his administration to investigate Joe Biden’s actions as president, alleging aides masked his predecessor’s “cognitive decline” and casting doubts on the legitimacy of his use of the autopen to sign pardons and other documents.
The order marked a significant escalation in Trump’s targeting of political adversaries and could lay the groundwork for arguments by the Republican that a range of Biden’s actions as president were invalid.
Biden responded in a statement Wednesday night: “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.”
The Justice Department under Democratic and Republican administrations has recognized the use of an autopen to sign legislation and issue pardons for decades, Trump presented no evidence that Biden was unaware of the actions taken in his name, and the president’s absolute pardon power is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.
“This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,” Trump wrote in a memo. “The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.”
Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House counsel David Warrington to handle the investigation.
It’s unclear how far Trump will push this effort, which would face certain legal challenges. But it reflects his fixation on Biden, who defeated him in 2020, an election that Trump never conceded and continues to falsely claim was rigged against him.
Trump frequently suggests that Biden was wrong to use an autopen, a mechanical device that replicates a person’s authentic signature. Although they’ve been used in the White House for decades, Trump claims that Biden’s aides were usurping presidential authority.
Biden issued pardons for his two brothers and his sister shortly before leaving office, hoping to shield them from potential prosecution under Trump, who had promised retribution during last year’s campaign. Other pardon recipients included members of a congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.
Trump often suggests that his political opponents should be investigated, and he has directed the Justice Department to look into people who have angered him over the years. They include Chris Krebs, a former cybersecurity official who disputed Trump’s claims of a stolen election in 2020, and Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who wrote an anonymous op-ed sharply critical of the president in 2018.
Meanwhile, House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky, a Republican, requested transcribed interviews with five Biden aides, alleging they had participated in a “cover-up” that amounted to “one of the greatest scandals in our nation’s history.”
“These five former senior advisors were eyewitnesses to President Biden’s condition and operations within the Biden White House,” Comer said in a statement. “They must appear before the House Oversight Committee and provide truthful answers about President Biden’s cognitive state and who was calling the shots.”
Interviews were requested with White House senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn, former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, former deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti, a former counselor to the president.
Comer reiterated his call for Biden’s physician, Kevin O’Connor, and former senior White House aides Annie Tomasini, Anthony Bernal, Ashley Williams and Neera Tanden to appear before the committee. He warned subpoenas would be issued this week if they refuse to schedule voluntary interviews.
“I think that people will start coming in the next two weeks,” Comer told reporters. He added that the committee would release a report with its findings, “and we’ll release the transcribed interviews, so it’ll be very transparent.”
Democrats have dismissed the effort as a distraction.
“Chairman Comer had his big shot in the last Congress to impeach Joe Biden and it was, of course, a spectacular flop,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who served as the ranking member on the oversight committee in the previous Congress. “And now he’s just living off of a spent dream. It’s over. And he should give up the whole thing.”
Republicans on the committee are eager to pursue the investigation.
“The American people didn’t elect a bureaucracy to run the country,” said Rep. Brandon Gill, a freshman Republican from Texas. “I think that the American people deserve to know the truth and they want to know the truth of what happened.”
The Republican inquiry so far has focused on the final executive actions of Biden’s administration, which included the issuing of new federal rules and presidential pardons that they claim may be invalid.
Comer cited the book “Original Sin” by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, which details concerns and debates inside the White House and Democratic Party over Biden’s mental state and age.
In the book, Tapper and Thompson wrote, “Five people were running the country, and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board.”
Biden and members of his family have vigorously denied the book’s claims.

Tricked into feeding $100 bills into a crypto ATM: A look into Louisiana's battle with scammers,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/crime_police/crypto-atms-bitcoin-louisiana-scam-elderly/article_213dcab4-f423-458c-96b0-a9f4aedc539a.html,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 09:00:00 -0500","Hundreds of thousands of crypto ATMs are popping up at gas stations, pharmacies and vape shops across the country. As local law enforcement struggles to manage the cyber crime they facilitate, recent legislation has been introduced that would force ATM…","When Danny Foret’s computer froze one morning, a window flashed on the screen urging him to call Microsoft customer support. But after he dialed the number, Foret says, his minor headache turned disastrous.
The support agent informed him his computer had been hacked, giving someone access to his bank account: $9,000 had been spent at a child pornography site, with another $4,000 siphoned toward online gambling.
Panic set in, Foret recalls, but the voice on the other line was reassuring, his instructions clear: Don’t touch your computer, don’t speak to anyone, and above all, act fast.
Shaken, Foret followed orders, withdrawing cash from his local bank. To prevent further theft, the caller said, the rest of the money needed a secure location: a Bitcoin ATM across the street at a Chevron. The 78-year-old Thibodaux native had spent a lifetime working oil fields for Texaco and says he'd never even heard of Bitcoin. Now he found himself scanning a QR code that allowed him to send money to an address recorded on something called a blockchain.
It wasn't until the next morning that he began to feel uneasy. By then, a third of his life savings was gone, fed in $100 bills through a machine.
“I was so upset that day I didn’t think straight,” Foret said. “They were polished, I guarantee it.”
The use of crypto currencies — digital assets that operate on decentralized networks rather than regulated authorities — has exploded in recent years. So too have their physical counterparts.
Thousands of crypto ATMs are popping up at gas stations, pharmacies and vape shops across the country. The companies that own them claim the machines make it easier for the tech-unsavvy to invest in crypto. But many law enforcement officials argue that same convenience allows criminals to easily scam people and launder money.
“Right now, this is not a system that gives any confidence to law enforcement that it's being legitimately used,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said. “There are a lot of smarter things these companies could do to make it a legitimate enterprise.”
The Federal Trade Commission reports that fraud losses at crypto ATMs increased tenfold between 2020 to 2023, with $66 million reported in the first six months of 2024. In Louisiana, as local law enforcement struggles to manage the new threat, legislation has been introduced recently that would force companies to help curtail criminals.
Crime's new frontier
As the realization that he had been scammed dawned on Foret, he contacted Sgt. Gerard Lotz, who handles cyber fraud for the Lafourche Parish Sheriff’s Office and is also a member of the Louisiana Cyber Crimes Division, a state-run program that collaborates with the U.S. Secret Service.
“They needed someone to investigate crypto, I just happened to be standing in the hallway,” said Lotz, who admits most of what he initially learned about Bitcoin came from 12-year-olds on YouTube. “They say I’m the foremost expert in cryptocurrency in Lafourche Parish.""
Lotz first noticed crypto ATMs appearing in his mostly rural parish over the summer of 2023. Since then, he has come across 30 or so of the machines in Lafourche. During the first 10 months of 2024, Lafourche residents reported losing $1.6 million to cryptocurrency scams, with $657,000 fed solely through ATMs.
“If 2% of the population of Louisiana accounts for $1.6 million in cryptocurrency fraud, how much is it for the whole state of Louisiana?” Lotz said.
Many cases go unreported by both victims and law enforcement. When they are brought to light, resource-strapped police departments rarely pursue them since the investigations are unlikely to end in arrests, Lotz said.
“The scam industry has evolved in the past years,” said Paul Sibenik, founder and CEO of Crypto Forensic Investigators, a private firm many people turn to when their losses exceed six figures.
While 90% of his cases involve scammers operating from overseas — often calling from countries like Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos — Sibenik says the schemes are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The groups behind them are larger, more organized and frequently linked to transnational enterprises such as Chinese crime syndicates, or, in the case of North Korea, state-sponsored schemes.
Many scammers are often victims themselves, Lotz said. According to a United Nations Report, an estimated 220,000 people have been trafficked into Southeast Asia for the sole purpose of conning people, forced to call around the clock from industrial-scale compounds. Globally, The Economist reports that up to 1.5 million people — both coerced and voluntary — are involved in the industry.
Despite his devastating loss, Foret expressed some sympathy for many caught up in the business.
“I guess they almost have to do it,” he said. “That’s rough.”
Tricky tactics
Lotz and Sibenik said getting people to the ATMs is made easier by personal information posted on the dark web by criminal hacker groups. Fraudsters pose as customer service representatives from banks or tech companies, develop business or romantic relationships, or impersonate local and federal government agents to convince victims they owe bogus fines and fees — such as alleged Social Security overpayments or outstanding warrants.
In three incidents in Lafourche, scammers targeted newer gas station employees, posing as their bosses and convincing them to transfer cash from their office’s safe into the ATMs, said Lotz. Others in the parish were victims of a nationwide scheme run by a prison gang in Georgia, where cellmates introduced themselves as local law enforcement.
“One represented themselves as our chief deputy, one as the detective captain,” Lotz said.
The main giveaway, he said, was that they called it “Lafourche County.”
After cash is converted to Bitcoin — or any of the thousands of other cryptocurrencies — the funds are typically sent to an online wallet controlled by the scammer. By the time victims realize they have been defrauded, thieves have usually already used “mixing services” — tools that combine stolen cryptocurrency with funds from other sources and distribute it across multiple accounts to obscure the origins of the scammed money.
“It's like starting a race 50 laps into the race,” Lotz said.
In rare cases where investigators identify a wallet address, blockchain technology — a public ledger recording all cryptocurrency transactions — enables them to trace funds between accounts.
“The problem is, you don’t know who is tied to that Bitcoin,” Lotz said. “I can’t give a search warrant to Bitcoin because it doesn’t exist; it’s a concept.”
So investigators monitor transactions but usually can’t do much until funds end up in an online exchange. Analogous to traditional banks, exchanges are law enforcement’s best chance to recover funds because they provide an opportunity to freeze assets. But that requires cooperation, and most criminals use exchanges based outside the U.S. in countries like the Bahamas or the Seychelles with weak regulations and minimal identification requirements.
“That way if a warrant is served from another country or a law enforcement agency, they can say ‘Hey I don't have any info on this person,’” he added.
Even if the exchange provides personal information, Lotz says, law enforcement sometimes has to wait days for search warrants to be processed by a judge, by which point the scammer has usually offloaded the funds back into cash. Private companies like Sibenik's face similar restraints once they locate stolen money.
“In order to recover funds that are frozen, pretty much every exchange wants a law enforcement request,” Sibenik added. “This crypto can be very fast, and the legal system does not move fast.”
Lawmakers respond
Crypto ATM companies say they facilitate access to digital currency. Most machines charge between 15% and 30% in transaction fees. By comparison, major online exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken charge 0.1% to 0.4% and allow users to convert cash to crypto from home.
“It begs the question why anybody would put cash into a machine like this when they could do it a different way.” Attorney General Murrill said.
In February, Athena Bitcoin, a major Bitcoin ATM provider, was sued in Maryland for allegedly enabling elder financial abuse. The lawsuit claims the company allowed exploitation by failing to implement adequate safeguards.
Bitcoin Depot, the largest Bitcoin ATM network in the world, received $5,418 from Foret’s transactions in February. Lotz says it has refused to return the money, despite law enforcement requests. In an email response to The Advocate, a representative for the company said Bitcoin Depot was unable to comment on the story.
“The most vulnerable people are being affected by the machines, and these companies are taking 30%.” Lotz said.
Reacting to the local cases, Lafourche Sheriff Craig Webre called the Attorney General's Office to raise the alarm. The conversation prompted the introduction of House Bill 483 during this spring’s state legislative session.
Sponsored by Rep. Mark Wright, the bill would place new restrictions on crypto ATM use, including a $3,000 daily transaction limit, a mandatory 72-hour waiting period before transactions are processed, and a warning on each machine stating that “no state or government official will ever request that cash be deposited into a Crypto ATM.”
Murrill said the three-day transaction hold is intended to give law enforcement a window to recover funds in cases of suspected fraud, citing incidents where Lafourche sheriff’s deputies were able to seize cash from an ATM moments before it was collected by an armored truck.
The $3,000 daily cap also aims to deter money laundering, as current machines allow unlimited cash deposits — activity that if large enough would automatically raise red flags from the IRS in traditional banking systems.
Murrill says the bill wouldn't interfere much with the broader crypto industry. On May 12, it passed the House with a 98-0 vote, and the Senate is expected to vote on it Sunday.
After a training course in Alabama with the National Computer Forensics Institute, Lotz was better able to wrap his head around the technology. Tracking software supplied by the federal government has also helped him trace about a quarter of Foret’s stolen funds to a UK-based exchange before they could be withdrawn.
He expects Foret to recover that portion of his money any day, returned in the form of Bitcoin. Thanks to bullish markets, the value of his reclaimed funds has grown a few hundred dollars since they were first stolen.
As he waits, Foret's last request was simple.

Opinion: We set out to quantify U.S. academic contributions to medicines. The results stunned even us,https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/06/us-universities-fda-approved-drugs-research-patents-orange-book/?utm_campaign=rss,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:30:00 +0000","From 2020 to 2024, universities contributed patents underpinning 50% of FDA-approved drugs. 87% of those academic breakthroughs came from American institutions.","In the 1990s, a famous English expatriate scientist had a yellowed cutout posted on his office door. It read, “British science is alive and well … and living in the United States.”
In the future, a similar article might reflect China or other nations successfully exploiting the decay in American research and development.
Behind nearly every prescription filled in America lies a powerful engine of innovation, fueled by the research conducted within the nation’s universities. Picking up a new prescription at the pharmacy represents the culmination of a decades-long choreography between the private, public, and academic sectors that drives this country’s medical innovation and ensures the most cutting-edge care and technology are available here.
Over the past few decades, the foundational science that informs the basic understanding of the human body’s ailments or the applied research to develop treatments has nearly always begun in an American research university. While pharmaceutical companies, like Merck and Bayer, have become household names, rarely is there an understanding of the academic roots of a new drug or therapy: foundations that in most cases date back years or decades.
To quantify this impact, we launched a research project, which is currently preprint, that sought to ask questions about the value of America’s universities to society. We used the narrow area of pharmaceutical drugs as a representative example.
Many things within academia are measured, from graduation rates and alumni earnings to the economic impact of a campus. Research outputs — which propel everything from medicine and technology to the military and environmental protection — provide another opportunity to assess contributions from the nation’s ivory towers. By identifying the inventors of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (and the key patents curated in the FDA Orange Book), our review revealed that from 2020 to 2024, universities contributed patents underpinning 50% of FDA-approved drugs. Even more stunningly, 87% of those academic breakthroughs came from American institutions.
Achieving a patent listed in the FDA Orange Book is a high bar that requires rigorous review. These key patents can determine when a pioneering medicine loses its proprietary protection and can be offered as a generic formulation. Historically, pharmaceutical companies have preferred to keep these valuable jewels in-house given the financial returns, and our earlier research shows that prior to the 21st century, private sector companies dominated pharmaceutical patents and inventorship. This dominance began to crack in the new millennium, with academic inventors and entrepreneurs playing an increasing role as we progressed through the 2000s and 2010s.
These new findings have profound implications. From an economic standpoint, pharmaceutical products account for a substantial and rising portion of American consumer spending and economic activity. The 10 largest pharmaceutical companies have a combined market capitalization of more than $2 trillion. Our updated findings demonstrate that over the past 50 years, these companies have become increasingly reliant upon academic inventors to provide new medicines.
This value is even more remarkable given that our new findings are limited to applied research and do not include the impact of fundamental research performed by many academic scientists. Previous work from our team and others has demonstrated that NIH-funded basic science has contributed to the development of more than 90% of new medicines, vaccines, and devices.
It must also be recognized that American dominance of drug development allows the nation to determine — indeed, to dictate — the diseases studied, and interventions developed. A recent poll in Nature found that 75% of scientists in America were considering leaving the country. Were the nation to allow its academic enterprise to wither, decisions about which diseases to treat and which therapies to develop will be made elsewhere.
The rise of American domination began in the post-war era based on the vision of Vannevar Bush, who led the Manhattan Project and served as an adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Bush, in his seminal report, “Science — The Endless Frontier,” advocated for the need for basic research to ensure national and economic security. This far-sightedness allowed the United States to assert its leadership of the biotechnology revolution that began 50 years ago. The nation’s public and economic health benefited from both training and retaining the world’s top minds.
Looking to the future, China has been investing heavily in both academic research and pharmaceutical development and seeks to displace American hegemony. Such changes have occurred before: The roots of the pharmaceutical industry were largely located in European nations, especially the United Kingdom and Germany, through the first half of the 20th century.
American institutions and the innovators within them have succeeded based on a contract between the federal government and U.S. research universities. The result of major funding for research created the country we know today and is why America has been the dominant player in the development of drugs to treat disease and improve lives of people around the globe. The nation’s research universities are indispensable to pharmaceutical innovation, and continued federal support for academic research is essential to maintain U.S. leadership in global drug development and broad economic growth.

For the first time, global average concentrations of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas emitted as a byproduct of burning fossil fuels, exceeded 430 parts per million (ppm) in May. The new readings were a record high and represented an increase of more than 3 ppm over last year.
The measurements indicate that countries are not doing enough to limit greenhouse gas emissions and reverse the steady buildup of C02, which climate scientists point to as the main culprit for global warming.
“Another year, another record,” Ralph Keeling, a professor of climate sciences, marine chemistry and geochemistry at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said in a statement. “It’s sad.”
Carbon dioxide, like other greenhouse gases, traps heat from the sun and can remain in the atmosphere for centuries. As such, high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere contribute to higher global temperatures and other negative consequences of climate change, including rising sea levels, melting polar ice, and more frequent and severe extreme weather events.
Atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen sharply since preindustrial times, owing mostly to human activities that pump greenhouse gases into the air.
Decades ago, crossing the 400 ppm threshold was unthinkable. That meant that for every 1 million molecules of gas in the atmosphere, more than 400 were carbon dioxide. The planet hit that grim milestone in 2013. And now, scientists have warned that levels of CO2 could reach 500 ppm within 30 years.
But human society is already in uncharted territory.
The last time the planet had such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was likely more than 30 million years ago, Keeling said, long before humans roamed Earth and during a time when the climate was vastly different.
He said it’s alarming not only how high CO2 levels have climbed, but also how quickly.
“It’s changing so fast,” he told NBC News. “If humans had evolved in such a high-CO2 world, there would probably be places where we wouldn’t be living now. We probably could have adapted to such a world, but we built our society and a civilization around yesterday’s climate.”
Carbon dioxide levels are typically represented on a graph known as the Keeling Curve, named for Keeling’s father, Charles David Keeling, who began taking daily measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide in 1958 with instruments atop the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.
The Keeling Curve famously shows a steep climb since the Industrial Revolution, owing to human-caused climate change.
Ralph Keeling and his colleagues at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found that average concentrations of atmospheric CO2 in May were 430.2 ppm. NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory, which has conducted separate daily readings since 1974, reported an average of 430.5 ppm in May.
Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are closely monitored to gauge how much humans are influencing Earth’s climate. The readings are also an indicator of the planet’s overall health.
“They’re telling you about your whole system health with a single-point measurement,” Keeling said. “We’re getting a holistic measurement of the atmosphere from really a kind of simple set of measurements.”",NBC News,['university of california san diego'],"['tens of millions', 'the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration', 'the University of California San Diego', 'C02', 'Ralph Keeling', 'UC San Diego’s', 'more than 30 million years ago', 'Keeling', 'NBC News', 'the Keeling Curve', 'Keeling', 'Charles David Keeling', 'Hawaii', 'The Keeling Curve', 'the Industrial Revolution', 'Ralph Keeling', 'the Scripps Institution of Oceanography', 'NOAA', 'Global Monitoring Laboratory', 'Keeling']",,0

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show with the escalating feud between President Trump and Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who, up until just recently, was a top presidential adviser and Trump’s top political benefactor. The fight could have broad implications for Trump’s presidency, the Republican Party and many government programs, including NASA, that rely on technology from Musk’s various companies. The feud became public Tuesday when Musk called Trump’s so-called big, beautiful budget bill a “disgusting abomination” because it will increase the federal deficit by $2.5 trillion. The tension then escalated considerably on Thursday.
During a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a reporter asked Trump about Musk’s comment. This is part of his response.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I’m very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars. And it really is unfair. … He knew it better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left. And if you saw the statements he made about me, which I’m sure you can get very easily — it’s very fresh, on tape — he said the most beautiful things about me. And he hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that’ll be next. But I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.
AMY GOODMAN: The feud then spilled into social media, with the two billionaires launching personal attacks on their own social media platforms, Musk on X and Trump on Truth Social.
At 2:37 p.m. Thursday, Trump wrote, “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” unquote.
At 3:10 p.m., Musk wrote, quote, “Time to drop the really big bomb, @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”
Then Trump wrote, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Trump said.
Musk responded by threatening to decommission the Dragon spacecraft used by NASA. Musk also appeared to back the impeachment of Trump and took credit for Trump winning the presidency.
Trump ally Steve Bannon went further, calling for Musk to be investigated and deported. He also called Trump to seize Musk’s company SpaceX.
To talk more about the fracturing of the Trump-Musk relationship and what this could mean for the Republican Party, we’re joined by Quinn Slobodian, professor of international history at Boston University, working on a book about Elon Musk titled Muskism. He is author of Hayek’s Bastards: Race, Gold, IQ, and the Capitalism of the Far Right, as well as Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy.
Professor Slobodian, welcome back to Democracy Now! Were you shocked by what you saw happen yesterday? I mean, who knows? They could be holding a joint news conference soon and announce they’re back in love.
QUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. I mean, they are people who always have their eye on the bottom line, but they also are, obviously, titanically sized egos. And I think that, more than anything, this is just a sign of how dangerous it is to put billions of dollars, even the lives of astronauts, the whole future of the American economy and the political scene, in the hands of two sole human beings.
AMY GOODMAN: When you said threaten the lives of astronauts, explain.
QUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, the Dragon unit that you mentioned is the only way for the astronauts in the International Space Station to get to and from where they are now. So, were he to decommission it, it might literally mean that they would be stranded out there, kind of Gravity style.
So, this is just one of the examples of many of the offloading of core government functions onto private service providers, that Elon Musk has been so masterful at playing, that we feel more and more exposed to, from the use of Starlink satellites in the field of battle in the Ukraine to the use of the same internet connection as leverage in his battle with the Brazilian government. I feel like, over time, we’ll only realize more and more how much we are at the mercy of someone who is acting with total impetuousness, and sometimes not even with his own self-interest in mind.
AMY GOODMAN: Let’s go from the threat to lives in space to here on the ground, Elon Musk taking on the budget, calling it an “abomination.” When Trump said he knows that — the budget bill better than almost anyone else, inside and out, Musk’s response was, “That is false. I never saw it. It was passed in the middle of the night.” Can you talk about the significance? I mean, this is the guy in charge of DOGE. How many thousands of jobs have been lost? And yet, at the same time now he’s viciously attacking the budget that was so narrowly passed, and it could threaten its ultimate passage.
QUINN SLOBODIAN: I mean, I think it’s worth sort of returning to the question of why Musk got involved at all with Trump — right? — what he was doing with this DOGE project. And I think it’s possible to kind of split it up into three categories.
I think, first of all, he was doing a kind of a bear hug strategy. So, I think, especially on the trade war and his many, many interests in China, you know, he has a Gigafactory there that has capacity to make a million Teslas a year. He wanted to get out in front of any possible excess of economic nationalism that might be rolled out.
And then I think he was kind of making a Hail Mary move, that, you know, he hadn’t really clicked with the Biden administration, and this could be a chance to maybe use a window of opportunity to boost his own aspirations, especially in artificial intelligence, where he was being outpaced by people like Sam Altman and OpenAI.
And then, third, I think you could see it as a kind of moonshot strategy, where I think he was trying to really even more plug in his own services, especially SpaceX, to, in fact, not only get to the moon, but divert the whole project towards Mars. So, there was a lot of reasons why Musk would want to be involved.
But from Trump’s point of view, he’s never really been a fiscal hawk, right? He’s always actually run against austerity in certain ways and run against this mainstream obsession with the debt ceiling and the deficit that has so defined GOP politics for the last couple decades. So it was always kind of an odd fit, and it’s not surprising in that sense that Musk now feels that this budget is, you know, not hard austerity enough for his liking. It’s telling, for example, that he’s posted multiple Milton Friedman memes over the last couple of days, sort of implying that this problem of runaway debt inflation should be top of mind at all times for the government. But Trump has always profited by playing fast and loose with that kind of ideology.
And the question is: Why now has this led to a snapping point —
AMY GOODMAN: So —
QUINN SLOBODIAN: — for Musk? And I think there’s a —
AMY GOODMAN: Keep going.
QUINN SLOBODIAN: If I could just say, I think there’s a couple of things there. I think Trump invokes the EV mandate, and that is a serious issue, right? What that is — it needs to be broken down — is the capacity of California to enforce a move towards electric cars over time, a part of which is a regulatory credit system that allows normal ICE — internal combustion engine — vehicles to buy credits from electric vehicle manufacturers. And this is now 40% of Tesla’s net income in the last year. It went up a billion dollars in the last year alone. And if that gets killed, it really does kind of kill Tesla’s margin. And I think that Musk is starting to feel the heat from Chinese producers like BYD, battery producers like CATL. And I think he sees here maybe the possible demise of the Tesla brand, as he is hated more and more from both sides of the spectrum. So, there’s reasons, as he returns to his businesses, to start to sweat about what he’s actually signed up for.
AMY GOODMAN: How about what this highlights around a rift within the MAGA movement, and where JD Vance fits into this, the vice president?
QUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, it’s always interesting to ask what exactly was going on with DOGE, right? I mean, if you want to get into the real kind of Dangerous Liaisons kind of courtesanship, I think, that is happening inside of the White House, it seems that, based on reporting, Stephen Miller was kind of stage managing, along with his wife, a lot of what was happening with DOGE.
And if you look at what actually came out of DOGE — and this is a good time now for us to sort of do a autopsy or postmortem on it, as it winds down, really — he said he was going to do 2 trillion cut — $2 trillion in cuts, out of a $6 trillion budget — very unlikely — went back to $1 trillion, scaled it back to $150 billion. What did they end up taking out? I mean, it’s basically culture war stuff, right? I mean, it’s ways to trigger the progressives and the libs — get rid of USAID, attack NEH funding, arts funding, science funding, education, energy. These ended up being big wins not really for Musk’s own bottom-line, cost-cutting mentality, but very much for the culture war being waged by people like Miller and JD Vance and Russell Vought at the Office of Management and Budget. So there is a way of looking at this as having been a success from their point of view. They were able to use the credibility of Musk as a kind of supposed, you know, brilliant, Edison-like inventor and wonderful, efficiency-creating cost cutter to actually get to some of their political goals.
But they never could bring that big number down. Why? Because entitlement spending still dominates the state spending in the GDP. And when you come close to that, you come close to the kind of beating heart of the social contract. And we saw the town hall meetings. We saw the anger when things started to encroach on the questions of Social Security and Medicaid. And for me, that was a very telling moment, and it was one that I think took Musk by surprise, too. He’s not used to the idea of needing to engage with a kind of consent and legitimacy mechanism where people feel like they paid into something and should now get something back. He’s used to interacting with a Twitter fan base, a set of really bought-in Tesla investors, for whom, you know, he always walks on water and he’s a god reincarnate. And when he just was confronted with the anger of average people who want to make sure that they can pay for their next meal, he didn’t know what to do.
So, I think that there’s a kind of a — there’s a way to see this as a victory for the national conservatives. They got to do some of their their easy wins against the progressives and the libs, and now they’re able to keep the door open for more protectionism and expansion of spending, as we see in the so-called big, beautiful bill.
AMY GOODMAN: Finally, do you think Musk has access to all of the private information that his DOGE army downloaded from all the agencies? Is that possible?
QUINN SLOBODIAN: I am not a software programmer, and I do not know how databases work that well, but it seems at least likely that part of what they were doing there, when they were converting things done in old programming languages and updating them, was also harvesting a lot of that data for use for we don’t know what. Feeding the machine of Grok or xAI is the most likely answer.
AMY GOODMAN: And finally, let me ask you: Steve Bannon, who’s on the anti-Musk side of the MAGA rift, has been calling for Trump to nationalize Musk’s businesses and for him to be deported, right? I mean, Elon Musk comes from South Africa.
QUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. I mean, this actually isn’t the harshest thing that Bannon has ever said. He referred to Silicon Valley as an “apartheid state” a few months ago. The idea of nationalizing SpaceX is an interesting one. It would certainly run against the core privatization ethos that Trump and the former GOP has been following for decades and decades. So far, I would chalk that up to just saber-rattling rhetoric for his podcast, more than an actual policy proposal.
AMY GOODMAN: Quinn Slobodian, I want to thank you for being with us, professor of international history at Boston University. Among other books, Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy, working on his new book called Muskism.
When we come back, we look at the deadly impact of the House budget bill. Back in 20 seconds.

Louisiana LIGO scientists fear Trump administration's proposed cuts: 'So much science would be lost',https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/louisiana-ligo-scientists-proposed-trump-budget/article_0d8e0238-745b-4b62-b51e-cd644d764958.html,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 13:30:00 -0500","Scientists believe if the Trump administration's proposed budget is approved, a Louisiana space observatory could be on the chopping block and see its scientific mission crippled.","Scientists believe if the Trump administration's proposed budget is approved, a Louisiana space observatory could be on the chopping block and see its scientific mission crippled.
The Trump administration announced on May 30 a proposed federal budget request for 2026 that would cut $5.2 billion, or 57%, of the National Science Foundation's $9 billion annual budget.
The proposal could lead to the shutdown of the NSF-funded observatory tucked away in the Livingston Parish piney woods, which made international headlines in 2015 when it detected gravitation waves from black holes more than a billion light years away.
The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is one of two in the United States. Its counterpart is LIGO Hanford in Washington state.
Under the proposed federal budget, only one LIGO observatory would operate with a reduced level of spending for LIGO technology development in the 2026 fiscal year, according to the budget proposal.
LIGO Livingston Observatory Head Joseph Giaime said that if either observatory were to close, ""the amount of space we can see into is much diminished.”
“We run together. We use data together. We’re able to dig more deeply into space together,” he said.
While it is unclear which LIGO observatory would have to shut down if the proposed budget were approved, scientists believe it would be harmful to both observatories either way.
LIGO Executive Director David Reitze, who oversees both observatories and is based at the California Institute of Technology, said in an email that LIGO is preparing for a 39.6% budget reduction for LIGO and are working to understand what can keep operating.
Reitze said this type of budget cut would force LIGO to make ""very hard choices"" about picking programs to terminate. He also said LIGO is talking to NSF to understand the decision process behind potentially closing an observatory
""Honestly, shutting down either LIGO Livingston or LIGO Hanford would cripple our scientific mission,"" Reitze said. ""How can we even make a decision like that?""
Plans on hold
LIGO had planned to temporarily shut down some parts of its Livingston facility over the next two years to install a number of technology improvements. The new technology would lead to more gravitational wave detections and increase the possibility of discovering new types of gravitational-wave sources. But the proposed budget cut could stall these plans.
""We'll have to put those upgrade plans on hold. So much science would be lost,"" he said.
Each LIGO observatory employs approximately 50 people. The Livingston site also hosts graduate students and researchers, including LSU researchers, according to Reitze.
The NSF froze funding grants in January after a White House memo called for a pause in federal grant spending and then rescinded the memo. LIGO has since been under a hiring freeze, but did not reduce any staff at either observatory, said Whitney Clavin, a Caltech spokesperson, in March.
LIGO has had significant ties to LSU for decades. The university even proposed Livingston as a location for the observatory. It is the only LIGO site close to a university, said LSU professor of physics and astronomy Gabriela González.
González, who was also the spokesperson for the international LIGO Scientific Collaboration during the 2015 breakthrough, said many scientists come to work at LSU because of LIGO.
She said if support for LIGO is eliminated or drastically reduced, observatory employees from Baton Rouge, Hammond and across the state would lose their jobs.
“If NSF support for LIGO research is reduced … it would not let us attract graduate students and postdocs to LSU who later work for the technological workforce in Louisiana and the U.S.,"" she said. ""Our physics and astronomy department and others in the country saw a large increase in applications to graduate school citing LIGO as one the main factors”
The gravitational waves discovery in 2015 confirmed a key prediction of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity and kick-started a new era of astronomy. Since then, LIGO has observed hundreds more gravitational waves.
Aside from operating and improving the gravitational wave detector, the Livingston observatory's main goals are also to use LIGO data for science, and to carry out education and public outreach at the LIGO Science Education center. The observatory hosts school field trips and public tours on the first Saturday of every month.

Fiona Hill, from County Durham, became the White House’s chief Russia adviser during Donald Trump’s first term and contributed to the British government’s strategy. She made the remarks in an interview with the Guardian.
“We’re in pretty big trouble,” Hill said, describing the UK’s geopolitical situation as caught between “the rock” of Vladimir Putin’s Russia and “the hard place” of Donald Trump’s increasingly unpredictable US.
Hill, 59, is perhaps the best known of the reviewers appointed by Labour, alongside Lord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, and the retired general Sir Richard Barrons. She said she was happy to take on the role because it was “such a major pivot point in global affairs”. She remains a dual national after living in the US for more than 30 years.
“Russia has hardened as an adversary in ways that we probably hadn’t fully anticipated,” Hill said, arguing that Putin saw the Ukraine war as a starting point to Moscow becoming “a dominant military power in all of Europe”.
As part of that long-term effort, Russia was already “menacing the UK in various different ways,” she said, citing “the poisonings, assassinations, sabotage operations, all kinds of cyber-attacks and influence operations. The sensors that we see that they’re putting down around critical pipelines, efforts to butcher undersea cables.”
The conclusion, Hill said, was that “Russia is at war with us”. The foreign policy expert, a longtime Russia watcher, said she had first made a similar warning in 2015, in a revised version of a book she wrote about the Russian president with Clifford Gaddy, reflecting on the invasion and annexation of Crimea.
“We said Putin had declared war on the west,” she said. At the time, other experts disagreed, but Hill said events since had demonstrated “he obviously had, and we haven’t been paying attention to it”. The Russian leader, she argues, sees the fight in Ukraine as “part of a proxy war with the United States; that’s how he has persuaded China, North Korea and Iran to join in”.
Putin believed that Ukraine had already been decoupled from the US relationship, Hill said, because “Trump really wants to have a separate relationship with Putin to do arms control agreements and also business that will probably enrich their entourages further, though Putin doesn’t need any more enrichment”.
When it came to defence, however, she said the UK could not rely on the military umbrella of the US as during the cold war and in the generation that followed, at least “not in the way that we did before”. In her description, the UK “is having to manage its number one ally”, though the challenge is not to overreact because “you don’t want to have a rupture”.
This way of thinking appears in the defence review published earlier this week, which says “the UK’s longstanding assumptions about global power balances and structures are no longer certain” – a rare acknowledgment in a British government document of how far and how fast Trumpism is affecting foreign policy certainties.
The review team reported to Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, and the defence secretary, John Healey. Most of Hill’s interaction were with Healey, however, and she said she had met the prime minister only once – describing him as “pretty charming … in a proper and correct way” and as “having read all the papers”.
Hill was not drawn on whether she had advised Starmer or Healey on how to deal with Donald Trump, saying instead: “The advice I would give is the same I would give in a public setting.” She said simply that the Trump White House “is not an administration, it is a court” in which a transactional president is driven by his “own desires and interests, and who listens often to the last person he talks to”.
She added that unlike his close circle, Trump had “a special affinity for the UK” based partly on his own family ties (his mother came from the Hebridean island of Lewis, emigrating to New York aged 18) and an admiration for the royal family, particularly the late queen. “He talked endlessly about that,” she said.
On the other hand, Hill is no fan of the populist right administration in the White House and worries it could come to Britain if “the same culture wars” are allowed to develop with the encouragement of Republicans from the US.
She noted that Reform UK had won a string of council elections last month, including in her native Durham, and that the party’s leader, Nigel Farage, wanted to emulate some of the aggressive efforts to restructure government led by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) before his falling-out with Trump.
“When Nigel Farage says he wants to do a Doge against the local county council, he should come over here [to the US] and see what kind of impact that has,” she said. “This is going to be the largest layoffs in US history happening all at once, much bigger than hits to steelworks and coalmines.”
Hill’s argument is that in a time of profound uncertainty, Britain needs greater internal cohesion if it is to protect itself. “We can’t rely exclusively on anyone any more,” she said, arguing that Britain needed to have “a different mindset” based as much on traditional defence as on social resilience.
Some of that, Hill said, was about a greater recognition of the level of external threat and initiatives for greater integration, by teaching first aid in schools or encouraging more teenagers to join school cadet forces, a recommendation of the defence review. “What you need to do is get people engaged in all kinds of different ways in support of their communities,” she said.
Hill said she saw that deindustrialisation and a rise of inequality in Russia and the US had contributed to the rise in national populism in both countries. Politicians in Britain, or elsewhere, “have to be much more creative and engage people where they are at” as part of a “national effort”, she said.
If this seems far away from a conventional view of defence, that’s because it is, though Hill also argues that traditional conceptions of war are changing as technology evolves and with it what makes a potent force.
“People keep saying the British army has the smallest number of troops since the Napoleonic era. Why is the Napoleonic era relevant? Or that we have fewer ships than the time of Charles II. The metrics are all off here,” she said. “The Ukrainians are fighting with drones. Even though they have no navy, they sank a third of the Russian Black Sea fleet.”
Her aim, therefore, is not just to be critical but to propose solutions. Hill recalled that a close family friend, on hearing that she had taken on the defence review, had told her: “‘Don’t tell us how shite we are, tell us what we can do, how we can fix things.’ People understand that we have a problem and that the world has changed.”",The Guardian,['dei'],"['Russia', 'Britain', 'US', 'UK', 'Fiona Hill', 'County Durham', 'Russia', 'Donald Trump’s', 'Guardian', 'Hill', 'UK', 'Vladimir Putin’s', 'Russia', 'Donald Trump’s', 'US', 'Hill', 'Labour', 'Robertson', 'Nato', 'Richard Barrons', 'US', 'Russia', 'Hill', 'Putin', 'Ukraine', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'UK', 'Hill', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Clifford Gaddy', 'Crimea', 'Putin', 'Hill', 'Ukraine', 'the United States', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Iran', 'Putin', 'Ukraine', 'US', 'Hill', 'Putin', 'Putin', 'UK', 'US', 'the cold war', 'UK', 'UK', 'Keir Starmer', 'Rachel Reeves', 'John Healey', 'Hill', 'Healey', 'Hill', 'Starmer', 'Healey', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump White House', 'Trump', 'UK', 'Lewis', 'New York', 'Hill', 'the White House', 'Britain', 'US', 'UK', 'Durham', 'Nigel Farage', 'Elon Musk’s', 'Trump', 'Nigel Farage', 'US', 'US', 'Hill', 'Britain', 'Britain', 'Hill', 'Hill', 'Russia', 'US', 'Britain', 'Hill', 'Napoleonic', 'Charles II', 'Hill']",,0

UnitedHealth accidentally sent STAT a confidential prep doc
An internal document drafted in advance of UnitedHealth Group’s shareholder meeting this week reveals how the company’s leadership — facing an extraordinary series of financial and legal challenges — sought to downplay complaints about its business practices and assure jittery investors that it will soon return to maximum profitability.
The 18-page document, marked in red “privileged and confidential,” was mistakenly sent by a UnitedHealth spokesperson to STAT’s Casey Ross, who had emailed with questions for a different story. The memo runs through manicured talking points apparently intended to coordinate the response to shareholders’ questions. It also discusses missed revenue targets, a litany of lawsuits and federal investigations, and concerns revealed in reporting by STAT that the company uses artificial intelligence and bureaucratic barriers to delay and deny care.
Casey said he was “stunned” upon seeing the email. “As a reporter, you understand that these activities take place within publicly traded companies,” he said. “But it is another thing entirely to get an unvarnished, behind-the-scenes window.” Read more from Casey, Tara Bannow, and Bob Herman. And it’s never a bad time to re-read some of the team’s excellent, award-winning coverage on the company:
- Part 1 of the latest series, “Health Care’s Colossus,” looked at how UnitedHealth leveraged its physician empire to squeeze profits out of patients. Here’s a video explainer on how it works.
- Part 2 looked at how UnitedHealth turned a questionable artery-screening program into a moneymaker.
- STAT’s 2023 “Denied by AI” UnitedHealth series began with how Medicare Advantage plans use algorithms to cut off care for seniors. The series continued with a story on internal dissent at UnitedHealth, and pressure to follow the algorithm on discharge decisions. The final installment looked at the use of secret rules to restrict rehab care.

That’s how many people would lose health insurance under Trump’s tax cut bill, according to projections published yesterday by nonpartisan congressional scorekeepers. Overall, the bill increases the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over a decade, thanks to its extension of Trump’s tax cuts and the enactment of new ones. Read more on the details from STAT’s John Wilkerson.
The approaching confusion over Covid vaccinations
Last week, key changes were made to the CDC’s Covid vaccination recommendations for healthy children and healthy pregnant people. For children, the recommendation changed from saying they “should” get vaccinated to saying they “may.” For pregnant people, the CDC now offers no advice at all. The changes will complicate discussions between pediatricians and parents, obstetricians and pregnant people, along with both groups and insurers, experts told STAT’s Helen Branswell. And the lack of any recommendation for pregnant people could lead insurers to stop covering the cost of the shots for that group.
“The last thing that health care professionals who are advocates for the health of women and their babies need is an undermining or mixed message from the federal government,” Ruth Faden, a professor of biomedical ethics, told Helen. Read more about what problems could arise.
Former Novo Nordisk employees on falling behind in the obesity drug race
When Novo Nordisk launched its new weight loss medication Wegovy in 2021, it took an early lead in the race to dominate what quickly became a booming market for obesity medications. But now, the company is widely seen as trailing competitor Eli Lilly. Novo’s stock has tumbled over 50% since its peak around a year ago, it just ousted its CEO, and there’s been an exodus of other top leaders from its Copenhagen headquarters.
So what happened? STAT’s Elaine Chen spoke with former Novo employees who have some theories, which all come down to an overly conservative approach to obesity drugs. “The open discussions in general about anti-obesity meds was — we needed to be cautious at that time and that adverse events would weigh heavier at the early stages of these types of programs,” one former employee said. Read more about what went wrong, according to the folks that were there.
These psych meds come with a higher risk of ALS, study says
Prescribed use of common psychiatric medications comes with a higher risk of later developing the devastating neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, according to a study published yesterday in JAMA Network Open. Specifically, the use of anti-anxiety meds, antidepressants, or hypnotics/sedatives was associated with a 34%, 26%, and 21% higher risk of ALS respectively. Using these drugs before diagnosis was also linked with poor survival afterward.
Researchers analyzed data from all patients diagnosed with ALS in Sweden between 2015 and 2023. That constituted more than 1,000 people, each of whom was age- and sex-matched with up to five people from the general population, as well as their siblings and spouses.
The results shouldn’t be seen as cause to quit your meds. For people who used medication within a year before their ALS diagnosis, the link could reflect reverse causation, the authors wrote, as the disease can come with psychiatric symptoms. And even for people who used these meds more than five years before their diagnosis, the psych conditions could be initial symptoms. More research is needed.

Trump's surgeon general pick criticizes others' conflicts but profits from wellness product sales,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trumps-surgeon-general-pick-criticizes-others-conflicts-profits-wellne-rcna211420,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:02:33 GMT","President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation’s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health.","PROVIDENCE, R.I. — President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation’s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health.
Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products — including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service — in ways that put money in her own pocket.
A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.
In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.
Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn’t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a “material connection” to a product they promote.
Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.
“I fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.
The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government’s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users’ glucose levels, could benefit from this administration’s health guidance and policy.
Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.
The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being “bought off” or “corrupt” because of ties to industry.
Means’ use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.
A compelling origin story
Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.
“During my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,” she wrote on her website.
Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.
Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.
“At the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we’re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we’d want it,” she said on Megyn Kelly’s podcast last year.
But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.
During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn’t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.
Growing an audience, and selling products
Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to “encompass more and more of our lives,” said Emily Hund, author of “The Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.”
With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.
Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don’t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.
“A lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,” said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don’t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.
Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.
Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, “Good Energy”; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.
She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included “affiliate” or “partner” coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a “metabolic health collection.”
On a “My Faves” page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links “are affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.”
It’s not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.
Disclosing conflicts
Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast “Let’s Be Honest” that “relationships are influential.”
“There’s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,” Means said. “We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.”
In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was “insanity” to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, “We need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren’t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.”
On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, “I do understand how it’s messy.”
Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a “Clean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations” guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.
Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.
Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an “Investor and/or Advisor.” The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.
Though the “About” page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that’s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.
Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives’ LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil’s founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means’ business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means’ advice “transformational,” saying her teachings reversed Niazi’s prediabetes and other ailments.
“I am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,” Niazi said in an email.
While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.
“What you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,” Sylvain said, adding, “Should there be any doubt about claims you make about products?”
Potential conflicts pose new ethical questions
Means isn’t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.
Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job — among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.
He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.
Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.
Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.
Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.
“This is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,” Hund said. “Is this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?”",NBC News,['stanford university'],"['PROVIDENCE', 'R.I.', 'Donald Trump', 'U.S.', 'Casey Means', 'The Associated Press found Means', 'AP', 'Jeff Hauser', 'the Revolving Door Project', 'Trump', 'Levels', 'U.S.', 'Robert F.

Flying boats make for a rare sight as Washington clears an island of derelict vessels by helicopter,https://www.yahoo.com/news/flying-boats-rare-sight-washington-014105643.html,2025-06-05T01:41:05Z,,"Flying boats make for a rare sight as Washington clears an island of derelict vessels by helicopter
OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — As the owner of a marina, Kate Gervais is used to seeing boats in the water. But for the last couple of days, she's been seeing them in the air.
The Washington Department of Natural Resources this week used one of its firefighting helicopters to haul abandoned boats off an uninhabited island in the southernmost reaches of Puget Sound, where the vessels had come to rest after drifting with the currents, and fly them to the mainland to be deconstructed later.
With 14 vessels removed, it was the agency's largest operation of its kind, officials said.
“It was a very, very weird sight,” said Gervais, who owns Boston Harbor Marina, just north of Olympia. “The sail boat with the mast was the weirdest one to see.”
A boat removal by helicopter is typically done by a private pilot, but for this operation, which was funded by a federal grant, the DNR opted to use one of its firefighting helicopters. It was cheaper and helped stretch the $1 million NOAA grant, said Commissioner of Public Lands Dave Upthegrove.
The state agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment too much. The aquatic lands where the boats land often include kelp beds, which are critical for supporting the forage fish that salmon rely on.
Vessels for this operation where found in hard-to-reach coves, at the tree line or in mud that rendered an airlift a better option, agency staff said.
Since the boat removal program began in 2002, the department has hauled out more than 1,200 derelict vessels. There are at least 300 more out there, with more found all the time, Upthegrove said.
“It’s a real challenge impacting the Puget Sound when people essentially dump their old boats into the water because they don’t want to deal with disposing of them,"" he said. ""That burden then falls on all of us.”
The federal grant allowed the state to clean up boats on Squaxin Island, an uninhabited island that is of particular cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe. The tribe's people once shared vast lands in western Washington state, but following the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek, the island — 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) long and half a mile (800 meters) wide — was the main area reserved for them, according to the tribe's website.
More in U.S.
Eventually, the tribe's members moved off the island, but they continue to use it for fishing, hunting, shellfish gathering and camping.
“The Squaxin Island Tribe is very enthusiastic about this opportunity to work with DNR to clean-up derelict vessels on tribal lands,” said Daniel Kuntz, the tribe's policy and program manager. “Maintaining clean beaches and water are essential to the Squaxin Island culture to ensure gathering access for future generations.”",Yahoo News,['federal grant'],"['Washington', 'OLYMPIA', 'Wash.', 'AP', 'Kate Gervais', 'The Washington Department of Natural Resources', 'Puget Sound', 'Gervais', 'Olympia', 'DNR', '$1 million', 'NOAA', 'Vessels', 'Upthegrove', 'Washington', 'Treaty of Medicine Creek', 'U.S.', 'DNR', 'Daniel Kuntz']",,0

The Biden-era guidance argued the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act required hospitals to provide treatment during a medical emergency, even in states with near-total abortion bans. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Sarah Varney. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: The Trump administration rescinded federal guidance that required emergency rooms to provide an abortion if the procedure would save a woman's life.That guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 after Roe v. Wade was overturned argued a law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, required hospitals to stabilize a patient's health during medical emergencies, even in states with near-total abortion bans.Yesterday, the administration said the guidance did not reflect President Trump's policy.For more on how this will affect pregnant women and access to lifesaving medical care at large, we're joined by special correspondent Sarah Varney.Sarah, thanks for being here.So why was this law known as EMTALA, why was it implemented in the first place? What problem was it trying to solve? Sarah Varney: So, President Ronald Reagan signed this bill in 1986. At the time, hospitals were routinely turning away poor patients, patients without insurance, and turning them away even when they might have life-threatening medical conditions.So this law was written. It went into effect, and it said that E.R.s across the country that receive Medicare payments, which is essentially every hospital in the United States, has to stabilize a patient with an emergency medical condition before they can transfer them. Geoff Bennett: So what did the Biden administration require post-Dobbs? And what is the Trump administration now saying it no longer has to do? Sarah Varney: A month or so after the Dobbs decision, the Biden administration issued a memorandum.It went out to all the hospitals around the country that received these Medicare funds, and it reminded them that EMTALA was in effect, and that, according to the Biden administration's reading of EMTALA, it meant that even in states that had very strict abortion bans, that women who presented in emergency rooms with life-threatening medical conditions, if an abortion was the procedure that was needed to stabilize her, that those hospitals had to provide that treatment.What the Trump administration is essentially saying is, we're rescinding that letter and leaving it open to interpretation from the different hospitals about whether or not certain emergency medical conditions meet their state ban. Geoff Bennett: And what state, Sarah, would be most affected by this? Sarah Varney: There's certain states where there's really no exception for the health of the pregnant woman. That includes Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.So these are some places where a pregnant person could go into the emergency room, and there would be some debate about whether or not they could have an abortion if that was necessary to stabilize their health. Just as an example, for instance, in South Dakota, they released a report last year that showed that there were — according to their records, that there were zero abortions that happened in South Dakota hospitals in 2023. Geoff Bennett: Sarah, how would this affect a pregnant woman in a red state versus a blue state? Sarah Varney: So there's already — even with the Biden guidance in effect, there has been pretty significant differences between the types of care that pregnant women have gotten in states with abortion bans and states without abortion bans.The Associated Press did an investigation that found dozens of women who were turned away from emergency rooms, including when they needed an abortion to stabilize their health care. ProPublica has also done pretty extraordinary investigative reporting, finding that women have been turned away from emergency rooms or not received the care that they needed.They were either harmed or, in some cases, they died. So we already have seen this divide, really, and this patchwork of care emerging across the United States. Geoff Bennett: And how are anti-abortion groups responding to this announcement? Sarah Varney: Anti-abortion groups are celebrating the rescission of this Biden-era guidance.They say it's actually not necessary. They point to these induced termination of pregnancy reports that I was just mentioning about South Dakota in places like Texas, where you had 14 abortions mostly due to emergency situations in Texas in January of 2025.So the anti-abortion groups and lawmakers, anti-abortion lawmakers say that these laws are working as they were intended and that women can, in fact, get emergency room care when it's necessary. Geoff Bennett: As I understand it, this decision was outlined in Project 2025, that conservative blueprint for a second Trump term. Tell us more about that. Sarah Varney: Well, the EMTALA rescission was actually included in Project 2025, so we're seeing that checked off the list.

Michigan House Republicans sue the secretary of state over election training materials,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/michigan-house-republicans-sue-secretary-state-election-training-122556852,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:22:30 -0400",Michigan Republicans are suing Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in an escalating fight over access to election training material,"Michigan House Republicans sue the secretary of state over election training materials
Michigan Republicans are suing Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in an escalating fight over access to election training material
KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- Michigan Republicans are suing the battleground state's top elections executive over access to election training materials. The lawsuit filed Thursday is the latest escalation in a brewing dispute that began when the GOP took majority control of the state's House of Representatives last year.
Since winning control of the chamber in the 2024 election, statehouse Republicans have repeatedly scrutinized the state's election processes and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026. The conflict comes as some state Republicans echo past false claims of election fraud in Michigan, which was a prime target of President Donald Trump and his backers after his 2020 election loss.
Republicans on the chamber’s Oversight Committee subpoenaed Benson in April, seeking access to training materials for local clerks and staff who administer elections, including access to the Bureau of Elections’ online learning portal.
Benson’s office released some requested materials in response to the subpoena, but not all, citing cybersecurity and physical security concerns related to administering elections and the voting process. The office has said it needs to review the online portal for “sensitive information"" and make redactions.
“Since the beginning of this saga, Secretary Benson has asked lawmakers to let a court review their request for sensitive election information that, in the wrong hands, would compromise the security of our election machines, ballots and officials,” Michigan Department of State spokesperson Cheri Hardmon said in a statement Thursday.
House Republicans say the goal of reviewing the material is to ensure clerks are trained in accordance with Michigan law. The House voted along party lines in May to hold Benson in contempt for not completely complying with the subpoena.
The request for training materials originally came from GOP state Rep. Rachelle Smit, who has pushed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Smit is the chair of the House elections committee, which was renamed to the Elections Integrity Committee with the new Republican majority.
“Secretary Benson has proven she is unwilling to comply with our subpoena and Michigan law,” Rep. Smit said in a statement Thursday. “She’s skirted the rules and done whatever she could to avoid public scrutiny. It’s become overwhelmingly clear that she will never release the training materials we’re looking for without direction from a court.""
The lawsuit asks the Michigan Court of Claims to intervene and compel Benson to comply with the subpoena.
“The public interest is best served if the constitutional order of the State of Michigan is preserved and the Legislature can properly perform its duty to regulate the manner of elections in the state and, if deemed necessary, enact election laws for the benefit of Michigan residents,” the lawsuit says.
Benson gained national attention for defending the results of the 2020 election in the face of Trump’s attempts to undercut the outcome nationwide and in Michigan. Multiple audits — including one conducted by the then-Republican-controlled Michigan Senate — concluded former President Joe Biden won the state in 2020 and that there was no widespread or systemic fraud.
Benson has remained a subject of GOP scrutiny this year.
A Republican state representative introduced three articles of impeachment against Benson on Tuesday, and several of the accusations continue to cast doubts on the results of the 2020 election. With Democrats in control of the state Senate, it’s unlikely the impeachment articles will result in a conviction.",ABC News,"['oversight', 'lawsuit', 'legislature']","['Michigan', 'House', 'Michigan', 'State', 'Jocelyn Benson', 'KALAMAZOO', 'Mich.', 'Michigan', 'GOP', 'House of Representatives', 'State', 'Jocelyn Benson', 'Michigan', 'Donald Trump', 'the chamber’s Oversight Committee', 'Benson', 'the Bureau of Elections', 'Benson’s', 'Benson', 'Michigan Department of State', 'Cheri Hardmon', 'House', 'Michigan', 'House', 'Benson', 'GOP', 'Rachelle Smit', 'House', 'the Elections Integrity Committee', 'Benson', 'Michigan', 'Smit', 'the Michigan Court of Claims', 'Benson', 'the State of Michigan', 'Legislature', 'Michigan', 'Benson', 'Trump', 'Michigan', 'Michigan Senate', 'Joe Biden', 'Benson', 'GOP', 'Benson', 'Senate']",,0
Fury and resignation around the world as Trump's travel ban comes roaring back,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/fury-resignation-world-trumps-travel-ban-comes-roaring-back-rcna211115,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 14:11:19 GMT",Countries across the world were in shock Thursday after President Donald Trump announced a travel ban on nationals from a dozen countries and the cancellation of visa programs for seven more.,"Countries across the world were in shock Thursday after President Donald Trump announced a travel ban on nationals from a dozen countries and the cancellation of visa programs for seven more. For many, the move seemed like a return to 2017 and one of the most controversial policies of Trump’s first term.
Trump cited national security and terrorism concerns Wednesday as motivating factors behind the ban on nationals largely from Africa and Asia, triggering reactions from representatives of those countries from weary diplomacy to downright anger.
Chad, a country in Central Africa that is among the countries hit with a travel ban, quickly issued a reciprocal restriction on issuing visas to U.S. citizens. “Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has its dignity and pride,” President Idriss Deby wrote Thursday on Facebook.
Trump's new order affects a patchwork of 19 countries — some of them banned for the first time, for reasons that the administration said include high rates of visa overstays, lack of ""appropriate screening and vetting measures"" and allegedly being sponsors of terrorism.
Nationals of 12 countries will be barred from entering the U.S.: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Partial bans have also been placed on nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
After the Trump administration canceled a special visa program with Venezuela on Wednesday, the country's interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, described the U.S. government as “fascist,” adding that “they persecute our countrymen, our people, for no reason.”
“The truth is being in the United States is a big risk for anybody, not just for Venezuelans,” he said during a weekly show on state television.
Many on the list are majority-Muslim countries, and several began observing the Hajj pilgrimage holiday late Wednesday, making immediate responses less likely. Officials at U.S. embassies in Libya, Chad, Eritrea, Sudan and Turkmenistan were not available for comment.
Still, Shawn VanDiver, president of the Afghan refugee advocacy group #AfghanEvac, referred to the ban as “political theater” and “a second Muslim Ban, dressed up in bureaucracy.”
Trump began a video address Wednesday by citing the recent violence in Boulder, Colorado, where an Egyptian man seeking asylum with an expired tourist visa injured at least 12 demonstrators in what city officials called an antisemitic attack, as justification for the renewed travel ban.
Egypt is not on the list of banned countries, but its absence speaks to the importance of Egyptian influence both on American Middle East policy and in the region at large, said Ahmed Soliman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.
Trump's order largely affects “conflict-prone [countries], or ones which have security issues at this time, or don’t have the diplomatic or security heft to respond very aggressively to this U.S. ban,” Soliman said. “We’re not seeing the U.S. going after its strategic partners in either the Middle East or Africa.”
The White House's decision prompted a rebuke from the African Union Commission, which in a statement Thursday urged the U.S. to exercise its right to protect its borders “in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa.”
“The Commission remains concerned about the potential negative impact of such measures on ... relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades,” it said.
It was a relatively tame statement from a body that represents countries already disproportionately affected by the Trump administration's decision to cut USAID programs.
International aid groups have condemned the new ban, with Amnesty International on Thursday calling it “discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel” on X.
Somalia, which had its American assistance slashed and U.S. military aid in training local forces to fight terrorist groups pulled, struck a similarly conciliatory tone.
“Somalia values its longstanding relationship with the United States and stands ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised,” Dahir Hassan Abdi, the Somali ambassador to the U.S., said in a statement Wednesday.
The administration pointed to terrorism as a reason for banning travel from Somalia.
“The United States Government has identified Somalia as a terrorist safe haven. Terrorists use regions of Somalia as safe havens from which they plan, facilitate, and conduct their operations,” according to a statement released by the White House. “The Government of Somalia struggles to provide governance needed to limit terrorists’ freedom of movement.”
Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan and independent public policy research organization, said terrorist attacks by nationals from the 12 countries facing outright bans are rare.
“A single terrorist from those countries murdered one person in an attack on U.S. soil: Emanuel Kidega Samson from Sudan, who committed an attack motivated by anti-white animus in 2017. The annual chance of being murdered by a terrorist from one of the banned countries from 1975 to the end of 2024 was about 1 in 13.9 billion per year,” Nowrasteh wrote.
Trump's order also pulls the rug from under nearly 200,000 Afghans who have relocated to the U.S. since America's chaotic and botched exit from the country in 2021. They include about 14,000 resettled refugees who arrived in the 12 months through September.
Trump, who suspended refugee resettlement for Afghans on his first day in office, criticized Afghanistan's passport authority and its screening and vetting measures Wednesday.
Representatives of the Afghan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“To include Afghanistan — a nation whose people stood alongside American service members for 20 years — is a moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold,” #AfghanEvac’s VanDiver added.
For experts watching Trump’s approach to the developing world since before he first took office in 2017, the move was less of a surprise.
Trump has for years expressed a desire to limit immigration from Haiti and African nations, deriding them as “shithole” countries in discussing the visa lottery system at a White House meeting in 2018.
Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science at the University College of London, called the president's latest move “part and parcel of an ‘America First’ foreign policy.”
The travel plan and visa cancellations send “a loud and clear message,” said Gift, “that America isn’t an open, pluralist nation that welcomes the world to its shores.”

The 21-year-old, who hails from Canada’s Yukon territory, made a push for victory with 14km to go and held on to win ahead of Riejanne Markus (Lidl-Trek). British teenager Cat Ferguson (Movistar) finished fifth for the second stage in a row, just behind third-placed Ally Wollaston (FDJ-Suez) and Roldan’s Picnic-Post NL teammate, Megan Jastrab.
Also in the chasing group was Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly), who finished ninth but did enough to take the overall leader’s green jersey. Faulkner, the Olympic road race champion in Paris, leads a frustrated Markus by just four seconds. Ferguson is fourth behind Wollaston, 14 seconds off Faulkner’s mark, with two stages to go.
“My team was really good in the first half of the race, just keeping me safe at the front. Once the circuit came, it was just a race of attrition,” Faulkner said after the race, which included two climbs up Saltburn Bank before the finish line.
The day began at Hartlepool docks in wet conditions, with stage one winner and overall leader Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal) falling early on, and then getting caught on the wrong side of a peloton split caused by Lorena Wiebes’ crash. Le Court sits 21st overall after stage two, while the two-times former winner, Lizzie Deignan (Lidl-Trek) is down in 16th place.
“We dropped some of the GC leaders, which was great, and it allowed me to finish with the jersey,” Alaska native Faulkner added. “I think a lot of people were really fighting to stay in the race. I felt really good on the last climb, both times up it.”

Louisiana could make it illegal to try to modify the weather. Here's what that means.,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/louisiana-could-make-it-illegal-to-try-to-modify-the-weather-heres-what-that-means/article_84147bfe-96af-54c1-9178-782cd5a455fb.html,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 04:00:00 -0500",Louisiana could soon ban any attempt to modify the weather through techniques like solar geoengineering or cloud seeding after a bill passed the Louisiana Legislature.,"Louisiana could soon ban any attempt to modify the weather through techniques like solar geoengineering or cloud seeding after a bill passed the Louisiana Legislature.
Those techniques are still either experimental or not widely used. But Sen. Mike Fesi, R-Houma, said his Senate Bill 46 aims to protect “the people of Louisiana and the integrity of our environment.”
“With so many unknowns around geoengineering and atmospheric interventions, we’re taking a stand for transparency, public health, and natural balance,” he said in a statement. “Senate Bill 46 ensures that decisions about our air and climate are made responsibly.”
The bill says that no person shall “intentionally inject, release, apply, or disperse, by any means, a chemical, chemical compound, substance, or apparatus into the atmosphere within the borders of this state for the express purpose of affecting the temperature, weather, climate, or intensity of sunlight.”
It also requires the Department of Environmental Quality to collect reports from anyone who believes they observe a weather modification activity.
When SB46 first passed the Senate, support for the bill fell along party lines, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. In the House, some Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the bill, though it still passed by a margin of 58 to 33. The bill still needs Gov. Jeff Landry’s signature to become law.
What does solar geoengineering look like?
There are several types of weather modification, both theoretical and real. Few if any such activities are currently taking place in Louisiana.
The activity that is primarily associated with solar geoengineering – using aircraft to disperse aerosols like sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere in an effort to reflect sunlight and cool the planet – is not taking place anywhere in the world, according to Josh Horton, a senior program fellow in solar geoengineering at the Harvard Kennedy School.
That concept is known as stratospheric aerosol injection, he said, and it is the leading solar geoengineering proposal. So far, there have not been any real-world experiments of the theory, and it is not clear how safe it would be, he said.
“There have been a couple of attempts to do very small-scale experiments that have been canceled for a number of reasons. It’s very controversial,” Horton said. “Right now all the research based on stratospheric aerosols is desk-based – it’s either using computer models or small-scale laboratory tests to see which kinds of particles would be most effective and most benign.”
There is another type of solar geoengineering known as marine cloud brightening that has been experimented with in Australia over the Great Barrier Reef. It involves spraying seawater into low-lying clouds in hopes that they will whiten and reflect sunlight back into space, Horton said.
That’s “not really what most folks who are pushing these (weather modification) bans in different states have in mind when they’re concerned about geoengineering and claiming it’s happening,” he said. “They’re thinking about these aircraft releasing megatons of sulfur or something else in the stratosphere that envelopes the planet, which of course is not happening but perhaps one day would, although we’re nowhere close to that.”
Cloud seeding
One type of weather modification that does occur in the United States is cloud seeding. It typically involves using aircraft to release silver iodide into clouds in an attempt to increase rainfall or snowfall.
The science behind cloud seeding, an activity that is seventy years old and mostly takes place out West, is uncertain, said Horton.
“There continues to be debates among scientists about whether or not it’s the least bit effective, but I think what there is agreement on is that it’s not really harmful,” he said.
According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, nine states currently use cloud seeding.
“Federal cloud seeding involvement and support is minimal,” the agency’s website says.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration does not conduct weather modification activities but requires companies that do to report such activity. Of over 1,000 project reports dating back to 2000 in the NOAA’s database, none specified Louisiana as a location. One did mention the Gulf, but the vast majority were in states like California, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Idaho and North Dakota.
Debate veers into ‘chemtrails’
Though SB46 does not mention the conspiracy theory known as ‘chemtrails,’ debate on the House floor veered into the topic when Rep. Kimberly Landry Coates, R-Ponchatoula, presented the bill and said it was meant to protect Louisiana from them.
‘Chemtrails’ refers to a wide-ranging conspiracy theory based on the belief that the lines left behind by aircraft are in fact chemicals or metals spread by the government or other organizations for purposes such as mind control or weather modification.
Coates , who spoke about chemtrails in relation to weather modification, said she was concerned about those lines and that multiple “groups” were spreading heavy metals to deflect sunlight.
The lines are actually contrails, line-shaped clouds that are created when the hot air from a plane’s exhaust mixes with cooler air in the environment, causing condensation, according to the National Weather Service.
Contrails are completely harmless, said Horton, adding that chemtrails are not real.
Now, “the idea of Chemtrails predates geoengineering but has sort of naturally swallowed up geoengineering and has sort of even morphed into conspiracy theories about geoengineering happening,” he said.
In a statement Friday, Coates explained she supported SB46 because it was “a vital step toward protecting Louisiana from the unknown and potentially dangerous consequences of geoengineering.”
“As these experimental climate interventions become more common around the world, Louisiana must take a stand to ensure that our skies, air, and environment are not subject to untested technologies without public oversight,” she said.
Coates sponsored a bill that would more broadly limit activities in the atmosphere, House Bill 608. But, even after the bill’s scope was narrowed through amendments, it failed to pass the House by a vote of 21-72.

'Coming for us': Expert sounds alarm on CCP's mission to 'kill Americans' after FBI makes shocking arrests,https://www.yahoo.com/news/coming-us-expert-sounds-alarm-173921409.html,2025-06-05T17:39:21Z,,"'Coming for us': Expert sounds alarm on CCP's mission to 'kill Americans' after FBI makes shocking arrests
Following news that two Chinese nationals were charged with allegedly smuggling a ""dangerous biological pathogen"" into the U.S. to study at an American university, Fox News Digital spoke to an expert on China who said the arrests should be a wake-up call to the country.
""I was entirely unsurprised, which is a sad commentary, but it speaks to the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP wants to kill Americans,"" Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute focusing on U.S. and China relations, told Fox News Digital after FBI Director Kash Patel announced the arrests of the two Chinese nationals.
""Look at what they've done with smuggling fentanyl precursors into our country to kill Americans, look at the effects of them failing to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" Sobolik said. ""Dead Americans. The fact that they want to target Americans here within the United States with pathogens and with bioweapons. This is the Chinese Communist Party. This is what they do. They're in a cold war with the United States. They want to become the most powerful nation in the world and they wanna make the world safe for their tyranny and unsafe for freedom. And they're coming for us here at home.""
The couple are accused of smuggling a fungus called Fusarium graminearum, which scientific literature classifies as a ""potential agroterrorism weapon,"" according to the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors note that the noxious fungus causes ""head blight,"" a disease of wheat, barley, maize and rice, and ""is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year.""
Trump, China's Xi Invite Each Other On State Visits Amid Trade Fight, Us President Says
The Justice Department also says Fusarium graminearum’s toxins cause vomiting, liver damage and ""reproductive defects in humans and livestock.""
According to the criminal complaint, one of the accused allegedly received Chinese government funding for her work on the pathogen in China.
The couple are accused of bringing the pathogen into the U.S. to study at a University of Michigan laboratory, which raises more concerns about Chinese nationals infiltrating American universities.
Last month, a bombshell report out of Stanford University shed light on the influence of spies from the Chinese Communist Party that the student newspaper says have likely infiltrated the prestigious institution and other universities nationwide to gather intelligence.
""American higher education is addicted to the Chinese Communist Party,"" Sobolik told Fox News Digital. ""It's addicted to easy money that has come from Beijing for decades. It's addicted to international students that pay full tuition, many of which are then coerced and pressured by the Chinese embassy and consulates and other networks to spy for the party and report back.
""American universities need to finally open their eyes and stop being willfully blind to the threat of the CCP. They're vectors for intelligence gathering. They are vectors for these threats that target Americans on our own soil. That's unacceptable. If sovereignty means anything, we need to be able to protect Americans within the borders of the United States. And universities cannot continue to be willing accomplices of the Chinese Communist Party.""
A Chinese embassy official said Wednesday he was unaware of the case involving two Chinese nationals charged with smuggling a ""dangerous biological pathogen"" into the U.S. for university research.
""I don't know the specific situation, but I would like to emphasize that the Chinese government has always required overseas Chinese citizens to abide by local laws and regulations and will also resolutely safeguard their legitimate rights and interests,"" said Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Communist Party Embassy in the U.S.

A Peruvian woman who crossed the U.S. border illegally has been acquitted of unauthorized access to a newly designated militarized zone along the southern border
EL PASO, Texas -- A Peruvian woman who crossed the U.S. border illegally was acquitted Thursday of unauthorized access to a newly designated militarized zone in the first trial under the Trump administration's efforts to prosecute immigrants who cross in certain parts of New Mexico and western Texas.
Adely Vanessa De La Cruz-Alvarez, 21, was arrested last month near the West Texas town of Tornillo after she entered the U.S. from Mexico by walking across the riverbed of the Rio Grande, court documents show.
In addition to being charged with entering the country illegally, she was charged with accessing a military zone. She is among several other immigrants who have been charged under the law since President Donald Trump’s administration transferred oversight of a strip of land along the border to the military. It is as part of a new approach the Department of Justice is taking to crack down on illegal immigration.
The Associated Press left messages Thursday with De La Cruz-Alvarez's attorney, Veronica Teresa Lerma. The lawyer told The Texas Tribune the acquittal is significant.
“Hopefully, this sets the tone for the federal government,” Lerma said, “so they know what the El Paso community will do with these charges.”
Even before the woman's case went to trial, federal magistrate judges in neighboring New Mexico had dismissed similar cases, finding little evidence that immigrants knew about the zones.
Lerma was convicted of entering the country illegally and was already facing deportation, but could have faced up to 18 months in prison for entering the militarized zone.
Despite the verdict, U.S. Attorney Justin Simmons of the Western District of Texas said his office will continue to aggressively prosecute National Defense Area violations.
“At the end of the day, another illegal alien has been found guilty of illegally entering the country in violation of the improper entry statute and will be removed from the United States,” Simmons said in a statement. ""That’s a win for America.""

Dave Chappelle Revisits His 2016 Trump ‘SNL’ Speech — And Whether It’s Aged Well,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dave-chappelle-revisits-2016-trump-snl-speech_n_68416a47e4b04981b63b27e7,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:06:28 -0400","The comedian recently sat down for a rare interview in which he recalled giving the MAGA leader ""a chance"" during his 2016 postelection monologue.","Dave Chappelle says he “fondly” remembers his 2016 monologue on “Saturday Night Live,” which was recorded mere days after Donald Trump was elected president for the first time, even if others may have concerns about how well the speech has aged.
The standup comedian, who included words of hope as Trump prepared to take the White House for the first time, has delivered similarly thoughtful “SNL” sets following former President Joe Biden’s win in 2020 and ahead of Trump’s recent inauguration.
Chappelle has avoided interviews since the barrage of anti-transgender jokes in his 2021 Netflix special “The Closer” divided viewers, but recently sat down for a Variety “Actors on Actors” chat with fellow comic Mo Amer — in which he stood by his 2016 monologue about Trump.
“I haven’t watched it in a while, but I remember it fondly,” Chappelle said in the video published Wednesday.
The comedian delivered a cautiously hopeful monologue at the time and said he’d give Trump “a chance” if he gave “the historically disenfranchised” one, too, as Amer, a Palestinian comic he grew close to during the COVID-19 pandemic, reminded him in the video.
“Oh, I remember that part,” Chappelle said. “You know what? I look at it like a photograph. That’s what it felt like in that moment. Now, if it ages well or not, I don’t get mad if I look at a picture because it’s not today. That’s what it was at that time.”
“You might look at an old set and cringe, but you could just cringe because of how you were at that time,” he continued.
Chappelle certainly didn’t praise Trump at the time, however, and said plainly that “an internet troll” had won the White House. He also touched on Trump’s alleged sexual assaults, and how different he felt after former President Barack Obama’s election in 2008.
“And it made me very happy about the prospects of our country,” Chappelle said in 2016 of seeing Obama in the White House. “So, in that spirit, I’m wishing Donald Trump luck. And I’m going to give him a chance. And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.”
Trump went on to impose a travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries during his first term and later refused to concede the 2020 election after losing to Joe Biden. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has launched mass deportations — and he imposed a brand-new travel ban Wednesday against a dozen nations.",Huffington Post,['deportation'],"['Dave Chappelle', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump', 'the White House', 'SNL', 'Joe Biden’s', 'Trump', 'Chappelle', 'Netflix', 'Trump', 'Chappelle', 'Trump', 'Amer', 'COVID-19', 'Chappelle', 'Chappelle', 'Trump', 'the White House', 'Trump', 'Barack Obama', 'Chappelle', 'Obama', 'Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden', 'the White House', 'Trump']",,0

Beginning Monday, the directive bans entry for nationals from 12 countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also institutes partial bans and visa restrictions for Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
Trump instituted similar travel restrictions during his first term and even targeted several of the same countries, including Iran, Libya and Venezuela.
About 139,000 visas were issued for visitors from the 19 countries during the 2023 fiscal year, data from the State Department shows. Visitors from Venezuela received the most visas.
Across all of the countries, tourism and business visas were issued most commonly.
Trump’s proclamation cited security and terrorism risks as the reason behind some of the restrictions, and it specifically accused visitors from several of the countries of staying past their visas’ expiration dates. But data from the Department of Homeland Security shows that while several of the countries had high overstay rates during the 2023 fiscal year, the actual numbers of people were low.

Israeli strikes overnight and into Thursday meanwhile killed at least 13 people, including three local journalists who were in the courtyard of a hospital, according to health officials in the territory. The military said it targeted a militant in that strike. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the remains of Judih Weinstein and Gad Haggai were recovered and returned to Israel in a special operation by the army and the Shin Bet internal security agency. “Together with all the citizens of Israel, my wife and I extend our heartfelt condolences to the dear families. Our hearts ache for the most terrible loss. May their memory be blessed,” he said in a statement. Kibbutz Nir Oz announced the deaths of Weinstein, 70, and Haggai, 72, both of whom had Israeli and U.S. citizenship, in December 2023. Weinstein was also a Canadian citizen. The military said they were killed in the Oct. 7 attack and taken into Gaza by the Mujahideen Brigades, the small armed group that it said had also abducted and killed Shiri Bibas and her two small children. The army said it recovered the remains of Weinstein and Haggai overnight into Thursday from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. A teacher who helped children and a chef who played jazz The couple were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of Oct. 7 when Hamas militants stormed across the border and rampaged through several army bases and farming communities. In the early hours of the morning, Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot, and send a message to her family. Weinstein was born in New York and taught English to children with special needs at Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “My beautiful parents have been freed. We have certainty,” their daughter, Iris Haggai Liniado, wrote in a Facebook post. She thanked the Israeli military, the FBI and the Israeli and U.S. governments and called for the release of all the remaining hostages. The couple were survived by two sons, two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. Reporters among 13 killed in Israeli strikes At least 10 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in Khan Younis overnight, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. It was not immediately clear if the strikes were related to the recovery mission. WATCH: Israeli attack survivor describes moment Hamas militants kidnapped her husband In Gaza City, three local reporters were killed and six people were wounded in a strike on the courtyard of the al-Ahli Hospital, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It did not immediately identify the journalists or say which outlets they worked for. The Israeli military said it struck an Islamic Jihad militant operating in the courtyard. The army says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it is embedded in populated areas. Over 180 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the vast majority of them in Gaza, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Israel has said many of those killed in its strikes were militants posing as reporters. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages. They are still holding 56 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies. Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians. Ceasefire talks deadlocked The United States, Egypt and Qatar have been trying to broker another ceasefire and hostage release after Israel ended an earlier truce in March and imposed a blockade that has raised fears of famine, despite being eased in recent weeks. But the talks appear to be deadlocked. Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. It has offered to hand over power to a politically independent Palestinian committee. Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying Israel will only agree to temporary ceasefires to facilitate the return of hostages. He has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is defeated or disarmed and sent into exile. He has said Israel will maintain control over Gaza indefinitely and will facilitate what he refers to as the voluntary emigration of much of its population to other countries. The Palestinians and much of the international community have rejected such plans, viewing them as forcible expulsion that could violate international law.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the remains of Judih Weinstein and Gad Haggai were recovered and returned to Israel in a special operation by the army and the Shin Bet internal security agency. “Together with all the citizens of Israel, my wife and I extend our heartfelt condolences to the dear families. Our hearts ache for the most terrible loss. May their memory be blessed,” he said in a statement. Kibbutz Nir Oz announced the deaths of Weinstein, 70, and Haggai, 72, both of whom had Israeli and U.S. citizenship, in December 2023. Weinstein was also a Canadian citizen. The military said they were killed in the Oct. 7 attack and taken into Gaza by the Mujahideen Brigades, the small armed group that it said had also abducted and killed Shiri Bibas and her two small children. The army said it recovered the remains of Weinstein and Haggai overnight into Thursday from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. A teacher who helped children and a chef who played jazz The couple were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of Oct. 7 when Hamas militants stormed across the border and rampaged through several army bases and farming communities. In the early hours of the morning, Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot, and send a message to her family. Weinstein was born in New York and taught English to children with special needs at Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “My beautiful parents have been freed. We have certainty,” their daughter, Iris Haggai Liniado, wrote in a Facebook post. She thanked the Israeli military, the FBI and the Israeli and U.S. governments and called for the release of all the remaining hostages. The couple were survived by two sons, two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. Reporters among 13 killed in Israeli strikes At least 10 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in Khan Younis overnight, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. It was not immediately clear if the strikes were related to the recovery mission. WATCH: Israeli attack survivor describes moment Hamas militants kidnapped her husband In Gaza City, three local reporters were killed and six people were wounded in a strike on the courtyard of the al-Ahli Hospital, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It did not immediately identify the journalists or say which outlets they worked for. The Israeli military said it struck an Islamic Jihad militant operating in the courtyard. The army says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it is embedded in populated areas. Over 180 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the vast majority of them in Gaza, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Israel has said many of those killed in its strikes were militants posing as reporters. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages. They are still holding 56 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies. Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians. Ceasefire talks deadlocked The United States, Egypt and Qatar have been trying to broker another ceasefire and hostage release after Israel ended an earlier truce in March and imposed a blockade that has raised fears of famine, despite being eased in recent weeks. But the talks appear to be deadlocked. Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. It has offered to hand over power to a politically independent Palestinian committee. Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying Israel will only agree to temporary ceasefires to facilitate the return of hostages. He has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is defeated or disarmed and sent into exile. He has said Israel will maintain control over Gaza indefinitely and will facilitate what he refers to as the voluntary emigration of much of its population to other countries. The Palestinians and much of the international community have rejected such plans, viewing them as forcible expulsion that could violate international law.

Trump administration's budget cuts could close down Louisiana LIGO observatory,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/trump-budget-cuts-livingston-ligo/article_cb3224ae-9351-46fe-bed8-340168c832e0.html,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:45:00 -0500",The observatory in Livingston Parish that made a historic scientific breakthrough by detecting gravitational waves is now at risk of shutting down under the Trump administration's proposed federal budget cuts.,"The observatory in Livingston Parish that made a historic scientific breakthrough by detecting gravitational waves is now at risk of shutting down under the Trump administration's proposed federal budget cuts.
On Friday, the Trump administration announced a proposed federal budget request for 2026 that cut $5.2 billion, or 57%, of the National Science Foundation's $9 billion annual budget.
NSF supports facilities across the country including the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. Two LIGO observatories are funded in the country: LIGO Livingston and LIGO Hanford in Washington state.
NSF would operate only one U.S. LIGO observatory with a reduced level of spending for LIGO technology development in the 2026 fiscal year, according to the budget proposal.
The LIGO observatory in Livingston Parish made international headlines in 2015 when it detected gravitation waves from black holes more than a billion light years away.
The proposed budget for LIGO in the 2026 fiscal year would be $29 million, a 40% reduction from the allotted $48 million in the 2024 fiscal year, according to the budget proposal document.
NSF and the Trump administration have not announced which LIGO observatory could be on the chopping block if the full budget cuts are enacted. However, the two observatories often work in tandem, conducting research together.
Joseph Giaime, head of the LIGO Livingston observatory, said LIGO leadership is working with NSF on its next steps in response to the proposed budget. But Giaime said it is not efficient to run one LIGO observatory without the other.
“I personally worry about our ability to continue our education mission and do a good job as needed on our science mission … we’re going to do the best we can,” he said.
Giaime said that by operating only one LIGO observatory, ""the amount of space we can see into is much diminished.”
“We run together. We use data together. We’re able to dig more deeply into space together,” he said.
The gravitation waves discovery confirmed a key prediction of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity and kick-started a new era of astronomy.
Livingston Parish President Randy Delatte had not been aware of the proposed cuts at the time of publication, according to parish spokesperson Brandon Browning.",The Advocate,['budget cuts'],"['Livingston Parish', 'Trump', 'Trump', '$5.2 billion', ""the National Science Foundation's"", '$9 billion', 'NSF', 'the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory', 'LIGO', 'LIGO Livingston', 'LIGO Hanford', 'Washington', 'NSF', 'U.S.', 'LIGO', 'LIGO', 'Livingston Parish', 'more than a billion light', 'LIGO', '$29 million', '$48 million', 'NSF', 'Trump', 'LIGO', 'tandem', 'Joseph Giaime', 'LIGO', 'Livingston', 'LIGO', 'NSF', 'Giaime', 'LIGO', 'Giaime', 'LIGO', 'Albert Einstein’s', 'Livingston Parish', 'Randy Delatte', 'Brandon Browning']","Threats to Research and Higher Education Funding from Heightened Regulatory Change and Scrutiny; New Orleans infrastructure, crime, and public image",3

Louisiana state employees could lose jobs under Civil Service amendment
Lawmakers want to change constitution to allow for easy firing of state employees

Louisiana lawmakers are trying to change the state constitution to wrestle power away from the Civil Service Commission to eliminate state worker protections and allow for the quick firing of thousands of employees for any reason, creating fear among critics that some dismissals could be politically motivated.
Senate Bill 8, sponsored by Sen. Jay Morris. R-West Monroe, is nearing final passage in the Louisiana Legislature, though voters will get the final say on a constitutional amendment on a ballot that could have significant consequences for how state government operates.
Morris’ proposal would give state lawmakers power that currently rests with the Civil Service Commission, a seven-member independent review panel that oversees the hiring and firing of 28,000 “classified” state workers. The commission hears complaints from classified employees and appeals from any who want to contest their dismissal or demotion, affording them due process when it comes to discipline and terminations.
In an interview Tuesday, Morris said his bill would let lawmakers “unclassify” state employees, removing them from the oversight of the commission. An unclassified employee does not have Civil Service protections and can be fired “at will” for no reason. The bill’s current version would also apply to local civil service workers such as municipal police and firefighters, but Morris said he intends to change his measure to exclude them and restrict it to only state employees.
“If you believe in democracy or republicanism — [because] we’re a republic — then the Legislature should have some ability to alter how our civil service system works,” Morris said. “Right now we can’t do anything because the constitution prevents it.”
Some Democrats have taken issue with the latest iteration of the ballot language in Morris’ bill because it doesn’t explicitly mention classified employees and could mislead voters into thinking the amendment doesn’t affect those state workers who are currently protected under Civil Service. When asked about the proposal following Tuesday’s meeting of the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, Rep. Wilford Carter, D-Lake Charles, said the ballot language doesn’t align with what’s in the bill.
The ballot language states: “Do you support an amendment to allow the legislature to remove or add officers, positions, and employees to the unclassified civil service?”
Critics have pointed to other issues that have not been addressed or debated in any of the committee hearings on Morris’ proposal.
One of those is the vague use of the word “remove,” which could be interpreted to mean “fire” or “terminate,” said Peter Robins-Brown, who opposes the bill on behalf of Louisiana Progress, which advocates for low and middle-income people. He said lawmakers have not drafted any kind of companion measure that would establish statutes or regulations to implement the specific necessary changes.
“No one has really been paying attention to the details,” Robins-Brown said. “I’m not sure how the average voter will be able to figure it out, especially when the bill doesn’t have a statutory companion to prove the goal of this exercise.”
Gov. Landry fails to remove civil service protections from 900 state jobs
Rep. Nicholas Muscarello, R-Hammond, who chairs the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, said the intent of the amendment is to give lawmakers the power to unclassify state employees, not fire employees. Hiring and terminating decisions would be left up to the executive branch, he said.
The Civil Service Commission, a nonpartisan entity, has taken a neutral position on Morris’ proposal. When asked about it Wednesday, commission administrators said they assume “remove” means the act of changing an employee’s classification status, but they pointed out the word is not actually defined in the bill.
State Civil Service Director Byron Decoteau said Morris’ civil service amendment amendment, if adopted, could technically allow lawmakers to simply “remove” an unclassified job position with no intention of classifying it, leaving a current employee in a limbo with neither a classified nor unclassified status.
Sherri Gregoire, Civil Service general counsel, said the lack of a clear definition invites different interpretations, including that the amendment gives lawmakers the power to remove governor’s staff members, and creates a situation that would certainly end up in court.
The more likely course of events, if voters decide to approve the amendment, would be that the legislature designates all future hires as unclassified employees — a move that would eventually end the classified civil service system altogether, Gregoire said. The Civil Service Commission, itself, would still exist under the constitution but would effectively become pointless because it would no longer have anything to oversee.
“Eventually you won’t have any classified employees, so why do you need a commission?” Gregoire said.
Morris said he doesn’t yet have a vision for how lawmakers would exercise their new power if voters approve the amendment.
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has tried repeatedly to exert authority over the commission. In February, he tried unsuccessfully to revoke civil service classifications from 900 state jobs, mostly positions for engineers, shortly after President Donald Trump made a similar move at the federal level. The state Civil Service Commission rejected Landry’s request in a 4-2 decision in February.
Because unclassified workers can be subject to political punishment and coercion, removing such a large number of engineers from the classified service could create ethical conflicts and unnecessary risks to the public, the commissioners said.
A similar version of Morris’ bill stalled on the House floor last year, but some Republicans who likely would have supported the bill were absent when the final vote took place.
Morris’ bill is expected to earn final passage before the regular session ends June 12 and will be placed before voters on the Nov. 3, 2026, statewide election ballot.

Four states petition the FDA to lift abortion pill restrictions,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/four-states-petition-fda-lift-abortion-pill-restrictions-rcna210045,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:08:16 GMT",Four states petitioned the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday to lift its lingering restrictions on abortion pills.,"Four states petitioned the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday to lift its lingering restrictions on abortion pills.
The attorneys general of California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York argue in the petition that the FDA’s current regulations make it difficult to prescribe mifepristone — one of two pills involved in a medication abortion — in primary care settings, despite evidence that it’s safe to do so.
“Given mifepristone’s 25-year safety record, there is simply no scientific or medical reason to subject it to such extraordinary restrictions,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “The FDA must follow the science and lift these unnecessary barriers that put patients at risk and push providers out of care.”
The drug is a central flash point in the abortion debate. Many anti-abortion groups see restricting who can get mifepristone or rescinding its approval as one of the most effective ways to limit abortion access nationwide.
The petition comes just days after FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said he was committed to conducting a safety review of mifepristone.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., each requested the review following the release of a paper, which was neither peer-reviewed nor published in a medical journal, that claimed to find a high rate of serious adverse events in women who recently took the medication. Researchers who study reproductive health said the report amounts to junk science and exaggerates the risks of mifepristone. They note that it does not meet basic research standards, relying on overly broad definitions and failing to disclose which database it used.
The report was released by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank that served on the advisory board of Project 2025, a right-wing policy initiative that called for the FDA to walk back its approval of mifepristone.
The attorneys general said Thursday that the FDA should use the safety review as an opportunity to remove barriers to accessing mifepristone nationwide — or, at minimum, in the four states involved in the petition.
The FDA regulates certain medications with serious safety concerns via a drug safety program called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). Mifepristone is currently part of that program, though a wealth of research has shown that less than 0.5% of women who take it have serious adverse reactions. Studies have also demonstrated that prescribing mifepristone through telehealth is as safe and effective as administering it in person.
As part of the REMS program, mifepristone is subject to a few restrictions: People who prescribe the pills must be certified health care providers, and pharmacies must obtain certifications to dispense the medication. Patients who receive mifepristone must also sign a form attesting that they intend to end their pregnancy.
The attorneys general said in their petition that those restrictions are burdensome and unnecessary. They claim that many primary care and family medicine physicians aren’t able or willing to take on the administrative burden of getting certified to prescribe the pills, or are worried about being added to a list of national or local abortion providers.
The FDA has already lifted several restrictions on mifepristone over the last decade. In 2016, it extended the window in which mifepristone could be used to terminate pregnancies from seven weeks’ gestation to 10 weeks. In 2019, it approved a generic form of the medication, which increased supply. And in 2021, it eliminated a requirement to dispense mifepristone in person, allowing the drug to be prescribed via telehealth and sent by mail.
Anti-abortion groups have called on the FDA to reinstate those restrictions, often pointing to misleading studies that suggest the medication has harmful effects. The April report that launched the FDA safety review, for instance, claims to find a 22-times higher rate of serious complications from mifepristone than reported by the agency.
In their petition Thursday, the four attorneys general denounced recent attempts to challenge mifepristone’s safety, which they said rely on methodologically flawed research.
A coalition of anti-abortion groups sued the FDA in 2022 over its approval of mifepristone, citing two studies from the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a group that opposes abortion, that claimed to show severe complications from the drug. The lawsuit was ultimately thrown out by the Supreme Court and the studies were later retracted by a medical publisher.
The Charlotte Lozier Institute released another paper last month claiming that a growing number of emergency room visits after abortions are incorrectly attributed to miscarriages, thereby masking abortion complications.
Rachel Jones, a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access, said the data only captures a small portion of abortions and is skewed in favor of those that are potentially higher risk. Some of the same data was used in the retracted studies, she said.
Jones added that the timing of the new reports from anti-abortion groups is not coincidental.
“The anti-choice people are really going after medication abortion and doing whatever they can to get the FDA under the Trump administration to revisit the availability of the drug,” she said.",NBC News,['lawsuit'],"['the Food and Drug Administration', 'California', 'Massachusetts', 'New Jersey', 'New York', 'FDA', 'New York', 'Letitia James', 'FDA', 'FDA', 'Marty Makary', 'Health and Human Services', 'Robert F.

How DOGE Created an Error-Prone AI Program to Tear Up Veterans Affairs Contracts,https://truthout.org/articles/how-doge-created-an-error-prone-ai-program-to-tear-up-veterans-affairs-contracts/,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 18:06:27 +0000","The faulty tool, created by a staffer with no medical or government experience, helped accelerate the gutting of the VA.","As the Trump administration prepared to cancel contracts at the Department of Veterans Affairs this year, officials turned to a software engineer with no health care or government experience to guide them.
The engineer, working for the Department of Government Efficiency, quickly built an artificial intelligence tool to identify which services from private companies were not essential. He labeled those contracts “MUNCHABLE.”
The code, using outdated and inexpensive AI models, produced results with glaring mistakes. For instance, it hallucinated the size of contracts, frequently misreading them and inflating their value. It concluded more than a thousand were each worth $34 million, when in fact some were for as little as $35,000.
The DOGE AI tool flagged more than 2,000 contracts for “munching.” It’s unclear how many have been or are on track to be canceled — the Trump administration’s decisions on VA contracts have largely been a black box. The VA uses contractors for many reasons, including to support hospitals, research and other services aimed at caring for ailing veterans.
VA officials have said they’ve killed nearly 600 contracts overall. Congressional Democrats have been pressing VA leaders for specific details of what’s been canceled without success.
We identified at least two dozen on the DOGE list that have been canceled so far. Among the canceled contracts was one to maintain a gene sequencing device used to develop better cancer treatments. Another was for blood sample analysis in support of a VA research project. Another was to provide additional tools to measure and improve the care nurses provide.
ProPublica obtained the code and the contracts it flagged from a source and shared them with a half dozen AI and procurement experts. All said the script was flawed. Many criticized the concept of using AI to guide budgetary cuts at the VA, with one calling it “deeply problematic.”
Cary Coglianese, professor of law and of political science at the University of Pennsylvania who studies the governmental use and regulation of artificial intelligence, said he was troubled by the use of these general-purpose large language models, or LLMs. “I don’t think off-the-shelf LLMs have a great deal of reliability for something as complex and involved as this,” he said.
Sahil Lavingia, the programmer enlisted by DOGE, which was then run by Elon Musk, acknowledged flaws in the code.
“I think that mistakes were made,” said Lavingia, who worked at DOGE for nearly two months. “I’m sure mistakes were made. Mistakes are always made. I would never recommend someone run my code and do what it says. It’s like that ‘Office’ episode where Steve Carell drives into the lake because Google Maps says drive into the lake. Do not drive into the lake.”
Though Lavingia has talked about his time at DOGE previously, this is the first time his work has been examined in detail and the first time he’s publicly explained his process, down to specific lines of code.
Lavingia has nearly 15 years of experience as a software engineer and entrepreneur but no formal training in AI. He briefly worked at Pinterest before starting Gumroad, a small e-commerce company that nearly collapsed in 2015. “I laid off 75% of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked,” he said. Lavingia kept the company afloat by “replacing every manual process with an automated one,” according to a post on his personal blog.
Lavingia did not have much time to immerse himself in how the VA handles veterans’ care between starting on March 17 and writing the tool on the following day. Yet his experience with his own company aligned with the direction of the Trump administration, which has embraced the use of AI across government to streamline operations and save money.
Lavingia said the quick timeline of Trump’s February executive order, which gave agencies 30 days to complete a review of contracts and grants, was too short to do the job manually. “That’s not possible — you have 90,000 contracts,” he said. “Unless you write some code. But even then it’s not really possible.”
Under a time crunch, Lavingia said he finished the first version of his contract-munching tool on his second day on the job — using AI to help write the code for him. He told ProPublica he then spent his first week downloading VA contracts to his laptop and analyzing them.
VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz lauded DOGE’s work on vetting contracts in a statement to ProPublica. “As far as we know, this sort of review has never been done before, but we are happy to set this commonsense precedent,” he said.
The VA is reviewing all of its 76,000 contracts to ensure each of them benefits veterans and is a good use of taxpayer money, he said. Decisions to cancel or reduce the size of contracts are made after multiple reviews by VA employees, including agency contracting experts and senior staff, he wrote.
Kasperowicz said that the VA will not cancel contracts for work that provides services to veterans or that the agency cannot do itself without a contingency plan in place. He added that contracts that are “wasteful, duplicative or involve services VA has the ability to perform itself” will typically be terminated.
Trump officials have said they are working toward a “goal” of cutting around 80,000 people from the VA’s workforce of nearly 500,000. Most employees work in one of the VA’s 170 hospitals and nearly 1,200 clinics.
The VA has said it would avoid cutting contracts that directly impact care out of fear that it would cause harm to veterans. ProPublica recently reported that relatively small cuts at the agency have already been jeopardizing veterans’ care.
The VA has not explained how it plans to simultaneously move services in-house, as Lavingia’s code suggested was the plan, while also slashing staff.
Many inside the VA told ProPublica the process for reviewing contracts was so opaque they couldn’t even see who made the ultimate decisions to kill specific contracts. Once the “munching” script had selected a list of contracts, Lavingia said he would pass it off to others who would decide what to cancel and what to keep. No contracts, he said, were terminated “without human review.”
“I just delivered the [list of contracts] to the VA employees,” he said. “I basically put munchable at the top and then the others below.”
VA staffers told ProPublica that when DOGE identified contracts to be canceled early this year — before Lavingia was brought on — employees sometimes were given little time to justify retaining the service. One recalled being given just a few hours. The staffers asked not to be named because they feared losing their jobs for talking to reporters.
According to one internal email that predated Lavingia’s AI analysis, staff members had to respond in 255 characters or fewer — just shy of the 280 character limit on Musk’s X social media platform.
Once he started on DOGE’s contract analysis, Lavingia said he was confronted with technological limitations. At least some of the errors produced by his code can be traced to using older versions of OpenAI models available through the VA — models not capable of solving complex tasks, according to the experts consulted by ProPublica.
Moreover, the tool’s underlying instructions were deeply flawed. Records show Lavingia programmed the AI system to make intricate judgments based on the first few pages of each contract — about the first 2,500 words — which contain only sparse summary information.
“AI is absolutely the wrong tool for this,” said Waldo Jaquith, a former Obama appointee who oversaw IT contracting at the Treasury Department. “AI gives convincing looking answers that are frequently wrong. There needs to be humans whose job it is to do this work.”
Lavingia’s prompts did not include context about how the VA operates, what contracts are essential or which ones are required by federal law. This led AI to determine a core piece of the agency’s own contract procurement system was “munchable.”
At the core of Lavingia’s prompt is the direction to spare contracts involved in “direct patient care.”
Such an approach, experts said, doesn’t grapple with the reality that the work done by doctors and nurses to care for veterans in hospitals is only possible with significant support around them.
Lavingia’s system also used AI to extract details like the contract number and “total contract value.” This led to avoidable errors, where AI returned the wrong dollar value when multiple were found in a contract. Experts said the correct information was readily available from public databases.
Lavingia acknowledged that errors resulted from this approach but said those errors were later corrected by VA staff.
In late March, Lavingia published a version of the “munchable” script on his GitHub account to invite others to use and improve it, he told ProPublica. “It would have been cool if the entire federal government used this script and anyone in the public could see that this is how the VA is thinking about cutting contracts.”
According to a post on his blog, this was done with the approval of Musk before he left DOGE. “When he asked the room about improving DOGE’s public perception, I asked if I could open-source the code I’d been writing,” Lavingia said. “He said yes — it aligned with DOGE’s goal of maximum transparency.”
That openness may have eventually led to Lavingia’s dismissal. Lavingia confirmed he was terminated from DOGE after giving an interview to Fast Company magazine about his work with the department. A VA spokesperson declined to comment on Lavingia’s dismissal.
VA officials have declined to say whether they will continue to use the “munchable” tool moving forward. But the administration may deploy AI to help the agency replace employees. Documents previously obtained by ProPublica show DOGE officials proposed in March consolidating the benefits claims department by relying more on AI.
And the government’s contractors are paying attention. After Lavingia posted his code, he said he heard from people trying to understand how to keep the money flowing.
“I got a couple DMs from VA contractors who had questions when they saw this code,” he said. “They were trying to make sure that their contracts don’t get cut. Or learn why they got cut.
“At the end of the day, humans are the ones terminating the contracts, but it is helpful for them to see how DOGE or Trump or the agency heads are thinking about what contracts they are going to munch. Transparency is a good thing.”

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump late Wednesday ordered the White House legal counsel and U.S. attorney general to investigate when Biden administration staff used an autopen to sign the former president’s name on official documents, alleging that Biden might not have known or approved of their actions.
The inquiry represents an escalation in Trump’s animosity toward and legal action against former President Joe Biden, who vehemently denies the allegations that he didn’t know what executive orders or pardons were signed during his term.
Trump has repeatedly suggested that Biden wasn’t fully cognizant during the end of his administration. Similar concerns were reported on by dozens of news organizations following Biden’s answers and behavior during a debate in June 2024.
Biden’s apparent confusion during some of the debate raised alarm bells among fellow Democrats and eventually led him to withdraw from his reelection campaign, later endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris.
Trump’s memorandum alleges “Biden’s aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden’s cognitive decline and assert Article II authority.
“This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.”
The memo stated that if Biden staff used an autopen, a mechanical device that mimics a person’s signature, “to conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden’s name.”
Trump said Thursday during an appearance in the Oval Office that he hadn’t discovered any evidence that Biden aides violated the law.
“No, but I’ve uncovered the human mind,” Trump said. “I was in a debate with the human mind and I didn’t think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it’s one of those things, one of those problems. We can’t ever allow that to happen to our country.”
Biden released a written statement rejecting the claims Trump laid out in the memo, arguing the investigation “is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.”
“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,” Biden wrote. “Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.”

A tiny sign revealed in April seemed like it might change the universe as we know it.
Astronomers had detected just a hint, a glimmer of two molecules swirling in the atmosphere of a distant planet called K2-18b — molecules that on Earth are produced only by living things. It was a tantalizing prospect: the most promising evidence yet of an extraterrestrial biosignature, or traces of life linked to biological activity.
But only weeks later, new findings suggest the search must continue.
“It was exciting, but it immediately raised several red flags because that claim of a potential biosignature would be historic, but also the significance or the strength of the statistical evidence seemed to be too high for the data,” said Dr. Luis Welbanks, a postdoctoral research scholar at Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration.
While the molecules identified on K2-18b by the April study — dimethyl sulfide, or DMS, and dimethyl disulfide, or DMDS — are associated largely with microbial organisms on our planet, scientists point out that the compounds can also form without the presence of life. Now, three teams of astronomers not involved with the research, including Welbanks, have assessed the models and data used in the original biosignature discovery and got very different results, which they have submitted for peer review.
Meanwhile, the lead author of the April study, Nikku Madhusudhan, and his colleagues have conducted additional research that they say reinforces their previous finding about the planet. And it’s likely that additional observations and research from multiple groups of scientists are on the horizon.
The succession of research papers revolving around K2-18b offers a glimpse of the scientific process unfolding in real time. It’s a window into the complexities and nuances of how researchers search for evidence of life beyond Earth — and shows why the burden of proof is so high and difficult to reach.
Noisy data
Located 124 light-years from Earth, K2-18b is generally considered a worthy target to scour for signs of life. It is thought to be a Hycean world, a planet entirely covered in liquid water with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, according to previous research led by Madhusudhan, a professor of astrophysics and exoplanetary science at the University of Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy. And as such, K2-18b has rapidly attracted attention as a potentially habitable place beyond our solar system.
Convinced of K2-18b’s promise, Madhusudhan and his Cambridge colleagues used observations of the planet by the largest space telescope in operation, the James Webb Space Telescope, to study the planet further. But two scientists at the University of Chicago — Dr. Rafael Luque, a postdoctoral scholar in the university’s department of astronomy and astrophysics, and Michael Zhang, a 51 Pegasi b / Burbidge postdoctoral fellow — spotted some problems with what they found.
After reviewing Madhusudhan and his team’s April paper, which followed up on their 2023 research, Luque and Zhang noticed that the Webb data looked “noisy,” Luque said.
Noise, caused by imperfections in the telescope and the rate at which different particles of light reach the telescope, is just one challenge astronomers face when they study distant exoplanets. Noise can distort observations and introduce uncertainties into the data, Zhang said.
More in Science
Trying to detect specific gases in distant exoplanet atmospheres introduces even more uncertainty. The most noticeable features from a gas like dimethyl sulfide stem from a bond of hydrogen and carbon molecules — a connection that can stretch and bend and absorb light at different wavelengths, making it hard to definitively detect one kind of molecule, Zhang said.
“The problem is basically every organic molecule has a carbon-hydrogen bond,” Zhang said. “There’s hundreds of millions of those molecules, and so these features are not unique. If you have perfect data, you can probably distinguish between different molecules. But if you don’t have perfect data, a lot of molecules, especially organic molecules, look very similar, especially in the near-infrared.”
Delving further into the paper, Luque and Zhang also noticed that the perceived temperature of the planet appeared to increase sharply from a range of about 250 Kelvin to 300 Kelvin (-9.67 F to 80.33 F or -23.15 C to 26.85 C) in research Madhusudhan published in 2023 to 422 Kelvin (299.93 F or 148.85 C) in the April study.
Such harsh temperatures could change the way astronomers think about the planet’s potential habitability, Zhang said, especially because cooler temperatures persist in the top of the atmosphere — the area that Webb can detect — and the surface or ocean below would likely have even higher temperatures.
“This is just an inference only from the atmosphere, but it would certainly affect how we think about the planet in general,” Luque said.
Part of the issue, he said, is that the April analysis didn’t include data collected from all three Webb instruments Madhusudhan’s team used over the past few years. So Luque, Zhang and their colleagues conducted a study combining all the available data to see whether they could achieve the same results, or even find a higher amount of dimethyl sulfide. They found “insufficient evidence” of both molecules in the planet’s atmosphere.
Instead, Luque and Zhang’s team spotted other molecules, like ethane, that could fit the same profile. But ethane does not signify life.
Disappearing evidence
Arizona State’s Welbanks and his colleagues, including Dr. Matt Nixon, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of astronomy at the University of Maryland College Park, also found what they consider a fundamental problem with the April paper on K2-18b.
The concern, Welbanks said, was with how Madhusudhan and his team created models to show which molecules might be in the planet’s atmosphere.
“Each (molecule) is tested one at a time against the same minimal baseline, meaning every single model has an artificial advantage: It is the only explanation permitted,” Welbanks said.
When Welbanks and his team conducted their own analysis, they expanded the model from Madhusudhan’s study.
“(Madhusudhan and his colleagues) didn’t allow for any other chemical species that could potentially be producing these small signals or observations,” Nixon said. “So the main thing we wanted to do was assess whether other chemical species could provide an adequate fit to the data.”
When the model was expanded, the evidence for dimethyl sulfide or dimethyl disulfide “just disappears,” Welbanks said.
Burden of proof
Madhusudhan believes the studies that have come out after his April paper are “very encouraging” and “enabling a healthy discussion on the interpretation of our data on K2-18b.”
He reviewed Luque and Zhang’s work and agreed that their findings don’t show a “strong detection for DMS or DMDS.” When Madhusudhan’s team published the paper in April, he said the observations reached the three-sigma level of significance, or a 0.3% probability that the detections occurred by chance.
For a scientific discovery that is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance, the observations must meet a five-sigma threshold, or below a 0.00006% probability that the observations occurred by chance. Meeting such a threshold will require many steps, Welbanks said, including repeated detections of the same molecule using multiple telescopes and ruling out potential nonbiological sources.
While such evidence could be found in our lifetime, it is less likely to be a eureka moment and more a slow build requiring a consensus among astronomers, physicists, biologists and chemists.
“We have never reached that level of evidence in any of our studies,” Madhusudhan wrote in an email. “We have only found evidence at or below 3-sigma in our two previous studies (Madhusudhan et al. 2023 and 2025). We refer to this as moderate evidence or hints but not a strong detection. I agree with (Luque and Zhang’s) claim which is consistent with our study and we have discussed the need for stronger evidence extensively in our study and communications.”
In response to the research conducted by Welbanks’ team, Madhusudhan and his Cambridge colleagues have authored another manuscript expanding the search on K2-18b to include 650 types of molecules. They have submitted the new analysis for peer review.
“This is the largest search for chemical signatures in an exoplanet to date, using all the available data for K2-18b and searching through 650 molecules,” Madhusudhan said. “We find that DMS continues to be a promising candidate molecule in this planet, though more observations are required for a firm detection as we have noted in our previous studies.”
Welbanks and Nixon were pleased that Madhusudhan and his colleagues addressed the concerns raised but feel that the new paper effectively walks back central claims made in the original April study, Welbanks said.
“The new paper tacitly concedes that the DMS/DMDS detection was not robust, yet still relies on the same flawed statistical framework and a selective reading of its own results,” Welbanks said in an email. “While the tone is more cautious (sometimes), the methodology continues to obscure the true level of uncertainty. The statistical significance claimed in earlier work was the product of arbitrary modeling decisions that are not acknowledged.”
Luque said the Cambridge team’s new paper is a step in the right direction because it explores other possible chemical biosignatures.
“But I think it fell short in the scope,” Luque said. “I think it restricted itself too much into being a rebuttal to the (Welbanks) paper.”
Separately, however, the astronomers studying K2-18b agree that pushing forward on researching the exoplanet contributes to the scientific process.
“I think it’s just a good, healthy scientific discourse to talk about what is going on with this planet,” Welbanks said. “Regardless of what any single author group says right now, we don’t have a silver bullet. But that is exactly why this is exciting, because we know that we’re the closest we have ever been (to finding a biosignature), and I think we may get it within our lifetime, but right now, we’re not there. That is not a failure. We’re testing bold ideas.”

The ban that Trump announced Wednesday takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday, a cushion that may avoid the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice in 2017. Trump, who signaled plans for a new ban upon taking office again in January, appears to be on firmer ground this time after the Supreme Court sided with him. WATCH: State Department holds news briefing as Trump creates new travel ban Some of the 12 countries also appeared on the list of banned countries in the Republican president’s first term. The new ban targets Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. There will also be heightened restrictions on visitors from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. North Korea and Syria, which were on the banned list in the first Trump administration, were spared this time. While many of the banned and restricted countries send few people to the United States, Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela had been major sources of immigration in recent years. Trump tied the new ban to Sunday’s terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The suspect, who is accused of turning a makeshift flamethrower on a group of people, is from Egypt, which is not on Trump’s restricted list. The Department of Homeland Security says he overstayed a tourist visa. The travel ban results from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the departments of State and Homeland Security and the director of national intelligence to compile a report on “hostile attitudes” toward the U.S. and whether entry from certain countries represented a national security risk. Visa overstays Trump said some countries had “deficient” screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. His findings rely extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of visa overstays of tourists, business visitors and students who arrive by air and sea, singling out countries with high percentages of those remaining after their visas expired. Measuring overstay rates has challenged experts for decades, but the government has made a limited attempt annually since 2016. Trump’s proclamation cites overstay rates for eight of the 12 banned countries. While Trump’s list captures many of the most egregious offenders, it omits others. Djibouti, for example, had a 23..9% overstay rate among business visitors and tourists in the 12-month period through September 2023, higher than seven countries on the banned list and six countries on the restricted list. The findings are “based on sketchy data and a misguided concept of collective punishment,” said Doug Rand, a former Biden administration official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Reactions Venezuela’s government had already warned its citizens against traveling to the U.S. A video released last week by the foreign ministry told Venezuelans the U.S. “is a dangerous country where human rights of immigrants are nonexistent.” “If you are thinking about traveling, cancel your plans immediately,” it urged. But the decision is a significant blow to Venezuelans, who were already limited in their U.S. travel plans since the governments broke off diplomatic relations in 2019. The announcement stunned the family of María Aldana, who has long worked multiple jobs in Caracas to support her brother’s dream to study engineering in the U.S. The family has spent more than $6,000 to finance his goals. Aldana, 24, said her distraught brother, who enrolled at a Southern California university two years ago, called the family crying. “We did it all legally,” Aldana said. The African Union Commission, meanwhile, appealed to the United States to reconsider “in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa.” International aid groups and refugee resettlement organizations took a harsher tone: “This latest proclamation is an attempt to further eviscerate lawful immigration pathways under the false guise of national security,” said Sarah Mehta, the American Civil Liberties Union’s deputy director of policy and government affairs for immigration. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired Cornell University Law School professor and expert in immigration law, said the ban is likely to withstand legal challenges, noting the Supreme Court eventually allowed a ban to take effect in Trump’s first term. Trump’s invocation this week of national security, along with exceptions for green-card holders, athletes and others, could also help the ban stand up in court. Shock in Iran The news came as a shock to many in Iran despite the decades of enmity between the two countries. Reports suggest thousands of university students each year travel to America to study, and others have extended families living in America, some of whom fled after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the shah. “My elder daughter got a bachelor’s degree from a top Iranian university and planned to continue in the U.S., but now she is badly distressed,” Nasrin Lajvardi said. Tensions also remain high because negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program have yet to reach any agreement, but Tehran resident Mehri Soltani offered rare support for Trump’s decision. “Those who have family members in the U.S., it’s their right to go, but a bunch of bad people and terrorists and murderers want to go there as well,” he said. ‘America has to cancel it’ Outside the former U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, a Taliban guard expressed his disappointment. “America has to cancel it,” Ilias Kakal said. Travel agents there said the ban would have little practical effect as Afghan passport holders have faced problems for years getting U.S. visas. Since the Taliban took over the country in 2021, only Afghans with foreign passports or green cards were able to travel to the United States with any ease, they said, while even those applying for special visas due to their work with U.S. forces in Afghanistan were facing problems. First term ban During his first term, Trump issued an executive order banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries. It was one of the most chaotic and confusing moments of his young presidency. The order, often referred to as the “Muslim ban,” was retooled amid legal challenges, until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. Trump and others have defended the initial ban on national security grounds, arguing it was aimed at protecting the country and not founded on anti-Muslim bias. However, the president had called for an explicit ban on Muslims during his first campaign for the White House. Amiri reported from the United Nations.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Governments of 12 countries whose citizens will be banned from visiting the United States beginning next week scrambled Thursday to understand President Donald Trump’s latest move to resurrect a hallmark policy of his first term. The ban that Trump announced Wednesday takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday, a cushion that may avoid the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice in 2017. Trump, who signaled plans for a new ban upon taking office again in January, appears to be on firmer ground this time after the Supreme Court sided with him. WATCH: State Department holds news briefing as Trump creates new travel ban Some of the 12 countries also appeared on the list of banned countries in the Republican president’s first term. The new ban targets Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. There will also be heightened restrictions on visitors from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. North Korea and Syria, which were on the banned list in the first Trump administration, were spared this time. While many of the banned and restricted countries send few people to the United States, Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela had been major sources of immigration in recent years.

"Democrat Slams Administration For 'Enriching Themselves,' Outlines Path To Beat Trump (CORRECTION)",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/robert-garcia-slams-democratic-party-beat-trump_n_68405a62e4b09bb4b588e626,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:14:56 -0400",Rep. Robert Garcia appears to have learned a whole lot after co-chairing the campaign of former Vice President Kamala Harris.,"CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misinterpreted Rep. Robert Garcia’s remarks. Garcia criticized Donald Trump’s administration for “enriching themselves.”
Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) appears to have learned a lot from former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign and said the American people want to see Democrats put up a fight against President Donald Trump.
Garcia argued as much during an appearance Tuesday on MSNBC’s “The Weeknight,” though this wasn’t the first time he urged his colleagues to reflect on why they lost last year’s election to Trump.
“What we have to do as a party is focus on a few things,” Garcia said. “First is making it very clear that we are the anti-corruption party. We’re the party that believes in democracy and the rule of law and supporting working families and the American public.”
“Right now, we have an administration that is completely focused on enriching themselves and their family,” he continued. “They are stealing from the American public, from working-class people, to enrich themselves and their billionaire friends.”
The panel of MSNBC hosts, including Symone Sanders Townsend, Michael Steele and Alicia Menendez, listened closely to his message. Garcia said Democrats must “do a better job of communicating” their goals to dejected voters.
Garcia notably co-chaired Harris’ campaign, which only had some 100 days to run against Trump after she became the Democratic nominee. Her loss spawned public frustration within the party, whose members couldn’t understand how they lost to Trump — yet again.
Garcia acknowledged Tuesday that Democrats failed because they “didn’t convince the American public that we’re on their side,” but argued that the party’s current resistance to Trump’s executive orders and seemingly open corruption is winning voters over.
“Every week that goes by, we’re getting stronger,” he said. “We’re honing in on our message, and when I’m ... talking to people, going to town halls, people are reacting to the aggressive approach that we’re taking, and they like it. We’ve gotta be out there and fight.”
Steele went on to ask how Democrats can possibly win people over with promises of health care or a stable economy.
“I think, one, we’ve got to call out every single lie, every single attack on democracy, every time they try to intimidate members of Congress or the public,” Garcia suggested. “We have got to call it out. We can’t be afraid of putting it all out on the table.”
“The American public understands, and the American public wants to see us fight,” he said.",Huffington Post,"['executive order', 'executive order']","['Robert Garcia’s', 'Garcia', 'Donald Trump’s', 'Robert Garcia', 'Kamala Harris', 'Donald Trump', 'Garcia', 'MSNBC', 'Trump', 'Garcia', 'MSNBC', 'Symone Sanders Townsend', 'Michael Steele', 'Alicia Menendez', 'Garcia', 'Garcia', 'Harris', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Garcia', 'Trump', 'Congress', 'Garcia']",,0
Trump’s Budget Bill Would Gut the Judiciary’s Power to Enforce Court Orders,https://truthout.org/articles/trumps-budget-bill-would-gut-the-judiciarys-power-to-enforce-court-orders/,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 16:37:37 +0000","By stripping judges' ability to hold officials in contempt, the law would undermine their power to check Trump's agenda.","Buried in the House’s budget reconciliation bill — now pending in the Senate — is a legislative provision that takes aim at the federal judiciary. Section 70302, titled “Restriction on Enforcement,” would undermine federal judges’ authority to enforce court orders by limiting their ability to hold government officials in contempt, a key tool for compelling compliance with court orders.
Following court rulings is not optional. If federal officials defy a court order, judges have the authority to hold them in contempt, which is a power that judges exercise to address threats to the integrity of judicial proceedings. When officials fail to follow a court order, judges may hold them and their attorneys in civil contempt, imposing fines, jail time, or other penalties to induce compliance. Judges can also punish past disobedience by holding government officials and their attorneys in criminal contempt.
Section 70302 would forbid federal courts from issuing such contempt penalties against anyone who disobeys preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders if the party seeking the order did not put down “security,” a financial guarantee such as a cash bond that would cover damages if a party is found to have been wrongfully enjoined.
Without contempt penalties against officials, judges would be left with few options to induce the government to follow their orders.
The timing of this brazen assault on the rule of law is no coincidence. So far this year, more than 190 court rulings have temporarily or permanently halted administration actions, and several judges have found that the administration violated court orders. At least one judge has found probable cause to hold administration officials in criminal contempt for “willful disobedience.”
Now the president’s allies in Congress are trying to aid these violations by removing potential consequences for such unlawful behavior.
The Senate should remove Section 70302 from the reconciliation bill so judges have the tools they need to ensure that the executive branch abides by the Constitution and the very laws that Congress passes.
The Provision Would Undercut Courts’ Inherent Power to Enforce Their Orders
Federal courts have relied on the contempt power since the founding. Rooted in courts’ innate power to enforce their rulings, the contempt authority was first codified in the Judiciary Act of 1789 and remains good law today. The Supreme Court has described the contempt power as “inherent in all courts” and “essential” to the enforcement of judgments.
It is common for judges to weigh contempt proceedings against federal officials. One study found that between 1990 and 2018 there were over 1,400 district court cases featuring a contempt motion or proceedings against a federal agency. And while often the threat of contempt suffices to induce compliance, judges do sometimes issue sanctions against the federal government. Federal agencies and high-ranking officials from both parties, including the attorney general and other cabinet secretaries, have been held in contempt.
By forbidding judges from punishing those who disobey preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders unless the party seeking the order posts security, Section 70302 erodes this cornerstone of judicial authority, inviting defiance of court orders.
The Provision’s Retroactivity Would Undermine Existing Orders and Disrupt Court Dockets
Congress does not often pass legislation that applies to past conduct. However, Section 70302 would apply retroactively, rendering past injunctions issued by federal judges that did not require a bond largely unenforceable absent further action by both the court and the parties in the case.
This retroactive application of Section 70302 would upend rulings by federal courts in countless federal cases across the country — and not just for lawsuits against the government. Any defendant who is subject to a federal preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order in which no bond was ordered would be able to disobey these past orders without the risk of contempt penalties.
In the case of preliminary injunctions, which are used to avoid irreparable harm while a lawsuit is pending, such orders can be in place for years. Limiting these orders’ enforceability risks chaotic disruptions for parties who rely on them to protect their rights and legal interests, and the prospect is especially troubling given the administration’s actions to avoid judicial oversight.
To the extent that Section 70302’s language applies to both preliminary and permanent injunctions — one potential interpretation of this poorly drafted provision — it would have the radical result of effectively preventing courts from enforcing every federal injunction currently restraining the government and private individuals in cases where no bond was posted.
To restore courts’ ability to use their contempt power, judges in each of these individual cases would likely need to reconvene court and order the plaintiffs to post a bond. Given the high case loads and scheduling backlogs that federal courts already face, the resulting burden on both judges and parties would be substantial. Further, there is no guarantee that all judges would act expeditiously in this way, if at all.
Requiring Financial Bonds Would Deter Public Interest Litigation
Under Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, parties that win preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders are required to post a bond in an amount that the court considers proper to cover anticipated cost and damages of the litigation. However, judges have broad discretion over bond requirements, and they routinely choose to waive the requirement or set a low bond amount.
Waivers are an especially common practice in public interest cases against the federal government involving everything from voting rights to freedom of speech. In such lawsuits, courts have strong interests in ensuring that monetary requirements do not impede vindication of constitutional rights and public access to judicial review.
Despite the fact that federal courts already have numerous tools at their disposal to deter frivolous litigation, including sanctions, President Trump issued a memo in March instructing agency heads to demand bonds from plaintiffs requesting injunctions against the federal government to “stop[] judicial overreach and frivolous lawsuits.” Since then, the Department of Justice has asked courts to set exorbitant bonds, even millions of dollars in some cases. Courts have thus far denied these requests, acknowledging that a costly upfront security was inappropriate and would essentially forestall judicial review.
While Section 70302 does not appear to preclude judges from requiring nominal bonds, the provision may still pressure judges concerned about their contempt power to impose sizeable bonds to avoid litigation over the suitability of the amount, even if in their judgment such a large bond amount is unwarranted. As a result, advocacy organizations without deep pockets might think twice before bringing vital public interest litigation and, in some cases, be deterred from bringing such litigation altogether.
Congress Cannot Use Budget Reconciliation to Change Judges’ Ability to Enforce Orders
The budget reconciliation process provides an expedited path for Congress to take up legislation related to taxing, spending, and the national debt. Under this process, reconciliation bills are not subject to a 60-vote threshold for ending debate in the Senate. Instead, they move forward to final passage under a simple majority vote.
However, each provision in a budget reconciliation bill must primarily affect federal spending or revenue and cannot be “extraneous” — defined as a provision whose budgetary effects are “merely incidental to the non-budgetary components of the provision.” Based on Congress’s own rules under the Congressional Budget Act, Section 70302 appears extraneous and should not pass Senate muster for budget reconciliation.
Indeed, Section 70302 is only incidentally related to federal spending and instead constitutes a change to the federal statute governing courts’ contempt powers. The section also alters the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by overriding courts’ longstanding interpretation of Rule 65(c), which allows judges to waive bonds before issuing a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order. There is no clear exception in the Congressional Budget Act allowing Congress to impose changes to the contempt statute or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure via budget reconciliation. If Congress wishes to alter judges’ authority to enforce contempt citations and waive bonds, it should do so via the ordinary legislative process.
Members of both parties have publicly stated that the executive branch must comply with court orders, and public opinion is overwhelmingly opposed to defiance of court orders. Rather than shoring up judicial independence, the House has chosen to do the opposite. Congress should remove Section 70302.

Massachusetts Teen Arrested By ICE On His Way To Volleyball Practice Has Been Released,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/immigration-judge-grants-bond-to-massachusetts-teen-arrested-volleyball-practice_n_6841d626e4b0a8e2861b36d8,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 13:43:41 -0400","Marcelo Gomes da Silva, 18, who came to the U.S. from Brazil at age 7, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday.","CHELMSFORD, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts high school student who was arrested by immigration agents on his way to volleyball practice has been released from custody after a judge granted him bond Thursday.
Marcelo Gomes da Silva, 18, who came to the U.S. from Brazil at age 7, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday. Authorities have said the agents were looking for the Milford High School teenager’s father, who owns the car Gomes da Silva was driving at the time and had parked in a friend’s driveway.
Speaking with members of the media outside the detention center shortly after his release on $2,000 bond, Gomes da Silva described “humiliating” conditions and said his faith helped him through his six days of detention.
On his wrist, he wore a bracelet made from the thin sheet of metallic blanket he was given to sleep on the cement floor.
“I’ll always remember this place,” he said. “I’ll always remember how it was.”
His lawyer, Robin Nice, told reporters after the hearing in Chelmsford that his arrest “shouldn’t have happened in the first place. This is all a waste.”
“We disrupted a kid’s life. We just disrupted a community’s life,” Nice said. “These kids should be celebrating graduation and prom, I assume? They should be doing kid stuff, and it is a travesty and a waste of our judicial process to have to go through this.”
She said Gomes da Silva was confined to a room holding 25 to 35 men, many twice his age, most of the time he was detained, with no windows, time outside, privacy to use the restroom or permission to shower. Nice said that at one point Gomes da Silva, who is active in his local church, asked for a Bible and was denied.
Gomes da Silva, who said his father taught him to “put other people first,” said many of the men imprisoned with him didn’t speak English and didn’t understand why they were there. He had to inform some of them they were being deported, and then watched them break down in tears.
“I told every single inmate down there: When I’m out, if I’m the only one who was able to leave that place, I lost,” he said. “I want to do whatever I can to get them as much help as possible. If they have to be deported, so be it. But in the right way, in the right conditions. Because no one down there is treated good.”
He said some days, he was given only crackers to eat, which he shared with cellmates. His first stop after being released was for McDonald’s chicken nuggets and french fries.
Not ICE’s target, but detained anyway
U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said earlier this week ICE officers were targeting a “known public safety threat” and Gomes da Silva’s father “has a habit of reckless driving at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour through residential areas.”
“While ICE officers never intended to apprehend Gomes da Silva, he was found to be in the United States illegally and subject to removal proceedings, so officers made the arrest,” she said in a statement.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said Monday that “like any local law enforcement officer, if you encounter someone that has a warrant or … he’s here illegally, we will take action on it.”
Upon his release, Gomes da Silva pushed back on ICE’s characterizations of his father: “Everything I got was from my dad. He’s a good person. He never did anything wrong.”
When he was able to call his parents during his detainment, Gomes da Silva said his father sobbed and told him the family was scared to leave the house.
Gomes da Silva initially entered the country on a visitor visa and was later issued a student visa that has since lapsed, Nice said. He told reporters he didn’t know his immigration status until he was arrested.
He said an officer asked him, “Do you know why you were arrested?” He said no.
“I told her, ma’am, I was 7 years old. I don’t know nothing about that stuff,” he recalled. “I don’t understand how it works.”
Nice described him as deeply rooted in his community and a dedicated member of both the school marching band and a band at his church.
The immigration judge set a placeholder hearing date for a couple of weeks from Thursday, but it might take place months from that, Nice said.
“We’re optimistic that he’ll have a future in the United States,” she said.
A shaken community
“I love my son. We need Marcelo back home. It’s no family without him,” João Paulo Gomes Pereira said in a video released Wednesday. “We love America. Please, bring my son back.”
The video showed the family in the teen’s bedroom. Gomes da Silva’s sister describes enjoying watching movies with her brother and the food he cooks for her: “I miss everything about him.”
Students at Milford High staged a walkout Monday to protest his detainment. Other supporters packed the stands of the high school gymnasium Tuesday night, when the volleyball team dedicated a match to their missing teammate.
Amani Jack, a recent Milford High graduate, said her classmate’s absence loomed large over the graduation ceremony, where he was supposed to play in the band. She said if she had a chance to speak with the president, she’d ask him to “put yourself in our shoes.”
“He did say he was going to deport criminals,” she said. “Marcelo is not a criminal. He’s a student. I really want him to take a step in our shoes, witnessing this. Try and understand how we feel. We’re just trying to graduate high school.”
Veronica Hernandez, a family advocate from Medford who said she works in a largely Hispanic community where ICE has had an active presence, said cases like Gomes da Silva’s show immigration enforcement is serious about taking “anybody” without legal status, not just those accused of crimes.
“I think seeing that something so simple as a child driving themselves and their friends to volleyball practice at risk struck a chord,” she said.

Goodbye Mr. Nice Guy? Investors dump Tesla on bet Trump may lash out at Musk through his car company,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/goodbye-mr-nice-guy-investors-dump-tesla-bet-122550385,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 07:34:21 -0400",Shares of Elon Musk&rsquo;s electric vehicle maker fell sharply Thursday as investors fear his dispute with President Donald Trump could end up hurting the company,"Goodbye Mr. Nice Guy? Investors dump Tesla on bet Trump may lash out at Musk through his car company
Shares of Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker fell sharply Thursday as investors fear his dispute with President Donald Trump could end up hurting the company
Investors bought hundreds of billions of dollars of Tesla stock after Donald Trump was elected on a bet that politics were more important than profits.
In three hours Thursday, they learned yet again how dangerous that gamble could be.
Shares of Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker plunged more than 14% in a stunning wipeout as investors dumped holdings amid a bitter war of words between the president and the world's richest man. By the end of the trading day, $150 billion of Tesla's value had been erased, more than what it would take to buy all the shares of Starbucks and hundreds of other big publicly traded U.S. companies.
In after-hours trading, Tesla shares rose 0.8%.
The disagreement started over the president's budget bill, then quickly turned nasty. After Musk said that Trump wouldn't haven't gotten elected without his help, Trump implied that he may turn the federal government against his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.
“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social messaging service Truth Social. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”
The drop on Thursday partially reversed a big runup in the eight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would be testing an autonomous, driverless “robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, this month.
Investors fear Trump might not be in such a rush to usher in a future of self-driving cars in the U.S., and that could slam Tesla. So much of its real business selling electric cars is struggling now and so it needs the promise of a new age of driverless cars to be realized— and fast.
“The whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Tesla's biggest fans, but now worried. ""If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.”
He added, ""There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.”
Trump's threat to cut government contracts seems targeted more to another of Musk's businesses, SpaceX, than his car company. The privately held rocket company has received billions of dollars for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, providing launches and doing other work for NASA. The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to moon next year.
A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk's once-close relationship with the president.
On a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use. Though its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.
One measure of SpaceX's success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares in recent months reportedly valued it at an $350 billion, up from an estimated $210 billion a year ago.
Now all that is possibly in danger. Tesla shares got even a bigger lift from Musk's close relationship with Trump, initially at least.
After the presidential election in November, investors rushed into the stock, adding more than $450 billion to its value in a few weeks. The belief was that the company would see big riches as Trump eased regulatory oversight of Tesla. They also were betting that the new administration would embrace Musk's plans for millions of cars on U.S. roads without drivers behind the wheel.
After hitting an all-time high on Dec. 17, the shares retreated as Musk’s time as head of a government cost-cutting group led to boycotts and a hit to Tesla's reputation. They've recently popped higher again after Musk vowed to focus more on Tesla and its upcoming driverless taxi launch.

Veteran Blasts Pete Hegseth Over Pride Month 'Troll' Job And 'Warrior Ethos',https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jason-kander-pete-hegseth-renaming-usns-harvey-milk_n_6840e0cee4b0280f7518889c,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 23:22:49 -0400","Former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander (D) smacked down the defense secretary's ""pretty immature"" order against a late LGBTQ+ rights icon.","Former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander (D) on Wednesday dragged Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s “pretty immature” order for the U.S. Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a vessel named after a late LGBTQ+ rights icon.
Kander — a U.S. Army veteran — spoke to MSNBC about Hegseth’s ’80s “action movie”-like talk of “trying to restore a warrior culture” in the military, arguing that his move to rename the ship sends the wrong message to gay service members who will believe they can’t be part of such an “ethos.”
“That’s a real problem in a military that rightfully got rid of the law that forced Harvey Milk out of the military,” said Kander of Milk, who served in the Navy in the Korean War before being forcibly discharged due to his sexual orientation.
In 1978, Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in California. He was assassinated later that year.
The timing of the move to rename the ship — which is set to be announced next week in the heart of Pride Month — was reportedly intentional and reflects wider efforts to reimagine history under President Donald Trump.
Hegseth’s plan to strip the vessel of Milk’s name has sparked outrage among leaders in San Francisco and led to criticism from actor Sean Penn, who played Milk in the 2008 Oscar-winning movie named after the politician.
Kander stressed that it’s not a “bad thing” to remind service members about “what they’re serving for.”
“And you want to talk about a ‘warrior ethos,’ I mean, how about somebody who joins the military during a war as an officer, gets kicked out over their own objections and then goes on to fight for civil rights and gives their life for the cause,” he said of Milk.
“That’s probably the kind of thing that we want to remind our service members that America is about and what we’re fighting for in the first place.”
Moments earlier, Kander said the move by Hegseth — who once walked back controversial comments attacking gay service members — reflects what happens when you put a Fox News host in charge of the Pentagon, as “everything looks like a tweet.”

This time around, the panic and chaos was already widespread by the time the president signed his proclamation Wednesday to fully or partially restrict foreign nationals from 19 countries from entering the United States.
Since being sworn in for his second term, Trump has unleashed a barrage of draconian immigration restrictions. Within hours of taking office, the president suspended the asylum system at the southern border as part of his wide-ranging immigration crackdown. His administration has ended temporary legal residency for 211,000 Haitians, 117,000 Venezuelans and 110,000 Cubans, and moved to revoke temporary protected status for several groups of immigrants. It has moved to restrict student visas and root out scholars who have come to the US legally.
“It’s death by 1,000 cuts,” said Faisal Al-Juburi of the Texas-based legal non-profit Raices, which was among several immigrants’ rights groups that challenged Trump’s first travel ban. “And that’s kind of the point. It’s creating layers and layers of restrictions.”
Trump’s first travel ban in January 2017, issued days after he took office, targeted the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The order came as a shock – including to many administration officials. Customs and Border Protection officials were initially given little guidance on how to enact the ban. Lawyers and protesters rushed to international airports where travellers were stuck in limbo. Confusion spread through colleges and tech companies in the US, and refugee camps across the world.
This time, Trump’s travel ban came as no surprise. He had cued up the proclamation in an executive order signed on 20 January, his first day back in the White House, instructing his administration to submit a list of candidate countries for a ban by 21 March. Though he finally signed a proclamation enacting the ban on Wednesday, it will not take effect until 9 June – allowing border patrol officers and travellers a few days to prepare.
The ban includes several exemptions, including for people with visas who are already in the United States, green-card holders, dual citizens and athletes or coaches traveling to the US for major sporting events such as the World Cup or the Olympics. It also exempts Afghans eligible for the special immigrant visa program for those who helped the US during the war in Afghanistan.
But the policy, which is likely to face legal challenges, will undoubtedly once again separate families and disproportionately affect people seeking refuge from humanitarian crises.
“This is horrible, to be clear … and it’s still something that reeks of arbitrary racism and xenophobia,” Al-Juburi said. “But this does not yield the type of chaos that January 2017 yielded, because immigration overall has been upended to such a degree that the practice of immigration laws is in a state of chaos.”
In his second term, Trump has taken unprecedented steps to tear down legal immigration. He has eliminated the legal status of thousands of international students and instructed US embassies worldwide to stop scheduling visa interviews as it prepares to ramp up social media vetting for international scholars.
The administration has arrested people at immigration check-ins, exiled asylum seekers to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, and detained scholars and travellers at airports without reason. Although Trump’s travel ban excludes green-card holders, his Department of Homeland Security has made clear that it can and will revoke green cards as it sees fit – including in the cases of the student activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi.
“The first Muslim ban was very targeted, it was brutal, it was immediate, and it was massive,” said Nihad Awad, the executive director at the Council on American–Islamic Relations. “Now, the administration is not only targeting nations with certain religious affiliations, but also people of color overall, people who criticise the US government for its funding of the genocide in Gaza.”
And this new travel ban comes as many families are still reeling and recovering from Trump’s first ban. “We’re looking at, essentially, a ban being in place potentially for eight out of 12 years,” said Ryan Costello, policy director at the National Iranian American Council. “And even in that period where the Biden administration lifted the ban, it was still very hard for Iranians to get a visa.”
Iranian Americans who came to the US fleeing political persecution back home, who couldn’t return to Iran, have in some cases been unable to see their parents, siblings or other loved ones for years. “You want your parents to be able to come for the birth of a child, or to come to your wedding,” Costello said. “So this is a really hard moment for so many families. And I think, unfortunately, there’s much more staying power for this ban.”
Experts say the new ban is more likely to stand up to legal challenges than his first ban. It also doesn’t appear to have registered the same intense shock and outrage, culturally.
“The first time, we saw this immediate backlash, protests at airports,” said Costello. “Now, over time, Trump has normalized this.”",The Guardian,"['executive order', 'international students', 'department of homeland security', 'executive order', 'legal status', 'protests', 'student visa', 'visa', 'nih']","['Donald Trump’s', 'the United States', 'Trump', 'US', 'Faisal Al-Juburi', 'Texas', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Iraq', 'Syria', 'Iran', 'Sudan', 'Libya', 'Somalia', 'Yemen', 'Customs', 'Border Protection', 'US', 'Trump', 'the United States', 'US', 'the World Cup', 'Olympics', 'US', 'Afghanistan', 'Al-Juburi', 'Trump', 'US', 'El Salvador', 'Trump', 'Department of Homeland Security', 'Mahmoud Khalil', 'Mohsen Mahdawi', 'Nihad Awad', 'the Council on American–Islamic Relations', 'US', 'Gaza', 'Trump', 'Ryan Costello', 'the National Iranian American Council', 'Biden', 'US', 'Iran', 'Costello', 'Costello', 'Trump']","Attract & Retain, Recruiting Research Talent and Key Person Dependence in Higher Education; Immigration update",2
Trump's surgeon general pick criticizes others' conflicts but profits from wellness product sales,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trumps-surgeon-general-pick-criticizes-others-conflicts-profits-wellne-rcna211420,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:02:33 GMT","President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation’s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health.","PROVIDENCE, R.I. — President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation’s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health.
Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products — including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service — in ways that put money in her own pocket.
A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.
In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.
Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn’t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a “material connection” to a product they promote.
Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.
“I fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.
The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government’s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users’ glucose levels, could benefit from this administration’s health guidance and policy.
Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.
The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being “bought off” or “corrupt” because of ties to industry.
Means’ use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.
A compelling origin story
Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.
“During my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,” she wrote on her website.
Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.
Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.
“At the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we’re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we’d want it,” she said on Megyn Kelly’s podcast last year.
But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.
During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn’t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.
Growing an audience, and selling products
Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to “encompass more and more of our lives,” said Emily Hund, author of “The Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.”
With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.
Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don’t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.
“A lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,” said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don’t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.
Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.
Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, “Good Energy”; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.
She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included “affiliate” or “partner” coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a “metabolic health collection.”
On a “My Faves” page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links “are affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.”
It’s not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.
Disclosing conflicts
Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast “Let’s Be Honest” that “relationships are influential.”
“There’s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,” Means said. “We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.”
In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was “insanity” to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, “We need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren’t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.”
On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, “I do understand how it’s messy.”
Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a “Clean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations” guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.
Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.
Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an “Investor and/or Advisor.” The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.
Though the “About” page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that’s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.
Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives’ LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil’s founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means’ business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means’ advice “transformational,” saying her teachings reversed Niazi’s prediabetes and other ailments.
“I am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,” Niazi said in an email.
While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.
“What you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,” Sylvain said, adding, “Should there be any doubt about claims you make about products?”
Potential conflicts pose new ethical questions
Means isn’t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.
Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job — among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.
He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.
Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.
Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.
Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.

"Planned Parenthood clinics provide basic health care. If they close, where will women go?",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/planned-parenthood-provides-basic-health-care-clinics-close-will-many-rcna210757,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 09:30:40 GMT","Citing deep funding cuts, at least 200 Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide are at risk.","When the Trump administration suddenly froze federal funding to more than 100 Planned Parenthood clinics this spring, the organization’s Michigan branch was already deep into hard discussions about its finances.
“The leadership team and our board had been scenario planning for months to try to fill those gaps to see how we could continue providing care,” said Ashlea Phenicie, chief external affairs officer of Planned Parenthood of Michigan.
The only option was clear. Michigan’s 14 Planned Parenthood clinics serve tens of thousands of women. In order to save clinics around the state that were either busier or in places where women had few other options, the team would have to close multiple clinics, including the only one in the state’s Upper Peninsula, a large, isolated and mostly rural area surrounded by a stretch of Lake Michigan. In Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, the city’s two clinics would be combined.
It’s a reality playing out across the country.
At least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed or will close within the year. For decades, the health care organization has been squeezed by the same pressures choking nearly all U.S. providers –– low insurance reimbursement rates, blocked Medicaid expansion, understaffing and rising costs of providing medical care that have forced hospitals and health clinic closures throughout the country.
Uniquely, Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that serves more than 2 million patients nationwide every year, many of them uninsured, underinsured or who qualify for Medicaid, has also become the target of pointed funding cuts that started under the first Trump administration.
“What is different this time around is that it’s much more sweeping. It’s a deeper and broader cut that will affect both more clinics and more people,” said Farzana Kapadia, a professor of epidemiology and population health at the New York University School of Global Public Health.
In March, the Trump administration withheld funding by excluding many Planned Parenthood clinics from the Title X family planning program, a federal grant program that funds family planning and reproductive health care. Then, in late May, House Republicans delivered another enormous blow, voting to end funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the reconciliation bill.
Federal law already restricts federal funds from being used for abortion, except in cases of incest, rape or if a mother’s life is in danger, through a law called the Hyde Amendment.
But if passed, the reconciliation bill would cut off Medicaid reimbursement to any nonprofit that primarily offers family planning or reproductive health services, provides abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment exceptions and received more than $1 million in Medicaid reimbursements in 2024. As a nationwide organization, Planned Parenthood does all three.
If the bill passes in the Senate, it would block Planned Parenthood clinics from billing Medicaid for any health services at all, including cancer screenings, wellness exams and birth control. It's unclear if the new legislation would apply to Planned Parenthood nationally or on a state-by-state basis.
Over half of Planned Parenthood patients are covered by publicly funded health programs like Medicaid and in 2023, about 36% of all Title X services were provided by Planned Parenthood clinics. Eliminating these sources of funding would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from Planned Parenthood’s care costs every year. Targeting federal funding for any type of care for Planned Parenthood clinics is a way opponents of abortion rights can attempt to shut down clinics that do provide abortion, even if they also offer other care.
Phenicie said Republican lawmakers appear to understand that cutting off Planned Parenthood from Title X and Medicaid reimbursement will put the clinics that perform abortion in peril, even if these funds can’t cover the procedures. The slashed funds could affect all Planned Parenthood clinics whether they offer abortion services or not.
“They know so much of our patient base is on Medicaid or needs Title X to pay for their care, they know that cutting this off will allow them to cut off access to abortion and they are willing to make that trade,” she said.
Before the cuts, Planned Parenthood was already operating on thin margins. Now, clinics are struggling to operate at a loss.
“The numbers are so devastating that there are really no options other than closing some centers and consolidating others, and then investing in our virtual health centers that can serve people across the state,” Phenicie said.
Clinics provide basic health care
At least 1 in 3 women say they have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care, as well as 1 in 10 men, according to a recent KFF Health poll. Nearly half of Black women have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic, the poll found.
Abortions, the main reason the Trump administration has ended support for the clinics, account for just 4% of the services Planned Parenthood provides, according to a 2024 annual report.
The vast majority of Planned Parenthood’s services involve basic health care for women, including diagnosing and treating urinary tract and yeast infections and screening for cervical cancer and breast cancer. Some locations offer vaccination against HPV, hepatitis B, Covid and influenza.
More than half of care is related to testing for sexually transmitted infections and treatment. Another 25% is providing access to contraception, often at low or no cost. Cancer screenings and other non-abortion services make up 18%, the report showed.
Those important medical services haven’t swayed opponents of the clinics.
In January, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., introduced a bill that sought to ban Planned Parenthood from federal funding in the same ways the federal reconciliation bill would. The bill is called the Defund Planned Parenthood Act.
“My commitment to protecting life isn’t just personal, it’s rooted in both science and principle. Life begins at conception, and I’ve spent my time in the Senate fighting to protect the right to life,” Paul said in a press release.
Closing in states that support abortion rights
About 40% of Planned Parenthood’s funding comes from government health care reimbursements and grants. Many locations offer a sliding scale payment option for people who can’t afford health care. That money comes, in part, from government programs that are now being cut.
“Cutting this funding is really about cutting access to care for people who are not insured or who are underinsured to allow for tax breaks for people who can afford their medical care,” NYU’s Kapadia said.
Wendy Stark, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, said that even when a patient has private insurance, “the reimbursement rates are just not meeting the costs of primary care.
“The U.S. health care system pays a tiny amount of health care dollars into primary and preventative care,” Stark said. “We are sitting in a micro version of that.”
Earlier this year, Planned Parenthood announced it was selling the building that housed its only Manhattan location. Planned Parenthood locations are also shuttering throughout the Midwest and in other states that have historically voted in favor of abortion rights, including Vermont.
In late May, Planned Parenthood announced it will close four clinics in Minnesota within a year. The state was the first to codify the right to abortion into law after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, but only one of the closing clinics performed abortions.
Four of the six Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa, including one in Ames, where Iowa State University is located, will also be shuttered. Four Illinois clinics, none which performed abortions, stopped operating in March. In April, three locations closed and two were consolidated in Michigan, where the right to abortion is enshrined into state law. Two Utah locations closed in May after losing a significant amount of funding as a result of the Title X freeze.
“We are subsidizing almost every visit we do, even with insurance,” Stark said. “We also have a great deal of our patients who come who do not have insurance.”
The decision to sell the Manhattan clinic was a strategic but difficult decision, she said. The revenue from the sale could help keep other clinics in the state operating. Both the patients and staff of the Manhattan clinic can be absorbed by Planned Parenthood’s other New York City locations, which can minimize the impact the closure will have.
“When we consolidate in certain locations, we look at the whole area. Can we funnel patients to our next closest health center, are there other clinics that patients can be sent to?” Stark said, adding that this is more difficult to do in rural areas that already have extremely minimal health care options.
“If we face further erosion of our finances, we will have to make more hard decisions,” she said.
Straining a fragile health care system
Several state-level laws banned Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funds in the decade preceding the sweeping federal exclusions.
Robin Marty, the executive director of WAWC Healthcare, formerly West Alabama Women’s Center, in Tuscaloosa, said these states can provide a picture of what health care may look like in states that have more recently faced Planned Parenthood closures.
“We exist as kind of a lesson to people of what resources are like if there is not a Planned Parenthood,” she said.
Planned Parenthood operates just one brick-and-mortar clinic in Alabama, in Birmingham, but offers telehealth throughout the state. There are just two in Louisiana and one in the Florida Panhandle.
There are no physical clinics in Mississippi, which has the highest teen birth rate in the nation. Alabama and Louisiana rank in the top seven, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Mississippi also has the highest maternal mortality rate. Louisiana comes in second. Alabama is fourth.
“There aren’t places for people to go for free birth control or STI screenings or maternal care,” she said, referring to sexually transmitted infections.
WAWC Healthcare is one of the only providers in Alabama, outside of federally qualified health centers, which are run by states or counties, that does. Already, Marty said, the clinic relies heavily on nongovernmental grants in the absence of access to Title X, though the clinic does accept Medicaid.
“Every time I apply for a grant, I know I have only about a 10% chance of getting it, but I do it anyway because that’s the only way my patients can get care,” she said. Other than grants, “we rely on donors who each donate about $50 each time we contact them.”
Marty said other clinics that provide some of the same services as Planned Parenthood, which are already operating on razor-thin margins, if not at a loss, will be further strained by closures. This strain will be passed onto patients.
“You are talking about individuals who are living at or below the poverty level who already can’t afford health care on their own and then you are eliminating a major source of their health care,” Kapadia said.
The GOP megabill, which blocks Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed with Medicaid dollars, among other Medicaid cuts, is awaiting its fate in the Senate this week. For now, Title X funding is frozen for Planned Parenthoods in 20 states.
If the “Big Beautiful Bill” passes, another 200 of the roughly 600 Planned Parenthoods will be in danger, according to Planned Parenthood.
When Title X funding was cut off to Michigan Planned Parenthood between 2019 and 2021, the number of people seeking preventative care at its locations dropped 75%, Phenicie said.
Although there are other health centers that can pay for visits using Title X funds, they could not absorb the patients Planned Parenthood could no longer see, she added.
In the month leading up to this year’s closures, Planned Parenthood Michigan kept the four closing clinics open to honor all the appointments that had already been made, and spent hours trying to help patients line up care at other clinics or through telehealth with Planned Parenthood.
“Even if they would like to continue care, if they can’t be covered under Title X and they can’t use Medicaid, their options will be limited,” Phenicie said.

After signs of a strong labor market in April – which was largely seen as resiliency against teetering trade policy from the White House – May saw a drop in new jobs added to the labor market, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, unchanged from last month.
May’s jobs report was dragged down by the loss of 22,000 federal workers’ jobs as the Trump administration used the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to cut government positions. Since January, 59,000 Federal jobs have been cut.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics also cut the numbers of jobs created in March and April. In an update, the bureau said a total of 95,000 fewer jobs had been created over the two months.
After the report was released, Trump once again called on the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell (whom he has nicknamed “Too Late”), to cut interest rates.
“‘Too Late’ at the Fed is a disaster! Europe has had 10 rate cuts, we have had none. Despite him, our Country is doing great. Go for a full point, Rocket Fuel!” the president wrote on Truth Social.
Economists expected a downward slump after data earlier in the week suggested a cooling job market. Payroll firm ADP reported that private-sector payrolls increased by just 37,000 in May, the lowest gain in more than two years.
“After a strong start to the year, hiring is losing momentum,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, in a statement.
The Institute for Supply Management also released its latest purchasing mangers’ index figure, which measures the general landscape for manufacturers and showed a reading of 49.9 in April – the lowest since June 2024.
In the most recent results of the University of Michigan’s survey of consumers, released at the end of May, consumer sentiment had stayed relatively stable from April to May, with the caveat that April’s reading was the lowest drop in consumer sentiment since 1990.
The impact of Trump’s trade war has yet to be seen in inflation readings. In April, the annual inflation rate was at 2.3%, a slight decrease from March, though economists said that the impact of Trump’s tariffs will be gradual and probably will not impact data until the summer.",The Guardian,['university of michigan'],"['US', 'Donald Trump’s', 'the White House', 'the Bureau of Labor Statistics', 'Trump', 'The Bureau of Labor Statistics', 'Trump', 'the Federal Reserve', 'Jerome Powell', 'Fed', 'Rocket Fuel', 'Truth Social', 'Nela Richardson', 'The Institute for Supply Management', 'the University of Michigan’s', 'Trump', 'Trump']",Economic Downturn,3
"The fine print: 5 things that even some Republicans didn't realize were buried in Trump's 'big, beautiful' budget bill",https://www.yahoo.com/news/the-fine-print-5-things-that-even-some-republicans-didnt-realize-were-buried-in-trumps-big-beautiful-budget-bill-154842233.html,2025-06-05T15:48:42Z,,"The fine print: 5 things that even some Republicans didn't realize were buried in Trump's 'big, beautiful' budget bill
Key allies of the president suddenly seem to have second thoughts about the sprawling legislation.
Late last month, House Republicans passed President Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” — a package of tax cuts, social safety net reductions and increased border and military spending meant to deliver the bulk of Trump’s legislative agenda.
Now, as their Senate counterparts strategize about how to maneuver the sprawling measure through Congress’s upper chamber, some key Trump allies are making a surprising admission: that they regret ever supporting the president’s signature legislation in the first place.
“I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there,” Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene confessed Tuesday on X.
“I am not going to hide the truth: This provision was unknown to me when I voted for that bill,” Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood told voters in his district last week. “I do not agree with that section that was added to that bill.”
“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Elon Musk, the former head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), posted Tuesday on X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”
Why the sudden second thoughts?
In part, it’s because of how the 1,037-page bill was passed. The final version — filled with last-minute changes meant to placate various factions — didn’t materialize until 10:40 p.m. the evening before the House’s self-imposed Memorial Day weekend deadline, leaving lawmakers just eight overnight hours to digest it.
And in part it’s because experts — including, on Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — keep releasing in-depth analyses detailing how much Trump’s bill would actually cost, and who it would actually affect.
Here are five things buried in the bill that even some Republicans didn’t realize were there — or at least aren’t admitting they know about.
1. Making it easier for Trump to defy the courts
To make their orders stick, federal judges really only have one tool at their disposal: holding anyone who defies them in contempt, then enforcing these contempt citations with fines or jail time.
But House Republicans quietly inserted language into the bill stating that federal courts may not “enforce a contempt citation for failure to comply with an injunction or temporary restraining order” unless the plaintiff pays what’s known as a security bond at the beginning of the case.
The problem? Federal judges often waive such bonds when plaintiffs claim the government did something unconstitutional.
More in Politics
The second Trump administration, it turns out, has been embroiled in dozens of cases concerning the constitutionality of its actions. In several — mainly involving deportations — judges are considering holding administration officials in contempt for refusing to comply with their orders.
And so, if the bill passes as written, it would “potentially shiel[d] President Trump and members of his administration from the consequences of violating court orders,” as the New York Times recently explained — in part by “making it prohibitively expensive to sue.”
Rep. Flood, for one, is not a fan.
“When I found out that provision was in the bill, I immediately reached out to my Senate counterparts and told them of my concern,” Flood told his (booing) constituents last week. “And when I return to Washington, I am going to very clearly tell the people in my conference that we cannot support undermining our court system, and we must allow our federal courts to operate and issue injunctions.”
2. Blocking states from regulating AI
In lieu of any sort of federal oversight, dozens of U.S. states have passed — or are actively considering — new laws regulating how artificial intelligence is used or developed.
But in a concession to tech companies that claim that patchwork regulations stifle innovation, the House bill would block states from enforcing these laws — or passing new ones — for the next decade.
“No state or political subdivision may enforce any law or regulation regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act,” the bill reads.
Apparently, Rep. Greene missed that part.
“Full transparency, I did not know about this section,” she wrote on X. “We have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous. This needs to be stripped out in the Senate.”
Asked why she didn’t “know about” the AI provision, Greene told the New York Times that “it’s hard to read over 1,000 pages when things keep changing up to the last minute before we voted on it.”
3. Making single parents work harder than married parents for food benefits
One of the biggest cost-cutting measures in the bill is the new work requirement for low-income Americans who receive SNAP benefits (aka food stamps). This includes parents with children age 7 or older; to qualify, they would have to work 80 hours a month.
But late in the process, House Republicans created a loophole specifically for married parents. According to the final bill, if a parent is “responsible for a dependent child 7 years of age or older and is married to, and resides with, an individual who is in compliance,” then they don’t have to complete the work requirement.
No such exemption applies, however, to single parents. Since there’s no other parent around to work those 80 hours, they would have to do it themselves (on top of parenting alone).
“If you’re married, then you could have one person in the couple as a stay-at-home parent, and only one person has to work,” Carolyn Vega, associate director of policy at Share Our Strength, told Axios. “But if you’re in any other kind of household arrangement, then everyone needs to be meeting the work requirements.”
As of 2022, the bulk of SNAP recipients (53%) were children in single-parent families — and 80% of single-parent households are headed by mothers, according to census data.
It’s unclear whether House Republicans realize their bill would effectively penalize single parents who rely on SNAP — or whether they’re simply more focused on encouraging married couples to embrace stay-at-home motherhood than anything else.
4. Cutting Medicaid for U.S. citizens (and not just immigrants)
In recent days, Trump and his allies have claimed that the bill wouldn’t cut Medicaid, the program that provides health insurance to more than 70 million low-income Americans.
“We’re not doing any cutting of anything meaningful,” the president told reporters on May 20. “The only thing we’re cutting is waste, fraud and abuse. With Medicaid, waste, fraud and abuse. There’s tremendous waste, fraud and abuse.”
“We are not cutting Medicaid in this package,” House Speaker Mike Johnson added on CNN. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there about this, Jake. The numbers of Americans who are affected are those that are entwined in our work to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse. So, what do I mean by that? You got more than 1.4 million illegal aliens on Medicaid.”
“No one” — presumably meaning no U.S. citizens — “will lose coverage as a result of this bill,” agreed Russell Vought, Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget.
But Trump & Co. either don’t know, or aren’t admitting, that their claims aren’t accurate. According to the latest nonpartisan CBO estimate, released Wednesday, the bill would actually slash federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over the next decade, causing the number of people enrolled in the program to fall by 7.8 million.
How would it do that? By forcing childless adults without disabilities to work in order to receive Medicaid benefits; by requiring states to impose new co-payments on medical services for Medicaid beneficiaries who live above the poverty line; and by making it easier for a state to cancel its residents’ Medicaid coverage if they don’t complete additional paperwork.
As for “illegal aliens,” 14 states currently use their own tax revenues to provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants; the bill would penalize those states by reducing their share of federal Medicaid funding. As a result, the CBO estimates that about 1.4 million more people without “verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status” would be uninsured in 2034.
But the CBO also projects that overall, Trump’s bill would cause the total number of uninsured U.S. residents to grow by 10.9 million over the same period — meaning the other 9.5 million would presumably be U.S. citizens.
Noting this, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri has argued that the bill’s Medicaid changes would harm “working people and their children.”
“Over 20 percent of Missourians, including hundreds of thousands of children, are on Medicaid,” Hawley said on CNN last month. “They’re not on Medicaid because they want to be. They’re on Medicaid because they cannot afford health insurance in the private market.”
5. Adding trillions to the deficit
Multiple members of the Trump administration have claimed that the bill would not add to the federal debt.
“The One Big Beautiful Bill ... helps get our fiscal house in order by carrying out the largest deficit reduction in nearly 30 years with $1.6 trillion in mandatory savings,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a news conference last month.
“The bill REDUCES deficits by $1.4 trillion over ten years,” Vought insisted Wednesday on X. “If you care about deficits and debt, this bill dramatically improves the fiscal picture.”
It can be tricky to project forward when it comes to fiscal matters, but it’s worth noting that pretty much every expert disagrees with Vought and Leavitt. By extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts, Trump’s bill would add $3.8 trillion in spending over the next decade; new investments in the border and the military would pile another $400 billion on top of that sum.
On the other side of the ledger are spending cuts totaling $1.8 trillion, according to the CBO.
That leaves a $2.4 trillion gap — otherwise known as debt.
Trump’s allies argue that the CBO isn’t making the right “baseline” assumptions about policy and revenue; some claim Trump’s tariffs will raise trillions of dollars to offset deficits, or that tax cuts will pay for themselves by spurring economic growth.
But the CBO isn’t alone in its approach. According to the New York Times, “the Budget Lab at Yale ... found the Republican proposal could add $2.4 trillion to the debt by 2034. The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated it would raise deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period. And the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit public policy organization that supports deficit reduction, pegged the uncovered cost at $3.3 trillion over the next nine years.”
“Not sure what shoddy assumptions someone is seeing, but advocates who claim this bill will improve the fiscal situation are completely at odds with all serious outside experts who conclude it would increase borrowing by trillions,” CRFB president Maya MacGuineas told the Times.
Musk, for one, seems to agree with the scorekeepers.
The bill “will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt,” he wrote earlier this week on X. “This immense level of overspending will drive America into debt slavery!”
The bill would also raise America’s debt ceiling from $36 trillion to $40 trillion. On Wednesday, Trump called for scrapping the debt ceiling altogether.",Yahoo News,"['compliance', 'oversight', 'deportation', 'temporary restraining order']","['Trump', 'House', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Senate', 'Congress', 'Trump', 'Georgia', 'Marjorie Taylor Greene', 'Nebraska', 'Mike Flood', 'Elon Musk', 'Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency', 'DOGE', 'X.', 'House', 'Congressional Budget Office', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'House', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'the New York Times', 'Flood', 'Senate', 'Washington', 'AI', 'U.S.', 'House', 'Greene', 'X.', 'AI', 'Senate', 'AI', 'Greene', 'the New York Times', 'House', 'Carolyn Vega', 'House', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid', 'House', 'Mike Johnson', 'CNN', 'Jake', 'Medicaid', 'U.S.', 'Russell Vought', 'Trump', 'the Office of Management and Budget', 'Trump & Co.', 'CBO', 'Medicaid', '$793 billion', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid', 'CBO', 'CBO', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Josh Hawley', 'Missouri', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid', 'Hawley', 'CNN', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid', 'Trump', 'The One Big Beautiful Bill', '$1.6 trillion', 'White House', 'Karoline Leavitt', '$1.4 trillion', 'X.', 'Vought', 'Leavitt', 'Trump', '$3.8 trillion', '$400 billion', '$1.8 trillion', 'CBO', '$2.4 trillion', 'Trump', 'CBO', 'Trump', 'trillions of dollars', 'CBO', 'the New York Times', 'Yale', '$2.4 trillion', 'The Penn Wharton Budget Model', '$2.8 trillion', 'the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget', '$3.3 trillion', 'Maya MacGuineas', 'Times', '$2.5 trillion', 'America', 'America', 'America', '$36 trillion to $40 trillion', 'Trump']",Economic Downturn,2

The eight deportees and 13 Ice staff have begun to “feel ill”, the US government said.
Eight men, from Latin America, Asia and South Sudan, and the Ice staff have been stuck at a US naval base since late May. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that the Ice officers began to fall ill “within 72 hours of landing” in Djibouti, and continue to suffer from suspected bacterial upper respiratory infections.
The Trump administration had attempted to send the eight detainees, who it said had been convicted of criminal offenses, to South Sudan, but a judge intervened to stop their flight in May, arguing that they were entitled to challenge the deportation in the courts.
Mellissa Harper, a top official at the DHS and Ice, said in a court declaration that the detainees are being held in a shipping container that was previously converted into a conference room. The Ice officers are “sharing very limited sleeping quarters”, Harper said, with only six beds between 13 people.
In the declaration, Harper said burn pits in Djibouti have led to Ice officials experiencing “throat irritation”. She said the outside temperature frequently exceeds 100F (38C) in the daytime, and said Ice officials were at risk of malaria because they did not take anti-malaria medication before arriving in Djibouti.
“Within 72 hours of landing in Djibouti, the officers and detainees began to feel ill,” Harper said, but they were unable to obtain proper testing for a diagnosis.
Harper added: “Upon arrival in Djibouti, officers were warned by US Department of Defense officials of imminent danger of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen. The Ice officers lack body armor or other gear that would be appropriate in the case of an attack.”
The declaration detailed the conditions that the detainees face, including only being allowed to shower once a day, and being subjected to “pat-downs and searches” during trips to the restroom, which is 40 yards from the shipping container where they are being held. Harper said there is limited lighting in the area, “which makes visibility difficult and creates a significant security risk for both the officers and aliens”.
The Trump administration had attempted to send the eight men to their home countries of Myanmar, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Mexico and South Sudan. Those countries declined to accept them, however, and US authorities then arranged to fly them to South Sudan in late May.
Brian Murphy, a US district judge in Boston, intervened, ruling that the administration had “unquestionably” violated his earlier order, issued in April, which ruled that anyone facing deportation to third-party countries had the right to challenge it legally.",The Guardian,"['department of homeland security', 'deportation']","['US', 'Djibouti', 'the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement', 'US', 'US', 'The Department of Homeland Security', 'DHS', 'Djibouti', 'Trump', 'Mellissa Harper', 'DHS', 'Harper', 'Harper', 'Djibouti', 'Djibouti', 'Djibouti', 'Harper', 'Djibouti', 'US Department of Defense', 'Yemen', 'Trump', 'Myanmar', 'Cuba', 'Vietnam', 'Laos', 'Mexico', 'South Sudan', 'US', 'Brian Murphy', 'US', 'Boston']",Immigration updates,1

A man who investigators say was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people” when he threw Molotov cocktails at demonstrators in Colorado raising awareness of Israeli hostages is set to make his first federal court appearance
DENVER -- A man who told investigators he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people” when he threw Molotov cocktails at demonstrators raising awareness of Israeli hostages is set to make his first appearance in federal court on Friday to face a hate crime charge.
Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is accused in Sunday's attack on the weekly event in Boulder, which investigators say he planned for a year. The federal case is being adjudicated in Denver, but Soliman was also charged in state court in Boulder Thursday with attempted murder and assault counts as well as counts related to the 18 Molotov cocktails police say he carried to the demonstration.
Federal authorities say Soliman, an Egyptian national, has been living in the U.S. illegally.
Soliman is represented by state and federal public defenders, who do not comment on their cases to the media.
Investigators say Soliman told them he had intended to kill all of the roughly 20 participants at the weekly demonstration on Boulder's popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, but he threw just two of his 18 Molotov cocktails while yelling “Free Palestine.” Soliman told investigators he tried to buy a gun but was not able to because he was not a “legal citizen.”
Soliman did not carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” police wrote in an arrest affidavit.
State prosecutors say 15 people and a dog were victims of the attack. Not all were physically injured, and some are considered victims for the legal case because they were in the area and could potentially have been hurt, 20th Judicial District Michael Dougherty said Thursday.
The dog was among the injured, which resulted in an animal cruelty charge being filed against Soliman, Dougherty said.
Soliman told investigators that he waited until after his daughter graduated from school before launching the attack, according to court documents.
Federal authorities want to deport Soliman's wife and their five children, who range from 4 to 17 years old, but a judge issued an emergency order Wednesday halting deportation proceedings until a lawsuit challenging their deportation can be considered.
U.S. immigration officials took Soliman's wife and children into custody on Tuesday.

The State Department has instructed U.S. embassies and consulates not to revoke visas previously issued to people from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries now under President Donald Trump’s new travel ban, which goes into effect next week
WASHINGTON -- The State Department instructed U.S. embassies and consulates on Friday not to revoke visas previously issued to people from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries now under President Donald Trump’s new travel ban, which goes into effect next week.
In a cable sent to all U.S. diplomatic missions, the department said “no action should be taken for issued visas which have already left the consular section” and that “no visas issued prior to the effective date should be revoked pursuant to this proclamation.”
However, visa applicants from affected countries whose applications have been approved but have not yet received their visas will be denied, according to the cable, which was signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
And, unless an applicant meets narrow criteria for an exemption to the ban, his or her application will be rejected starting on Monday.
Still, the cable, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, suggests there should be no issue for current visa holders from the affected countries entering the United States after the restrictions take effect on June 9 at midnight ET.
During Trump’s first term, a hastily written executive order ordering the denial of entry to citizens of mainly Muslim countries created chaos at numerous airports and other ports of entry, prompting successful legal challenges and major revisions to the policy.
The new proclamation, which Trump signed on Wednesday, appears designed to beat any court challenge by focusing on the visa application process.
Rubio’s cable says the only people who should be denied entry into the U.S. are those currently outside the United States who do not have a valid visa on the effective date.
Despite Rubio's cable, physically entering the United States at a port of entry is not controlled by the State Department. It is up to the Department of Homeland Security and the discretion of individual Customs and Border Patrol agents to determine if a visa holder is admitted or turned away.
The visa ban applies to people from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other visa restrictions will apply to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
Some exceptions apply only for specific countries, like Afghanistan. Others are for most of the countries on the list, or are more general and unclear, like the policies for foreign visitors planning to come to the U.S. for the 2026 Word Cup and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, two of the events Trump has said he is excited to host.

Abrego Garcia back in US to face charges of helping traffic 'thousands' of migrants,https://www.yahoo.com/news/kilmar-abrego-garcia-way-back-185850961.html,2025-06-06T20:53:00Z,,"Abrego Garcia back in US to face charges of helping traffic 'thousands' of migrants
Mistakenly deported Salvadoran native Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been brought back to the United States where he will face criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S.
More than two months after the Trump administration admitted it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia from Maryland to his native El Salvador, a federal grand jury has indicted him for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the United States.
A two-count indictment, which was filed under seal in federal court in Tennessee last month and unsealed Friday, alleges Abrego Garcia, 29, participated in a yearslong conspiracy to haul undocumented migrants from Texas to the interior of the country.
MORE: Justice Department investigating 2022 Abrego Garcia traffic stop: Sources
The alleged conspiracy spanned nearly a decade and involved the domestic transport of thousands of noncitizens from Mexico and Central America, including some children, in exchange for thousands of dollars, according to the indictment.
Abrego-Garcia is alleged to have participated in more than 100 such trips, according to the indictment. Among those allegedly transported were members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13, sources familiar with the investigation said.
Abrego-Garcia is the only member of the alleged conspiracy charged in the indictment.
His return to the U.S. comes after the Trump administration repeatedly said that they were unable to bring him back despite his mistaken deportation.
Attorney General Pam Bondi, at a Friday afternoon press conference, thanked Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele for ""agreeing to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.""
""Our government presented El Salvador with an arrest warrant and they agreed to return him to our country,"" Bondi said.
Bondi said that if Abrego Garcia is convicted of the charges, upon the completion of his sentence he will be deported back to his home country of El Salvador.
""The grand jury found that over the past nine years, Abrego Garcia has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring,"" Bondi said. ""They found this was his full time job, not a contractor. He was a smuggler of humans and children and women. He made over 100 trips, the grand jury found, smuggling people throughout our country.""
More in U.S.
The decision to pursue the indictment against Abrego Garcia led to the abrupt departure of Ben Schrader, a high-ranking federal prosecutor in Tennessee, sources briefed on Schrader’s decision told ABC News. Schrader’s resignation was prompted by concerns that the case was being pursued for political reasons, the sources said.
Schrader, who spent 15 years in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Nashville and was most recently the chief of the criminal division, declined to comment when contacted by ABC News.
In a statement to ABC News, Abrego Garcia's attorney said that he's going to keep fighting to ensure Abrego Garcia receives a fair trial.
""From the beginning, this case has made one thing painfully clear: The government had the power to bring him back at any time. Instead, they chose to play games with the court and with a man's life,"" said attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg. ""We're not just fighting for Kilmar -- we're fighting to ensure due process rights are protected for everyone. Because tomorrow, this could be any one of us -- if we let power go unchecked, if we ignore our Constitution.""
In a detention memo filed Friday afternoon in court in Tennessee, federal prosecutors moved to have Abrego Garcia held in pretrial custody ""because he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight, and no condition or combination of conditions would ensure the safety of the community or his appearance in court.""
Federal prosecutors, in a detention memo filed this afternoon in court in Tennessee, have moved for pre-trial detention of Abrego Garcia, writing that ""…the United States will request that the defendant be held in pretrial custody because he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight, and no condition or combination of conditions would ensure the safety of the community or his appearance in court.""
""If convicted at trial, the defendant faces a maximum punishment of 10 years' imprisonment for 'each alien' he transported,"" the memo said, ""Accordingly, the sentencing exposure for the defendant -- given the number of undocumented aliens involved -- goes well beyond the remainder of the defendant's life.""
MORE: Timeline: Wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador
Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who had been living with his wife and children in Maryland, was deported in March to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13. His wife and attorneys deny that he is an MS-13 member.
The Justice Department's move to criminally prosecute Abrego Garcia represents the most aggressive step yet in the administration's efforts to gather potentially incriminating information about Abrego Garcia's background, following a federal judge's order requiring the government to facilitate his return to the U.S. to be afforded due process in deportation proceedings.
The Trump administration has acknowledged in court filings that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador in March was in error, because it violated a U.S. immigration court order in 2019 that shielded Abrego Garcia from deportation to his native country, according to immigration court records. An immigration judge had determined that Abrego Garcia would likely face persecution there by local gangs that had allegedly terrorized him and his family.
The administration argued, however, that Abrego Garcia should not be returned to the U.S. because he is a member of the transnational Salvadoran gang MS-13, a claim his family and attorneys have denied. In recent weeks, Trump administration officials have been publicizing Abrego Garcia's interactions with police over the years, despite a lack of corresponding criminal charges.
In March, Abrego Garcia's family filed a lawsuit over his deportation. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ultimately ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that ruling on April 10.
Abrego Garcia was initially sent to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison but was believed to have later been transferred to a different facility in the country.
The criminal investigation that led to the charges was launched in April as federal authorities began scrutinizing the circumstances of a 2022 traffic stop of Abrego Garcia by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, according to the sources. Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding in a vehicle with eight passengers and told police they had been working construction in Missouri.
According to body camera footage of the 2022 traffic stop, the Tennessee troopers -- after questioning Abrego Garcia -- discussed among themselves their suspicions that Abrego Garcia might be transporting people for money because nine people were traveling without luggage, but Abrego Garcia was not ticketed or charged.
The officers ultimately allowed Abrego Garcia to drive on with just a warning about an expired driver's license, according to a report about the stop released last month by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Asked what circumstances have changed since Abrego Garcia was not taken in custody during that traffic stop in Tennessee, Bondi replied, ""What has changed is Donald Trump is now president of the United States, and our borders are again secure, and thanks to the bright light that has been shined on Abrego Garcia -- this investigation continued with actually amazing police work, and we were able to track this case and stop this international smuggling ring from continuing.""
Asked by ABC News' Pierre Thomas asked whether this should be seen as resolving the separate civil case in Maryland in which a federal judge ordered the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said, ""There's a big difference between what the state of play was before the indictment and after the indictment. And so the reason why he is back and was returned was because an arrest warrant which was presented to the government and in El Salvador. So there's, there's a big difference there as far as whether it makes the ongoing litigation in Maryland moot. I would think so, but we don't know about this. He just landed today.""
As ABC News first reported last month, the Justice Department had been quietly investigating the Tenessee traffic stop. As part of the probe, federal agents in late April visited a federal prison in Talladega, Alabama to question Jose Ramon Hernandez-Reyes, a convicted felon who was the registered owner of the vehicle Abrego Garcia was driving when stopped on Interstate 40 east of Nashville, sources previously told ABC News. Hernandez-Reyes was not present at the traffic stop.
Hernandez-Reyes, 38, is currently serving a 30-month sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a prior felony conviction for illegal transportation of aliens.
After being granted limited immunity, Hernandez-Reyes allegedly told investigators that he previously operated a ""taxi service"" based in Baltimore. He claimed to have met Abrego Garcia around 2015 and claimed to have hired him on multiple occasions to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to various locations in the United States, sources told ABC News.
MORE: Newly released video shows Abrego Garcia's 2022 Tennessee traffic stop
When details of the Tennessee traffic stop were first publicized, Abrego Garcia's wife said her husband sometimes transported groups of fellow construction workers between job sites.
""Unfortunately, Kilmar is currently imprisoned without contact with the outside world, which means he cannot respond to the claims,"" Jennifer Vasquez Sura said in mid-April.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who flew to El Salvador and met with Abrego Garcia shortly after his deportation, said Friday that the Trump administration had ""relented"" regarding his return.
""After months of ignoring our Constitution, it seems the Trump Admin has relented to our demands for compliance with court orders and due process for Kilmar Abrego Garcia,"" Van Hollen posted on X. ""This has never been about the man -- it's about his constitutional rights & the rights of all.""
Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2012, according to court records. He had been living in Maryland for the past 13 years, and married Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen, in 2019. The couple has one child together.

Fear and anger ripple through countries targeted by Trump's travel ban,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-travel-ban-sparks-confusion-affected-families-rcna211169,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:10:28 GMT","The travel ban goes into effect on Monday, leaving many to fear a future in which they can't visit family or loved ones are unable to escape dire circumstances in their home countries.","Anger and condemnation broke out as families, attorneys and immigrant advocates absorbed the blast from the latest bombshell delivered by the Trump administration — a travel ban that stops or restricts people from 19 mostly African, Asian and Caribbean countries from entering the U.S.
While the Trump administration said the travel ban is meant to keep Americans safe, critics lobbed accusations of discrimination, cruelty, racism, inhumanity and more in response. Meanwhile, the news also elicited confusion over what will happen once the ban goes into effect on Monday.
""This travel ban is a racist, bigoted and xenophobic and deeply un-American attack on human rights — it’s like persecution. We have fled dictatorship, violence, hunger,” Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, told NBC News from Miami, a city with a large population of immigrants from several of the countries on Trump’s list.
“This administration clearly has something against immigrants, and it has something against us in particular,” said José Antonio Colina, a former Venezuelan army lieutenant who fled to Miami in 2003 and heads the exile organization Veppex. “We are double-persecuted. We are persecuted by the tyranny of Nicolás Maduro and we are persecuted by the administration of Donald Trump.”
A 38-year-old Haitian green-card holder in Miami who was too fearful to allow her name to be used said she and many others in the community feel “confused and scared” over the travel ban on Haiti. She said most of her family lives there, including her sister and father, who is sick. “They come all the time to visit and now I don’t know if they will be able to,” she said, adding she heard there were exceptions to the ban but wasn't sure.
There are some exceptions, including for people with lawful permanent residency, spouses and children of U.S. citizens, those who are adopted and others.
“But if you are a spouse of a permanent resident, forget about it,” said Doug Rand, former senior adviser of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration. It will also affect other relatives, such as adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens, people who won the diversity lottery or people who were sponsored by U.S. employers and are from the listed countries, “people who have been waiting for years and done it the right way,” he said.
In Havana, a queue of people outside the U.S. Embassy learned the news of the travel ban and suspensions as they waited for their visa interviews.
“I had been waiting nine years for this moment,” said one young woman in line, who declined to be identified by name for fear it might affect her visa chances. She and others said the suspension means not being able to visit family or escape dire circumstances in Cuba.
“If they don’t grant visas, Cubans will starve, given the situation, they will starve,” said Ismael Gainza, a retired Cuban. “I see that measure as bad, I see it as bad because the situation is tough and we have to survive.”
Trump’s proclamation issued Wednesday night bans nationals from 12 countries from traveling to the U.S. The countries are: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
In seven more countries, travel to the U.S. was suspended but not banned. They are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
Shahzeen Karim, managing attorney at Hafey & Karim law firm, said that although she's in the immigration law space, she holds “Republican views” on the topic, agreeing there's a need for a stricter immigration policy and more thorough screening.
“I know the White House presented some explanations as to why each of those countries, but I can’t help but feel very targeted, being a Muslim immigration attorney,” Karim said. “The countries are majority Muslim, unfortunately.”
Challenging the ban could be 'an uphill battle'
Immigration advocates said that, unlike Trump's previous travel ban, which caught them off guard, they expected the president would enact a similar policy in his second term. Trump’s 2017 ban immediately barred Muslims from entering the country, leaving some stranded at airports or unable to board flights.
But like his previous ban, the impact of the current ban taking effect next week will be felt by people trying to bring together families, those who landed a job in the U.S., who had tours or visits planned, who planned to study here or were looking forward to a cultural exchange.
It took three tries for Trump, in his previous administration, to come up with a travel ban that the U.S. Supreme Court would accept. Lower courts nixed the first version, and the administration kept revising it until the high court accepted its third version in June 2018. Immigration and civil rights groups opposed all three versions.
Raha Wala, vice president of strategy and partnerships at the National Immigration Law Center, said that challenging the latest ban “will be an uphill battle” because the Supreme Court decision is the law of the land.
Edward Cuccia, an immigration attorney in New York City, said that blocking the latest ban could be tougher now than in 2017.
“Trump got smarter this time,” he said, explaining that the mix of countries makes it harder to argue that the ban is discriminatory.
Also, the implementation won't be as abrupt, and the argument that the singled-out countries do not vet the documents of their nationals well may hold up in court, according to Cuccia.
Even so, the implications are vast for the people who are affected and are not a security threat, he said.
“What is this going to mean for family unification? There’s a lot of countries here!” Cuccia said. “And then, there are people that maybe had business dealings, people who wanted to do investments here in the United States or come over on temporary work visas, student visas or even just to visit. … That seems to be gone out the window.”
Wala called the justification for the ban — that visa overstays present a national security threat and the inability to fully vet visa travelers in those countries — a “fig leaf.”
If there is a gap in vetting, “that’s worth taking a look at,” he said, but he added that “all kinds of people overstay their visas — and just because someone overstayed their visa and committed a crime, we just have to get away from this guilt by association concept.”
For Wala, the newly announced ban cannot be separated from the president's previous policies and statements.
""This ban started as the president saying he was going to have a complete and total shutdown of Muslims in the country. And he also said he wants to ban folks — and pardon my French here — from s---hole countries,"" Wala said.
In Miami, Colina said he was glad the ban would prevent officials of Maduro’s regime in Venezuela and their families ""who always find a way"" to get a visa to enter the country, ""but they are a minority, and the partial ban will negatively impact the larger community and it’s not fair.”",NBC News,"['civil rights', 'discrimination', 'student visa', 'visa']","['Trump', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'Adelys Ferro', 'the Venezuelan American Caucus', 'NBC News', 'Miami', 'Trump', 'José Antonio Colina', 'Miami', 'Veppex', 'Nicolás Maduro', 'Donald Trump', 'Miami', 'Haiti', 'U.S.', 'Doug Rand', 'U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services', 'Biden', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Havana', 'Cuba', 'Ismael Gainza', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'Myanmar', 'Chad', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'Eritrea', 'Haiti', 'Iran', 'Libya', 'Somalia', 'Sudan', 'Yemen', 'U.S.', 'Burundi', 'Cuba', 'Laos', 'Sierra Leone', 'Togo', 'Turkmenistan', 'Venezuela', 'Shahzeen Karim', 'Hafey & Karim', 'the White House', 'Karim', 'Trump', 'Trump’s 2017', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'the U.S. Supreme Court', 'Raha Wala', 'the National Immigration Law Center', 'Supreme Court', 'Edward Cuccia', 'New York City', 'Cuccia', 'Cuccia', 'the United States', 'Wala', 'fig', 'Wala', 'Wala', 'Miami', 'Maduro', 'Venezuela']",Immigration updates,1

The justices, in a unanimous ruling, overturned a lower court’s decision that had allowed the lawsuit to proceed against the firearms maker Smith & Wesson and distributor Interstate Arms. The lower court had found that Mexico plausibly alleged that the companies aided and abetted illegal gun sales, harming its government.
The companies had argued for the dismissal of Mexico’s suit, filed in Boston in 2021, under a 2005 US law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that broadly shields gun companies from liability for crimes committed with their products. The Boston-based first circuit court of appeals decided in 2024 that the alleged conduct by the companies fell outside these protections.
“Mexico alleges that the companies aided and abetted unlawful sales routing guns to Mexican drug cartels. The question presented is whether Mexico’s complaint plausibly pleads that conduct. We conclude it does not,” the liberal justice Elena Kagan wrote for the supreme court on Thursday morning.
The case came to the supreme court at a complicated time for US-Mexican relations as Donald Trump pursues on-again, off-again tariffs on Mexican goods imported into the US. Trump has also accused Mexico of doing too little to stop the flow of synthetic drugs such as the opioid fentanyl and migrant arrivals at the border, even though Mexico has stepped up efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the border in recent years.
Mexico had claimed that the companies have deliberately maintained a distribution system that included firearms dealers who knowingly sell weapons to third-party, or “straw”, purchasers who then traffic guns to cartels in Mexico.
The suit also accused the companies of unlawfully designing and marketing their guns as military-grade weapons to drive up demand among the cartels.
Mexico in the lawsuit sought monetary damages of an unspecified amount and a court order requiring Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms to take steps to “abate and remedy the public nuisance they have created in Mexico”.

I’ll pass on the movie, but that description seems pretty apt to what living under this Trump administration feels like: a gratuitously more violent sequel to a ghoulish original.
Consider the Muslim ban. Back in late 2015, candidate Donald Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on”. He signed the first version of the Muslim ban on 27 January 2017, and protests erupted at airports across the nation at the revival of a national policy, similar to the Chinese Exclusion Act, that bars entry of whole swaths of people based on our national prejudices. It took the Trump administration three attempts at crafting this policy before the supreme court tragically greenlit it.
While Joe Biden later reversed the policy, congressional moves to restrict the president’s ability to institute these blanket bans – such as the No Ban Act – have not succeeded. And on the first day of his second term, Trump indicated he was prepared to institute a wider-reaching travel ban. He has now done just that. The new executive order will “fully restrict and limit the entry [to the US] of nationals of the following 12 countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen” and will also “partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 7 countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela”.
Yes, there are key cutouts in the latest travel ban that make it a different animal from the original 2017 ban, but it still derives from the same family. Green-card holders, those with valid visas issued before the executive order was proclaimed, and professional athletes representing their countries in the forthcoming World Cup, for example, are exempt, illustrating how the administration has learned to write more litigation-resistant immigration exclusion orders.
But make no mistake. Such a policy is alienating, counterproductive and simply racist. For one thing, Trump claims that the ban is necessary because the selected countries exhibit either “a significant terrorist presence”, a lack of cooperation in accepting back their nationals, or high rates of visa overstays. According to the Entry/Exit Overstay Report for fiscal year 2023 (the last one available), the number of people from Equatorial Guinea, a small African country, who overstayed their B1/B2 visas (travel to the US for business or pleasure) was 200. From the United Kingdom, it was 15,712.
It’s true that the percentage (as opposed to the number) of people overstaying their visas from Equatorial Guinea is significantly higher than UK overstays. But Djibouti, which hosts the primary US military base in for operations in Africa, has an even higher percentage of B1/B2 visa overstayers than Equatorial Guinea – yet it isn’t part of the ban, illustrating how much it is based on narrow political calculations and cheap theatrics.
The capriciousness of the policy was immediately evident after Trump released a video explaining his decision. “The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed for our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstayed their visas,” he said, adding: “We don’t want them.” Yet, as everyone knows, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, attack is an Egyptian national, another key US ally. And Egypt is not on the list.
Nor should it be, because these lists of banned countries collapse individuals into vague categories of suspicion and malfeasance. Why should the actions of one person from any given country mark a completely different person as inadmissible? Trump may sound tough to his supporters when announcing the ban, but such broad-brush applications against basically all the nationals of comparatively powerless countries is hardly the flex that Trump thinks it is. In the eyes of the rest of the world, the new policy mostly makes the administration look like a bully, picking on a handful of Muslim-majority countries, a few African and Asian states, a couple of its traditional enemies, and Haiti.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world also sees how the Trump administration has withdrawn temporary protections from more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and Nicaragua, suspended refugee resettlement from around the world, and yet welcomed in dozens of white Afrikaners from South Africa to the United States as refugees. The ethnocentrism of the policy is as naked as it is opportunistic.
The truth is that the damage from Trump’s first-term Muslim ban was long-lasting and had all kinds of collateral impact, including on the mental health of family members living in the United States. And immigrant advocacy organizations are already sharply criticizing this latest version. AfghanEvac, a non-profit organization that facilitates the resettlement of Afghans who worked with American troops, stated that the new ban “is not about national security – it is about political theater”. To include Afghanistan among the banned countries, even as thousands of Afghans worked alongside American forces, is to Shawn VanDiver, the group’s founder and president, “a moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold.”
Trump’s latest travel ban, his ramped-up immigration deportation regime, his international student crackdown, and his all but ending asylum in the United States add up to a clearly a concerted attempt to stave off the inevitable while vilifying the marginal. Demographers have been telling us for years now that the US will be a “majority minority” country around 2045, a prospect that has long frightened many of the white conservatives who make up Trump’s base. In response, Trump is pursuing a policy that draws on the most basic kind of nativism around, and one we’ve seen before in the United States.
The 1924 Immigration Act severely restricted immigration to the US to keep America as white and as western European as possible. Only in 1965 were the laws finally changed, with the national immigration quotas lifted, laying the foundation for the multicultural society we have today. That earlier movie of epic exclusion lasted some 41 years. So far, this sequel is violent, scary and authoritarian. It had better be a short film.

WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Linda McMahon took heat from Democrats on the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce on Wednesday over the Trump administration’s initiatives to dramatically overhaul the federal role in education and eliminate the Education Department.
Lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request — which includes $12 billion in spending cuts — as well as efforts to dismantle the agency and threats to yank funds for schools that use race-conscious practices across aspects of student life.
A department summary said the cut “reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down.”
Chair Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican, praised McMahon’s efforts.
“We believe in reducing bureaucracy, trusting our educators, trusting our state and local leaders and trusting the innovators who are pushing against the barriers thrown up by the bureaucracy,” he said. “And above all, we trust our parents — this is our vision, and thankfully, we finally have an administration in place that shares this vision.”
But Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the panel, blasted the department’s priorities, including the budget proposal, which he said “would make it more difficult for students to enroll in and afford a college education by proposing reductions in funding to need-based grants such as Pell and work study.”
“At the end of the day, it is the students of this nation who will suffer under this budget proposal,” the Virginia Democrat said. “Students from low-income families and students with disabilities, English learners, international students and students of color will face more hurdles accessing equal educational opportunity.”
The budget calls for eliminating key programs administered by the Education Department for disadvantaged and low-income students, including Federal TRIO Programs and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, or GEAR UP.
The budget request also proposes a $60 million increase to expand the number of charter schools in the country and lowering nearly $1,700 from the maximum amount a student can receive annually through the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college.
A federal judge in Massachusetts in May dealt the administration a major setback to its education agenda, ordering the agency to reinstate the more than 1,300 employees gutted during a reduction in force effort, blocking the department from carrying out Trump’s order to close the department and barring the department from transferring the student loan portfolio and special education services to other federal agencies while the case challenging those policies is ongoing.
A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld the trial judge’s order.
DEI lesson plans
Democrats on Wednesday took aim at the administration’s efforts against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs. The administration had sought to bar schools from using DEI practices across aspects of student life to continue to receive federal funding, an effort that multiple federal judges have blocked.
Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania said the Trump administration “has undoubtedly revived the culture of racism we haven’t seen since the Jim Crow era,” adding that “they’ve made it clear that open attacks on Black and brown and other marginalized communities is not just tolerated, but it’s encouraged.”
Asked by Lee whether a lesson plan on the Tulsa race massacre would be considered “illegal DEI,” McMahon replied: “I’d have to get back to you on that.”
Lee then asked McMahon whether she knew what the Tulsa race massacre was, to which the secretary said: “I’d like to look into it more and get back to you on it.”
McMahon was similarly noncommittal on a question about assigning school desegregation icon Ruby Bridges’ autobiography.
State flexibility
The budget proposal also calls for consolidating 18 grant programs for K-12 education and replacing them with a single formula grant program, which the administration says will give states spending flexibility.
Democrats at Wednesday’s hearing blasted the administration’s push to return education “back to the states,” noting that some states have poor records on education.
Rep. Yassamin Ansari said the education system is “absolutely failing” many students in the United States. The main cause of that, the Arizona Democrat said, was that many states have “woefully underfunded” their public education systems and not, as the administration has claimed, due to “too much” federal oversight or DEI policies.
When asked by Ansari what risk McMahon weighed for public schools and universities if federal education funding is gutted or devolved to the states, the secretary said “federal education wouldn’t necessarily be gutted” and that “there would be more money to go to the states without the bureaucracy of the Department of Education.”
Ansari rejected that claim, noting that some states, including hers, have an “abysmal track record of managing education.” She pointed to Arizona’s low rankings on public education, teacher salaries, test scores and the highest student-to-teacher ratio in the country.

"Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Nears $85B, More Than Doubling in a Year",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corporate-bitcoin-holdings-nears-85b-133422399.html,2025-06-05T13:34:22Z,,"Bitcoin BTC has taken deeper root in corporate treasuries, with 116 public companies now holding a combined 809,100 BTC, worth around $85 billion based on current prices, at the end of May.
That’s a dramatic rise from 312,200 BTC held a year ago in corporate treasuries, according to Binance Research’s latest report. Nearly 100,000 BTC has been added since early April alone.
The surge appears driven by a mix of rising prices and structural tailwinds. Donald Trump adopted a pro-crypto stance during his 2024 presidential campaign, vowing to make the U.S. a global hub for the asset class and create a “crypto capital of the planet.”
Since Trump took office he has moved to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped numerous lawsuits against major crypto firms..
Binance’s report shows that bitcoin treasury accumulation grew in November, when Trump won the election.
Adding to that, new fair-value accounting rules introduced by the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) this year allow companies to recognize gains on BTC holdings, removing a longstanding deterrent.
Newer entrants including GameStop (GME) and PSG have recently started accumulating BTC as a well, yet Strategy still holds the lion’s share of BTC in corporate treasuries, with over 70% of holdings.
Some companies are also tiptoeing into other assets. SharpLink holds $425 million in ETH, while DeFi Development and Classover are betting on solana SOL. China-based firm Webus recently filed for a $300 million XRP strategic reserve.
Still, these altcoin holdings remain relatively small and are often tied to firms trying to rebrand as token-forward entities, Binance noted.

Transgender troops face a deadline and a difficult decision: Stay or go?,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/transgender-troops-face-deadline-difficult-decision-stay-122580396,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 12:30:24 -0400","As transgender service members face a deadline to leave the U.S. military, hundreds are taking the financial bonus to depart voluntarily","Transgender troops face a deadline and a difficult decision: Stay or go?
As transgender service members face a deadline to leave the U.S. military, hundreds are taking the financial bonus to depart voluntarily
WASHINGTON -- As transgender service members face a deadline to leave the U.S. military, hundreds are taking the financial bonus to depart voluntarily. But others say they will stay and fight.
For many, it is a wrenching decision to end a career they love, and leave units they have led or worked with for years. And they are angry they are being forced out by the Trump administration's renewed ban on transgender troops.
Active duty service members had until Friday to identify themselves and begin to leave the military voluntarily, while the National Guard and Reserve have until July 7. Then the military will begin involuntary separations.
Friday's deadline comes during Pride Month and as the Trump administration targets diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying it's aiming to scrub the military of “wokeness” and reestablishing a “warrior ethos.”
“They’re tired of the rollercoaster. They just want to go,” said one transgender service member, who plans to retire. ”It’s exhausting.”
For others, it's a call to arms.
“I’m choosing to stay in and fight,” a noncommissioned officer in the Air Force said. “My service is based on merit, and I’ve earned that merit.”
The troops, who mainly spoke on condition of anonymity because they fear reprisals, said being forced to decide is frustrating. They say it's a personal choice based on individual and family situations, including whether they would get an infusion of cash or possibly wind up owing the government money.
“I'm very disappointed,” a transgender Marine said. “I've outperformed, I have a spotless record. I'm at the top of every fitness report. I'm being pushed out while I know others are barely scraping by.”
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said this is President Donald Trump’s directive and what America voted for. The Pentagon, he said, is “leaving wokeness & weakness behind” and that includes “no more dudes in dresses.”
Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a veteran, and 22 other Democratic senators have written to Hegseth urging him to allow transgender troops to keep serving honorably.
Already, more than 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and are slated to begin leaving, according to rough Defense Department estimates. Defense officials say there are about 4,240 active duty transgender troops but acknowledge the numbers are fuzzy.
For many, the decision is financial.
Those who voluntarily leave will get double the amount of separation pay they would normally receive and won't have to return bonuses or tuition costs. Those who refuse to go could be forced to repay reenlistment or other bonuses as high as $50,000.
That was the tipping point for Roni Ferrell, an Army specialist at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington.
Ferrell, 28, lives on base with her wife and two children and had planned to stay in the Army for at least another decade. But she said she felt “backed into a corner” to sign the voluntary separation agreement, fearing she would have to repay an $18,500 reenlistment bonus.
“My commander basically said it was my only option in order to make sure my kids are taken care of,” Ferrell said.
The Marine, who has served for more than 25 years, said she had planned to stay and fight, but changed her mind. Lawyers, she said, told her an involuntary separation would put a code in her record saying she was forced to leave “in the interests of national security.”
That designation, she said, could mean those involuntarily separated could lose their security clearances, hurting future job prospects.
In a statement Friday, a defense official said the code “is not intended” to trigger clearance revocations and that gender dysphoria is not a security reporting requirement, according to the director of national intelligence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Cynthia Cheng-Wun Weaver, senior director of litigation for Human Rights Campaign, said it’s important for troops to talk with judge advocates general in their services to ensure they understand the different procedures being implemented.
The Air Force service member and a transgender officer in the Army National Guard both said they plan to stay and fight. Lawsuits over the ban continue and could change or block the policy.
For troops involved in the court battles as plaintiffs, leaving voluntarily now would likely hurt their standing in the case. For others, it's simply dedication to their career.
“I’ve really embraced military culture, and it’s embraced me,” the Air Force member said. “It’s not about money. It’s the career that I love.”
The Guard soldier echoed that sentiment, saying he will stay on ""because it is important to me to serve. Frankly, I’m good at it, I’m well trained so I want to continue.”
Others without bonuses to repay or who have been in the military only a short while and won't get much in separation bonus pay may opt to stay and see what happens.
National Guard members who are heading to their monthly drill weekend or annual two-week drill in June could be required to go but serve as the gender they were assigned at birth.
That means they would have to wear uniforms and haircuts of that gender, use that bathroom and be referred to as “sir” or “ma'am” based on that gender.
For many, that could be close to impossible and create uncomfortable situations.
“If I were to show up to drill this weekend, I’d be expected to use all female facilities, I would be expected to wear a woman’s uniform,” said the Army Guard officer, who transitioned to male about five years ago and says others in his unit know him as a man. “I don’t look like a woman. I don’t feel like a woman. It would be disruptive to good order and discipline for me to show up and to tell my soldiers, you have to call me ‘ma’am’ now.”
It's not clear if Guard units are handling it all the same way, and it could be up to individual states or commanders. Some may allow troops to postpone the drill or go on administrative leave.
The service members interviewed by The Associated Press said they don’t know what will happen once the deadline passes to leave voluntarily.
Some believe that unit commanders will quickly single people out and start involuntary separations. Others say the process is vague, may involve medical review boards and could take months.
The defense official said Friday that as the Pentagon takes these steps, it “will treat our service members with dignity and respect.”
Under Hegseth’s directive, military commanders will be told to identify troops with gender dysphoria — when a person’s biological sex does not match their gender identity — and send them to get medical checks to force them out of the service, defense officials have said. The order relies on routine annual health checks — so it could be months before that evaluation is scheduled.
“My real big sticking point is that this administration's whole push is to reform this country based around merit, and that gender, race, etc., should have no factor in hiring,” the Air Force service member said. “If that’s true, I’m solely being removed for my gender, and merit is no longer a factor.”

Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html,"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 14:29:52 GMT",Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis.,"Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears.
Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.
Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts.
That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.
However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year.
The effect of smaller tax returns
Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say.
“March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN.
Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth.
Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report.
A slowing labor market
Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month.
Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute.
“The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said.
Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported.
The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then.
The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April.
“On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release.
“Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 21:13:04 GMT","When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds.","When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds.
As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited.
SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color.
Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.”
Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States.
Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital.
SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors.
“When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors.
Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding.
Many women and people of color say they are turned away
Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.
In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows.
“We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN.
Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said.
Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them.
“The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said.
Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank.
In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her.
“The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said.
None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.
Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country.
Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities.
The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks.
Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks.
OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets.
SVB’s collapse could spark future change, entrepreneur says
Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders.
“I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN.
Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase.
But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’”",CNN,"['discrimination', 'diversity, equity, and inclusion']","['Silicon Valley Bank', 'billions of dollars', 'Arlan Hamilton', 'Hamilton', 'SVB', 'Hamilton', 'Backstage Capital', 'California', 'America', 'SVB', 'the United States', 'Hamilton', 'CNN', 'Hamilton', 'State of Black Venture Report', 'BLK VC', 'SVB', 'Joynicole Martinez', 'Rising Tide Capital', 'Martinez', 'the Forbes Coaches Council', 'SVB', 'the Small Business Credit Survey', 'Federal Reserve', 'Martinez', 'CNN', 'Asya Bradley', 'Kinley', 'SVB', 'Bradley', 'WhatsApp', 'Social Security', 'the United States', 'Bradley', 'SVB', 'Bradley', 'SVB', 'Bradley', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Bank of America', 'Wells Fargo', 'Citibank', 'Bradley', 'SVB', 'Bradley', 'CNN', 'The Financial Services Forum', 'the United States', 'millions of dollars', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Jamie Dimon', 'CNN', '$30 billion', 'Black and Brown', 'Wells Fargo', '2022 Diversity, Equity', 'Inclusion', 'the Black Economic Alliance', 'the Black Entrepreneur Fund', '$50 million', 'Black', 'Wells Fargo', '$50 million', 'OneUnited Bank', 'the United States', 'JPMorgan Chase', '$3.7 trillion', 'SVB', 'Hamilton', 'White', 'Backstage Capital', 'Hamilton', 'CNN', 'Backstage Capital', 'Crunchbase', 'Bradley', 'SVB']",Student and Employee Health & Safety; Discrimination updates,3

Geoff Bennett: Another issue being discussed at the White House today, the war in Ukraine. During their meeting in the Oval Office, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged President Trump to increase pressure on Russia. But Mr. Trump made no such commitments and instead compared Ukraine and Russia to two fighting children who need to work out their differences.Nick Schifrin reports. Nick Schifrin: Today, in the Oval Office, an attempt to tie the U.S. to Europe by family. Friedrich Merz, German Chancellor: This is the birth certificate of Donald Trump's grandfather, born in 1869 close to Bad Duerkheim. Nick Schifrin: The U.S. support of Western Europe against the Nazis as a reason for the U.S. to side with Ukraine. Friedrich Merz: May I remind you that we are having June 6 tomorrow? This is D-Day anniversary, when the Americans once ended a war in Europe.Donald Trump, President of the United States: That was not a pleasant day for you? Friedrich Merz: No, that was not a pleasant…(Crosstalk) Donald Trump: This was not a… Friedrich Merz: This was the liberation of my country from Nazi dictatorship. Donald Trump: That's true. Friedrich Merz: America is again in a very strong position to do something on this war and ending this war. We are looking for more pressure on Russia. Nick Schifrin: But more than three years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Trump today suggested the war should maybe continue. Donald Trump: Sometimes, you see two young children fighting like crazy. They hate each other and they're fighting in a park. And you try and pull them apart. They don't want to be pulled. Sometimes, you're better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart. There's some additional fighting that's going to go on. Nick Schifrin: President Trump also said he hadn't read a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal that would impose sanctions on Russia and its trading partners, and any future sanctions could be Imposed both on Russia and Ukraine. Donald Trump: When I see the moment where it's not going to stop, and I'm sure you're going to do the same thing, we will be very, very, very tough. And it could be on both countries, to be honest. Nick Schifrin: Merz became chancellor of a center-right coalition last month. He's promised to help Ukraine build its own weapons and increase Germany's defense spending to 5 percent of gross domestic product.That's the same goal NATO defense ministers negotiated today in Brussels to spend 3.5 percent on defense, plus 1.5 percent on infrastructure. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said NATO members had no choice. Pete Hegseth, U.S. Defense Secretary: We're here to continue the work that President Trump started, which is a commitment to 5 percent defense spending across this alliance, which we think will happen, we think has to happen, by the summit at The Hague later this month. Nick Schifrin: But not all of NATO's 32 countries are on board. Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles. Margarita Robles, Spanish Defense Minister: We think we are able to accomplish these capability targets for Spain with the 2 percent of GDP. Nick Schifrin: U.S. officials say those plans endorsed today born from estimates that Russia is rebuilding its defense industrial base for war beyond Ukraine. NATO hopes to be able to deploy 300,000 troops to Eastern Europe within six months should Russia attack.The U.S. currently has 80,000 troops based in Europe and could reduce that number, Hegseth hinted today. Pete Hegseth: So, there are reasons why we have troops in certain places and we respect and understand that. It's also prudent that we review that force posture in real time alongside our allies and partners to make sure it's right-sized. Nick Schifrin: But NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte expressed confidence in the U.S.' European presence, given the threat posed by Russia. Mark Rutte, NATO Secretary-General: We all know we will be safe for the next couple of years, but then we need to use those years to learn Russian if we don't do this. Nick Schifrin: Today, it is only Ukraine preventing Russia's advance. A defense official tells ""PBS News Hour"" this weekend's attack by Ukrainian drones destroyed about a dozen Russian bombers and damaged about a dozen more. That's less than Ukraine's public estimate.In their phone call yesterday, President Trump warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to respond. Donald Trump: I said, don't do it. You shouldn't do it. You should stop it. But, again, there's a lot of hatred. Nick Schifrin: Merz hoped to convince President Trump today to pressure Russia. But, in Trump's words, the children will continue to tussle.For the ""PBS News Hour,"" I'm Nick Schifrin.

Prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong has been charged with conspiracy to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security under a Beijing-imposed law that critics say has crushed Hong Kong's once-thriving pro-democracy movement
HONG KONG -- Prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong on Friday was charged with conspiracy to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security under a Beijing-imposed law that critics say has crushed Hong Kong's once-thriving pro-democracy movement.
The prosecution was the second time Wong has been charged under the sweeping national security law. He was already convicted in a separate subversion case linked to an unofficial primary election and is serving a sentence of four years and eight months.
The prosecution accused Wong, 28, of conspiring with fellow activist Nathan Law and others to ask foreign countries, institutions, organizations and individuals outside of China to impose sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile actions, against Hong Kong and China.
They also said he disrupted the formulation and implementation of laws and policies by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments, and that the act was likely to have serious consequences. The alleged offense occurred between July 2020 and November 2020.
The prosecution didn't elaborate on the accusations in court. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
After hearing the charge in court, Wong, who wore a blue shirt and was visibly thinner, said he “understood” the charge.
The case was adjourned to August.
National security police arrested Wong in Stanley, an area in southern Hong Kong, over the national security charge and also on suspicion of “dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offense,"" police said in a statement.
Wong rose to fame in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city’s schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement.
In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named “Demosisto” with fellow young activists Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong’s independence who “begged for interference” by foreign forces.
Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020.

WASHINGTON — A federal judge in the District of Columbia on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to allow Venezuelan men removed under an 18th-century wartime law and sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador to have their cases heard in court, though he conceded the logistics of the order would be challenging to sort out.
In a 69-page order, Judge James Boasberg partially granted an injunction to require 137 Venezuelans be given due process. He ruled that they had no chance to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, or the accusation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang.
The Trump administration will have until June 11 to put forth a plan for the men removed under the wartime law and sent to the mega-prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, to be afforded their due process rights.
“The Government has violated the CECOT Class’s vested right to due process, an infringement that risks inflicting irreparable harm for which the public interest requires a remedy,” Boasberg said. “The question — simply asked but not so simply answered — thus becomes what relief they must obtain for that violation.”
Boasberg said that the Trump administration “plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States — a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition.”
He said that even if President Donald Trump lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act and if those subject to the proclamation are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, they must be given a chance to contest the charges.
“This is the critical point —there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government’s say-so.”
“Defendants instead spirited away planeloads of people before any such challenge could be made,” Boasberg continued. “And now, significant evidence has come to light indicating that many of those currently entombed in CECOT have no connection to the gang and thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.”
Order doesn’t require return
The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, sought to require the Venezuelans be brought back to the U.S. from El Salvador to challenge their removals. But Boasberg rejected that argument.
Boasberg determined that even though there is a financial agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador to detain the men, they are in the custody of the Salvadoran government.
“While it is a close question, the current record does not support Plaintiffs’ assertion that they are in the constructive custody of the United States,” Boasberg said.
“Even crediting the public statements characterizing the arrangement as outsourcing the U.S. prison system and acknowledging the President’s unofficial assertion of his power to request a release, such comments cannot overcome a sworn declaration from a knowledgeable government official attesting that the CECOT Class’s ongoing detention is a question of Salvadoran law.”
Department of Justice attorneys have used the same reasoning in a separate case to resist the return of the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, despite a U.S. Supreme Court order to “facilitate” the Maryland man’s return to the U.S.
ACLU will be allowed to have input to determine how due process can be afforded to the men at CECOT, Boasberg wrote.
Wednesday’s order is the latest in a months-long dispute between the Trump administration and Boasberg after three planes landed in El Salvador and roughly 300 men were sent to CECOT in mid-March, despite the judge’s temporary restraining order against using the Alien Enemies Act.
Boasberg found probable cause to hold Trump officials in contempt for violating his temporary restraining order that ordered the deportation planes carrying men removed under the Alien Enemies Act to be returned to the U.S. over concerns they did not receive due process.

Trump once opened the door to the LGBTQ+ community.

Now activists say he's their top threat
When he first ran for office, Donald Trump seemed like he could be a new kind of Republican when it came to LGBTQ+ rights
WASHINGTON -- When he first ran for office, Donald Trump appeared to be a new kind of Republican when it came to gay rights.
Years earlier, he overturned the rules of his own Miss Universe pageant to allow a transgender contestant to compete. He said Caitlyn Jenner could use any bathroom at Trump Tower that she wanted. And he was the first president to name an openly gay person to a Cabinet-level position.
But since returning to office this year, Trump has engaged in what activists say is an unprecedented assault on the LGBTQ+ community. The threat from the White House contrasts with World Pride celebrations taking place just blocks away in Washington, including a parade and rally this weekend.
“We are in the darkest period right now since the height of the AIDS crisis,” said Kevin Jennings, who leads Lambda Legal, a longtime advocacy organization. “I am deeply concerned that we’re going to see it all be taken away in the next four years.”
Trump's defenders insist the president has not acted in a discriminatory way, and they point to public polling that shows widespread support for policies like restrictions on transgender athletes.
“He’s working to establish common sense once again,” said Ed Williams, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, which represents LGBT conservatives.
Harrison Fields, the principal deputy press secretary at the White House, said, “the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people.”
“The president continues to foster a national pride that should be celebrated daily, and he is honored to serve all Americans,” Fields said.
Trump made anti-transgender attacks a central plank of his campaign reelection message as he called on Congress to pass a bill stating there are “only two genders” and pledged to ban hormonal and surgical intervention for transgender minors. He signed an executive order doing so in January.
His rally speeches featured a spoof video mocking transgender people and their place in the U.S. military. Trump has since banned them outright from serving. And although June is recognized nationally as Pride month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters this week that Trump has “no plans for a proclamation.”
“I can tell you this president is very proud to be a president for all Americans, regardless of race, religion or creed,” she added, making no mention of sexual orientation or gender identity.
Williams described Pride activities as a progressive catch-all rather than a civil rights campaign. “If you’re not in the mood to protest or resist the Trump administration,” he said, “Pride is not for you.”
Trump declined to issue Pride Month proclamations in his first term, but did recognize the celebration in 2019 as he publicized a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality headed by Richard Grenell, then the U.S. Ambassador to Germany and the highest-profile openly gay person in the administration. (Grenell now serves as envoy for special missions.)
“As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation,” Trump posted on social media.
This time, there is no celebrating.
The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which Trump named himself chairman of after firing members of the board of trustees, canceled a week’s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer’s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., at one of the nation’s premier cultural institutions.
Trump, who indicated when he took up the position that he would be dictating programming, had specifically said he would end events featuring performers in drag. The exterior lights that once lit the venue on the Potomac River in the colors of the rainbow were quickly replaced with red, white and blue.
Multiple artists and producers involved in the center’s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues.
Inside the White House, there's little second-guessing about the president's stances. Trump aides have pointed to their decision to seize on culture wars surrounding transgender rights during the 2024 campaign as key to their win. They poured money into ads aimed at young men — especially young Hispanic men — attacking Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for supporting “taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,” including one spot aired during football games.
“Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,” the narrator said.
Jennings flatly rejected assertions that the administration hasn’t been discriminatory. “Are you kidding me? You’re throwing trans people out of the military. That’s example No. 1.”
He points to the cancellation of scientific grants and funding for HIV/AIDS organizations, along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's “petty and mean” order to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, which commemorates the gay rights activist and Navy veteran.
Jennings also said it doesn't help that Trump has appointed openly gay men like Grenell and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to high-profile positions: “I would call it window dressing.”
Craig Konnoth, a University of Virginia professor of civil rights, compared the U.S.’ trajectory to that of Russia, which has seen a crackdown on gay and lesbian rights after a long stretch of more progressive policies. In 2023, Russia’s Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism.
Williams said Trump has made the Republican Party more accepting of gay people. First lady Melania Trump, he noted, has hosted fundraisers for his organization.
“On the whole, we think he’s the best president ever for our community. He’s managed to support us in ways that we have never been supported by any administration,” Williams said. “We are vastly accepted within our party now.”
Trump's approach to LGBTQ+ rights comes amid a broader shift among Republicans, who have grown less tolerant in recent years.
While overall support for same-sex marriage has been stable, according to Gallup, the percentage of Republicans who think marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized as valid with the same rights as traditional marriage dropped to 41% this year. That's the lowest point since 2016, a year after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, and a substantial decline from a high of 55% in 2021.
There's been a similar drop in the share of Republicans who say that gay and lesbian relations are morally acceptable, which has dropped from 56% in 2022 to 38% this year. Democrats, meanwhile, continue to overwhelmingly support same-sex marriage and say that same-sex relations are morally acceptable.
An AP-NORC poll from May also found that Trump’s approach to handling transgender issues has been a point of relative strength for the president. About half (52%) of U.S. adults said they approve of how he’s handling transgender issues — a figure higher than his overall job approval (41%).
Douglas Page, who studies politics and gender at Gettysburg College, said that “trans rights are less popular than gay rights, with a minority of Republicans in favor of trans rights. This provides incentives for Republicans to speak to the conservative side of that issue.”
“Gay people are less controversial to Republicans compared to trans people,” he said in an email, “so gay appointees like Secretary Bessent probably won’t ruffle many feathers.”

(AP) — A former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump says he wants to become governor in the president’s adopted home state of Florida and is running as a Democrat. David Jolly formally announced his bid Thursday, becoming the latest party convert hoping to wrest back control of what had been the country’s premier swing state that in recent years has made a hard shift to the right. Under state law, term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis can’t run for reelection in 2026. Even as Florida serves as a place for the Trump administration to poach staff and test policies, Jolly says he’s confident that issues such as affordability, funding public schools, and strengthening campaign finance and ethics laws will resonate with all voters in 2026. He predicts elections next year will herald nationwide change. “I actually think Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us. I think we should get politicians out of the classrooms, out of the doctor’s offices,” Jolly said. “I think enough people in Florida, even some Republicans, now understand that. That the culture wars have gone too far,” he added. Jolly was first elected to his Tampa Bay-area congressional seat during a 2014 special election and was reelected for one full term. The attorney and former lobbyist underwent a political evolution that spurred him to leave the Republican Party in 2018 to become an independent and then a registered Democrat. He has built a national profile as an anti-Trump political commentator on MSNBC. Jolly said he has considered himself “part of the Democratic coalition” for five or so years, and believes in what he sees as the party’s “fundamental values” — that government can help people, that the economy should be “fair” to all, and that immigrants should be celebrated. READ MORE: Gov. DeSantis signs bill making Florida 2nd state to ban fluoride from its water system “I struggled to exercise those values in the Republican Party,” Jolly said, continuing: “The actual registration as a Democrat wasn’t a pivot. It was a kind of a formality.” Jolly has broken from his old party on immigration, as Florida lawmakers race to help Trump fulfill his promise of mass deportations. Jolly skewered Republicans, whom he said have “conflated immigration and crime,” which he described as wrong and immoral. “If you were born here or if you immigrated here, or if you’re a Tallahassee politician who steals Medicaid money, we’re going to be tough on crime,” Jolly added, referring to a probe into the use of Medicaid settlement funds by a charity associated with first lady Casey DeSantis. Jolly’s gubernatorial run as a Democrat draws comparisons to the failed bid of former Republican congressman-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, who lost to DeSantis in 2022 by 19 points. Crist, running as a Democrat, ousted Jolly from his congressional seat in 2016. “By switching from Republican to Independent to Democrat, Jolly has officially completed his transition to become the next Charlie Crist,” the campaign of Trump-backed Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor, said in a statement. Jolly joined the Florida Democratic Party at arguably one of its most vulnerable points in years. Florida currently has no Democrats elected to statewide office, and there are now 1.2 million more registered Republicans than Democrats, according to the state’s active voter rolls. The GOP has made significant inroads in formerly Democratic strongholds in the state, such as Miami-Dade County. The day Jolly announced his new affiliation, the then-top Democrat in the Florida Senate, Jason Pizzo, revealed he was leaving the party, declaring that “the Democratic Party in Florida is dead.” Pizzo, a former prosecutor, has said he’ll launch his own run for governor as a candidate with no party affiliation. On the Republican side, Jolly will face Donalds, who is also a frequent presence on cable news as a surrogate for the president. Among the other names floated as potential GOP candidates are former Rep. Matt Gaetz and Casey DeSantis.

DeSantis signs bill making Florida 2nd state to ban fluoride from its water system “I struggled to exercise those values in the Republican Party,” Jolly said, continuing: “The actual registration as a Democrat wasn’t a pivot. It was a kind of a formality.” Jolly has broken from his old party on immigration, as Florida lawmakers race to help Trump fulfill his promise of mass deportations. Jolly skewered Republicans, whom he said have “conflated immigration and crime,” which he described as wrong and immoral. “If you were born here or if you immigrated here, or if you’re a Tallahassee politician who steals Medicaid money, we’re going to be tough on crime,” Jolly added, referring to a probe into the use of Medicaid settlement funds by a charity associated with first lady Casey DeSantis. Jolly’s gubernatorial run as a Democrat draws comparisons to the failed bid of former Republican congressman-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, who lost to DeSantis in 2022 by 19 points. Crist, running as a Democrat, ousted Jolly from his congressional seat in 2016. “By switching from Republican to Independent to Democrat, Jolly has officially completed his transition to become the next Charlie Crist,” the campaign of Trump-backed Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor, said in a statement. Jolly joined the Florida Democratic Party at arguably one of its most vulnerable points in years. Florida currently has no Democrats elected to statewide office, and there are now 1.2 million more registered Republicans than Democrats, according to the state’s active voter rolls. The GOP has made significant inroads in formerly Democratic strongholds in the state, such as Miami-Dade County. The day Jolly announced his new affiliation, the then-top Democrat in the Florida Senate, Jason Pizzo, revealed he was leaving the party, declaring that “the Democratic Party in Florida is dead.” Pizzo, a former prosecutor, has said he’ll launch his own run for governor as a candidate with no party affiliation. On the Republican side, Jolly will face Donalds, who is also a frequent presence on cable news as a surrogate for the president. Among the other names floated as potential GOP candidates are former Rep. Matt Gaetz and Casey DeSantis.

Researchers, advocates, and executives got a glimpse of the answer Thursday, as the Food and Drug Administration convened a “Cell and Gene Therapy Roundtable.”
It was an unusual event. Multiple panelists told STAT on Wednesday they didn’t know what the agenda or goal of the meeting was. There was little debate. No details were hashed out, no specific promises made.
Guests from across academia, advocacy, and industry were told to each give a short statement on what the FDA “ought to know” about cell and gene therapy. That took two hours. Then health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz came in and gave statements. By the time they were done, there were barely 10 minutes left.

MyPillow Guy Mike Lindell Is Already In Trouble With The Judge As His Trial Begins,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mypillow-guy-mike-lindell-is-already-in-trouble-with-the-judge-as-his-trial-begins_n_6840db7de4b00b2e94c5822d,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 22:42:40 -0400",Plaintiff's attorneys argued Lindell violated a court order by posting online and participating in interviews about the proceedings.,"MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell on Tuesday violated court orders not to discuss proceedings amid his defamation trial, prompting the judge to warn him against further violations.
Former Dominion Voting Systems employee Dr. Eric Coomer is suing Lindell, a vocal ally of President Donald Trump, for defamation over Lindell’s baseless 2020 election conspiracy theories. Coomer’s attorneys informed the judge that Lindell appeared on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast on Tuesday and that posts from his X account were being published as court was in session, violating court orders, according to a June 3 court document obtained by HuffPost.
They also cited a Substack article from The Bulwark’s Will Sommer titled “Mike Lindell is Texting Me From His Defamation Trial” and an on-air interview with LindellTV, featuring Lindell.
Coomer’s attorneys argued in the court document that Lindell’s moves violated a May court order that prohibits “photographs, audio, or video recordings...including, but not limited to, the courtroom or the hallway outside of the courtroom.”
The attorneys said that “this Rule extends to any live blogging, tweeting, transcribing, transmitting, or any other type of real-time communication and/or reporting about these proceedings.”
Likewise, Coomer’s attorneys cited a verbal order on Monday in which the court prohibits “disclosure of trial testimony to witnesses who are excluded from the courtroom; and prohibit excluded witnesses from accessing trial testimony.”
District Judge Nina Wang verbally reprimanded Lindell, cautioning him against making any other public remarks.
“I am concerned not only about the tainting of potential witnesses, but I’m concerned about preserving a fair and unbiased jury,” Wang said, according to KUSA.
According to the outlet, Lindell’s team assured the judge that he wouldn’t take any more interviews during the trial or live tweet as it happens.
“I will have my phone off in court,” Lindell reportedly told the judge.
“That would be a great idea,” Wang responded.
Lindell’s team at LindellTV claimed that it runs the account.
Lindell’s X account contains numerous posts published during the court’s hours, many of them asking for donations or claiming that the trial is “the Trial of the Century.” Some of the posts also frame him as a target of Dominion, making him out to be some kind of martyr for election integrity and a fighter for freedom of speech.
Bannon, who served as the chief strategist for Trump’s first administration for seven months before he was fired, virtually interviewed Lindell as he stood outside the courthouse. Lindell told Bannon the judge seemed “fair” and that the jury seemed “amazing.”
“I believe it’s going to be the gateway where the dominoes fall and we get to paper ballots hand-counted,” Lindell added.
“Everybody should want secure elections,” Lindell also told Bannon. “I would never give up.”
The relentless salesman also pitched his pillows while on Bannon’s podcast.
The trial began Monday in Denver federal court with jury selection and is expected to conclude on or around June 10.
“All Mike Lindell did was talk,” Lindell’s lawyer, Chris Kachouroff, reportedly told the jury.
“Mike believed that he was telling the truth,” Kachouroff added. “It doesn’t have to be true.”

Massive NIH study challenges use of race as a proxy for genetic ancestry in research,https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/05/nih-all-of-us-genetics-study-examines-nuanced-interplay-of-race-and-genetics/?utm_campaign=rss,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 16:55:02 +0000",A large government study shows that Americans’ self-reported race is a poor proxy for their genetic ancestry.,"A large government study published Thursday shows more definitively than ever before that Americans’ self-reported race is a poor proxy for their genetic ancestry. Researchers said the findings have major implications for the way health disparities are studied, and how they are discussed in the public sphere.
The new paper offered more nuance and consideration to the complicated relationship between race and genetics than past studies, outside commentators said. Its massive dataset and National Institutes of Health authors give authority to its conclusions, which arrive amid a heated debate over the role racial categories play in research as the Trump administration has targeted grants it deems related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion” as being “unscientific.”
In the study, published Thursday in the American Journal of Human Genetics, researchers analyzed the genomes of more than 200,000 participants in the All of Us cohort, which was established by the NIH to create a dataset that accurately represented the makeup of the United States.
Outside scientists said the study drives home the important differences between race and genetic ancestry. “The clear message here is that these are two distinct constructs, they mean different things, and they should not be used interchangeably,” said Luisa Borrell, a social epidemiologist at the CUNY School of Public Health who worked on a 2023 National Academies report on the use of race in genetics research.
Jonathan Kahn, a legal and historical scholar at Northeastern Law School who just published a book on the use of diversity in biology and in law, added, “I thought it was thoughtful and much more nuanced than the kind of language geneticists were using about race and variation, even five years ago, let alone 20 years ago. There was a lot of movement towards a subtler, more well-considered examination and articulation of relationships between race and genetic variation.”
The study mapped people’s self-reported race with their genetic ancestry, and through several different analyses, it points to a much fuzzier understanding of race, as opposed to thinking of racial groups as distinct and easily defined.
In one case, it used body mass index as an example of how broad racial categories can be misleading. The study found that those with West African ancestry were predisposed to have a high BMI while those with East African ancestry were predisposed to not have a high BMI, but those groups may be lumped together if a study just accounts for someone having African ancestry.
The study also revealed how differences in race mapped out across the United States, which is likely the result of migration to different parts of the country from different parts of the world. The paper also hones in on Latinos as an example where a socially defined group of people doesn’t map neatly onto genetic ancestry.
“As a representation of the general U.S. population and how complicated it is, this is a pretty big advance, and an important set of results,” said Sasha Gusev, a statistical geneticist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He noted that other studies have pointed out the incongruence between race and genetic ancestry, but those have typically been from smaller biobanks that intentionally collect data from racially minoritized groups. He added that the kind of geographic analyses the study did could only be done because it was a national cohort. “It also speaks to the fact that not only is racial self-identification a construct, but it’s one that differs across different parts of the country.”
The study could have a profound influence on the way geneticists conduct and frame their work. Historically, the idea that race was inextricably linked to biology was used to justify health disparities and other forms of racial bias.
There has generally been two camps in the field — one that claims race is a social construct and a biological understanding of race is too simplistic, and the other that says race is a discrete, identifiable group and is the primary driver in a person’s trajectory. The new study reinforces the shortfalls of using socially defined racial categories in genetics work.
“Race and ethnicity are poor proxies for genetic ancestry; therefore, biomedical research should adjust directly for ancestries estimated from genetic data rather than relying on self-identified race or ethnicity,” the study’s lead author, Charles Rotimi, scientific director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, wrote in an email to reporters.
Just minutes after that email was sent, an NIH spokesperson responded, “Hi all – please hold on using these responses until you hear from me,” but did not follow up by the time of publication.
STAT reached out to the paper’s co-authors outside of the NIH. Only one responded, writing that “all communication related to the paper is under review by HHS, and we do not have approval to participate in press interviews.”
The screening of scientists’ communications contrasts with NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya’s promise to foster a culture of free speech. Bhattacharya’s boss, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has similarly pledged to promote “radical transparency.”
After publication, NIH made Rotimi available for an interview. He said the study results point to race being the wrong way to think about a person’s risk of disease — and should encourage researchers to think of people on a more individual level. The results don’t necessarily invalidate previous work that has found genetic differences between races, he said, but “those past findings are not as precise as they should have been, or they should be. As we gather more data with large cohorts like All of Us, we should be in a better position to truly characterize people.”
A fraught history
The current study is part of a long and often-fraught history of geneticists and ideas of race.
Since Charles Darwin proposed the basics of what would become the field of genetics, people have tried to apply its principles to racial groups. Soon after Darwin proposed his theory of evolution, his cousin, Francis Galton, created the foundations of what would become the eugenics movement. On the first page of his book “Hereditary Genius,” Galton writes he was interested in understanding “the mental peculiarities of different races.”
“He spent his career trying to, in the primitive ways that were available at the time, prove that Europeans were biologically superior. It’s continuous, since then, it’s never, ever been dropped,” said Eric Turkheimer, a behavior geneticist at the University of Virginia who has written about the way Trump’s Make America Great Again movement could affect the field of genomics.
The All of Us cohort was launched in 2018 to create a database of genetic data that more accurately represented the U.S. — but even it has had a spotty past when it comes to discussing race.
The program caught some flak last year for a paper published by some of its scientists because it used a method of genetic visualization, called UMAP, that can artificially create distinct clusters in data. Several geneticists argued that it amplified genetic differences in racial groups in a misleading way. The worry at the time was that it could send the message that it was reifying a genetic basis for racial groups, a concern that was only amplified because genetics research has at times been used to justify white supremacy.
“The majority of population geneticists try not to promote the narrative that there are these discrete genetic racial clusters, because that’s not what the data tells us, not what the last 70 years of research tell us,” said Jedidiah Carlson, a population geneticist who has studied how some population genetics data are used in right-wing circles. While he has not studied the 2024 paper specifically, he did note it seems to be shared frequently by conservatives.
‘Open to interpretation’
The new paper does not mince words in its recommendation to scientists, but how it may be interpreted by the general public is much harder to pin down.
While the text and analyses of the paper point to race being a social construct, the way that the paper still leans on ancestry by subcontinental groups could allow for people to interpret the paper as simply calling for more granular racial categories.
“You can build a narrative around this that says, ‘Our socially constructed view is completely true.’ You can also build another view, which is, ‘It’s a little different than we thought it was back in the day. But the socially defined races look like they have pretty different ancestry components,’” said Aaron Panofsky, the director of the Institute for Society and Genetics at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied how conservatives have used genetics. He said that the paper is written in such a way that it “does not just double down on all these straightforward, old-style ways of talking about it, but it can’t emancipate itself from the problematic space of race and ethnicity. In some ways, it slips back in, and I believe it contradicts it. I think it’s very open to interpretation. It doesn’t settle anything.”
Another potential interpretation is that the paper supports the rationale the NIH has used in recent weeks when terminating research grants it deems related to DEI, which states, “Research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry.”
For his part, Rotimi, the lead author, said he tries to stay out of politics and likes “my data to speak for me.” He said his lab views race “as really a social construct. It doesn’t mean it’s not useful, but it’s truly a social construct. And the best way I can describe that is to say that trying to use genetics to define race or to use genetics to support our racial classification is like slicing soup. You can cut all you want — that soup is going to stay mixed.”
He added that “when we use concepts as broad as European or Africans or Asians, we distort our understanding of genetic variation, and that distortion can put individuals at risk when we try to prescribe medicine or when we try to treat them.”
Kahn and others noted the paper is making what could be a radical shift in thinking about the role race plays in medical research. In the past, geneticists have largely chalked up variation by race in health outcomes that couldn’t be explained by other variables as genetic differences they did not fully understand yet. But the paper instead says that race is likely a proxy for environmental factors.
“We’re not saying this because we’re a bunch of woke, leftist scientists, we are saying this because this is going to improve the science that we’re doing,” Carlson said. But he also worries that if the paper garners negative attention, it could have a chilling effect on further research that confronts genetic determinism.
Kahn lauded the paper’s use of the word “variation” as opposed to “diversity,” a word that he says may have encouraged the connection between the idea of race and genetics.
“The two concepts, the social and biological understandings of diversity, have been doing this sort of dance around each other, and sometimes they’re in productive juxtaposition. But oftentimes they’re entangled, and it’s just a mess,” he said.
“What I see this paper doing is providing a potential template to keep these concepts from being entangled in a way that is both scientifically unproductive but also politically volatile. So I’m hopeful.”

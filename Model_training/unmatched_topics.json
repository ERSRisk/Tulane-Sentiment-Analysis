            "Stop order from judge. Federal judge orders stop to ICE sweeps(Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images)Topline:\nA federal judge in Los Angeles tonight ordered the Trump administration to stop carrying out immigration sweeps in which she said federal agents have been indiscriminately arresting people across southern California without reasonable suspicion that they're in the country illegally.\nThe backstory: Since early June, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other federal agencies have been roving Los Angeles and surrounding counties arresting thousands of people in what civil rights lawyers characterized in a lawsuit last week as an unconstitutional and \"extraordinary campaign of targeting people based on nothing more than the color of their skin.\"\nWhat the judge found: In her order, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, of the U.S. District Court for Central California, said there is \"a mountain of evidence\" to support the claim that agents are arresting people solely based on their race, accents, or the work they're engaged in, in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable government seizure.\nA federal judge in Los Angeles ordered the Trump administration to stop carrying out immigration sweeps in which she said federal agents have been indiscriminately arresting people across southern California without reasonable suspicion that they're in the country illegally.\nThe backstory\nSince early June, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other federal agencies have been roving Los Angeles and surrounding counties arresting thousands of people in what civil rights lawyers characterized in a lawsuit last week as an unconstitutional and \"extraordinary campaign of targeting people based on nothing more than the color of their skin.\"\nIn her order, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, of the U.S. District Court for Central California, said there is \"a mountain of evidence\" to support the claim that agents are arresting people solely based on their race, accents, or the work they're engaged in, in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable government seizure.\n\"The seizures at issue occurred unlawfully,\" Frimpong wrote.\nUnderstanding the restraining orders\nShe issued two temporary restraining orders \u2014 one prohibiting immigration agents from arresting people without reasonable suspicion that they're in the country illegally, and the other requiring agents to give people they arrest immediate access to lawyers.

            "Judge Orders Trump Admin To Stop Rounding People Up Based On Skin Color In Southern California. LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles.\nImmigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit last week accusing President Donald Trump\u2019s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. The plaintiffs include three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens, one who was held despite showing agents his identification.\nThe filing in U.S. District Court asked a judge to block the administration from using what they call unconstitutional tactics in immigration raids. Immigrant advocates accuse immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA.\nJudge Maame E. Frimpong also issued a separate order barring the federal government from restricting attorney access at a Los Angeles immigration detention facility.\nFrimpong issued the emergency orders, which are a temporary measure while the lawsuit proceeds, the day after a hearing during which advocacy groups argued that the government was violating the Fourth and Fifth amendments of the constitution.\nShe wrote in the order there was a \u201cmountain of evidence\u201d presented in the case that the federal government was committing the violations they were being accused of.\nThe White House responded quickly to the ruling late Friday. \u201cNo federal judge has the authority to dictate immigration policy \u2014 that authority rests with Congress and the President,\u201d spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. \u201cEnforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview (or) jurisdiction of any judge. We expect this gross overstep of judicial authority to be corrected on appeal.\u201d\nImmigrants and Latino communities across Southern California have been on edge for weeks since the Trump administration stepped up arrests at car washes, Home Depot parking lots, immigration courts and a range of businesses. Tens of thousands of people have participated in rallies in the region over the raids and the subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines.\nThe order also applies to Ventura County, where busloads of workers were detained Thursday while the court hearing was underway after federal agents descended on a cannabis farm, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple injuries.\nAccording to the American Civil Liberties Union, the recent wave of immigration enforcement has been driven by an \u201carbitrary arrest quota\u201d and based on \u201cbroad stereotypes based on race or ethnicity.\u201d\nWhen detaining the three day laborers who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, all immigration agents knew about them is that they were Latino and were dressed in construction work clothes, the filing in the lawsuit said. It goes on to describe raids at swap meets and Home Depots where witnesses say federal agents grabbed anyone who \u201clooked Hispanic.\u201d\nTricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in an email that \u201cany claims that individuals have been \u2018targeted\u2019 by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE.\u201d\nMcLaughlin said \u201cenforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence\u201d before making arrests.\nBut ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens who was detained, was \u201cphysically assaulted ... for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighborhood.\u201d\nTajsar asked why immigration agents detained everyone at a car wash except two white workers, according to a declaration by a car wash worker, if race wasn\u2019t involved.\nRepresenting the government, attorney Sean Skedzielewski said there was no evidence that federal immigration agents considered race in their arrests, and that they only considered appearance as part of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d including prior surveillance and interactions with people in the field.\nIn some cases, they also operated off \u201ctargeted, individualized packages,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe Department of Homeland Security has policy and training to ensure compliance with the Fourth Amendment,\u201d Skedzielewski said.\nOrder opens facility to lawyer visits\nLawyers from Immigrant Defenders Law Center and other groups say they also have been denied access to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown LA known as \u201cB-18\u201d on several occasions since June, according to court documents.\nLawyer Mark Rosenbaum said in one incident on June 7 attorneys \u201cattempted to shout out basic rights\u201d at a bus of people detained by immigration agents in downtown LA when the government drivers honked their horns to drown them out and chemical munitions akin to tear gas were deployed.\nSkedzielewski said access was only restricted to \u201cprotect the employees and the detainees\u201d during violent protests and it has since been restored.\nRosenbaum said lawyers were denied access even on days without any demonstrations nearby, and that the people detained are also not given sufficient access to phones or informed that lawyers were available to them.\nHe said the facility lacks adequate food and beds, which he called \u201ccoercive\u201d to getting people to sign papers to agree to leave the country before consulting an attorney.\nFriday\u2019s order will prevent the government from solely using apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone\u2019s occupation as the basis for reasonable suspicion to stop someone. It will also require officials to open B-18 to visitation by attorneys seven days a week and provide detainees access to confidential phone calls with attorneys.\nAttorneys general for 18 Democratic states also filed briefs in support of the orders.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were already barred from making warrantless arrests in a large swath of eastern California after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in April."

            "More than 160 people are still missing after deadly Texas floods, governor says. HUNT, Texas (AP) \u2014 More than 160 people are still believed to be missing in Texas days after flash floods killed over 100 people during the July Fourth weekend, the state's governor said Tuesday.\nThe huge jump in the number unaccounted for \u2014 roughly three times higher than previously said \u2014 came after authorities set up a hotline for families to call.\nThose reported missing are in Kerr County, where most of the victims have been recovered so far, Gov. Greg Abbott said. Many were likely visiting or staying in the state\u2019s Hill Country during the holiday but did not register at a camp or hotel, he said during a news conference.\nThe county's lowlands along the Guadalupe River are filled with youth camps and campgrounds, including Camp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors died. Officials said Tuesday that five campers and one counselor have still not been found.\nSearch-and-rescue teams are using heavy equipment to untangle and peel away layers of trees, unearth large rocks in riverbanks and move massive piles of debris that stretch for miles in the search for the missing people. Crews in airboats, helicopters and on horseback along with hundreds of volunteers are part of one of the largest search operations in Texas history.\nThe flash flood is the deadliest from inland flooding in the U.S. since Colorado\u2019s Big Thompson Canyon flood on July 31, 1976, killed 144 people, said Bob Henson, a meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections. That flood surged through a narrow canyon packed with people on a holiday weekend, Colorado\u2019s centennial celebration.\nPublic officials in charge of locating the victims are facing intensifying questions about who was in charge of monitoring the weather and warning that floodwaters were barreling toward camps and homes.\nThe Republican governor, who took a helicopter tour of the disaster zone, dismissed a question about who was to blame for the deaths, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s the word choice of losers.\u201d\n\u201cEvery football team makes mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe losing teams are the ones that try to point out who\u2019s to blame. The championship teams are the ones who say, \u2019Don\u2019t worry about it, man, we got this. We\u2019re going to make sure that we go score again and we\u2019re going to win this game.' The way winners talk is not to point fingers.\u201d\nAbbott promised that the search for victims will not stop until everyone is found. He also said President Donald Trump has pledged to provide whatever relief Texas needs to recover. Trump plans to visit the state Friday.\nScenes of devastation at Camp Mystic\nOutside the cabins at Camp Mystic where the girls had slept, mud-splattered blankets and pillows were scattered on a grassy hill that slopes toward the river. Also in the debris were pink, purple and blue luggage decorated with stickers.\nAmong those who died at the camp were a second grader who loved pink sparkles and bows, a 19-year-old counselor who enjoyed mentoring young girls and the camp\u2019s 75-year-old director.\nThe flash floods erupted before daybreak Friday after massive rains sent water speeding down hills into the Guadalupe River, causing it to rise 26 feet (8 meters) in less than an hour. The wall of water overwhelmed people in cabins, tents and trailers along the river\u2019s edge. Some survivors were found clinging to trees.\nSome campers had to swim out of cabin windows to safety while others held onto a rope as they made their way to higher ground. Time-lapse videos showed how floodwaters covered roads in a matter of minutes.\nAlthough it's difficult to attribute a single weather event to climate change, experts say a warming atmosphere and oceans make catastrophic storms more likely.\nWhere were the warnings?\nQuestions mounted about what, if any, actions local officials took to warn campers and residents who were spending the July Fourth weekend in the scenic area long known to locals as \u201cflash flood alley.\u201d\nLeaders in Kerr county, where searchers have found about 90 bodies, said their first priority is recovering victims, not reviewing what happened in the hours before the flash floods.\n\u201cRight now, this team up here is focused on bringing people home,\u201d Lt. Col. Ben Baker of the Texas Game Wardens, said during a sometimes tense news conference.\nKerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the county\u2019s chief elected official, said in the hours after the devastation that the county does not have a warning system.\nGenerations of families in the Hill Country have known the dangers. A 1987 flood forced the evacuation of a youth camp in the town of Comfort and swamped buses and vans. Ten teenagers were killed.\nLocal leaders have talked for years about the need for a warning system. Kerr County sought a nearly $1 million grant eight years ago for such a system, but the request was turned down by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Local residents balked at footing the bill themselves, Kelly said.\nRecovery and cleanup goes on\nFour days have passed since anyone was found alive in the aftermath of the floods in Kerr County, officials said Tuesday.\nThe bodies of 30 children were among those that have been recovered in the county, which is home to Camp Mystic and several other summer camps, the sheriff said.\nThe devastation spread across several hundred miles in central Texas all the way to just outside the capital of Austin.\nAidan Duncan escaped just in time after hearing the muffled blare of a megaphone urging residents to evacuate Riverside RV Park in the Hill Country town of Ingram.\nAll his belongings \u2014 a mattress, sports cards, his pet parakeet\u2019s bird cage \u2014 now sit caked in mud in front of his home.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on right now, it hurts,\u201d the 17-year-old said. \u201cI literally cried so hard.\u201d\nAlong the banks of the Guadalupe, 91-year-old Charles Hanson, a resident at a senior living center, was sweeping up wood and piling pieces of concrete and stone, remnants from a playground structure.\nHe wanted to help clean up on behalf of his neighbors who can\u2019t get out. \u201cWe\u2019ll make do with the best we got,\u201d he said.\nSeewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.

            "Sheriff says 10 campers still missing as death toll from central Texas flash floods rises to 78. Jim Vertuno, Associated Press\nJim Vertuno, Associated Press\nJulio Cortez, Associated Press\nJulio Cortez, Associated Press\nJohn Seewer, Associated Press\nJohn Seewer, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nKERRVILLE, Texas (AP) \u2014 Families sifted through waterlogged debris Sunday and stepped inside empty cabins at Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp ripped apart by flash floods that washed homes off their foundations and killed at least 78 people in central Texas.\nRescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain continued their desperate search for the missing, including 10 girls and a counselor from the camp. For the first time since the storms began pounding Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said there were 41 people confirmed to be unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing.\nWATCH: Ground crews and volunteers race to find those still missing after Texas floods\nIn Kerr County, home to Camp Mystic and other youth camps in the Texas Hill Country, searchers have found the bodies of 68 people, including 28 children, Sheriff Larry Leitha said in the afternoon.\nHe pledged to keep searching until \u201ceverybody is found\u201d from Friday\u2019s flash floods. Ten other deaths were reported in Travis, Burnet, Kendall, Tom Green and Williamson counties, according to local officials. The death toll is certain to rise over the next few days, said Col. Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\nThe governor warned Sunday that additional rounds of heavy rains lasting into Tuesday could produce more life-threatening flooding, especially in places already saturated.\nFamilies were allowed to look around the camp beginning Sunday morning. One girl walked out of a building carrying a large bell. A man, who said his daughter was rescued from a cabin on the highest point in the camp, walked a riverbank, looking in clumps of trees and under big rocks.\nA woman and a teenage girl, both wearing rubber waders, briefly went inside one of the cabins, which stood next to a pile of soaked mattresses, a storage trunk and clothes. At one point, the pair doubled over, sobbing before they embraced.\nOne family left with a blue footlocker. A teenage girl had tears running down her face looking out the open window, gazing at the wreckage as they slowly drove away.\nWhile the families saw the devastation for the first time, nearby crews operating heavy equipment pulled tree trunks and tangled branches from the water as they searched the river.\nWith each passing hour, the outlook of finding more survivors became even more bleak. Volunteers and some families of the missing who drove to the disaster zone searched the riverbanks despite being asked not to do so.\nAuthorities faced growing questions about whether enough warnings were issued in an area long vulnerable to flooding and whether enough preparations were made.\nREAD MORE: Texas officials face scrutiny over lack of evacuation orders before deadly flooding\nPresident Donald Trump signed a major disaster declaration Sunday for Kerr County, activating the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Texas.\nThe president said he would likely visit Friday. \u201cI would have done it today, but we\u2019d just be in their way,\u201d he told reporters before boarding Air Force One back to Washington after spending the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible.\u201d\nThe destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the river in only 45 minutes before daybreak Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as flash flood watches remained in effect and more rain fell in central Texas on Sunday.\nSearchers used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue people stranded in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads. Officials said more than 850 people were rescued in the first 36 hours.\nGov. Greg Abbott vowed that authorities will work around the clock and said new areas were being searched as the water receded. He declared Sunday a day of prayer for the state.\n\u201cI urge every Texan to join me in prayer this Sunday \u2014 for the lives lost, for those still missing, for the recovery of our communities, and for the safety of those on the front lines,\u201d he said in a statement.\nIn Rome, Pope Leo XIV offered special prayers for those touched by the disaster. History\u2019s first American pope spoke in English at the end of his Sunday noon blessing, \u201cI would like to express sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were in summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas in the United States. We pray for them.\u201d\nThe hills along the Guadalupe River are dotted with century-old youth camps and campgrounds where generations of families have come to swim and enjoy the outdoors.

            "LIVE: Hill Country Flooding claims over 80 lives; Camp Mystic officials confirm 27 dead. KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) \u2014 Families sifted through waterlogged debris Sunday and stepped inside empty cabins at Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp ripped apart by flash floods that washed homes off their foundations and killed at least 82 people in central Texas.\nRescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain, high waters and snakes including water moccasins continued their desperate search for the missing, including 10 girls and a counselor from the camp. For the first time since the storms began pounding Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said there were 41 people confirmed to be unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing.\nRELATED: Downtown vigil for central Texas flood victims announced by Centro San Antonio\nCamp Mystic officials released a statement confirming the loss of 27 campers and counselors to Hill Country flood.\nOur hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy. We are praying for them constantly. We have been in communication with local and state authorities who are tirelessly deploying extensive resources to search for our missing girls. We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from community, first responders, and officials at every level. We ask for your continued prayers, respect and privacy for each of our families affected. May the Lord continue to wrap His presence around all of us.\nAlso, the family of Chloe Childress, a camp counselor at Camp Mystic, who died during the flood, issued a statement Monday morning remembering their loved one:\nChloe Childress lived a beautiful life that saturated those around her with contagious joy, unending grace, and abiding faith. Returning as a counselor to the place she loved so dearly, Chloe was looking forward to dedicating her summer days to loving and mentoring young girls at Camp Mystic.\nOur family was shocked to hear of the horrific tragic flooding in the hill country, and we were devastated to learn that our precious Chloe was among the victims. While we know that her joy is now eternal and her faith has become sight, our hearts are shattered by this loss and the similar heartbreak of other families like ours. We desire to grieve privately during this time and thank so many caring people, in advance, for respecting this wish. Please know we are grateful for every kind thought, your quietly spoken prayers, and the countless hearts of sympathy that are carrying us through these days.\nIn Kerr County, home to Camp Mystic and other youth camps in the Texas Hill Country, searchers have found the bodies of 68 people, including 28 children, Sheriff Larry Leitha said in the afternoon.\nHe pledged to keep searching until \u201ceverybody is found\u201d from Friday's flash floods. Ten other deaths were reported in Travis, Burnet, Kendall, Tom Green and Williamson counties, according to local officials. The death toll is certain to rise over the next few days, said Col. Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\nThe governor warned that additional rounds of heavy rains lasting into Tuesday could produce more life-threatening flooding, especially in places already saturated. As he spoke at a news conference in Austin, emergency alerts lit up mobile phones in Kerr County that warned of \u201cHigh confidence of river flooding\" and a loudspeaker near Camp Mystic urged people to leave. Minutes later, however, authorities on the scene said there was no risk.\nRELATED: Family's sacred summer tradition shattered by unexpected flood in Texas Hill Country\nFamilies were allowed to look around the camp beginning Sunday morning. One girl walked out of a building carrying a large bell. A man, who said his daughter was rescued from a cabin on the highest point in the camp, walked a riverbank, looking in clumps of trees and under big rocks.\nA woman and a teenage girl, both wearing rubber waders, briefly went inside one of the cabins, which stood next to a pile of soaked mattresses, a storage trunk and clothes. At one point, the pair doubled over, sobbing before they embraced.\nOne family left with a blue footlocker. A teenage girl had tears running down her face looking out the open window, gazing at the wreckage as they slowly drove away.\nWhile the families saw the devastation for the first time, nearby crews operating heavy equipment pulled tree trunks and tangled branches from the water as they searched the river.\nWith each passing hour, the outlook of finding more survivors became even more bleak. Volunteers and some families of the missing who drove to the disaster zone searched the riverbanks despite being asked not to do so.\nAuthorities faced growing questions about whether enough warnings were issued in an area long vulnerable to flooding and whether enough preparations were made.\nRELATED: Texas A&M teams lead rescue efforts as central Texas battles catastrophic flooding\nPresident Donald Trump signed a major disaster declaration Sunday for Kerr County, activating the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Texas.\nThe president said he would likely visit Friday. \u201cI would have done it today, but we\u2019d just be in their way,\u201d he told reporters before boarding Air Force One back to Washington after spending the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible.\u201d\nThe destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the river in only 45 minutes before daybreak Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as flash flood watches remained in effect and more rain fell in central Texas on Sunday.\nSearchers used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue people stranded in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads. Officials said more than 850 people were rescued in the first 36 hours.\nGov. Greg Abbott vowed that authorities will work around the clock and said new areas were being searched as the water receded. He declared Sunday a day of prayer for the state.\n\"I urge every Texan to join me in prayer this Sunday \u2014 for the lives lost, for those still missing, for the recovery of our communities, and for the safety of those on the front lines,\u201d he said in a statement.\nIn Rome, Pope Leo XIV offered special prayers for those touched by the disaster. History\u2019s first American pope spoke in English at the end of his Sunday noon blessing, \u201cI would like to express sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were in summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas in the United States. We pray for them.\u201d\nThe hills along the Guadalupe River are dotted with century-old youth camps and campgrounds where generations of families have come to swim and enjoy the outdoors. The area is especially popular around the Independence Day holiday, making it more difficult to know how many are missing.\nSurvivors shared terrifying stories of being swept away and clinging to trees as rampaging floodwaters carried trees and cars past them.

SUNDAY - KERR COUNTY ROAD CLOSURE UPDATE\nRoad and bridge crews have been working tirelessly to restore access to local communities. Here are the latest closures:\nUnless otherwise listed, all Kerr County-maintained low water crossings and bridges are closed.\nUpdates available on known roads, low water crossings, and bridges are as follows:\nAssessments for hidden damage to the structures will be conducted once the water recedes. Roads marked \"emergency passable\" are NOT open for the general public.\nTX-39 has also been closed to onlookers, as the volume of traffic west of Ingram was impeding search and rescue operations. Those who live in the area must be prepared to show photo ID to officers on the roadway."

            "Trump says he&#8217;s placing Washington police under federal control and deploying the National Guard. David Klepper, Associated Press\nDavid Klepper, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday he\u2019s taking over Washington\u2019s police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard in the hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed crime is already falling in the nation\u2019s capital.\nThe president, flanked by his attorney general, his defense secretary and the FBI director, said he was declaring a public safety emergency and his administration would be removing homeless encampments.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump declared, adding he\u2019d also be \u201cgetting rid of the slums.\u201d\nFor Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia\u2019s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi will assume responsibility for Washington\u2019s metro police department, Trump said, as he also railed against potholes and graffiti in the city and called them \u201cembarrassing.\u201d The president did not provide a timeline for the control of the police department, but he\u2019s limited to 30 days under statute.\nWATCH LIVE: Trump holds news briefing on plans for homelessness and crime in Washington\nAs Trump spoke, demonstrators gathered outside the White House to protest his moves. And local officials rejected the Republican president\u2019s depiction of the district as crime-ridden and called his actions illegal.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said. \u201cThere is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia.\u201d\nSchwalb, a Democrat, said violent crime in the district reached historic 30-year lows last year and is down another 26% this year.\nThe president dismissed the idea Washington needed to enlarge its 3,500-officer police force, even as he seeks to have more armed personnel going through the city with the goal of reducing crime.\n\u201cWhat you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them,\u201d he said.\nTrump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in an executive order to declare a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d so his administration could take over the city\u2019s police force. He signed a directive for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard.\nWhile Trump has portrayed himself as a friend to law enforcement and enjoyed the political backing from many of their groups, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, including people convicted of assaulting police officers.\nSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nThank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.\nAbout 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation\u2019s capital as part of Trump\u2019s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.\nMore than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Marshals Service are contributing officers.\nThe person was not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately have a comment Monday morning.\nTrump has emphasized the removal of Washington\u2019s homeless population, though it was unclear where the thousands of people would go, and he did not give details at his news conference Monday.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump wrote Sunday in a social media post. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\u201d\nTrump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was \u201cridiculous\u201d and the city was \u201cunsafe,\u201d after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency.\nMayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the National Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. Superior Court, some of which have been open for years.\nBowser cannot activate the National Guard herself, but she can submit a request to the Pentagon.\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\u201d she said Sunday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d acknowledging it is \u201cthe president\u2019s call about how to deploy the Guard.\u201d\nBowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. She noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023. Trump\u2019s weekend social media posts depicted the district as \u201cone of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.\u201d\nFor Bowser, \u201cAny comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.\u201d\nPolice statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Overall, violent crime is down 26% compared with this time a year ago.\nThe president has criticized the district as full of \u201ctents, squalor, filth, and Crime,\u201d and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. Police arrested two 15-year-olds in the attempted carjacking and said they were looking for others.\n\u201cThis has to be the best run place in the country, not the worst run place in the country,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\nHe called Bowser \u201ca good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.\u201d\nTrump has repeatedly suggested the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump said lawyers are examining.\nBowser acknowledged the law allows the president to take more control over the city\u2019s police, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\u201cNone of those conditions exist in our city right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime. In fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d\nAssociated Press writers Ashraf Khalil, Alanna Durkin Richer, Darlene Superville and Michelle L.

            "Trump deploys National Guard to Washington DC and pledges crime crackdown. Trump deploys National Guard to Washington DC and pledges crime crackdown\nPresident Donald Trump said he was deploying the National Guard to Washington DC and taking control of the city's police force as he pledged to crack down on crime and homelessness in the city.\nTrump declared a \"public safety emergency\" on Monday, deploying 800 National Guard troops to bolster hundreds of federal law enforcement officers who were deployed over the weekend.\n\"It's becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness,\" he told reporters at the White House.\nThe city's Mayor Muriel Bowser has rejected the president's claims about crime, and while there was a spike in 2023, statistics show it has fallen since then. Violent crime in the city is also at a 30-year low.\n\"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" Trump said during a news conference in which he was flanked by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will lead the city's police force while it is under federal control.\n\"This is liberation day in DC, and we're going to take our capital back,\" he said.\nTrump said Washington DC had been \"taken over by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals\" as well as \"drugged out maniacs and homeless people\".\nAccording to data from the city's Metropolitan Police Department, homicides dropped by 32% between 2023 and 2024 and reached their lowest level since 2019.\nThere has been another substantial drop this year of 12%, the data shows.\nMayor Bowser, a Democrat, acknowledged there had been a \"terrible\" spike in crime in 2023, which mirrored a national trend, but she pushed back against any claims of a crimewave in the city.\n\"We are not experiencing a crime spike,\" she told MSNBC on Sunday. \"The president is very aware of our efforts.\"\nWhen asked about White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's comment that Washington is more violent than Baghdad, Bowser said \"any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false\".\nOf the 800 National Guard troops who will be activated, between 100-200 will be deployed and supporting law enforcement at any given time, the army said in a statement.\nDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the National Guardsmen would arrive by the end of the week.\nAs well as that deployment, Trump said he would place the city's police department under direct federal control using the District of Columbia Home Rule Act.\nThat act was instituted by former President Richard Nixon to allow residents of Washington DC - which is the only US city that is not in any of the 50 states - to elect a city council and a mayor.\nBut it also has a caveat that allows the president to take control of the city's police force if \"special conditions of an emergency nature exist\".\nIf the president intends to take control for longer than 48 hours, they need to provide a written notice to Congress. And even if that notice is provided, they cannot keep control of the police for longer than 30 days.\nOn Sunday, when asked about the possibility of the president taking control of the city's police department, Mayor Bowser said: \"There are very specific things in our law that would allow [that]. None of those conditions exist in our city right now.\"\nShe said she was \"concerned\" about the National Guard enforcing local laws.\nBowser gave a news conference later on Monday in which she said the president's order was \"unsettling and unprecedented\".\nShe said Trump's view of the city had been \"shaped by his Covid-view experience during his first term\", which she acknowledged was \"challenging times\" for the district.\n\"It's true we experienced a crime spike post-Covid,\" she said.\n\"We worked quickly to put laws in place that got violent offenders off our streets,\" she added. \"We have seen a huge decrease in crime because of those efforts.\"\nAs well as crime, Trump also spoke at length about homelessness in Washington DC.\n\"We're getting rid of the slums,\" he said, without giving further details. He said homeless people would be sent elsewhere but did not say where.\nTrump added that \"everything should be perfect\" when dignitaries and foreign leaders visit the city.\n\"It's a very strong reflection of our country,\" he said. \"If our capital is dirty, our whole country is dirty and they don't respect us.\"\nLocal groups working with homeless people in the capital told the BBC they had actually seen progress in recent years.\nHomelessness is down almost 20% for individuals in Washington DC in 2025 compared to five years ago, said Ralph Boyd, the president and chief executive of So Others Might Eat (SOME) - a group that provides people in the city with housing, clothing and other social services.\nHe also said Trump's proposal to move people out of the city was not a long-term solution.\n\"All it will do is transfer the problem somewhere else into communities that are perhaps less equipped to deal with it than we are,\" Boyd said.\nMeanwhile, outside the White House, protesters concerned about Trump's actions gathered and chanted \"hands off DC\" and \"protect home rule\".\n\"Trump does not care about DC's safety, he cares about control,\" a speaker at the event said.\nThe president's actions follow a series of social media posts in recent days in which he has criticised the running of Washington DC. Trump has long complained about the city's Democratic leadership for their handling of crime and homelessness.\nHe has also expressed concern for a former employee of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) who was attacked in the city last week.\nDuring Monday's press conference, Trump said the employee was \"savagely beaten by a band of roaming thugs\" and was \"left dripping in blood\".\nHe also mentioned other federal government employees and elected officials who have been attacked, including a Democratic lawmaker and an intern.\n\"This is a threat to America,\" Trump said.\nThe first time Trump deployed the National Guard was in June, when he ordered 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to deal with unrest over raids on undocumented migrants.\nThe last time the National Guard was deployed to Washington DC was in response to the Capitol riot in 2021.\nWith additional reporting from Madeline Halpert",
            "Trump seizes control of Washington DC police and deploys national guard. Donald Trump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized control of the city\u2019s police force, describing a \u201clawless\u201d city in ways that are sharply at odds with official crime statistics.\nThe US president\u2019s move was swiftly condemned as a \u201cdisgusting, dangerous and derogatory\u201d assault on the political independence of a racially diverse city. The federal takeover is expected to be in effect for 30 days, the White House confirmed to the Guardian.\nSpeaking at a White House press conference on Monday, Trump said he was taking \u201ca historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back.\u201d\nHe described Washington DC as \u201cone of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world\u201d, claiming its murder rate is higher than Bogot\u00e1 or Mexico City, even though violent crime is at a 30-year low.\nThe defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who was among officials joining Trump on the podium, said 800 national guard troops would take to the streets of Washington over the coming week. \u201cThey will be strong, they will be tough and they will stand with their law enforcement partners,\u201d he said.\nTrump, who lost the presidential election in DC to Democrat Kamala Harris by 86 percentage points, added that he may send in the military \u201cif needed\u201d.\nBy invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, the president is federalising DC\u2019s Metropolitan police department for the first time in its history. He said he was declaring a public safety emergency and putting the police under the control of the attorney general, Pam Bondi.\nTrump vowed to allow police to \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d in the face of provocations. \u201cThat\u2019s the only language they [alleged criminals] understand. They like to spit in the face of the police. You spit, and we hit, and they get hit real hard.\u201d\nSection 740 requires the mayor, Muriel Bowser, to provide \u201csuch services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\u201d, when the president determines that there are \u201cspecial conditions\u201d requiring it. The president can only exercise such control under the act for 30 days without Congress passing a law extending it.\nAfter the former General Services Administration staffer Edward Coristine \u2013 a 19-year-old on the so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d team nicknamed \u201cBig Balls\u201d \u2013 appeared to have been attacked by a group of young people last week near his car, Trump began discussing a return to federal control of the city and the use of national guard to quell street crime.\nWashington DC was hit hard by the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, recording more homicides in 2023 than in any year since 1997. At that time it was among the top five homicide rates in major population centres \u2013 those with more than a million residents \u2013 behind only Memphis in Tennessee, St Louis in Missouri and Baltimore in Maryland, according to the non-profit USAFacts.\nBut violent crime in Washington DC has fallen sharply since 2023, shaking off the pandemic increases to reach a 30-year low on the day Trump took office, and has fallen 26% further this year according to weekly reports from the Metropolitan police department. The change in crime rates is consistent with dramatic decreases in violence in large cities across the country.\nThe capital is much safer than it used to be. In 1991 it was branded the murder capital of the US with the killing of 482 people. By last year the total number of homicides had fallen to 187. This year the rate is on course to be lower.\nNonetheless, Trump ordered a range of federal law enforcement agencies to deploy on to DC streets over the weekend in a surge. About 450 officers from the United States Capitol police, the Federal Protective Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other agencies were present into the city\u2019s quadrants over the weekend.\nAt the press conference on Monday morning, Trump painted a nightmarish portrait of a city \u201covertaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people\u201d.\nThe DC attorney general, Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host only confirmed to her role on 2 August, said she saw \u201ctoo much violent crime being committed by young punks who think that they can get together in gangs and crews and beat the hell out of you or anyone else\u201d.\nPirro expressed her frustration with what she views as excessive leniency when it comes to the way juveniles are prosecuted. \u201cI can\u2019t arrest them. I can\u2019t prosecute them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey go to family court, and they get to do yoga and arts and crafts. Enough, it changes today.\u201d\nPirro called for changes to the law to allow a wider range of juvenile cases to be heard in adult court.\nAgain taking to social media on Sunday, Trump demanded that homeless residents of the capital leave, posting images of encampments ostensibly taken from his motorcade.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday morning, shortly after being driven from the White House to his golf club in Virginia. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.\u201d\nHomelessness rates in the nation\u2019s capital have also been falling, with the most recent point-in-time count showing a decrease from 2024.\nMonday\u2019s announcement by Trump, who pardoned his supporters who attacked the US Capitol in Washington on 6 January 2021, was criticised by Democrats and civil rights leaders.\nEleanor Holmes Norton, a non-voting delegate representing DC in the House of Representatives, said the decision \u201cis an historic assault on DC home rule, is a counterproductive, escalatory seizure of DC\u2019s resources to use for purposes not supported by DC residents, and is more evidence of the urgent need to pass my DC statehood bill\u201d.\nKen Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: \u201cTrump is once again playing political games using service members and federal law enforcement officials. Trump doesn\u2019t give a damn about keeping DC residents safe.\n\u201cWhen rioters violently stormed the Capitol and there were repeated requests for the national guard, Trump failed to act. To add insult to injury, he released from jail those 1,500 violent insurrectionists who assaulted police officers and broke local and federal law.\u201d\nAl Sharpton, the founder and president of the National Action Network, suggested that the intervention was motivated by a desire to distract from criticisms over the administration\u2019s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\u201cDonald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration\u2019s handling of the Epstein files.\u201d\nLater Muriel Bowser, the mayor of DC, who has pursued a non-confrontational relationship with Trump, described the intervention as \u201cunsettling and unprecedented\u201d but declined to criticise the president directly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve said before, and I\u2019ll repeat, that I believe that the president\u2019s view of DC is shaped by his Covid-era experience during his first term,\u201d she told reporters.\n\u201cIt is true that those were more challenging times related to some issues. It is also true that we experienced a crime spike post-Covid but we worked quickly to put laws in place and tactics that got violent offenders off our streets, and gave our police officers more tools.\u201d\nBowser said her office plans to follow the law and cooperate with the federal government, though \u201cI don\u2019t want to minimise the intrusion on our autonomy\u201d. She has requested a meeting with Bondi, who will temporarily oversee the Metropolitan police department.\nFlanked by Pamela Smith, the DC police chief, and other city officials, Bowser added: \u201cWhile this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, we\u2019re totally surprised. I can say to DC residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\u201d\nAsked about Trump\u2019s hint that he could deploy the US military if required, the mayor replied: \u201cI think I speak for all Americans. We don\u2018t believe it is legal to use the American military against American citizens on American soil. I am not a lawyer, but I think that is a fairly widely held fact.\u201d\nMeanwhile Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader in the House, described Trump as a \u201cwannabe king\u201d and argued his plan to \u201cunleash the national guard on the city\u2019s youth and homeless population has no basis in law and will put the safety of the people of our nation\u2019s capital in danger\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cWe stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.\u201d\nShrai Popat contributed reporting"

            "CDC shooter believed COVID vaccine was harmful; union says misinformation put staff at risk. Susan Haigh, Associated Press\nSusan Haigh, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nA Georgia man who had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal has been identified as the shooter who opened fire late Friday on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, killing a police officer.\nThe 30-year-old suspect, who died during the incident, had also tried to get into the CDC\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday.\nREAD MORE: Authorities identify suspect who opened fire at CDC in Atlanta, killing one police officer\nThe man, identified as Patrick Joseph White, was armed with five guns, including at least one long gun, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.\nA union representing workers at the CDC said the incident was not random and \u201ccompounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured.\u201d It demanded federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, saying it was putting scientists at risk.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the shooting and the continuing investigation:\nPolice say White opened fire outside the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday, leaving bullet marks in windows across the sprawling campus. At least four CDC buildings were hit, Director Susan Monarez said on X.\nDeKalb County Police Officer David Rose was mortally wounded while responding. Rose, 33, a former Marine who served in Afghanistan, had graduated from the police academy in March.\nWhite was found on the second floor of a building across the street from the CDC campus and died at the scene, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said. He added that \u201cwe do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted.\u201d\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigations said the crime scene was \u201ccomplex\u201d and the investigation would take \u201can extended period of time.\u201d\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, said the CDC and leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services must provide a \u201cclear and unequivocal stance in condemning vaccine disinformation.\u201d\nSuch a public statement by federal officials is needed to help prevent violence against scientists, the union said in a news release.\n\u201cTheir leadership is critical in reinforcing public trust and ensuring that accurate, science-based information prevails,\u201d the union said.\nFired But Fighting, a group of laid-off CDC employees, has said HHS Secretary Robert F.

Gunman in CDC shooting fired nearly 500 shots after breaking into his father\u2019s gun safe. Here\u2019s what we know\nBy Chris Youd, Brenda Goodman, Meg Tirrell, Ryan Young, Jason Morris, Dakin Andone, CNN\n(CNN) \u2014 The gunman who opened fire Friday at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention broke into his father\u2019s safe to get the five firearms recovered at the scene, state investigators said Tuesday, as some CDC workers seeking answers and reassurance from leadership were left dissatisfied by a short agency-wide meeting about the shooting.\nThe shooter, Patrick Joseph White, fired nearly 500 rounds during the shooting, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said at a news conference Tuesday. Most of the shell casings found at the scene were from a long gun, one of the weapons White took from his father, the GBI said.\nWhite \u2013 who GBI Director Chris Hosey confirmed died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound \u2013 had expressed discontent with the Covid-19 vaccine in written documents recovered from his home. White \u201cwanted to make the public aware of his public distrust of the vaccines,\u201d Hosey said.\nThe investigative updates Tuesday came as the CDC held an all-agency meeting where staffers hoped to get more details about last week\u2019s shooting \u2013 the latest example of the ongoing turmoil at one of the world\u2019s top health agencies, more than five years after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nInstead, some who listened said they found the call lacking: No new information was shared, and comments were disabled, preventing anyone from asking questions, according to two CDC sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the meeting.\n\u201cNot much new in that meeting,\u201d one CDC source said, describing it as \u201cmore for our hearts than our heads.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what else we know:\nHundreds of shots were fired\nThe shooting started just before 5 p.m. Friday at a CVS drugstore directly across from the CDC\u2019s main entrance. DeKalb County police officer David Rose arrived as White fired on the CDC complex; on Tuesday, investigators confirmed Rose was fatally shot by White.\nNo one at the CDC was injured in the shooting.\nOf the nearly 500 shots fired, about 200 struck six CDC buildings on the campus, which is located near Emory University on the eastern edge of Atlanta.\nMost of those shots were fired by a long gun, investigators said \u2013 one of the five weapons White had stolen from his father. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has determined all the firearms belonged to White\u2019s father.\nAll five firearms \u2013 a mix of rifles, a shotgun and a handgun \u2013 were recovered, Hosey said, noting that White\u2019s family is cooperating with the ongoing investigation.\nShooter \u2018verbalized thoughts of suicide\u2019\nWhite had no known criminal history, Hosey told reporters Tuesday.\nBut he had \u201crecently verbalized thoughts of suicide,\u201d Hosey said, and law enforcement was contacted several weeks before the shooting. It is unclear who reached out to law enforcement.\nA law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN the gunman took his own life after unsuccessfully attempting to leave the CVS. Investigators believe White ran out of some of his ammunition, but the door was locked and would not open after firing a few rounds at it, the law enforcement official said.\nCDC holds all-hands meeting\nThe CDC\u2019s all-agency meeting Tuesday had been pre-scheduled following the confirmation of Director Dr. Susan Monarez, according to a CDC staffer who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal. But the staffer noted they had been told the meeting\u2019s content clearly would change because of Friday\u2019s shooting.\nMany CDC employees are looking for more information on how exactly the shooter tried to get onto campus and how he was deterred. They also want agency leadership to acknowledge the role the Trump administration\u2019s smears of federal employees and vaccines had apparently played in the attack.\nThe meeting Tuesday was brief, lasting about 17 minutes. The information that was shared by Monarez and Jeff Williams \u2013 who leads the Office of Safety, Security and Management \u2013 largely repeated what was already known about the incident and the extensive damage to CDC buildings. Both Monarez and Williams honored Rose.\nEmployees were supposed to hear an update on available mental health resources from acting Chief Operating Officer Christa Capozzola, but she had trouble connecting to the call.\n\u201cThey had lots of technical challenges,\u201d one CDC source said. \u201cIn their defense, most of that team was RIF\u2019d,\u201d the source added, referring to extensive reduction-in-force layoffs of federal employees earlier this year. The CDC lost about a quarter of its staff.\n\u201cThis was such a mess,\u201d said a second CDC employee who listened to the meeting. \u201cAll the chats are popping about how bad and disrespectful it was,\u201d that employee said, describing group messages shared after the meeting.\nCDC employees want to know why there wasn\u2019t an earlier announcement to seek cover and why some did not receive a text alert from the agency\u2019s security system.\nThe second CDC staffer who listened to the call said they had hoped to see agency leaders \u201cbeing human, actually talking to us \u2013 allowing for questions.\u201d\n\u201cDr. Monarez and CDC leadership remain focused on supporting staff during an extraordinarily difficult time as evidenced by their continued direct engagement. Friday\u2019s shooting was a traumatic event for the agency, and leadership is working to provide continued updates along with resources for healing and recovery. There will be continued opportunities for staff engagement and dialogue in the days ahead,\u201d Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said Tuesday.\n\u201cThis is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce and we hope the media will respect the moment rather than exploiting a tragedy and further exacerbating an already harrowing experience by the dedicated CDC staff,\u201d he added.\nThe CDC has come under fire during the second Trump administration as conspiracy theories continue to plague the vaccines credited with halting the spread of Covid-19. On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2013 a longtime critic of Covid vaccinations, with a history of spreading vaccine misinformation \u2013 visited the CDC offices.\nThe purpose of Kennedy\u2019s visit was \u201cto offer condolences to the family of police officer David Rose\u201d and \u201cto offer support to all the CDC employees who are part of a shining star health agency around the world,\u201d he said in an interview with Scripps News taped Monday.\nWhen asked what would be done to stop the spread of vaccine misinformation to prevent incidents like Friday\u2019s shooting, Kennedy said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know enough about what the motive was of this individual.\u201d\nIn an internal video sent to staff ahead of Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Monarez said, \u201cScience and public health should never be under attack.\u201d\nMonarez appeared emotional in the video as she pledged support for CDC employees left \u201cshaken, saddened and deeply concerned.\u201d\n\u201cMy thoughts are with everyone impacted, and I want you to know that your safety, your well-being, and your sense of security remain my highest priority,\u201d Monarez said. \u201cScience and public health should never be under attack. What we do here is about protecting lives. It\u2019s about preventing suffering and building healthier communities. Acts of violence will never weaken our resolve.\u201d\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story\u2019s headline misstated the number of rounds the shooter fired at the CDC.\nCNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

            "Man charged with beheading father says he was trying to perform a citizen's arrest. Man charged with beheading father says he was trying to perform a citizen's arrest\nA Pennsylvania man accused of killing and beheading his father testified in his defense\nDOYLESTOWN, Pa. -- The Pennsylvania man charged with fatally shooting then beheading his father and posting it on YouTube said on the stand Wednesday that the killing was \u201cPlan B\u201d after trying to arrest his father for what he called false statements and treason.\nJustin D. Mohn, 33, took the stand in a suburban Philadelphia courtroom on the third day of his trial on murder and other charges stemming from the Jan. 30, 2024, homicide of his father, Michael F. Mohn.\nMohn, dressed in a blue sport coat, shirt and tie, with his arms shackled to his waist, spoke clearly without any apparent emotion for more than two hours of direct testimony and cross examination.\nResponding to questions from his attorney, Steven Jones, Mohn said he shot his father in the bathroom of the family's Levittown home after telling him he was going to arrest him. Mohn said his father, who he said was an experienced martial artist, told him he would kill him before he let that happen and reached for the gun.\n\u201cUnfortunately, he resisted,\u201d Justin Mohn said, adding: \u201cI was hoping to perform a citizen\u2019s arrest on my father for, ultimately, treason.\"\nHe described a list from his notebook, shown during the trial, that had the lines \u201cBoom\u201d and \u201cSlice\u201d as his \u201cPlan B,\u201d and said he expected his father to go along with the citizen's arrest.\nHe said he differed politically from his parents, describing them as on the left. He told the court he believed his father wanted to stop him from becoming a politician similar to President Donald Trump and that his father gave false statements in an unrelated civil case Justin Mohn brought in federal court.\nAsked why he beheaded his father, he said he wanted to send a message to federal government workers to meet his demands, which included their resignation as well as the cancellation of public debt, among other things. He said he didn't do it out of hatred for his father or to cause trauma to his family. His mother, Denice Mohn, cried in court at the end of the direct questioning from his attorney.\n\u201cI knew something such as a severed head would not only go viral but could lessen the violence,\u201d Justin Mohn said.\nProsecutors said Mohn shot his father with a newly purchased pistol, then decapitated him with a kitchen knife and machete. The 14-minute YouTube video he posted was live for several hours before it was removed.\nMohn was arrested later that day after scaling a fence at Fort Indiantown Gap, the state\u2019s National Guard headquarters. He said in court he knew it was wrong to jump the fence at the site. Prosecutors said he called for others to join him in attempting to overthrow the U.S. government.\nMohn had a USB device containing photos of federal buildings and apparent instructions for making explosives when he was arrested, authorities said.\nHe also expressed violent anti-government rhetoric in writings he published online, going back several years. Earlier in the trial, the judge heard from Justin Mohn\u2019s mother, who said police came to the house he shared with his parents and warned him about his online postings before the killing.\nDenice Mohn testified that she and her husband had been offering financial support and guidance as Justin Mohn looked for a job.\nProsecutors described the homicide as \u201csomething straight out of a horror film.\u201d They said Justin Mohn killed his father \u2014 who had been an engineer with the geoenvironmental section of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 Philadelphia District \u2014 to intimidate federal workers, calling it a \u201ccold, calculated, organized plan.\u201d\nThe YouTube video included rants about the government, immigration and the border, fiscal policy, urban crime and the war in Ukraine.\nIn court, Michael Mohn was remembered as a good neighbor and supportive father. In the video posted on YouTube, Justin Mohn described his father as a 20-year federal employee and called him a traitor.\nDuring a competency hearing last year, a defense expert said Mohn wrote a letter to Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States seeking to strike a deal to give Mohn refuge and apologizing to President Vladimir Putin for claiming to be the czar of Russia. The judge ruled Mohn was competent to stand trial.\nEvidence presented at the trial included graphic photos and the video posted to YouTube. The judge warned members of the public at the trial about the images and said they could leave before the photos were shown. The proceedings are known as a bench trial, with only a judge, not a jury.\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

            "NOAA delays the cutoff of key satellite data for hurricane forecasting. NOAA delays the cutoff of key satellite data for hurricane forecasting\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says it is delaying by one month the planned cutoff of satellite data that helps forecasters track hurricanes\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday it is delaying by one month the planned cutoff of satellite data that helps forecasters track hurricanes.\nMeteorologists and scientists warned of severe consequences last week when NOAA said, in the midst of this year\u2019s hurricane season, that it would almost immediately discontinue key data collected by three weather satellites that the agency jointly runs with the Defense Department.\nThe Defense Meteorological Satellite Program\u2019s microwave data gives key information that can\u2019t be gleaned from conventional satellites. That includes three-dimensional details of a storm, what's going on inside of it and what it is doing in the overnight hours, experts say.\nThe data was initially planned to be cut off on June 30 \u201cto mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk,\u201d NOAA\u2019s announcement said. The agency now says it's postponing that until July 31. Peak hurricane season is usually from mid-August to mid-October.\nSpokespeople from NOAA and the Navy did not immediately respond to a request for more details about the update.\nNOAA \u2014 which has been the subject of hefty Department of Government Efficiency cuts this year \u2014 said Friday the satellite program accounts for a \u201csingle dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools\u201d in the National Weather Service's portfolio.\nThe agency's \u201cdata sources are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nBut Union of Concerned Scientists science fellow Marc Alessi told The Associated Press on Friday that detecting the rapid intensification, and more accurately predicting the likely path, of storms is critical as climate change worsens the extreme weather experienced across the globe.\n\u201cNot only are we losing the ability to make better intensification forecasts, we are also losing the ability to predict accurately where a tropical cyclone could be going, if it\u2019s in its development stages,\u201d Alessi said. \"This data is essential.\n\u201cOn the seasonal forecasting front, we would see the effects,\" he added, \"but also on the long-term climate change front, we now are losing an essential piece to monitoring global warming.\u201d\n___\nAlexa St. John is an Associated Press climate reporter.

            "Why forecasters are concerned about losing 3 key satellites ahead of peak hurricane season. Chris Vagasky, The Conversation\nChris Vagasky, The Conversation\nLeave your feedback\nAbout 600 miles off the west coast of Africa, large clusters of thunderstorms begin organizing into tropical storms every hurricane season. They aren\u2019t yet in range of Hurricane Hunter flights, so forecasters at the National Hurricane Center rely on weather satellites to peer down on these storms and beam back information about their location, structure and intensity.\nThe satellite data helps meteorologists create weather forecasts that keep planes and ships safe and prepare countries for a potential hurricane landfall.\nNow, meteorologists are about to lose access to three of those satellites.\nWATCH: As hurricane season begins, federal agencies overseeing storms face barrage of challenges\nOn June 25, 2025, the Trump administration issued a service change notice announcing that the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, DMSP, and the Navy\u2019s Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center would terminate data collection, processing and distribution of all DMSP data no later than June 30. The data termination was postponed until July 31 following a request from the head of NASA\u2019s Earth Science Division.\nHow hurricanes form. NOAA\nI am a meteorologist who studies lightning in hurricanes and helps train other meteorologists to monitor and forecast tropical cyclones. Here is how meteorologists use the DMSP data and why they are concerned about it going dark.\nAt its most basic, a weather satellite is a high-resolution digital camera in space that takes pictures of clouds in the atmosphere.\nThese are the satellite images you see on most TV weather broadcasts. They let meteorologists see the location and some details of a hurricane\u2019s structure, but only during daylight hours.\nHurricane Flossie spins off the Mexican coast on July 1, 2025. Images show the top of the hurricane from space as day turns to night. Image provided by NOAA/GOES\nMeteorologists can use infrared satellite data, similar to a thermal imaging camera, at all hours of the day to find the coldest cloud-top temperatures, highlighting areas where the highest wind speeds and rainfall rates are found.\nBut while visible and infrared satellite imagery are valuable tools for hurricane forecasters, they provide only a basic picture of the storm. It\u2019s like a doctor diagnosing a patient after a visual exam and checking their temperature.\nInfrared bands show more detail of Hurricane Flossie\u2019s structure on July 1, 2025. Image provided by NOAA/GOES\nFor more accurate diagnoses, meteorologists rely on the DMSP satellites.\nThe three satellites orbit Earth 14 times per day with special sensor microwave imager/sounder instruments, or SSMIS. These let meteorologists look inside the clouds, similar to how an MRI in a hospital looks inside a human body. With these instruments, meteorologists can pinpoint the storm\u2019s low-pressure center and identify signs of intensification.\nPrecisely locating the center of a hurricane improves forecasts of the storm\u2019s future track. This lets meteorologists produce more accurate hurricane watches, warnings and evacuations.\nREAD MORE: An expert shares key 5 steps for hurricane disaster preparation with aging parents\nHurricane track forecasts have improved by up to 75% since 1990. However, forecasting rapid intensification is still difficult, so the ability of DMPS data to identify signs of intensification is important.\nAbout 80% of major hurricanes \u2013 those with wind speeds of at least 111 mph (179 kilometers per hour) \u2013 rapidly intensify at some point, ramping up the risks they pose to people and property on land. Finding out when storms are about to undergo intensification allows meteorologists to warn the public about these dangerous hurricanes.\nNOAA\u2019s Office of Satellite and Product Operations described the reason for turning off the flow of data as a need to mitigate \u201ca significant cybersecurity risk.\u201d\nThe three satellites have already operated for longer than planned.\nThe DMSP satellites were launched between 1999 and 2009 and were designed to last for five years. They have now been operating for more than 15 years. The United States Space Force recently concluded that the DMSP satellites would reach the end of their lives between 2023 and 2026, so the data would likely have gone dark soon.\nThree other satellites in orbit \u2013 NOAA-20, NOAA-21 and Suomi NPP \u2013 have a microwave instrument known as the advanced technology microwave sounder.\nThe advanced technology microwave sounder, or ATMS, can provide data similar to the special sensor microwave imager/sounder, or SSMIS, but at a lower resolution. It provides a more washed-out view that is less useful than the SSMIS for pinpointing a storm\u2019s location or estimating its intensity.\nImages of Hurricane Erick off the coast of Mexico, viewed from NOAA-20\u2019s ATMS (left) and DMPS SSMIS (right) on June 18 show the difference in resolution and the higher detail provided by the SSMIS data. Image provided by U.S. Naval Research Laboratory via Michael Lowry\nThe U.S. Space Force began using data from a new defense meteorology satellite, ML-1A, in late April 2025.\nML-1A is a microwave satellite that will help replace some of the DMSP satellites\u2019 capabilities. However, the government hasn\u2019t announced whether the ML-1A data will be available to forecasters, including those at the National Hurricane Center.\nSatellite programs are planned over many years, even decades, and are very expensive. The current geostationary satellite program launched its first satellite in 2016 with plans to operate until 2038. Development of the planned successor for GOES-R began in 2019.\nSimilarly, plans for replacing the DMSP satellites have been underway since the early 2000s.\nScientists prepare a GOES-R satellite for packing aboard a rocket in 2016. Photo by Charles Babir/NASA\nDelays in developing the satellite instruments and funding cuts caused the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System and Defense Weather Satellite System to be canceled in 2010 and 2012 before any of their satellites could be launched.\nThe 2026 NOAA budget request includes an increase in funding for the next-generation geostationary satellite program, so it can be restructured to reuse spare parts from existing geostationary satellites. The budget also terminates contracts for ocean color, atmospheric composition and advanced lightning mapper instruments.\nThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, is forecast to be above average, with six to 10 hurricanes. The most active part of the season runs from the middle of August to the middle of October, after the DMSP satellite data is set to be turned off.\nHurricane forecasters will continue to use all available tools, including satellite, radar, weather balloon and dropsonde data, to monitor the tropics and issue hurricane forecasts. But the loss of satellite data, along with other cuts to data, funding and staffing, could ultimately put more lives at risk.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "Deep cuts to hurricane data could leave forecasters in the dark as storm season looms. Forecasters are expected to lose some of their sharpest eyes in the sky just a few months before Atlantic hurricane season peaks when the Department of Defense halts a key source of satellite data over cybersecurity concerns.\nThe data comes from microwave sensors attached to three aging polar-orbiting satellites operated for both military and civilian purposes. Data from the sensors is critical to hurricane forecasters because it allows them to peer through layers of clouds and into the center of a storm, where rain and thunderstorms develop, even at night. The sensors don\u2019t rely on visible light.\nLosing the data \u2014 at a time when the National Weather Service is releasing fewer weather balloons and the agency is short on meteorologists because of budget cuts \u2014 would make it more likely that forecasters miss key developments in a hurricane, several hurricane experts said. Those changes help meteorologists determine what level of threat a storm may pose and therefore how emergency managers ought to prepare. Microwave data offers some of the earliest indications that sustained winds are strengthening inside a storm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the instrument that allows us to look under the hood. It\u2019s definitely a significant loss. There\u2019s no doubt at all hurricane forecasts will be degraded because of this,\u201d said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher and senior research associate at the University of Miami\u2019s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. \u201cThey\u2019re able to detect when an eye wall forms in a tropical storm and if it\u2019s intensifying \u2014 or rapidly intensifying.\u201d\nA revised announcement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published Monday said that the cuts have been delayed by a month.\nResearchers think rapid intensification is becoming more likely in tropical storms as the oceans warm as a result of human-caused climate change.\nThe three satellites are operated for both military and civilian purposes through the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, a joint effort of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Defense.\nWhile hurricane experts said they were concerned about losing the tool, Kim Doster, NOAA\u2019s communications director, downplayed the decision\u2019s effect on hurricane forecasting by the National Weather Service.\nIn an email, Doster said the military\u2019s microwave data \u201cis a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the NWS portfolio.\u201d\nDoster said these models include data from geostationary satellites \u2014 a different system that constantly observes Earth from about 22,300 miles away and offers a vantage point that appears fixed because the satellites synchronize with Earth\u2019s rotation.\nThey also ingest measurements from Hurricane Hunter aircraft missions, buoys, weather balloons, land-based radar and from other polar-orbiting satellites, including NOAA\u2019s Joint Polar Satellite System, which she said provides \u201cthe richest, most accurate satellite weather observations available.\u201d\nA U.S. Space Force official said the satellites and their instruments in question remain functional and that the data will be sent directly to weather satellite readout terminals across the DOD. The Navy\u2019s Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center made the decision to stop processing that data and sharing it publicly, the official said.\nThe Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLast week, a division of the Navy notified researchers that it would cease to process and share the data on or before June 30, and some researchers received an email from the Navy\u2019s Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, saying that its data storage and sharing program relied on a processing station that was using an \u201cend-of-life\u201d operating system with vulnerabilities.\n\u201cThe operating system cannot be upgraded, poses a cybersecurity concern, and introduces risk to DoD networks,\u201d the email, which was reviewed by NBC News, said.\nThat notice was later revised to say that the agency now expects to decommission data processing no later than July 31st. A NASA scientist requested postponing the cuts to allow data sharing to continue, according to the updated announcement.\nThe move would have cut the amount of microwave data available to forecasters in half, McNoldy estimated.\nThis microwave data is also used by snow and ice scientists to track the extent of polar sea ice, which helps scientists understand long-term climate trends. Sea ice forms from frozen ocean water. It grows in coverage during winter months and typically melts during warmer times of the year. Sea ice reflects sunlight back into space, which cools the planet. That makes it an important metric to track over time. The extent of summer Arctic sea ice is trending lower because of global warming.\nWalt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, said his program learned of the Navy\u2019s decision earlier this week.\nMeier said the satellites and sensors are about 16 years old. Researchers have been preparing for them to eventually fail, but they weren\u2019t expecting the military to pull the plug on data with little warning, he said.\nMeier said the National Snow and Ice Data Center has relied on the military satellites for data on sea ice coverage since 1987, but will adapt its systems to use similar microwave data from a Japanese satellite, called AMSR-2, instead.\n\u201cIt certainly could be a few weeks before we get that data into our system,\u201d Meier said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to undermine our sea ice climate data record in terms of confidence in it, but it\u2019s going to be more challenging.\u201d\nThe polar-orbiting satellites that are part of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program provide intermittent coverage of hurricane-prone areas.\nThe satellites typically zip around the globe in a north-south orientation every 90-100 minutes in a relatively low orbit, Meier said. The microwave sensors scan across a narrow swath of the earth, which Meier estimated at roughly 1,500 miles.\nAs the Earth rotates, these polar-orbiting satellites can capture imagery that helps researchers determine the structure and potential intensity of a storm, if it happens to be in their path.\n\u201cIt\u2019s often just by luck, you\u2019ll get a really nice pass over a hurricane,\u201d McNoldy said, adding that the change will reduce the geographic area covered by microwave scans and the frequency of scans of a particular storm.\nAndy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist with the University of Miami Cooperative Institute for Marine & Atmospheric Studies, said the microwave data is used in some hurricane models and also by forecasters who can access near real-time visualizations of the data.\nHazelton said forecasters are always looking for visual signatures in microwave data that often provide the first evidence a storm is rapidly intensifying and building strength.\nThe National Hurricane Center defines rapid intensification as a 35-mph or higher increase in sustained winds inside a tropical storm within 24 hours. Losing the microwave data is particularly important now because in recent years, scientists have observed an increase in rapid intensification, a trend likely fueled in part by climate change as ocean waters warm.\nA 2023 study published the journal Scientific Reports found that tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean were about 29% more likely to undergo rapid intensification from 2001 to 2020, compared to 1971 to 1990. Last year, Hurricane Milton strengthened from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just 36 hours. Some of that increase took place overnight, when other satellite instruments offer less information.\nThe trend is particularly dangerous when a storm, like Hurricane Idalia, intensifies just before striking the coast.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly seen in recent years many cases of rapid intensification ahead of landfall. That\u2019s the kind of thing you really don\u2019t want to miss,\u201d McNoldy said, adding that microwave data is \u201cexcellent at giving the important extra 12 hours of lead time to see the inner core changes happening.\u201d\nBrian LaMarre, the former meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service\u2019s weather forecasting station in Tampa Bay, said the data is also useful for predicting flood impacts as a hurricane comes ashore.\n\u201cThat scan can help predict where the heavier precipitation and rainfall rates can be,\u201d LaMarre said. \u201cThis data is critically important to public safety.\u201d\nHurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. It typically starts to peak in late summer and early fall. NOAA forecasters have predicted a more busy 2025 hurricane season than typical, with six to 10 hurricanes."

            "Jane St impact: Are mysterious price moves in Nifty 50 options sign of market manipulation?. Traders say one tell-tale sign of abnormal price action can be seen in the so-called straddle on the NSE Nifty 50 Index. A hard-to-explain increase in its price during expiration days has become a common sighting in recent years, though it doesn\u2019t always happen. It was visible as recently as mid-May.\nA straddle is a bet on volatility that involves buying both a bullish and bearish option on the same asset, with the same exercise level. In a normal situation, the price of the strategy falls gradually throughout the day as the expiration approaches.\n\u201cOver the past two years, on several expiry days, we could see the straddle price go higher by multiples of the starting price, and sometimes not exhibit any theta decay at all\u201d for long periods of time during the session, said Devansh Gupta, managing director at New Delhi-based quantitative trading firm Algoquant, referring to the erosion of value for options as their expiration nears. \u201cThe math made no sense.\u201d\nIndian markets were plunged into the global spotlight earlier this month, when the nation\u2019s regulator temporarily barred Jane Street Group LLC from securities trading in an order citing index manipulation. The US firm has denied the allegations, saying it was deploying an arbitrage strategy.\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India didn\u2019t specifically mention straddles in its order, though it flagged unexplained variations in option prices. The example it highlighted focused on weekly contracts tracking the NSE Nifty Bank Index, which were discontinued late last year as part of SEBI curbs to halt a derivatives frenzy that triggered billions of dollars in losses for retail traders.\nThe straddle became a tool to track whether options prices on expiration days were becoming detached from the underlying asset for large stretches of time, according to about half a dozen high-speed traders that Bloomberg News spoke to before the SEBI order was released. When the unusual pattern emerged, it likely reflected the presence of a whale making big bets in the market, they said.\nThe traders also noticed the abnormal trading in less liquid options on the BSE Sensex Index, among other gauges.\nEarlier this month, a SEBI official told Bloomberg News the regulator will expand its market-manipulation probe to include trades around other major equity gauges, including the Nifty 50 and Sensex.\nThere may be patterns similar to those described in the July 4 order in other indexes or trading behaviors reflecting alternate strategies that have not yet been analyzed, SEBI board member Ananth Narayan wrote in the document, adding that the regulator observed some suspicious activity on the May 15 expiration day.\nMarket activity has slowed in Indian derivatives since Jane Street was barred from trading. On Thursday, the first major expiration day that followed the ban, the India NSE Volatility Index tracking bets for Nifty 50 swings ended at its lowest level in more than a year, and volume of options on the gauge was lower than on recent expiration days.\nThe total premium paid for the derivatives on the nation\u2019s largest bourse tumbled to a four-month low. That day, the strange pattern on the Nifty 50 straddle was nowhere to be seen.\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel)\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

            "Accelerated glacial melt and monsoon rains trigger deadly floods in Pakistan. Glaciers across northern Pakistan have been melting at an accelerated pace as a result of record-breaking summer temperatures, leading to deadly flash flooding and landslides.\nThe floods and heavy monsoon rains have caused devastation across the country this summer, killing at least 72 people and injuring more than 130 since the rains began in late June.\nIn the country\u2019s mountainous region of Gilgit-Baltistan, temperatures have risen as high as 48.5C (119.3F), which local officials described as unprecedented in a region that is more than 1,200 metres above sea level and famous for its snow-capped mountains. The previous record was 47 degrees, set in 1971.\nThe region, which spans the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush and the Karakoram mountain ranges, has witnessed an acceleration in the melting of its glaciers in the past week.\nIt has led to the swelling of the local rivers and the formation of unstable lakes that have burst, triggering flash floods and landslides that have washed away villages and roads, cutting off some communities entirely and leaving others without power or drinking water.\nThe head of Gilgit-Baltistan\u2019s disaster management authority, Zakir Hussain, said the region was facing a \u201cvery serious situation\u201d and described the fast formation of volatile glacial lakes as \u201chighly hostile\u201d to people\u2019s safety.\nHe said those in some areas close to the glaciers were being evacuated from their homes. \u201cWe are facing a flood situation in many areas,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rise of temperature has sent a shiver down our spines.

            "Mexico's president calls march against mass tourism 'xenophobic'. Mexico's president calls march against mass tourism 'xenophobic'\nA fierce protest in Mexico City railing against gentrification and mass tourism was fueled by long-running government failures and active promotion to attract digital nomads, according to experts\nMEXICO CITY -- A fierce protest in Mexico City railing against gentrification and mass tourism was fueled by government failures and active promotion to attract digital nomads, according to experts, who said tension had been mounting for years.\nThe criticism comes after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum alleged that Friday's protest was marked by xenophobia, reviving a debate over an influx of Americans in the city.\nMany Mexicans say they've been priced out of their neighborhoods \u2014 in part because of a move made by Sheinbaum in 2022, when she was the Mexico City mayor and signed an agreement with Airbnb and UNESCO to boost tourism and attract digital nomads despite concern over the impact short-term rentals could have.\nOn Friday, that came to a head. A largely peaceful protest of hundreds of demonstrators marched through tourism centers of the city with signs reading \u201cGringo: Stop stealing our home\u201d and \u201cHousing regulations now!\u201d\nNear the end of the march, a group of protesters turned violent, breaking the windows of storefronts and looting a number of businesses. In one case, a protester slammed a butter knife against the window of a restaurant where people were hiding, and another person painted \u201ckill a gringo\u201d on a nearby wall.\n\u201cThe xenophobic displays seen at that protest have to be condemned. No one should be able to say \u2018any nationality get out of our country\u2019 even over a legitimate problem like gentrification,\u201d Sheinbaum said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been open, fraternal.\u201d\nThe frustrations were built upon years of mass tourism and rising rent prices in large swathes of the city. The influx of foreigners began around 2020, when Americans flooded into the Mexico City to work remotely, dodge coronavirus restrictions and take advantage of cheaper living costs.\nIn the years since, choice neighborhoods like Roma and Condesa, lush central areas dotted with cafes and markets, have grown increasingly populated by foreign tourists and the remote workers known as digital nomads, and there are more temporary housing units rented through companies like Airbnb that cater to tourists.\nAs they have, rent and living prices have soared and English has been increasingly common on the streets of those areas. Some groups have described the phenomenon as a sort of \u201cneo-colonialism.\"\nThe Mexico City Anti-Gentrification Front, one of the organizations behind the protest, it was \u201ccompletely against\u201d any acts of physical violence and denied that the protests were xenophobic. Instead, the organization said the protest was a result of years of failures by the local government to address the root of the problems.\n\u201cGentrification isn't just foreigners' fault, it's the fault of the government and these companies that prioritize the money foreigners bring,\u201d the organization said in a statement. Meanwhile \u201cyoung people and the working class can't afford to live here.\u201d\nIn its list of demands, the organization called for greater rent controls, mandates that locals have a voice in larger development projects in their area, stricter laws making it harder for landlords to throw out residents and prioritizing Mexican renters over foreigners.\nMexico\u2019s protest comes on the back of a wave of similar protests across Europe railing against mass tourism. Tensions in Mexico have also been compounded by wider inequalities and the Trump administration targeting Latino communities in the U.S. as it ramps up deportations.\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security took a jab at protesters Sunday, writing in a post on the social media platform X: \u201cIf you are in the United States illegally and wish to join the next protest in Mexico City, use the CBP Home app to facilitate your departure.\u201d\nProtesters' cries against government failures were echoed by experts, who said that surging gentrification is a product of both shortage of affordable housing in the city and longtime government failures to regulate the housing market.\nAntonio Azuela, lawyer and sociologist and others said that they do see the protest as a xenophobic backlash, and around 2020 the core of the problem was the influx of \u201cdigital nomads\u201d in the city, but it grew out of hand because of lax housing laws.\n\u201cWhat has made this explode is lack of regulation in the market,\u201d Azuela said.\nMexico City's government over the course of decades has made a few efforts to control development and create affordable housing.\nLegislators estimated there are about 2.7 million houses and apartments in the city, but it needs about 800,000 more. But such affordable housing developments that have popped up often are pushed off to the fringes of the city, said Luis Salinas, a researcher at National Autonomous University of Mexico who has studied gentrification in Mexico City for years.\nControls, meanwhile, have been marked by lack of enforcement, which developers travel services companies like Airbnb take advantage of, he said.\nToday, more than 26,000 properties in Mexico City are currently listed on Airbnb, according to the Inside Airbnb, an advocacy organization that tracks the company's impact on residential communities through data. That's compared to 36,000 properties in New York City and 19,000 in Barcelona, where protests have also broken out.\n\u201cThe government has treated housing like it\u2019s merchandise,\u201d Salinas said. The actions the government is taking \u201care completely insufficient. The federal government needs to be intervening far more nowadays.\u201d\nAirbnb said it helped contribute more than a billion dollars in \u201ceconomic impact\u201d to Mexico City last year and that spending by guests has supported 46,000 jobs in the city. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed is regulation based not on prohibitions, but on respect for rights and transparency of obligations,\" it said in a statement.\nLast year, Mexico City's government approved the most ambitious rent control law since the 1940s in an effort to control prices and also set caps on short-term rentals to 180 nights a year, but Salinas said that enforcement of short-term rental legislation has been put on pause until after the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nAnd even then, the country's government will have to take far greater actions to get the situation under control, said Azuela.\n\u201cThis isn't going to end by just reigning in Airbnb,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're going to have to do a whole lot more.\u201d\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",
            "Mexico expels 26 cartel figures wanted by US authorities in deal with Trump administration. By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and MAR\u00cdA VERZA\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Mexico has expelled 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States in the latest major deal with the Trump administration as American authorities ratchet up pressure on criminal networks sending drugs across the border, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Tuesday.\nThe cartel leaders and other prominent figures were being flown from Mexico to the U.S. on Tuesday, the person said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the operation that was still ongoing.\nThose being handed over to U.S. custody include Abigael Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, a leader of \u201cLos Cuinis,\u201d a group closely aligned with notorious cartel Jalisco New Generation or CJNG. Another person, Roberto Salazar, is accused of participating in the 2008 killing of a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy, the person said.\nMexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office and Security ministry confirmed the transfers, which were carried out after a promise from the U.S. Justice Department that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty in any of the cases.\nIt\u2019s the second time in months Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs across the border. In February, Mexico handed over to American authorities 29 cartel figures, including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985.\nThose transfers came days before 25% tariffs on Mexican imports were to take effect. Late last month, President Donald Trump spoke with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and agreed to put off threatened 30% tariffs for another 90 days to allow for negotiations.\nSheinbaum has shown a willingness to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically being more aggressive in pursuit of Mexico\u2019s cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico\u2019s sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Trump and others of intervention by the U.S. military.\nThe Trump administration made dismantling dangerous drug cartels a key priority, designating CJNG and seven other Latin American organized crime groups foreign terrorist organizations.\nAbigael Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia is the brother-in-law of CJNG leader Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera Cervantes, a top target of the the U.S. government. He was arrested in February 2015 in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco and had been fighting extradition to the United States since then.\nAlongside his two brothers, he led \u201cLos Cuinis,\u201d which financed the the founding and growth of the CJNG, one of the most powerful and dangerous cartels in Mexico. CJNG traffics hundreds of tons of cocaine, methamphetamine, and fentanyl into the United States and other countries and is known for extreme violence, murders, torture, and corruption.\nOne of his brothers, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, was sentenced in Washington\u2019s federal court in June to 30 years in a U.S. prison after pleading guilty to international cocaine trafficking.

That's why we match so well.\"\nThe episode drops on August 13 at 7 p.m. ET, per the teaser.\nThe \"New Heights\" podcast launched on September 8, 2022, and this marks the first time that Swift appears on the show as a guest, although the brothers have mentioned her several times.\nMost notably, Kelce said in an April 2023 episode that he had made a friendship bracelet for Swift with his number on it, and tried to shoot his shot with her during her Eras Tour concert.\nSwift confirmed in a December 2023 interview with Time magazine that she and Kelce \"started hanging out right after that.\"\nThis appearance on \"New Heights\" also marks one of Swift's rare podcast appearances. The singer has previously appeared on \"The Zach Sang Show\" and Apple Music's \"The Zane Lowe Show.\"\nAt 12:12 a.m. ET on August 12, Swift announced the title of her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"\nWhen the countdown ended, \"New Heights\" released another preview clip of the coming podcast episode, in which Swift reveals her album cover \u2014 though it's blurred out.\nSwift is the world's richest female musician, with an estimated net worth of $1.4 billion, per May data from Bloomberg.\nOver the years, the \"New Heights\" podcast has hosted several high-profile guests, including Brad Pitt, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and LeBron James \u2014 who, like Swift, is a billionaire.\nRepresentatives for Kelce and Swift did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.\nAugust 12, 2025: This story has been updated to reflect the announcement of Swift's new album.",
            "A complete timeline of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's relationship. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been dating since the summer of 2023.\n-\nThe pop star and athlete, both 35, have gushed about each other in interviews.\n-\nSwift is currently rolling out her new album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" with Kelce's help.\n-\nWe'll take a wild guess and say that Travis Kelce's favorite track from Taylor Swift's \"Midnights\" might be \"Mastermind.\"\nShortly after he turned up to the Eras Tour with a friendship bracelet and a dream, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end began dating the multi-Grammy-winning superstar.\nKelce, 35, laid the groundwork in the summer of 2023. He made his feelings known for Swift, 35, after he failed to get some one-on-one time when she performed on his home turf in Missouri. Soon, all the dominoes cascaded in a line: Swift began attending NFL games, openly cheering for the Chiefs, and stepping out with Kelce for date nights in New York City.\nHere's a complete timeline of their relationship so far.\nJuly 8, 2023: Kelce attends Swift's Eras Tour show stop in Kansas City.\nKelce officially entered his Swiftie era when he attended the second of the \"Anti-Hero\" singer's two performances on his home turf.\nBefore the concert at Arrowhead Stadium, Kelce was seen chatting with other Swifties and even trading friendship bracelets, according to a video posted on X (formerly Twitter).\nJuly 26, 2023: A few weeks later, Kelce says on his podcast that he wanted to give Swift his number at the show.\nSpeaking on his podcast, \"New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce,\" the athlete said he was \"butt hurt\" because he couldn't give Swift a friendship bracelet (a tradition among Swift's concertgoers) that included his phone number.\n\"I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,\" Kelce told his brother and cohost, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce.\nJason then asked which number he put on the bracelet \u2014 the number on his Kansas City Chiefs jersey (87) or his phone number.\n\"You know which one,\" Travis responded. He also quipped that while Swift \"doesn't meet anybody\" before her shows, he \"took it personal.\"\nAccording to Swift, she and Kelce began dating \"right after\" the podcast episode aired.\nIn an interview with Time magazine, Swift confirmed her relationship with Kelce and offered details about the beginning of their romance.\n\"This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\" she said. \"We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I'm grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.\"\nSeptember 21, 2023: Kelce says he's \"thrown the ball in her court\" and invites Swift to one of his football games.\nTwo months after his podcast episode, Kelce told ESPN's Pat McAfee that after trying to woo the Grammy winner with a friendship bracelet, he extended an invite to one of his upcoming games.\n\"I told her, 'I've seen you rock the stage at Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead and see which one's a little more lit,'\" Kelce said in the interview.\n\"So we'll see what happens in the near future,\" he added.\nSeptember 24, 2023: Swift attends the Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears three days later.\nSwift sent the internet into meltdown when she accepted to Kelce's invitation. However, according to Swift, the lovebirds were already official by the time she attended her first game on September 24.\n\"By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,\" she told Time. \"I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.\"\nOn that fated day, Swift was photographed wearing Kansas City colors as she watched the game from Kelce's private suite, alongside his mom, Donna Kelce.\nWhen Kelce \u2014 already considered one of the best tight ends in NFL history \u2014 hauled in a touchdown pass from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes in the third quarter, Swift rose to her feet and cheered.\nAfter chest-bumping with another spectator in the box, the singer appeared to shout, \"Let's fucking go!\" as Mama Kelce smiled and applauded.\nAfter the game, images of Kelce and Swift walking out of the stadium together and driving off in his old-school convertible car were shared on X.\nThe pair ended their night at Prime Social Rooftop, which Kelce rented out for Swift, his family, and his teammates, per Entertainment Tonight. In photos obtained by TMZ, the couple wasn't shy about showing their affection for each other as Swift was seen wrapping her arm around Kelce's neck as they chatted with other partygoers.\nIn the days following, an anonymous source told People that Kelce and Swift had been \"hanging out\" and were still in the \"super, super early days\" of getting to know each other.\n\"They're having fun,\" the source told the outlet. \"This was Taylor's first time meeting his mom and dad, and everyone was enjoying themselves.\"\nMeanwhile, Kelce debriefed the Swift-inspired frenzy on his podcast. He thanked her for \"pulling up\" to his game, saying he \"sure as hell enjoyed this weekend.\"\nSeptember 27, 2023: Kelce speaks about Swift again on his podcast.\nDuring an episode of \"New Heights,\" Kelce joked that his personal life is \"not so personal\" anymore.\n\"Shout out to Taylor for pulling up,\" he said. \"That was pretty ballsy.\"\nKelce went on to praise Swift for her behavior with his family at her first Chiefs game.\n\"I just thought it was awesome how everyone in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. The friends and family,\" he said. \"She looked amazing, everybody was talking about her in great light. And on top of that the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course.\"\n\"To see the slow motion chest bumps, to see the high fives with mom,\" he continued. \"To see how Chiefs kingdom was all excited that she was there, that shit was absolutely hysterical and it was definitely a game I'll remember that's for damn sure. And then we just slid off in the getaway car at the end.\"\nOctober 1, 2023: Swift attends a second Chiefs game a week later \u2014 and brings some of her famous friends.\nDuring the Chiefs game against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium in New York, Swift supported Kelce again and brought along some A-list pals.\nSwift was spotted watching the game alongside Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Sabrina Carpenter, Hugh Jackman, Sophie Turner, and Antoni Porowski.\nWhile Swift and Kelce left the stadium separately, it seems they had spent some time together beforehand; the Super Bowl champion was spotted by Page Six leaving Swift's New York apartment that morning.\nOctober 4, 2023: Kelce tries to get the NFL to pull back on its coverage of Swift at his games, declaring on his podcast, \"They're overdoing it.\"\nKelce said the NFL had gone overboard in their coverage of Swift during an episode of his podcast, released on October 4.\n\"I think it's fun when they show who all is at the game. I think it brings a little more to the atmosphere, brings a little bit more to what you're watching,\" Kelce said.\n\"But at the same time, I think they're overdoing it a little bit,\" he continued.\nNBC Sports, which aired the game, frequently cut to shots of Swift cheering on the Chiefs. The NFL also briefly changed its bios on Instagram and X to reference Swift after the Chiefs beat the Jets.\nIn response, the NFL defended its coverage of the pair in a statement obtained by ESPN.\nOctober 5, 2023: Kelce celebrates his 34th birthday. Swift reportedly flies to Missouri to spend the weekend with him.\nAccording to multiple outlets, the \"Fearless\" singer spent a few days with Kelce following his 34th birthday.\nUs Weekly, Page Six, and the Daily Mail reported that Swift flew from her home in Nashville, Tennessee to Kansas City, Missouri the day after his birthday.\nThe two were not seen out together, and an anonymous source told Us Weekly that the pair chose to have a \"chill night\" together.

But there's another end of it where it's like, 'Man, this is a lot.'\"\n\"This is another level of stardom that typically football players don't deal with,\" he added.\nOctober 24, 2023: Kelce's dad praises Swift as \"smart\" and \"genuine.\"\nIn an interview with People, Ed Kelce described Swift as \"a very, very sweet, very charming, down-to-earth young woman.\"\nThe athlete's father also praised her first impression as \"very genuine,\" presumably referring to the Chiefs game on October 12, when Swift and Ed were seen chatting in the stands.\n\"I'll tell you something very special that I noticed about Taylor the first time I met her,\" Ed shared. \"We're sitting in the suite, she gets up and in the front room, she gets up to go get a drink or something and she starts picking up empty bottles, cans, plates that are scattered around. Because in the suites everybody gets stuff and you empty it down wherever you can.\"\n\"And I'm just thinking, I don't think she got the diva memo. She didn't get the spoiled musician,\" he continued. \"She doesn't know how to pull that off. And that really to me said a whole lot.\"\nNovember 3, 2023: Kelce responds with a smile when asked if he's \"in love\" with Swift.\nAt a press conference in Frankfurt, Germany, where the Kansas City Chiefs would soon play the Miami Dolphins, Kelce fielded a direct question about his feelings for Swift.\nAccording to ESPN's NFL reporter Jeff Darlington, the reporter asked, \"What is the latest status, and are you in love?\"\n\"I got to see her last week.

Magazine, the NFL player said he was a Swiftie before he began dating the pop star.\nHe praised Swift's songwriting, especially her song \"Blank Space,\" and even described his girlfriend as \"a genius.\"\n\"I've never been a man of words,\" Kelce said. \"Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been fucking mind-blowing.

And we're just proud of each other.\"\nJanuary 26, 2024: Kelce says he and Swift are happy to ignore the \"outside noise.\"\nDuring a Chiefs press conference, Kelce fielded questions about navigating his relationship amid his growing fame.\n\"As long as we're happy, we can't listen to anything that's outside noise,\" Kelce said. \"That's all that matters.\"\nKelce added that he'd be \"silly\" to deny Swift's role in his growing fan base, but his priority is still his job.\n\"I brought this upon myself, and I do enjoy having fun with it all, and the biggest thing is making sure my focus is right here in this building,\" Kelce told reporters.\nJanuary 28, 2024: Swift celebrates with Kelce when the Chiefs secure their spot in the Super Bowl.\nFor her 12th NFL appearance, Swift watched the Chiefs beat the Baltimore Ravens to secure their spot in Super Bowl LVIII.\nAfter the game, she joined Kelce and his family on the field to celebrate.

Swift also wore a \"New Heights\" hat to support Kelce's podcast.\nKelce later said that he prefers to watch concerts \"from the fans' perspective.\"\n\"I'm a fan of the music. I'm a fan of live shows,\" Kelce said on his podcast. \"I want to see it from the front of the stage. Yeah, we probably could've finessed it that way [watching backstage], but I think it's just that much more of an experience if you're in the pit, man. If you're in the madness with all the fans. It was awesome though.\"\nApril 19, 2024: Swift releases her new album \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" which may include a nod to Kelce.\nSwift's 31-track double album \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" contains two songs that may nod to Kelce.\nThe first is \"The Alchemy,\" which doubles as a love song and an ode to Swift's enduring career. The lyrics feature several sport-related metaphors like \"Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team\" and \"Where's the trophy? He just comes running over to me.\"\nAccording to the liner notes, \"The Alchemy\" was copyrighted in 2023, so it's unclear how deeply tied to Kelce it can be. (Swift's albums are typically finished several months ahead of their release date, ensuring vinyl factories have enough time to fulfill preorders.)\nHowever, \"So High School,\" which also seemingly references Kelce, was released in the deluxe half of \"TTPD,\" meaning it wasn't included with physical copies of the album. A song can be made available to stream almost immediately after completion, so it's possible the song was written more recently.\n\"So High School\" is perhaps the only straightforward love song on \"Poets,\" depicting a relationship that transports Swift back to her \"You Belong With Me\" days \u2014 the giddy rush of young love and lust.\nThe track appears to include direct references to Kelce, including \"You know how to ball, I know Aristotle,\" \"You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her,\" and \"Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me?\"\nBack in 2016, Kelce played a game of \"Kiss, Marry, Kill\" with AfterBuzz TV, in which he chose to kiss Swift.\nApril 27, 2024: Kelce calls Swift his \"significant other\" at a charity gala.\nKelce brought Swift as his date to the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation Golf Classic gala in Las Vegas.\nIn a highlights reel shared by Kelce's teammate, the couple can be seen walking into the event holding hands.\nOther clips shared by fans at the event show Kelce and Swift cuddling and kissing at their table. At one point, Kelce made a speech and referred to Swift as his \"significant other.\" For a surprise auction item, they sold four tickets to the Eras Tour for $80,000.\nMay 12, 2024: Kelce watches Swift perform her 87th show on the Eras Tour.\nWhen Swift returned to the stage for the European leg, she had adjusted the Eras Tour set list to perform songs from \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" The new segment includes \"So High School,\" possibly as a nod to her current relationship.\nSwift's fourth and final performance in France also happened to be the tour's 87th show. Kelce, who wears No. 87 for the Chiefs, was in the audience. Kelce was spotted dancing with Swift's close friend, Gigi Hadid, and filming Swift on his iPhone.\n\"Can you believe it's our 87th show tonight?\" Swift asked the audience during her acoustic set, just before playing \"The Alchemy\" and \"Begin Again\" as the evening's surprise songs.\nDuring the concert's \"1989\" segment, Swift also debuted a new outfit: a glittering yellow top with a red ombr\u00e9 skirt. Fans interpreted this as a nod to Kelce and the Chiefs because the team's colors are yellow and red. (Kelce previously said his favorite song of Swift's is \"Blank Space\" from \"1989\").\nFinally, to close the evening, Swift tweaked the lyrics of \"Karma\" to salute \"the guy on the Chiefs\" for the second time.\nJune 23, 2024: Kelce makes his debut appearance on the Eras Tour stage.\nDuring Swift's third and final performance in London, Kelce made a surprise appearance during her onstage costume change for \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\nThis scene depicts Swift getting shot and killed at the end of \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.\" Then, she's picked up and revived by a set of dancers dressed as ringmasters. These characters force Swift to strip down, put on heels, and keep performing through the pain \u2014 a segue into her meta bop (and \"TTPD\" album highlight) \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\"\nKelce joined the skit as another ringmaster. He picked up Swift's body from the stage, carried her to the fainting couch, and mimed applying powder to her face with a makeup brush.\nKelce is now cemented in Swiftian history as the first boyfriend to join Swift onstage during one of her concerts.\nSeptember 7, 2024: Swift brings Kelce as her date to a friend's wedding.\nSwift and Kelce were spotted out together in New York City, where they attended the wedding of Karen Elson and Lee Foster, per Vogue.\nElson is a model, while Foster is the owner of Electric Lady Studios, where Swift has recorded many songs over the years \u2014 from \"Lover\" to \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\nSwift wore a cream-colored floral dress for the occasion, paired with a Vivienne Westwood purse, Louboutin sandals, and $64,000 worth of jewelry.\nSeptember 8, 2024: The couple attends the US Open together.\nDuring an extended break from the Eras Tour, Swift and Kelce attended the 2024 US Open Tennis Championships, where they were photographed cuddling, kissing, and singing along to \"I Believe In a Thing Called Love\" by The Darkness. They even wore color-coordinating outfits.\nThe couple was joined by friends like Brittany Mahomes and the Haim sisters.\nSeptember 11, 2024: Swift gives a shout-out to \"my boyfriend Travis\" at the VMAs.\nSwift's \"Fortnight\" won video of the year at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards. During her acceptance speech, she described her joyful experience filming (and directing) the video.\n\"Something that I'll always remember is when I finished a take and I'd say 'cut,' and we'd be done with that take, I would always hear someone cheering from across the studio where we were shooting it,\" she said. \"That one person was my boyfriend, Travis.\"\nAfter an eruption of applause, Swift continued to thank Kelce for his positive attitude.\n\"Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic,\" she said. \"So I want to thank him for adding that to our shoot because I'll always remember that.\"\nOctober 7, 2024: After skipping a few games, Swift makes a stylish return to Arrowhead Stadium.\nDespite recent tabloid speculation about their relationship status, Swift showed up to cheer for Kelce when the Chiefs took on the New Orleans Saints.\nSwift wore a Vivienne Westwood set and glitter freckles for the occasion in Kansas City, where the Chiefs won their fifth consecutive game and extended their undefeated season.\nJanuary 26, 2025: Once again, Swift celebrates on the field when the Chiefs win the AFC championship.\nFor the second year in a row, Swift watched the Chiefs become AFC champions at Arrowhead Stadium \u2014 her ninth attendance of the season and 22nd total. She joined Kelce and his team for the on-field celebrations.\nFebruary 9, 2025: Swift supports Kelce at Super Bowl LIX.\nSwift traveled to New Orleans to cheer for Kelce at their second Super Bowl as a couple.\nEarlier that week, the couple was spotted dining with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes at Lilette, a popular French restaurant in the city.

Because I am a fan. I'm a fan of music. I'm a fan of art. And it's so cool that I get to experience her being that plus one for me on the football field\u2026 I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows.\"\nKelce also discussed the similarities between himself and Swift as entertainers, performing for sold-out stadium crowds.\n\"I hadn't experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, understands the ups and downs of being in front of millions,\" he said. \"That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows.

I've seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it's mind-blowing.\"",
            "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are proving to be an enduring love story. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are proving to be an enduring love story\nBy Lisa France, CNN\n(CNN) \u2014 We like this new era Taylor Swift is in.\nShe will be appearing on boyfriend Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast \u201cNew Heights\u201d to discuss her 12th studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d with his cohost and brother, Jason Kelce, on Wednesday.\nThe new music comes after her hugely successful Eras Tour, which ended in December 2024. But almost as important as the news of another album is how Swift made the announcement, sitting next to her beau.\nSwift has never had a boyfriend this intimately involved in a new project launch, which has her supporters wondering if wedding bells going to ring anytime soon?\nHere\u2019s a look back at the alchemy that got us to this era.\nJuly 2023\nKelce is very familiar with Kansas City\u2019s Arrowhead Stadium since that\u2019s where his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, play. But on July 8, 2023, he was there for a different reason \u2013 to see Swift perform as part of her \u201cEras Tour.\u201d\nA few weeks later, he shared the story on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast about how he had attempted to get Swift his phone number via a Swiftie-style friendship bracelet.\n\u201cI was disappointed that she doesn\u2019t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,\u201d he told the world after his brother Jason asked about attending the concert. \u201cSo I was a little butthurt I didn\u2019t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets, and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it,\u201d Kelce said.\nWhen Jason asked if his brother meant his jersey number or his phone number, the Kansas City tight end quipped, \u201cYou know which one.\u201d\nSeptember 2023\nFrom there, Kelce found himself fielding questions about what, if anything, was going on between him and Swift.\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna talk about my personal life,\u201d he said during an interview with NFL+ host Andrew Siciliano.\nThat didn\u2019t stop the speculation that the pair were dating, and Kelce shared during an appearance on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d that he had invited Swift to watch him play.\n\u201cI threw the ball in her court,\u201d the football player said. \u201cI told her, \u2018I\u2019ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead.\u2019 We\u2019ll see what happens in the near future.\u201d\nSwift eventually took him up on it and appeared at his game on September 24, sitting next to his mother, Donna Kelce, in the family suite.\nSwifties, as her hardcore fan base is known, promptly lost it, heralding the kickoff of mania over the pair.\nOctober 2023\nThe NFL began leaning in to \u201cTraylor,\u201d \u201cTayvis,\u201d \u201cSwelce\u201d or whatever you choose to use as their couple nickname.\nThe league\u2019s official X account posted about her plenty when on October 1 Swift and some of her famous friends including Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds cheered Kelce and his team on against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium.\nEveryone felt swept up in the excitement over the two. Donna Kelce, his mother, told CNN at the time that all the attention surrounding her son and Swift felt \u201cunreal.\u201d\n\u201cI tell everyone that it\u2019s kind of like an alternate universe that I just happened to be in,\u201d Donna Kelce said. \u201cLike, I went through a third wall into another dimension. That\u2019s what it feels like.\u201d\nAnd in a case of \u201cwe can show you better than we can tell you,\u201d Kelce and Swift appeared to confirm their coupledom when they were photographed holding hands in New York City after they both made separate surprise appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d season 49 premiere on October 14.\nSwift gave definite girlfriend vibes a week later when she and Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes, showed off their special handshake during a successful Chiefs play against the Los Angeles Chargers. Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes are besties as well as teammates.\nNovember 2023\nThere was no doubt that Swift and Kelce were indeed a couple once he traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, for her November 11 Eras Tour stop.\nNot only was Kelce there with Swift\u2019s dad, she swapped the \u201cKarma\u201d lyric \u201cKarma is the guy in the screen coming straight home to me\u201d \u2013 which many thought was about her ex-boyfriend actor Joe Alwyn \u2013 for \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.\u201d\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t swoon-worthy enough, video of her running off stage into Kelce\u2019s arms for a smooch had those rooting for the superstar singer to find her person singing \u201cIt\u2019s a love story, baby, just say \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\nLater that month, Kelce was the cover star of WSJ Magazine\u2019s and opened up about their relationship.\n\u201cObviously I\u2019ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them\u2026. I\u2019ve never dealt with it,\u201d Kelce told the publication of Swift\u2019s life in the spotlight. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m not running away from any of it\u2026. The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she\u2019s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.\u201d\nDecember 2023\nKelce wasn\u2019t the only one willing to talk about their relationship.\nSwift was named Time magazine\u2019s 2023 \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d and in an interview with the publication, she cleared up speculation that they became official at that first September football game she attended.\n\u201cBy the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,\u201d she told Time.\nShe added, they \u201cwould never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date\u201d in the public sphere like that. Makes sense.\nJanuary 2024\nNot only did Kelce and Swift ring in the new year together with a sweet kiss, but she also met his brother Jason for the first time.\nThe then-Philadelphia Eagles center and his wife Kylie Kelce hung out with Swift during the Chiefs\u2019 playoff game against the Buffalo Bills,\nSuffice it to say, Jason Kelce made quite the impression as he stripped off his shirt, guzzled beer and hopped out of the suite window to have some fun with the fans.\nThe brothers talked about it during an episode of their podcast and Jason Kelce said his wife had warned him to be on his \u201cbest behavior\u201d for his first meet up with his beloved brother\u2019s girlfriend.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Kylie, the first day I met you I was blackout drunk and fell asleep at the bar,\u201d he said during the podcast. \u201cThis is part of the charm. This is part of the Jason Kelce charm. I wanna make my best first impression.\u2019\u201d\nIt apparently worked as Travis Kelce told him, \u201cTay said she absolutely loved you.\u201d\nFebruary 2024\nLove was in the air the month of Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 not just between Swift and her boyfriend, but for his sports fans.\nHis team made it once again to the Super Bowl, which allowed the NFL to further cash in given that Swift had been boosting ratings with her attendance at the games.\nAnd while some thought the league was overdoing it with all the shots of the singer during the games, Mama Kelce was excited for the new audience Swift was attracting.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s amazing that more and more people are embracing the NFL. I love sports. I especially love football because my boys have been doing it for so long,\u201d Donna Kelce told CNN. \u201cI truly believe that it\u2019s bringing families closer. Sports tends to do that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten letters, texts and comments when I\u2019m in the airport about how fathers are so happy that their daughters are finally coming to them to try to understand the game,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd they couldn\u2019t have thought that would have ever happened before now.\u201d\nHer son Travis and his Chiefs went on to win the Super Bowl, their third in five years and their second in a row.\nAnd because we must know how did it end, Swift and Kelce gave us that movie moment when he turned from celebrating with his mother, told Swift \u201cCome here girl,\u201d and the pair embraced and exchanged a few kisses on the field.\nThere was much partying and Swift even joked in a TikTok video about ending up in a nightclub with her parents as they celebrated the historic win.\nLater that month Kelce thrilled concertgoers in Australia when he flew out to join her when she played her Sydney tour stop.\nApril 2024\nGood luck remembering who played Coachella because all eyes were on Swift and her man as they enjoyed the annual music festival. It was so serious, a video of a lip-reader trying to interpret what the couple said to each other while they jammed went viral.\nBut that was nothing compared to the excitement when Swift dropped her new album \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d on April 19.\nImmediately, Swifties were trying to decode which songs/lyrics might be about Kelce.\nThe singer scored with all the sports references in her track \u201cThe Alchemy,\u201d which led many to believe that the song about having an intense attraction to a new lover was inspired by Kelce.\n\u201cSo when I touch down/Call the amateurs and/Cut \u2018em from the team/Ditch the clowns, get the crown/Baby I\u2019m the one to beat,\u201d Swift sings. \u201cCause the sign on your heart/Said it\u2019s still reserved for me/Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?\u201d\nMay 2024\nKelce proved to be Swift\u2019s number one fan and revealed his favorite Swift \u2018era.\u2019\n\u201cI\u2019m a big \u20181989\u2019 fan,\u201d Kelce told \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d during his second annual Kelce Jam music festival. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to lie, I may be a little biased towards \u2018The Tortured Poets Department.\u2019 Just a little bit.\u201d\nThe pair also enjoyed a romantic vacation in Lake Como, Italy, while Swift was on break from the European leg of her Eras Tour.\nJune 2024\nSpeaking of Europe, Swift posted a selfie of her, Kelce, Prince William and his two oldest kids, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, from her London concert, which also counted as his first Instagram-official shot on her feed.\nKelce wasn\u2019t just along for the ride, it turns out.\nHe made his debut at her Wembley Stadium concert in London where he donned a top hat and tails for a cameo on stage with Swift.\nSwift posted about her performance at the stadium, writing, \u201cAnd I\u2019m still cracking up/swooning over @killatrav\u2019s Eras Tour debut.\u201d\nJuly 2024\nKelce gave listeners of his podcast the behind the scenes of his surprise debut, sharing that \u201cIt was an absolute blast.\u201d\n\u201cIt was such a fun, playful part of the show and it was like the perfect time for me to go up there, just be a ham and have some fun, not only with [Swift]\u2026 but the crowd and really try and get everybody excited for the rest of the show,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was awesome.\u201d\nHis main focus? Not to fumble.\n\u201cThe golden rule was \u2018Do not drop Taylor. Get her to the couch safe,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\u201cDo not drop the baby\u201d is what he thought, and as usual, Kelce won.\nThe football player attended her favorite songbird\u2019s concerts in Amsterdam and Germany before heading back to the US for training camp with his Kansas City Chiefs.\nAbsence made the heart grow fonder as Kelce danced to \u201cShake It Off\u201d at the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship Tournament and dedicated his karaoke win to his girlfriend.\nAugust 2024\nSwift performed her last show along the European leg of her Eras Tour at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium. Days later, she commented for the first time on the thwarted terror attack that led to the cancellation of three shows in Vienna earlier in the month.\nIn her statement, Swift expressed her gratitude to the authorities involved because even thought she felt guilt for the cancellations, \u201cwe were grieving concerts and not lives,\u201d she wrote.\nKelce did not publicly comment about the incident.\nSwift and Kelce reunited later in the month to throw a star-studded bash at her Rhode Island mansion to celebrate her taking a break from her tour. Guests included other couples like Jason and Kylie Kelce, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, and Bradley Cooper and Gigi Hadid.\nKelce also became a minority owner of a racehorse named, wait for it, Swift Delivery.\nAnd Swift, apparently, is more involved in Kelce\u2019s career than we knew.\n\u201cShe\u2019s really interested in football and she asks a lot of great questions,\u201d Mahomes told NBC\u2019s Chris Simms in a recent interview. \u201cShe started drawing up plays, we might have to put one in.\u201d\nFebruary 2025\nKelce and his Kansas City Chiefs were heading back to the Super Bowl, but all anyone wants to talk to him about is his relationship with Swift.\nAfter back to back questions during a press conference as to when Kelce planned on popping the question to his superstar singer girlfriend the football player responded \u201cMan, back to back, you guys are crazy.\u201d\nHe was more than happy, however, to praise her work ethic and talk about how he felt the need to match it.\n\u201cI better hold up my end of the bargain,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cIf she\u2019s out here being the superstar she is, never taking no for an answer and always working her tail off, I better match that energy for sure.\u201d\nHis team, the Kansas City Chiefs, lost to the Philadelphia Eagles and Swift and Kelce dropped out of sight for a bit though there were reports that they enjoyed a bit of vacationing.\nMay 2025\nMay was a big month for Swift.\nWe were reminded that celebs are also Swifties, when WNBA player Caitlin Clark was asked if she thought Swift and Kelce would be attending any of her Indiana Fever games.\nClark said she hoped so.\nI feel like they\u2019re also living. They\u2019re in a nice, in vacation mode right now,\u201d Clark told USA Today. \u201cSo I hope they enjoy a nice little break out of the spotlight. But I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be cheering for the Fever either way.\u201d\nSwift also scored a personal victory in getting her music catalog back, which she announced in a letter shared on her site and said she was able to do so thanks to the success of her Eras Tour.\n\u201cTo say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,\u201d she wrote.\nJune 2025\nThere were wedding bells, but not Swift and Kelce\u2019s.\nThe couple attended his cousin Tanner Corum\u2019s nuptials at the RiverView Family Farm in Knoxville, Tennessee.\nCorum shared a photo of the couple, posing with him and his bride, Samantha, along with their daughter at the wedding.\n\u201cSo damn thankful for our family and the people that love us the most to come celebrate us on this special day,\u201d Corum wrote in the caption.\nAugust 2025\nSwift teased the announcement of her 12th studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d in a clip showing her sharing the news on Kelce\u2019s podcast.\nIt marked the first time the world gets to see the couple publicly engaged in conversation.\nA version of this story was originally published in July 2024.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

            "Amy Bradley theories range from accident to accusations. Editor\u2019s Note: This article contains discussions of suicide. Reader discretion is advised. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, you can find resources in your area on the National Crisis Line website or by calling 988.\n(NewsNation) \u2014 Amy Bradley suddenly vanished from a Caribbean cruise in March 1998 and has been the subject of various theories about what happened to her.\nBradley, 23 at the time she went missing, was on Royal Caribbean\u2019s Rhapsody of the Seas with her parents and brother as they traveled to Curacao.\nThe night she disappeared, she was out partying with her brother until the early hours of the morning. The last time she was seen, her father woke up and noticed her legs on the chair of the balcony at around 5:30 a.m.\nBy 6 a.m., Bradley was gone.\nMissing California teen found safe after 2 weeks\nIn July, Netflix released \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing,\u201d a three-part docuseries detailing her mysterious disappearance and the many theories that have arisen in the 27 years since. The series has reinvigorated interest in the case and brought Bradley\u2019s story back into the public eye.\nThe FBI investigation into her disappearance remains open, and there is a $25,000 reward for information that leads to her recovery.\nFalling overboard\nA central theory concerning Bradley\u2019s disappearance is that she fell or jumped off the boat, although some believe that cannot be the case.\nOne version of the theory suggests that she was intoxicated and tripped and fell overboard. Others suggest it was merely an accidental fall caused by sudden movement of the ship.\nMore in World\nA Man Was Perfectly Frozen in Ice for 28 Years. The Glacier Just Spit Him Back Out.\nAccording to The Charley Project, a public database for missing persons cases, some theorists do not believe Bradley fell overboard because the ship was close to shore at the time and \u201cwitnesses would have undoubtedly heard or seen any accident.\u201d\nShe was also a registered lifeguard and a strong swimmer. Her body was never found when the water was searched.\nAshley Summers has been missing for 18 years\nSuicide\nA darker theory related to falling overboard is that she jumped intentionally.\nSpeculation about Bradley\u2019s relationship was raised in the documentary, and some theorists suggest she was going through a rough patch with her girlfriend before the cruise.\nHowever, her family believes it is unlikely she would have harmed herself. She had recently graduated from college and had a new job lined up with a computer consulting firm. She had sent postcards to friends and planned to pick up a dog she adopted when the cruise ended.\n\u201cShe had just moved into her new apartment and was starting a new job on the following Monday. She had so many plans and was so happy about all of them,\u201d Iva Bradley wrote in a blog post on the International Cruise Victims\u2019 website.\nPolice: 22-year-old man missing from suburban Chicago\nMurdered on the ship\nOn the night she disappeared, Bradley was seen dancing with the bassist of the ship\u2019s band, Alister \u201cYellow\u201d Douglas. Witnesses and surveillance footage confirmed the interaction.\nSome passengers also alleged they saw Bradley with Douglas on an upper level of the ship at around 5:45 a.m., within the time window she went missing.\nThe FBI questioned Douglas following her disappearance. He voluntarily took and passed a polygraph test.\nNo evidence has linked Douglas to the case, and he has never been charged with any wrongdoing.\nBody of missing teen found in Florida pond after he texted mom for help\nKidnapped and/or trafficked\nSince her disappearance, there have been numerous alleged sightings of Bradley, many suggesting she was trafficked and held by captors. Many of these accounts are documented on the amybradleyismissing.com online forum.\nA month after she vanished, the Bradley family returned to Curacao to search for her. A taxi driver recognized them and claimed he had seen Bradley running and searching for a phone shortly after she went missing, but a search of the area turned up nothing.\nThat same year, a Canadian tourist reported seeing a woman with Bradley\u2019s distinct tattoos on a beach in Curacao. She was with two men who led her away after giving the tourist suspicious looks. Authorities searched the beach and found nothing.\nMonths later, a U.S. Navy officer said he met Bradley in a brothel in Curacao, where she asked him for help. He claimed he left without reporting the encounter for fear of losing his job. The FBI later investigated the brothel but found no evidence.\nIn 2005, the Bradley family received anonymous photos from an adult website showing a woman who resembled Amy. The site was based in the Caribbean, but the FBI was unable to trace the IP address, and the woman\u2019s identity remains unconfirmed.\nOregon fishing vessel capsizes; 3 rescued, 1 missing\nFled the ship to start a new life\nOne theory, supported by little evidence, suggests Bradley left the ship voluntarily to start a new life in the Caribbean.\nThe only indication of this, according to a Netflix companion article on the docuseries, is \u201ca pattern of IP addresses, traced to Barbados, logging into the amybradleyismissing.com forum on key family anniversaries and holidays.\u201d\nWhat her family believes\nBradley was traveling with her parents, Iva and Ron, and her brother, Brad. Though she was legally declared dead in 2010, her family maintains she was abducted and is still alive.\n\u201cSomebody knows something, somebody saw something, somebody heard something, somebody told somebody something,\u201d Iva Bradley says in the docuseries\nBrad Bradley told NewsNation\u2019s \u201cBanfield\u201d that they believe she was \u201ctargeted,\u201d \u201ctaken\u201d and \u201cremoved from the ship.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of haters online that say a lot of nasty things and basically say she\u2019s gone, she fell over, she jumped over. I can guarantee those two things didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he told WWBT.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

            "German backpacker's outback rescue 'sheer luck'. A German backpacker survived on minimal food and water for 11 nights in the rugged outback before finding a road and flagging down a motorist by \"sheer luck\".\nCarolina Wilga, 26, is recovering in hospital with cuts and bruises and suffering from dehydration and fatigue after a near two-week ordeal in the Western Australian wheatbelt.\nMs Wilga was found on Friday afternoon by a female motorist, after last being seen on June 29 at a general store in the town of Beacon about 300km northeast of Perth.\nHer disappearance triggered a massive search after a desperate plea from her mother amid concerns for her safety.\nPolice have revealed Ms Wilga spent just one night with her van after it got bogged in dense Karroun Hill Nature Reserve bushland, 35km off a main track.\nShe followed the sun and walked west, thinking that would be her best bet of finding a road.\n\"She was essentially out in the wilderness for about 11 nights, which is significant,\" detective acting inspector Jessica Securo told reporters on Saturday.\n\"(That) brings us back to how lucky she was that she was located safe and well, and how thankful we are that we managed to find her.\n\"She is still in disbelief that she was able to survive. In her mind, she had convinced herself she was not going to be located.\"\nMs Wilga walked a total of 24km with \"minimal food and water\" before the chance encounter with Tania, who was driving past.\n\"She was on the side of the road waving her hands. She was in a fragile state, but she was well. Thin but well,\" Tania told the ABC.\n\"She'd been bitten by a lot of midgies. She said it was very, very cold.\"\nTemperatures dropped to zero at night in the region, while there was also heavy rain over several days.\nInsp Securo, who has spoken with Ms Wilga, said the tourist had become very confused and disorientated and it was sheer luck she found the road.\n\"The area out there ... it can be quite dangerous if you don't know what you're doing or where you are going,\" Insp Securo said.\nMs Wilga has had a \"good night's sleep\", food and a shower since being found and had been left overwhelmed by the media attention.\nShe could continue her stay in Australia and still has the east coast on her bucket list, Insp Securo said.\n\"It's still early days and obviously she's focusing on her recovery (but) I know she wants to work in Australia,\" she said.\n\"She still has so much travel to do here. I think if she has the ability to stay, she definitely will.\"\nPolice are still trying to figure out how the van got into trouble, but said it appeared Ms Wilga lost control trying to find a track.\nInsp Securo said in survival situations, people were always better off staying with their car.\n\"It's far easier for an aerial search to locate a vehicle than it is a person,\" she said.\nAustralian Associated Press",
            "Carolina Wilga: German backpacker found alive after 12 days missing in remote Australian bushland. German backpacker Carolina Wilga has been found alive after going missing 12 days ago in remote Western Australian bushland.\nInsp Martin Glynn of WA police told reporters on Friday evening that the 26-year-old had been located walking on a bush track on the edge of the reserve where she had gone missing.\nHe said she had been recovered by a member of the public on the roadside and brought to Beacon. As of 7.30pm AEST, Wilga had been airlifted out of the area en route to hospital in Perth for medical attention.\n\u201cAs you can imagine, from the trauma she suffered for the last few days, she\u2019s been obviously through a great deal,\u201d he said.\n\u201cShe does have some injuries. She\u2019s been ravaged by mosquitoes. She\u2019s obviously been through an amazing journey, a trauma no doubt will be a testimony to demonstrating her bravery in those circumstances out there.\n\u201cI think once we do hear her story, it will be a remarkable story,\u201d Glynn said, adding that it was a \u201cgreat result\u201d for the backpacker\u2019s family and those involved in the search.\nPolice on Thursday found Wilga\u2019s abandoned Mitsubishi van about 150km from Beacon in the Karroun Hill area, which has been described as remote and inhospitable country.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle they\u2019ve actually spotted the car, to be honest,\u201d Glynn said.\n\u201cThe police air wing officers were able to identify that the vehicle was bogged and was subject to extensive efforts by her to recover the vehicle,\u201d Glynn told a media conference about an hour before news Wilga had been found.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email\n\u201cShe\u2019d used Maxtrax and pieces of wood to try to free the vehicle from its location, but unfortunately was unsuccessful,\u201d Glynn said.\nPolice believe Wilga walked away from her vehicle once she was unable to free it.\n\u2018Remarkable story\u2019\nIt was unknown how far she had gotten from her vehicle at the time she was found, but Glynn said \u201cobviously she would have covered a lot of ground in that time as she tried to make her way out of there\u201d.\nGlynn said Wilga\u2019s family had been notified of her wellbeing, and thanked locals and the wider community for providing police with information over the past few days.\nHe was unable to confirm if Wilga had spoken to police, describing her condition as \u201cquite \u2026 fragile\u201d. But while having \u201ca lot of significant minor injuries\u201d, she did not appear to have any serious injuries.\n\u201cI think once we do hear her story, it will be a remarkable story,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s obviously coped in some amazing conditions. There\u2019s a very hostile environment out there, both from flora and fauna. It\u2019s a really, really challenging environment to cope in.\u201d\nWeather conditions in the region had dropped down to 0C at night.\n\u201cYou\u2019re always so hopeful with these missing person situations,\u201d Glynn said. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite traumatic because you obviously always go out with the best of hope that you will find the person \u2026 It\u2019s just a great outcome for everyone involved.\u201d\nOn Friday, police conducted a \u201creflex search\u201d within a 300-metre radius of the van to gather any evidence that could have determined which direction Wilga had travelled.\nWilga last had contact with friends on 29 June after travelling through the towns of Toodyay and Dowerin, south-west of Beacon.\nSpeaking to media before Wilga was found, Acting Insp Jessica Securo said that an inexperienced person could easily become lost in that location.\n\u201cThe terrain is outback country and there are large, rocky outcrops,\u201d she told ABC News on Friday.\n\u201cSo although there\u2019s a number of tracks, you can see how it would be easy to become lost or disorientated in that area if you didn\u2019t know it well.\u201d\nSecuro said Wilga\u2019s vehicle was located at least about 35km from any main tracks.\nForensic officers had inspected the van to determine why it was abandoned and what Wilga may have been able to carry with her after she left it.\n\u201cIt appears that as she was driving, she\u2019s likely to [have] become lost, and then the car has suffered mechanical issues \u2026 and [she] has potentially walked away from her vehicle,\u201d Securo said earlier on Friday.\nShe said that Wilga\u2019s van was \u201cself-sufficient\u201d and that she had solar panels and water, but that the vehicle was mechanically unable to be used when it was found."

            "Inevitables. TEATRO\nMenos detalles\nUna actriz (Carolina Saade) y un titiritero (Gerardo Pori\u00f3n) reconstruyen un viaje trunco, tr\u00e1gico y c\u00f3mico, como un cuento de hadas contempor\u00e1neo para adultos. Aunque repleta de fantas\u00eda, la nueva obra de Gustavo Tarr\u00edo est\u00e1 inspirada en hechos reales. Con teatro de sombras, de objetos, maquinaria teatral a la vista, chemsex y canciones, despliega el iceberg de una historia conmovedora: el viaje que narra parte con dos personas y vuelve con una. Lo inesperado transforma la experiencia en excitante, lis\u00e9rgica y alucin\u00f3gena. Al regreso, con la ausencia a cuestas, se suman escalas eternas, alertas m\u00faltiples y aeropuertos repletos de extra\u00f1os. Y al llegar, se vuelve imposible contarlo todo sin que alguien interrumpa y diga: \u201cPor favor, menos detalles\u201d.\nMi\u00e9rcoles a las 20.30, en El Galp\u00f3n de Guevara, Guevara 326.

Inspirada en el registro creado por el organero Aquilino Amezua a partir del estudio de laringes humanas, Vox humana es una imperdible \u00f3pera experimental dirigida por Guillermina Etkin que indaga en la voz como artefacto y su posible emulaci\u00f3n maqu\u00ednica.\nViernes y s\u00e1bado a las 20, en el Centro Cultural Borges, Viamonte 525. Las entradas son gratis y se retiran desde media hora antes de la funci\u00f3n.\nM\u00daSICA\nVamos fugir\nNueva y luminosa versi\u00f3n de este cl\u00e1sico de Gilberto Gil, convertido tambi\u00e9n en un tema emblem\u00e1tico del reggae brasile\u00f1o. Grabado originalmente por el bahiano junto a The Wailers y Liminha \u2013bajista de Os Mutantes y luego productor fundamental dentro del rock local\u2013 para su disco Ra\u00e7a humana (1984), desde entonces ha sido objeto de innumerables versiones, por toda clase de int\u00e9rpretes, ya sea por Daniela Mercury, la banda de afroreggae Natiruts y hasta el duo sertanejo Victor & Leo. Pero ninguna m\u00e1s recordada como la del grupo Skank, que la incluy\u00f3 como novedad en su antolog\u00eda Radiola (2004). Para esta regrabaci\u00f3n, Gil se re\u00fane con Samuel Rosa \u2013ex l\u00edder de Skank, con el que version\u00f3 \u201cCould You Be Loved\u201d en su homenaje a Bob Marley, Kaya N\u2019Gan Daya (2002)\u2013 para volver a cantar esos versos que anuncian, hoy mejor que nunca, eso de \u201cVamos a huir/ de este lugar, Baby\u201d.\nToday\u2019s Song\nNuevo simple de Foo Fighters, primer tema nuevo del grupo de Dave Grohl en dos a\u00f1os, desde la salida del disco But Here We Are (2023). Al mismo tiempo celebraci\u00f3n por los 30 a\u00f1os de su grupo y homenaje a todos los m\u00fasicos que pasaron por su formaci\u00f3n, su aparici\u00f3n marca el regreso de Grohl y su grupo despu\u00e9s de las tragedias y esc\u00e1ndalos del \u00faltimo tiempo.

La plataforma Mubi acaba de sumar a su oferta las dos temporadas originales, producidas a comienzos de los a\u00f1os noventa, adem\u00e1s del prodigioso regreso de 2018 y el extraordinario ap\u00e9ndice cinematogr\u00e1fico Fire Walk With Me. Los adjetivos no se agotan a la hora de hablar de la saga, cuyo extra\u00f1o cruce entre el policial de cr\u00edmenes y la telenovela result\u00f3 de enorme influencia y sent\u00f3 las bases de una nueva era en las series televisivas.

El documental, que puede verse en Disney+, analiza el proceso creativo detr\u00e1s de la pel\u00edcula, los alcances de su enorme \u00e9xito de p\u00fablico y la herencia art\u00edstica de un film inoxidable. Hay entrevistas actuales a todos los talentos involucrados, pero la mayor virtud del largometraje es la cantidad de material de archivo que ilustra c\u00f3mo el joven realizador de 27 a\u00f1os pas\u00f3 de ser un ilustre desconocido a uno de los nombres mayores del Hollywood de los a\u00f1os '70 y '80.\nCINE\nUn mundo recobrado\nReciente ganador en el Festival de Cine de Derechos Humanos, el largometraje de Laura Bondarevsky se est\u00e1 exhibiendo todos los viernes de julio en Cine Arte Cacodelphia. Se trata de un documental con secuencias de ficci\u00f3n que reconstruye la vida y obra de Yenia Dumnova, una mujer de origen ruso que supo cuidar a la realizadora durante su infancia. La historia de esa \u201cabuela por elecci\u00f3n\u201d permite recorrer un per\u00edodo de intensa actividad pol\u00edtica \u2013los a\u00f1os '60 y '70\u2013, uniendo lo \u00edntimo con lo colectivo y la historia personal con aquella que lleva may\u00fascula. Dice la directora que \u201ca veces necesitamos entender c\u00f3mo llegamos hasta ac\u00e1, por qu\u00e9 suceden determinadas cosas y no otras. Entonces viajamos en el tiempo en la m\u00e1quina del cine. Y ese proceso m\u00e1gico, de trabajo colectivo, nos permite reconstruir, hilar, recobrar.

            "\u00abGalicia es solidaria; si rechaza recibir a menores ser\u00e1n \u00f3rdenes de Madrid\u00bb. Entrevista | Elma Saiz Ministra de Inclusi\u00f3n, Seguridad Social y Migraciones\n\u00abGalicia es solidaria; si rechaza recibir a menores ser\u00e1n \u00f3rdenes de Madrid\u00bb\nEn medio del pulso entre Xunta y Gobierno por la acogida de menores, la ministra Elma Saiz acudi\u00f3 a Santiago al Congreso Internacional sobre Migraciones y Refugio en Europa a explicar las l\u00edneas maestras del Ejecutivo en la materia. Defiende que la pol\u00edtica migratoria de Espa\u00f1a es \u00abreferente internacional\u00bb y pivota alrededor de un eje b\u00e1sico: \u00abPoner los derechos humanos en el centro\u00bb\nLa inmigraci\u00f3n capitaliza buena parte de la agenda pol\u00edtica aqu\u00ed y en Europa. \u00bfTiene Espa\u00f1a un problema de inmigraci\u00f3n?\nNo. Desde que el mundo es mundo, los movimientos migratorios forman parte del ser humano y lo importante es c\u00f3mo se gestionan a trav\u00e9s de la pol\u00edtica migratoria. Y el Gobierno de Espa\u00f1a tiene muy clara la suya: situar los derechos humanos en el centro y convertir este desaf\u00edo en una oportunidad. Hay que diferenciar entre lo que es un problema para la ciudadan\u00eda y lo que es un problema creado. Todos los datos nos indican que hay un mensaje positivo y un aporte al pa\u00eds de la inmigraci\u00f3n, y m\u00e1s en una tierra como Galicia, donde la emigraci\u00f3n forma parte de su historia.\nHabla de convertir el desaf\u00edo migratorio en oportunidad. \u00bfC\u00f3mo?\nLa pol\u00edtica migratoria del Gobierno, referente a nivel internacional, va desde una atenci\u00f3n humanitaria a las personas que llegan buscando una oportunidad hasta los despachos, pasando por la aprobaci\u00f3n de normas como el nuevo reglamento de la Ley de Extranjer\u00eda o con reformas profundas.\nTodos los datos nos indican que hay un mensaje positivo y un aporte al pa\u00eds de la inmigraci\u00f3n, y m\u00e1s en una tierra como Galicia, donde la emigraci\u00f3n forma parte de su historia.\nLa situaci\u00f3n del norte y el sur de Espa\u00f1a no tienen nada que ver en cuanto a la presi\u00f3n de la inmigraci\u00f3n y su percepci\u00f3n social. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se aborda este desequilibrio?\nNo da igual qui\u00e9n est\u00e9 al frente de los gobiernos y eso se ve en las pol\u00edticas de las diferentes comunidades. Por ejemplo en Madrid, donde hay mucho migrantes y sin embargo la presidenta Ayuso recorta todo lo que tiene que ver con servicios p\u00fablicos, cuando lo que tendr\u00eda que hacer es ver cu\u00e1les son sus necesidades y reforzar esos servicios. Lo que no puede es recibir a mucha poblaci\u00f3n de fuera que hace que tu comunidad crezca mientras t\u00fa recortas servicios y acuses a los inmigrantes de esos recortes y de colapsar tus servicios. Por eso las comunidades deben ser responsables.\nAunque depende del Ministerio de Juventud e Infancia, el reparto territorial de menores ha irritado a Galicia, que se niega a recibir a 317 menas. \u00bfHa molestado esta postura al Gobierno? \u00bfHay di\u00e1logo?\nLa forma de proceder de este Gobierno desde el minuto cero siempre es el di\u00e1logo, la mano tendida y la colaboraci\u00f3n. Esta semana hubo una conferencia sectorial sobre ese asunto donde parte de las comunidades del PP boicotearon la voluntad del Congreso, ya que hay que recordar que se prob\u00f3 la modificaci\u00f3n del art\u00edculo 35, as\u00ed que las comunidades deben acoger a menores de forma obligatoria. Es cumplir la ley. Pero a m\u00ed me llama la atenci\u00f3n especialmente Galicia, porque es una comunidad solidaria que recibi\u00f3 sin problema a menores no acompa\u00f1ados de Ucrania y ahora se niega a acoger. Quiero pensar que quiz\u00e1s sea porque est\u00e1n recibiendo mensajes por parte de la se\u00f1ora Ayuso, porque no me cuadra este modus operandi en Galicia.\n\u00bfHay inmigraci\u00f3n buena e inmigraci\u00f3n mala? Algunos discursos pol\u00edticos la diferencian.\nNo, rotundamente no. \u00bfAlguien puede imaginar que hubiera supuesto para un gallego o gallega emigrando a Argentina que al llegar all\u00ed se le hubiera preguntado si es un buen o un mal migrante? Es algo inconcebible.\n\u00bfSobrevivir\u00eda Espa\u00f1a hoy sin inmigraci\u00f3n?\nNo. Su aporte es fundamental como motor de crecimiento dentro de ese milagro econ\u00f3mico que se valora desde otras latitudes y que parece que el \u00fanico sitio donde no se ve aqu\u00ed, por los mensajes de algunas fuerzas pol\u00edticas, que desinforman.\nMuchos sectores econ\u00f3micos y sociales dependen de la inmigraci\u00f3n, pero se quejan de problemas para obtener permisos y legalizarse. \u00bfSe puede agilizar su regularizaci\u00f3n en esos casos?\nLa reforma del reglamento de la Ley de Extranjer\u00eda quiere dar respuesta a esas y otras cuestiones. Uno de los cometidos del Ministerio es saber, con datos, qu\u00e9 profesiones tienen m\u00e1s necesidad de mano de obra e incluso ampliar el cat\u00e1logo de dif\u00edcil cobertura. Y lo hacemos con un mensaje muy claro: ning\u00fan extranjero viene a sacar el trabajo a los ciudadanos de nuestro pa\u00eds.\nLa inmigraci\u00f3n que llega por patera, aunque abre los informativos, no representa ni el 6%\nGalicia fue la primera autonom\u00eda en activar un plan de retorno a emigrados que despu\u00e9s siguieron otras autonom\u00edas y el Gobierno. \u00bfEst\u00e1 funcionando?\nQueremos proteger los v\u00ednculos entre pa\u00edses de origen y destino, porque esa relaci\u00f3n se puede traducir en convenios. Pero tambi\u00e9n estamos trabajando para mejorar la situaci\u00f3n de los espa\u00f1oles en el exterior, que son m\u00e1s de tres millones. Tenemos una situaci\u00f3n geopol\u00edtica complicada y hay un incremento importante de solicitantes de protecci\u00f3n internacional que huyen por distintas causas. El cambio clim\u00e1tico tambi\u00e9n genera flujos migratorios, que no van a ir a menos. Y tambi\u00e9n las pol\u00edticas de Trump castigan a la poblaci\u00f3n migrante y muchos miran hacia Espa\u00f1a. Hemos puesto en marcha EduBrigde to Spain, un programa de v\u00eda r\u00e1pida o fast track siendo conscientes de que muchos alumnos de universidades de EEUU que fueron admitidos van a tener problemas con sus visados o su renovaci\u00f3n de documentaci\u00f3n. Espa\u00f1a quiere ser un polo de atracci\u00f3n para esos perfiles de talento ya a partir del curso que empieza en septiembre. Y es a su vez un ejemplo de que la inmigraci\u00f3n que llega por patera, aunque abre los informativos, no representa ni el 6%.\nLa Seguridad Social est\u00e1 en m\u00e1ximos hist\u00f3ricos de cotizantes. \u00bfEst\u00e1 blindada la supervivencia del sistema o habr\u00e1 reformas?\nVamos por el buen camino y no lo digo solo yo. Nuestro sistema es sostenible y las cifras de empleo se fortalecen, frente a los mensajes de miedo y desinformaci\u00f3n. Aunque estamos desplegando m\u00e1s reformas, hemos fortalecido los ingresos al sistema y hemos corregido faltas en nuestro mercado laboral: los salarios dignos y empleo de calidad de hoy son las pensiones del futuro. Y estamos comprometidos con la revalorizaci\u00f3n de las pensiones.\n\u00bfHabr\u00e1 Gobierno hasta final de legislatura? \u00bfC\u00f3mo ve a S\u00e1nchez?\nEstamos trabajando y esta semana vimos en el pleno del Congreso como las fuerzas progresistas quieren que sigamos haci\u00e9ndolo, ampliando derechos y mejorando la vida de la gente. Hay publicaciones que hablan del milagro econ\u00f3mico espa\u00f1ol y estamos demostrando que se puede crecer sin dar un paso atr\u00e1s en protecci\u00f3n social y derechos laborales y humanos.\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo ve el presidente S\u00e1nchez?\nComprometido con su pa\u00eds. Por un lado, para no menoscabar nuestro escudo social; por otro, cumpliendo con nuestra participaci\u00f3n en la OTAN y Europa; y volviendo a mostrar un liderazgo internacional.\n\u00abEl ingreso m\u00ednimo llega a un 86% m\u00e1s de gallegos que la Risga\u00bb\nEl ingreso m\u00ednimo vital (IMV) va a cumplir cinco a\u00f1os y Galicia lleva dos pidiendo su transferencia. \u00bfEs viable?\nDesde el marco de la Constituci\u00f3n y asumiendo que la colaboraci\u00f3n entre administraciones siempre es buena para el ciudadano, estamos abiertos a todo. De hecho, varias comunidades ya han asumido esa gesti\u00f3n. Pero debemos ser conscientes de lo que pasa en Galicia: el IMV tiene una dotaci\u00f3n presupuestaria un 88% superior y llega a un 86% m\u00e1s de beneficiarios que la Risga. Lo que no podemos hacer es que de la inclusi\u00f3n y de la lucha contra la pobreza se responsabilice solo el IMV, no podemos detraer recursos en esa renta auton\u00f3mica y cargarle todo al IMV.\nEl mensaje de que las ayudas como el IMV desincentivan el empleo est\u00e1 calando por la falta de mano de obra en muchos sectores. \u00bfLo comparte?\nYo le pondr\u00eda un adjetivo: el IMV desincentiva el empleo precario. Es pronto para analizar c\u00f3mo se comporta el incentivo al empleo a\u00f1adido al IMV en 2023, por lo que pedir\u00eda tiempo. Pero somos muy conscientes de qui\u00e9n es el rostro del perceptor del ingreso y qu\u00e9 supone, porque es una palanca para la dignidad de las personas, para la b\u00fasqueda de oportunidades. He conocido mujeres que cobran el IMV y son madres de tres hijos menores... Es muy dif\u00edcil para ellas compatibilizarlo con un trabajo por una cuesti\u00f3n de conciliaci\u00f3n.\nEsta es la playa con el agua m\u00e1s 'caliente' de Galicia (y est\u00e1 casi vac\u00eda)\n-\nCambio del tiempo en Galicia: la llegada de un frente trae de nuevo la lluvia y descenso en las temperaturas\n-\nLas carreras con m\u00e1s y menos nota de corte en Galicia: de los 13 puntos a las opciones con 5\n-\nLa puerta que todo el mundo quiere cruzar: as\u00ed es el mirador m\u00e1s buscado de Galicia\n-\nCrecer o cerrar: las granjas coru\u00f1esas multiplican por cuatro su tama\u00f1o\n-\nLuto en la verbena por la muerte de Miguel Garc\u00eda, que moderniz\u00f3 las fiestas con la Par\u00eds de Noia\n-\nLa AEMET avisa de un giro en el tiempo con lluvias y tormentas intensas en la mitad norte: as\u00ed afectar\u00e1n a Galicia\n-\nSe van de vacaciones a la Ribeira Sacra y flipan con las vistas de su habitaci\u00f3n: 'Ahora entiendo por qu\u00e9 no es reembolsable\n-",
            "Maya insiste ante Frigerio por la pol\u00edtica de reconstrucci\u00f3n de la red caminera. Por tal motivo, Maya propone a Frigerio que \u201cnotifique a la Naci\u00f3n que, ante la realidad de abandono por parte de la Naci\u00f3n, se har\u00e1 cargo del mantenimiento y reconstrucci\u00f3n de la red existente en el territorio de Entre R\u00edos\u00bb.\n\u00abDe la misma forma, interesa se promueva por la Legislatura una ley que habilite el cobro de un pasaporte de circulaci\u00f3n de las rutas de la provincia peaje- el cual ser\u00e1 abonado exclusivamente por los camiones que circulen por la provincia y est\u00e9n identificados con patente extranjera, dejando de circulaci\u00f3n gratuita el resto de las categor\u00edas\u201d, remarc\u00f3.\nEn la misma l\u00ednea, record\u00f3: \u201cLa decisi\u00f3n del gobierno nacional de no concretar obras p\u00fablicas y sumado al abandono actual por fin de la concesi\u00f3n, como de la misma forma la pol\u00edtica de eliminaci\u00f3n de Vialidad Nacional, imponen actuar con urgencia\u201d.\nAl concluir Maya su carta al gobernador Frigerio, reconoce el esfuerzo que se ha efectuado en las rutas provinciales y propone que \u201cse instrumente una fuente de recaudaci\u00f3n por parte de los camiones extranjeros que sirva para el mantenimiento de las rutas y que no sea como en la actualidad que lo que rompen los extranjeros lo pagamos los entrerrianos. Insiste Maya en consagrar la regla de que el que rompe paga\u201d.\nAntecedentes de la solicitud al gobernador de Entre R\u00edos\nEl m\u00e1s cercano ocurri\u00f3 ayer, con una carta enviada al titular de la Gobernaci\u00f3n de Entre R\u00edos: \u201cCumplo en dirigirme a Ud. nuevamente, a los fines de insistir en que se arbitren medidas desde el gobierno provincial, de reconstrucci\u00f3n de la red caminera provincial y nacional. Soy conocedor de las importantes inversiones que se han efectuado en la red provincial, a cargo del esfuerzo de los entrerrianos y tambi\u00e9n recuerdo su respuesta en la materia que \u2018le herv\u00eda la sangre\u2019 ante la falta de resoluci\u00f3n de un tema tan importante\u201d.\nAsimismo, indic\u00f3: \u201cHoy vemos que las rutas nacionales, han sido abandonadas por la Naci\u00f3n y adem\u00e1s se anunci\u00f3 la disoluci\u00f3n de Vialidad, resultando urgente arbitrar medidas para que no avance el deterioro y volvamos al ripio, ya que semejante autopista a\u00fan se puede conservar y con autofinanciamiento\u201d.\nPor tal motivo, sostuvo: \u201cRespetuosamente le sugiero le notifique a la Naci\u00f3n que, ante esta realidad, avanzara en el mantenimiento y de la misma manera solicite a la Legislatura Provincial, la habilitaci\u00f3n legal del proyecto de cobro de pasaporte de circulaci\u00f3n de las rutas entrerrianas, para que sean tributadas, exclusivamente, por camiones extranjeros, dejando de libre circulaci\u00f3n al resto de las categor\u00edas nacionales y/o extranjeras\u201d.\n\u201cA tal efecto recuerdo que tanto al Ejecutivo como al Legislativo remit\u00ed oportunamente el proyecto que habilitar\u00eda tan pol\u00edtica, lo que puede ser instrumentado en forma urgente y de donde se alcanzar\u00eda una recaudaci\u00f3n importante para mantener y reparar las rutas. Deseo recordar que en aquella oportunidad instruyo a las autoridades de Vialidad Provincial se reunieran conmigo, -cuesti\u00f3n que concretamos-, con el fin de coincidir en una medida, la que pese al transcurso del tiempo no se ha hecho realidad. Desde el peronismo y en una oposici\u00f3n constructiva, preocupado por la cuesti\u00f3n al igual que Ud. y haci\u00e9ndome eco del reclamo generalizado, es que intereso al Sr. Gobernador ejecute con la mayor urgencia pol\u00edticas al respecto\u201d, cerr\u00f3 esta carta.\nEl recuerdo m\u00e1s lejano fue en enero de 2025, donde expuso: \u201cCumplo en dirigirme a Ud. a los fines de elevar el presente proyecto de reconstrucci\u00f3n de las rutas provinciales. Desde nuestra identidad peronista creemos necesaria dada la emergencia, hacer propuestas constructivas, para que ello se traslade al objetivo central de nuestra identidad que es fuentes de trabajo y salarios dignos\u201d.\nEn esa l\u00ednea, recalc\u00f3: \u201cTener ideas y no aportarlas implica una mezquindad que se paga con hambre y desocupaci\u00f3n, todo lo cual est\u00e1 lejos del peronismo. La felicidad familiar est\u00e1 vinculada a la realizaci\u00f3n en el trabajo y educaci\u00f3n y la pretensi\u00f3n de que nuestros hijos no se alejen es parte de esa felicidad\u201d.\nEn esa l\u00ednea, sostuvo: \u201cseguramente los poderes que intervengan mejoraran la iniciativa, pero lo cierto es que esta propuesta aportara a las arcas provinciales millones, lo que implica un porcentaje muy importante de aumento presupuestario, no aportado por entrerrianos y se trasladara a su beneficio. desde el peronismo pensamos que es hora que las oposiciones no tiren piedras sino propuestas y eso inspira nuestra presentaci\u00f3n. ambicionamos ser una oposici\u00f3n constructiva porque lo que est\u00e1 de por medio en la realizaci\u00f3n de los entrerrianos\u201d.\nPROYECTO PANAM\u00c1 SECO ENTRERRIANO\nArt. 1: Crease el fondo de reconstrucci\u00f3n caminera de la provincia de Entre R\u00edos con dependencia directa del PEP, el cual se integrar\u00e1 con las recaudaciones provenientes del pasaporte de circulaci\u00f3n de camiones, para todo tr\u00e1nsito de ingreso y egreso a las rutas provinciales.\nArt. 2: El pasaporte de circulaci\u00f3n integrar\u00e1 el impuesto automotor provincial, extendido a trav\u00e9s ATER e implicar\u00e1 el derecho a libre circulaci\u00f3n sin pago alguno, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del correspondiente al impuesto.\nArt. 3: todo cami\u00f3n, con patente extranjera, que transite por los caminos de la provincia, deber\u00e1 gestionar al ingreso y egreso a modo de canon de circulaci\u00f3n y/o peaje, con destino al fondo de reconstrucci\u00f3n caminera, el pasaporte de circulaci\u00f3n, conforme a lo que establezca la reglamentaci\u00f3n pertinente.\nArt. 4: los montos recaudados por todo concepto en virtud de la presente ser\u00e1n afectados en un 75% por la provincia a los fines de la reconstrucci\u00f3n de la red caminera, comenzando prioritariamente por victoria hacia los diferentes destinos de origen, y el 25% restante ser\u00e1 de coparticipaci\u00f3n de municipios.\nA los fines pertinentes el PEP establecer\u00e1 una cuenta en el Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina y Banco de Entre R\u00edos y/o la instituci\u00f3n bancaria que estime, a los efectos del dep\u00f3sito y disposici\u00f3n de los montos recaudados, lo que se giraran en forma autom\u00e1tica a los municipios conforme al r\u00e9gimen de coparticipaci\u00f3n existente.\nArt. 5.: autorizase al PEP a poner en ejecuci\u00f3n las presentes disposiciones a partir de los 30 d\u00edas de la publicaci\u00f3n de la presente, reglamentando circunstanciadamente los montos que se deber\u00e1n abonar por los usuarios, en su tr\u00e1nsito por las rutas entrerrianas.\nFUNDAMENTOS:\nLa pol\u00edtica de rutas asfaltadas en la provincia, salvo excepciones menores comenz\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 1946/50 en que solo exist\u00edan 30 kil\u00f3metros asfaltados y en ese periodo se concretaron 607 kil\u00f3metros de pavimentos.\nDesde esa \u00e9poca hasta la fecha todos los gobiernos, de todos los signos pol\u00edticos, han venido concretando esfuerzos en mejorar y ejecutar nuevas rutas, lo cual tomo mayor impulso a partir de la desaparici\u00f3n de hip\u00f3tesis de conflicto con los pa\u00edses vecinos y la concreci\u00f3n de los puentes sobre los r\u00edos Paran\u00e1 y Uruguay, que eliminaron el aislamiento de Entre R\u00edos, que era utilizado como mecanismo de defensa ante posibles conflictos internacionales.\nLas rutas nacionales existentes en Entre R\u00edos concesionadas por la Naci\u00f3n han mantenido un estado de circulaci\u00f3n aceptable con cr\u00edticas habituales, no obstante, se reclama mejorar la situaci\u00f3n.\nEntre R\u00edos no ha ejecutado pol\u00edticas de peajes hasta la fecha, como si lo han concretado otras provincias y resulta en la actualidad, ante la realidad econ\u00f3micas, recurrir a este mecanismo a los fines de hacer posible la circulaci\u00f3n y tr\u00e1nsito, siendo imprescindible dotar de medidas de seguridad aun no contempladas como indican los requisitos internacionales.\nLa seguridad que aportan las autopistas son indispensables en la actualidad como el remedio para evitar accidentes y la p\u00e9rdida de vidas. El objetivo final es concretar autopistas.\nPor otra parte, la realidad nos se\u00f1ala que no ser\u00e1 posible continuar con el tr\u00e1nsito bioce\u00e1nico, ni el local, si continua el deterioro de las rutas y la \u00fanica soluci\u00f3n es recurrir a los mecanismos financieros y aportes de usuarios que hagan posible la existencia de rutas con la seguridad que la modernidad indica.\nLas rutas fueron destruidas por camiones en especial con destino a la comunicaci\u00f3n comercial bioce\u00e1nica y aqu\u00ed debe regir la regla \u201cel que rompe paga\u201d. Los entrerrianos ya pagamos y ahora estamos exentos, deben abonar los usuarios de extra\u00f1a jurisdicci\u00f3n e internacionales, que logran ganancias en comercializaci\u00f3n por la utilizaci\u00f3n de estas rutas.\nLos destinatarios principales de este sistema son los transportistas de grandes vol\u00famenes que conectan el Atl\u00e1ntico con el Pacifico \u2013 similar al canal de Panam\u00e1- y esencialmente se utilizan desde el sur de Brasil, cruzando el Uruguay y despu\u00e9s de Entre R\u00edos, y otras provincias llegar a Chile para su exportaci\u00f3n. Del mismo modo el regreso del comercio desde Chile a los pa\u00edses antes se\u00f1alados.\nHoy vemos la modernizaci\u00f3n de las rutas del hermano pa\u00eds del Uruguay y ello se verifica con la instalaci\u00f3n y cobro de peajes en m\u00faltiples lugares estimando que en un recorrido de aproximadamente 350 kil\u00f3metros se tributa un monto de alrededor a los usa 300. M\u00e1s aun, recientemente se han efectuado inversiones de servicios en las fronteras del Uruguay y se cobra adicionales de estad\u00eda de usa 50 diarios a los camiones que se demoran en tr\u00e1mites pendientes.\nTodo esto, antes se concretaba con un costo muy superior de navegaci\u00f3n o necesariamente recurriendo a los servicios del canal de Panam\u00e1 que por su costo encarec\u00eda el comercio. Hoy vemos el conflicto existente en Panam\u00e1, ya que los fletes superan en 12 veces a los que pretendemos instalar en Entre R\u00edos.\nLa emergencia muestra opciones que debemos definir. O se termina la circulaci\u00f3n por destrucci\u00f3n de rutas o se instrumenta el sistema aqu\u00ed propuesto para seguridad y continuidad del comercio nacional e internacional.

            "How Do Childhood Cancer Treatments Accelerate Biological Aging?. News\nArticle\nAuthor(s):\nFact checked by:\nChildhood cancer treatments can accelerate biological aging which increases survivors\u2019 risk for long-term health issues like heart disease and obesity.\nChildhood cancer treatments can accelerate biological aging which increases survivors\u2019 risk for long-term health issues like heart disease and high blood pressure, according to Dr. Zhaoming Wang and Meng Zhang. The pair go on to emphasize that understanding this connection could enable interventions to better manage and prevent these complications as survivors age.\n\u201cEpigenetic age acceleration measures the difference between your biological age and your chronological age,\u201d Wang explained.\n\u201cAccelerated epigenetic aging, is modifiable. If we can confirm that it links a past treatment to a future health outcome, then we can potentially [stop] this process to reduce the negative effects of the treatment,\u201d Zhang added.\nTo further break down the connection between childhood cancer treatments and accelerated biological aging in survivors, Wang and Zhang sat down for an interview with CURE. In the interview, they explained what epigenetic age acceleration means and how it may lead to long-term conditions like heart disease or high blood pressure.\nWang is a full member of the Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control and the Department of Computational Biology at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, where he also serves on the faculty of the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and the institution\u2019s Comprehensive Cancer Center.\nZhang is a senior scientist at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.\nIn the interview, they also discussed what role clinicians have in helping survivors of cancer reduce long-term risks after treatment.\nWang: To explain it in simple terms, epigenetic age acceleration is the difference between your biological age and your chronological age, specifically using a type of biological age measurement called epigenetic age. There are various ways to measure biological age, and epigenetic age is one of them.\nEpigenetic age acceleration essentially tells you if you are biologically older or younger than your actual chronological age. For example, if someone is chronologically 40 years old but their biological age is 45, they have a positive epigenetic age acceleration value. This means they are biologically older than they should be when compared to the average for their chronological age. A high epigenetic age acceleration value indicates that a person is biologically older.\nMany diseases are age-related; for instance, older individuals tend to develop heart attacks, cardiovascular conditions, hypertension, or high blood sugar more frequently. What we observe in cancer survivors is that their cancer treatment actually accelerates this aging process, putting them on a fast track in terms of advancing aging. Chronologically, a 10-year-old survivor might be only five years out from treatment, but biologically, they could be closer to a 15-year-old in the non-cancer population. Similarly, a 20-year-old cancer survivor might biologically appear to be 30.\nI hope this helps you understand that epigenetic age acceleration measures the difference between your biological age and your chronological age.\nMy lab's research isn't a one-stop shop; it's a continuous process. Our mission is to understand the biological mechanisms behind treatment toxicity. While cancer treatment happens in the past, over 85% of children with cancer survive long-term. We're trying to bridge the gap between past treatment and present health.\nOur previous research has already shown that certain cancer treatments in childhood are linked to accelerated aging. For instance, many children with Hodgkin lymphoma receive radiation to the chest. We found that Hodgkin lymphoma survivors age much faster, which is reflected in greater epigenetic age acceleration.\nFollowing up on that, we conducted several studies and discovered that epigenetic age acceleration is also predictive of the development and worsening of long-term health conditions. In our recently published study, we describe how these conditions include cardiometabolic and cardiovascular issues like heart disease, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and obesity, among others. These are just a few of the adverse long-term health outcomes we've been investigating.\nBuilding on our prior research, the new question we're exploring is whether epigenetic age acceleration acts as an intermediary between past treatment and current health. Our hypothesis is that aging is the underlying mechanism. In other words, exposure to cancer treatment triggers accelerated aging, which in turn leads to the early onset of age-related diseases.\nZhang: Besides what Dr. Wang mentioned, we also know that aging, or more specifically, accelerated epigenetic aging, is modifiable. If we can confirm that it links a past treatment to a future health outcome, then we can potentially target and block this process to reduce the negative effects of the treatment.\nOur findings suggest that survivors with greater epigenetic age acceleration have an increased risk of developing complications such as obesity, hypertension, and heart problems. These are often related to both their past treatments and the natural aging process, as advanced age is one of the strongest risk factors for these conditions.\nThis information could allow doctors to recommend heightened screening for these survivors. For example, they could increase the frequency of screenings, including imaging and other diagnostic tests, to catch these diseases early. The goal is to intercept these conditions before they progress to an incurable state.\nIn addition to using this information for screening, there are potential interventions. We know that certain lifestyle modifications can help. Two key examples are diet, specifically caloric restriction, which involves eating less to boost the immune system and promote health, and exercise, such as walking, running, or other sports.\nThere is also a lot of research into pharmacological interventions, or \u201cexercise pills,\u201d as I like to joke with my colleagues. This involves drug repurposing, where we use existing drugs to treat new conditions. For example, drugs like metformin (traditionally for diabetes), rapamycin, or GLP-1 (often used for obesity and now diabetes) are being researched for their potential to slow down the aging process.\nEssentially, epigenetic age acceleration provides a metric that helps us classify people into high, intermediate, and low-risk groups. This allows us to adjust screening frequency and preventive strategies, ultimately offering a more personalized approach to care.\nTranscript has been edited for clarity and conciseness\nFor more news on cancer updates, research and education, don\u2019t forget to subscribe to CURE\u00ae\u2019s newsletters here.\nStay up to date on cancer updates, research and education",
            "Biological age of the brain emerges as a powerful predictor of longevity. The candles on your birthday cake don't tell the whole story. As anyone who ever attended a high-school reunion can tell you, some people age faster than others.\nWhoever put the candles on your cake probably didn't have to guess your chronological age. But research has shown that we also have what's called a \"biological age,\" a cryptic but more accurate measure of our physiological condition and likelihood of developing aging-associated disorders from heart trouble to Alzheimer's disease.\nWe all guess people's actual ages, almost unconsciously, by scanning their faces for wrinkles, baggy eyes and other telltale signs. But figuring out how old someone's brain, arteries or kidneys are is another matter. The organs tucked inside our bodies are aging at different speeds, too, according to a new study by Stanford Medicine investigators.\nWe've developed a blood-based indicator of the age of your organs. With this indicator, we can assess the age of an organ today and predict the odds of your getting a disease associated with that organ 10 years later.\"\nTony Wyss-Coray, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences and director of the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience\nThey can even predict who is most likely to die from medical conditions associated with one or more of the 11 separate organ systems the researchers looked at: brain, muscle, heart, lung, arteries, liver, kidneys, pancreas, immune system, intestine and fat.\nThe biological age of one organ - the brain - plays an outsized role in determining how long you have left to live, Wyss-Coray said.\n\"The brain is the gatekeeper of longevity,\" he said. \"If you've got an old brain, you have an increased likelihood of mortality. If you've got a young brain, you're probably going to live longer.\"\nWyss-Coray, the D. H. Chen Professor II, is the senior author of the study, to be published online July 9 in Nature Medicine. The lead author is Hamilton Oh, PhD, a former graduate student in Wyss-Coray's group.\nEleven organ systems, 3,000 proteins, 45,000 people\nThe scientists zeroed in on 44,498 randomly selected participants, ages 40 to 70, who were drawn from a longitudinal data-gathering endeavor called UK Biobank. This ongoing effort has collected multiple blood samples and updated medical reports from some 600,000 individuals over several years. These participants were monitored for up to 17 years for changes in their health status.\nWyss-Coray's team made use of an advanced commercially available laboratory technology that counted the amounts of nearly 3,000 proteins in each participant's blood. Some 15% of these proteins can be traced to single-organ origins, and many of the others to multiple-organ generation.\nThe researchers fed everybody's blood-borne protein levels into a computer and determined the average levels of each of those organ-specific proteins in the blood of those people's bodies, adjusted for age. From this, the scientists generated an algorithm that found how much the composite protein \"signature\" for each organ being assessed differed from the overall average for people of that age.\nBased on the differences between individuals' and age-adjusted average organ-assigned protein levels, the algorithm assigned a biological age to each of the 11 distinct organs or organ systems assessed for each subject. And it measured how far each organ's multiprotein signature in any given individual deviated in either direction from the average for people of the same chronological age. These protein signatures served as proxies for individual organs' relative biological condition. A greater than 1.5 standard deviation from the average put a person's organ in the \"extremely aged\" or \"extremely youthful\" category.\nOne-third of the individuals in the study had at least one organ with a 1.5-or-greater standard deviation from the average, with the investigators designating any such organ as \"extremely aged\" or \"extremely youthful.\" One in four participants had multiple extremely aged or youthful organs.\nFor the brain, \"extremely aged\" translated to being among the 6% to 7% of study participants' brains whose protein signatures fell at one end of the biological-age distribution. \"Extremely youthful\" brains fell into the 6% to 7% at the opposite end.\nHealth outcomes foretold\nThe algorithm also predicted people's future health, organ by organ, based on their current organs' biological age. Wyss-Coray and his colleagues checked for associations between extremely aged organs and any of 15 different disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, chronic liver or kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes, two different heart conditions and two different lung diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and more.\nRisks for several of those diseases were affected by numerous different organs' biological age. But the strongest associations were between an individual's biologically aged organ and the chance that this individual would develop a disease associated with that organ. For example, having an extremely aged heart predicted higher risk of atrial fibrillation or heart failure, having aged lungs predicted heightened chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk, and having an old brain predicted higher risk for Alzheimer's disease.\nThe association between having an extremely aged brain and developing Alzheimer's disease was particularly powerful - 3.1 times that of a person with a normally aging brain. Meanwhile having an extremely youthful brain was especially protective against Alzheimer's - barely one-fourth that of a person with a normally aged brain.\nIn other words, someone with a biologically old brain is approximately 12 times as likely to receive a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease over the next decade or so as someone the same age with a biologically young brain.\nIn addition, Wyss-Coray said, brain age was the best single predictor of overall mortality. Having an extremely aged brain increased subjects' risk of dying by 182% over a roughly 15-year period, while individuals with extremely youthful brains had an overall 40% reduction in their risk of dying over the same duration.\nPredicting the disease, then preventing it\n\"This approach could lead to human experiments testing new longevity interventions for their effects on the biological ages of individual organs in individual people,\" Wyss-Coray said.\nMedical researchers may, for example, be able to use extreme brain age as a proxy for impending Alzheimer's disease and intervene before the onset of outward symptoms, when there's still time to arrest it, he said.\nCareful collection of lifestyle, diet and prescribed- or supplemental-substance intake in clinical trials, combined with organ-age assessments, could throw light on the medical value of those factors' contributions to the aging of various organs, as well as on whether existing, approved drugs can restore organ youth before people develop a disease for which an organ's advanced biological age puts them at high risk, Wyss-Coray added.\n\"This is, ideally, the future of medicine,\" he said. \"Today, you go to the doctor because something aches, and they take a look to see what's broken. We're trying to shift from sick care to health care and intervene before people get organ-specific disease.\"\nAlthough the analytical tool is available only for research purposes now, Wyss-Coray has plans to commercialize it. He is a co-founder and scientific officer of Teal Omics and Vero Bioscience, two companies to whom Stanford University's Office of Technology Licensing has licensed technology developed in this and related research for commercializing, respectively, screens for new drug targets and a consumer product.\nThe test could be available in the next two to three years, Wyss-Coray said. \"The cost will come down as we focus on fewer key organs, such as the brain, heart and immune system, to get more resolution and stronger links to specific diseases.\"\nThe study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grants P50AG047366 and P30AG066515), the Milky Way Foundation, the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience and the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.\nSource:\nJournal reference:\nOh, H.

            "Dementia In Cats Mirrors Alzheimer\u2019s In Humans And It Could Transform Research For Both Species. By the time a cat reaches its late teens, it may start to behave differently \u2014 wandering the house at night, calling out more often, getting lost in familiar rooms. To many owners, these are signs of concerning ageing. To scientists, they are clues to a disease that could help solve one of medicine\u2019s greatest mysteries.\nA new study from the University of Edinburgh has found that cats with dementia develop brain changes strikingly similar to those in humans with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The work suggests that elderly cats could serve as a powerful natural model for the human condition, potentially accelerating the search for treatments.\n\u201cDementia is a devastating disease \u2014 whether it affects humans, cats, or dogs,\u201d said Dr. Robert McGeachan, the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cOur findings highlight the striking similarities between feline dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in people.\u201d\nWhen Dementia Comes to the Doorstep\nFor many cat owners, the signs of cognitive decline can be subtle \u2014 until they are impossible to ignore. K\u00e4gi, a cat owner in Switzerland, recently shared on Reddit the story of Maolo, an elderly cat from down the street. Maolo and his family had moved away from the home he once knew, but he continued to show up at K\u00e4gi\u2019s door, as if it were still his own.\n\u201cThis, with the strong suspicion that he has dementia, because he also often forgets that he has just eaten and then still asks for another meal, seems to be the most plausible explanation,\u201d K\u00e4gi said.\nK\u00e4gi\u2019s own cats, Mocca and Cosmo, are much younger, but still demand a \u201cdessert\u201d after dinner. Maolo\u2019s visits, however, feel different \u2014 more disoriented.\nSuch behaviour is more common than many realise. A PetMD article by Dr. Melissa Boldan notes that more than a quarter of cats aged 11 to 14 show at least one sign of dementia. That number jumps to about half in cats over 15. The symptoms include wandering aimlessly, using the wrong door to go outside, struggling to find their way out of rooms, becoming stressed in familiar places, and soiling inappropriately.\nOther clues are more subtle: asking for food at odd times, sleeping in unusual patterns, waiting at the window for people who aren\u2019t due home, or seeming indifferent to affection from those they once loved.\nA short video of Maolo lingering outside K\u00e4gi\u2019s door, posted to social media, quickly went viral \u2014 drawing thousands of sympathetic comments. \u201cAwww poor thing. Might want to just lead him back home then,\u201d one user wrote. Another urged, \u201cLet him in and give food, pets, and snacks\u2026 seriously.\u201d\nA Toxic Hallmark Shared Across Species\nThe Edinburgh team examined the brains of 25 cats after death. Some had shown clear signs of feline cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) in life. Symptoms include confusion, sleep disruption, changes in social behaviour, and loss of house-training. Others were old but cognitively normal, and a smaller group were young adults.\nUnder the microscope, the researchers found a familiar villain: amyloid-beta. This toxic protein, one of Alzheimer\u2019s defining features, was lodged not just between brain cells but inside synapses, the microscopic junctions where nerve cells communicate. In humans, amyloid-beta is thought to disrupt those connections, eroding memory and cognition.\nIn both aged and CDS-affected cats, amyloid-beta was more abundant than in young cats. The protein\u2019s presence inside synapses matched patterns seen in human Alzheimer\u2019s brains and in laboratory mouse models.\nThe Brain\u2019s Cleanup Crew Turns Destructive\nThe study went further, revealing that amyloid-beta may be triggering the brain\u2019s own immune cells (microglia and astrocytes) to engulf synapses. In healthy brains, this pruning process shapes neural circuits during development. In disease, it can accelerate cognitive decline.\nUsing high-resolution confocal microscopy, the team showed that in regions rich in amyloid-beta plaques, microglia and astrocytes contained pieces of synapses. In cats with dementia, the amount of engulfed, amyloid-laden synapses correlated with the overall amyloid burden \u2014 a relationship not seen in cognitively healthy aged cats.\n\u201cBecause cats naturally develop these brain changes, they may also offer a more accurate model of the disease than traditional laboratory animals, ultimately benefiting both species and their caregivers,\u201d Dr. McGeachan said.\nWhy Cats Could Change Alzheimer\u2019s Research\nFor decades, scientists have relied heavily on genetically engineered rodents to study Alzheimer\u2019s. These models are useful, but they don\u2019t naturally develop dementia. Cats do \u2014 and they share many of the same brain pathologies as humans, including amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and brain atrophy.\nProfessor Dani\u00e8lle Gunn-Moore, an expert in feline medicine and a co-author of the study, believes this could transform care for both species.\n\u201cFeline dementia is so distressing for the cat and for its person,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is by undertaking studies like this that we will understand how best to treat them. This will be wonderful for the cats, their owners, people with Alzheimer\u2019s and their loved ones.\u201d\nThe findings also open the door to testing whether new Alzheimer\u2019s treatments \u2014 such as monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid-beta \u2014 might help ageing pets. If successful, the research could bridge veterinary and human medicine in unprecedented ways.\nThe findings appeared in the European Journal of Neuroscience."

            "Transmission Dynamics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) Viruses in Wild Birds, South Korea, 2023\u20132024. Disclaimer: Early release articles are not considered as final versions. Any changes will be reflected in the online version in the month the article is officially released.\nVolume 31, Number 8\u2014August 2025\nResearch\nTransmission Dynamics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) Viruses in Wild Birds, South Korea, 2023\u20132024\nSuggested citation for this article\nAbstract\nWe analyzed 15 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) clade 2.3.4.4b virus infections detected in wild birds in South Korea during September 2023\u2013March 2024. We isolated and sequenced 8 H5N1 and 7 H5N6 viruses. We investigated spatiotemporal transmission dynamics by using a Bayesian discrete trait phylodynamic model that incorporated geographic and host species information. Our source\u2013sink dynamics support introductions of H5N1 viruses from northern Japan to South Korea and subsequent spread through multiple regions in South Korea. The H5N6 viruses were most likely introduced into southwestern South Korea and spread northeastward. Wild waterfowl, especially wild ducks, played a key role in transmission of both H5N1 and H5N6 viruses. Our data showed multiple introductions and extensive spread of HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b viruses and bidirectional transmission between Japan and South Korea. Our results highlight the value of enhanced active surveillance for monitoring HPAI viruses, which can provide insight into preventing future outbreaks.\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) cause severe clinical signs and high mortality rates in gallinaceous birds, leading to substantial economic losses in the poultry industry (1). Among HPAIVs, the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (gs/GD) lineage of H5Nx, which emerged in China in 1996, has caused outbreaks and diverged into 10 primary clades (nos. 0\u20139) and multiple subclades (2\u20134). Wild waterfowl play a crucial role in the wide and rapid geographic spread of gs/GD lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5Nx virus (5). Of note, HPAI H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have caused widespread outbreaks across diverse geographic regions, including Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and even Antarctica (6\u201310). Increasing reports of HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b virus infections in diverse mammalian hosts, including dairy cows in North America, raise substantial public health concerns (11,12).\nIn South Korea, 6 major HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b outbreaks occurred during 2017\u20132024 (13\u201316). During the 2022\u20132023 HPAI outbreak, 174 cases of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus infection in various wild bird species were reported throughout South Korea (17). Spatiotemporal analysis of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses revealed multiple hot spots in the Korean Peninsula that were responsible for the maintenance and spread of the viruses during the outbreak (18,19). Phylodynamic analysis integrating host trait information revealed a complex intertwined relationship between different regions inside and outside the Korean Peninsula and cross-species transmission of viruses among susceptible wild bird hosts (17,20). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates from that outbreak also revealed emergence of diverse genotypes resulting from extensive reassortment (21).\nDuring September 2023\u2013March 2024, two different HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b virus subtypes, H5N1 and H5N6, caused influenza outbreaks in wild birds and poultry farms in South Korea (22\u201324). In particular, the index case in poultry was identified as a co-infection of H5N1 and H5N6 on a chicken farm (24). However, the evolutionary history and spread pattern of H5N1 and H5N6 viruses have not been clearly identified. To clarify the spatiotemporal diffusion and transmission dynamics between host species, we performed WGS on HPAIV isolates collected from wild birds during the 2023\u20132024 outbreak and performed a Bayesian phylodynamic analysis incorporating host species and sampling locations.\nVirus Detection and Isolation\nDuring September 2023\u2013March 2024, the National Institute of Wildlife Disease Control and Prevention (NIWDC) of the Ministry of Environment of South Korea collected samples from wild birds as part of the national HPAI surveillance program. Samples were collected from wild bird feces (n = 11,294), carcasses (n = 555), and captured birds (n = 1,058) from 87 major migratory bird habitats across all provinces of South Korea.\nOropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples from captured birds and carcasses and bird fecal samples were placed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% volume of 400 mg/mL gentamicin and homogenized. We then filtered the supernatant by using a 0.45 \u00b5m Minisart Syringe Filter (Sartorius, https://www.sartorius.com) and inoculated into allantoic cavity of 10-day-old specific pathogen\u2013free embryonated chicken eggs. After 72 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C, we harvested the allantoic fluids from eggs and tested for hemagglutination activity by using 10% chicken red blood cells. We extracted RNA from allantoic fluid samples positive for hemagglutination activity by using the Maxwell RSC Simply RNA Tissue Kit (Promega, https://www.promega.com) and screened for the avian influenza virus matrix (M) gene and H5 gene using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) (25\u201327).\nWGS and Assembly\nWe sequenced 8 H5N1 and 7 H5N6 viruses in this study. We synthesized complementary DNA for M gene and H5 rRT-PCR\u2013positive samples by using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, https://www.thermofisher.com). For samples confirmed as HPAIV via hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequencing, we amplified all 8 gene segments (HA, M, neuraminidase [NA], nucleoprotein [NP], nonstructural [NS], polymerase acidic [PA], and polymerase basic [PB] 1 and 2) by using AccuPrime Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), according to methods described in a previous study (28). We constructed DNA libraries by using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit (Illumina, https://www.illumina.com) and 96 dual-index barcodes, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. We conducted WGS on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) with 150 bp paired-end reads. We used CLC Genomics Workbench 24.0.1 software (QIAGEN, https://www.qiagen.com) to trim and assemble reads and identified HPAIV-positive samples (Table).\nPhylogenetic Analysis\nTo determine the genotypes and temporal signal of datasets for molecular clock analysis, we conducted maximum-likelihood analysis. We conducted BLAST searches (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) of all viral genomes sequenced in this study against the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org). We used the retrieved results as reference sequences for phylogenetic analysis. We used ElimDupes software (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/elimdupesv2/elimdupes.html) to remove identical sequences. We aligned nucleotide sequences of each gene segment by using MAFFT version 7.490 (https://mafft.cbrc.jp). We constructed maximum-likelihood trees for each gene (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS) by using RAxML version 8.0 (https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML) and the general time-reversible model with 1,000 bootstrap iterations. We used iTOL (https://itol.embl.de) to visualize the trees and considered a cluster monophyletic only when it had a bootstrap support value >70 and a nucleotide sequence identity >97% (29).\nWe focused the phylodynamic analysis on the HA gene because of its variability and role as a key antigen. We extracted HA gene sequences belonging to same clade of our sequences from the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree. We used TempEst version 1.5.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tempest) to conduct root-to-tip regression analysis and assess the temporal signal. Upon confirming a significant temporal signal (R2 >0.5), we used datasets to investigate transmission dynamics across geographic regions and host species. We conducted Bayesian discrete trait phylodynamic analyses of the HA gene by using BEAST version 1.10.4 (https://beast.community). We broadly categorized traits into host and region, and to reduce bias among traits, we performed subsampling, resulting in 6 major datasets (Appendix Table 1). For H5N1, we constructed 2 datasets for phylogeography. The discrete categories for estimation of international virus spread consisted of South Korea (n = 10), northern Japan (n = 10), central Japan (n = 6), southern Japan (n = 12), and outside of Korean Peninsula (i.e., Russia and China, n = 10). The discrete categories for estimation of virus spread between provinces within South Korea included Gyeong-buk (southeast province of South Korea, n = 5), Jeonbuk (southwest province of South Korea, n = 1), Jeonnam (south-southwest province of South Korea, n = 2), Jeju (southern island of South Korea, n = 3), and Japan (n = 10). Similarly, the regional dataset for H5N6 viruses included Gyeong-buk (n = 3), Gyeong-nam (south-southeast province of South Korea, n = 2), Jeonbuk (n = 1), Jeonnam (n = 3), and Japan (n = 1).\nFor datasets analyzing transmission among hosts, we categorized H5N1 sequences into raptors (n = 1), domestic ducks (n = 2), and wild waterfowl (n = 8) from South Korea, and wild waterfowl (n = 4) and crows (n = 6) from Japan. The H5N6 sequence dataset included domestic ducks (n = 2) and wild waterfowl (n = 7) from South Korea, 1 raptor from Japan, and H5N1 sequences from East Asia collected during 2022\u20132023 (n = 36). We categorized the viruses identified from East Asia during 2022\u20132023 as a discrete nominal category regardless of animal species and sampling location because the viruses from wild birds and poultry across that region during the 2022\u20132023 epidemic were the most probable ancestral origins inferred from the ML phylogenetic analysis. To elucidate the role of wild waterfowl in transmission, we combined H5N1 and H5N6 data to form datasets comprising wild ducks (n = 8), geese (n = 9), swans (n = 8), and other hosts (n = 10).\nFor Bayesian inferences, we applied a Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano substitution model plus gamma, an uncorrelated log-normal distribution, and a Gaussian Markov random field Bayesian skyride coalescent prior (30). We executed Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs of the configuration in parallel across 3 separate chains, each consisting of 100 million steps. We combined samples from those chains after a 10% burn-in period. We used Tracer version 1.5 (https://beast.community/tracer) to analyze parameters with adequate effective sample sizes (>200). We generated a maximum clade credibility tree by using TreeAnnotator (https://beast.community/treeannotator) and visualized the tree by using FigTree version 1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/Figtree). To quantify the support for transmission routes, we used SpreaD3 version 1.0.7 (https://beast.community/spread3) and interpreted results as positive support when the Bayes factor (BF) was >3 and the posterior probability (PP) was >0.5 and strong support when the BF was >20, and the PP was >0.9 (31). We also used FluMutGUI 3.1.1 (https://github.com/izsvenezie-virology/FluMutGUI) to identify molecular markers for mammalian adaptation across the 8 viral genes.\nOverview of 2023\u20132024 HPAI viruses from Wild Birds in South Korea\nDuring November 27, 2023\u2013February 6, 2024, a total of 8 cases of H5N1 and 11 cases of H5N6 were reported from wild birds in South Korea (22,23) (Appendix Figure 1). Among those cases, we isolated 8 H5N1 and 7 H5N6 viruses (Table). Next-generation sequencing yielded total read counts ranging from 21,507 to 756,810 and average coverage depths ranging from 240.80 to 8,442.09. During the 2023\u20132024 winter season, HPAI H5N1 was detected in a Eurasian wigeon (Mareca penelope) on November 27, 2023, six days before the initial H5N1 and H5N6 outbreak in poultry. The index H5N6 was detected in a Mandarin duck (Aix galericulata) on December 4, 2023. The number of cases gradually increased over time, reaching a peak in December 2023 (Figure 1).\nOrigin and Genotypes of H5N1 and H5N6 HPAI Viruses\nMaximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the 8 genes revealed that the HA and M genes of H5N1 and H5N6 shared >97% nucleotide sequence identity and formed a monophyletic cluster. The other 5 internal genes of isolates from South Korea formed distinct monophyletic clades within their respective subtypes (Appendix Figures 2\u20139). The phylogenies showed that the H5N1 viruses consisted of genes derived from HPAI H5N1 strains previously circulating in East Asia. In contrast, the H5N6 viruses were reassortants between PB2, PA, NP, and NS genes from low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses from Eurasia and the NA gene from H5N6 viruses identified in China. Those findings were consistent with findings observed in genetic analysis of index cases (22,23), suggesting no further reassortment occurred in wild birds during that outbreak.\nAccording to recommendations from the European Food Safety Authority (32), we screened 14 selections of molecular markers associated with the pandemic potential of avian influenza viruses (HA, 222L; PB2, 271A, 292V, 526R, 588V, 591K, 627K, 627V, 631L, and 701N; PA, 356R; NP, 52N; and MP, 95K) by using the deduced amino acid sequences of all 15 isolates. We analyzed mammalian adaptation markers, but did not detect major markers (PB2: E627K, D701N), and we identified only a few minor markers (Appendix Table 2). Among other minor mutations, we observed 156A in HA, which is associated with increased binding to \u03b12,6-sialic acid, and N66S in PB1-F2, which is associated with increased virulence and replication in mice.\nTransmission Dynamics of HPAI H5N1 Viruses in South Korea during 2023\u20132024\nThe maximum clade credibility phylogeny constructed from the HA gene of HPAI H5N1 viruses suggested that the virus initially entered northern Japan from China or Russia, then subsequently spread to central Japan and South Korea. Within Japan, the virus spread southward from the northern region to the southern region (Figure 2). In South Korea, we identified at least 2 separate H5N1 virus introductions, which most likely entered through the east-central region (Gyeong-buk province) and the southwest region (Jeon-nam province). The virus subsequently spread southwestward (Jeon-buk) and, finally, to Jeju Island in southern South Korea (Figure 3). Of note, within South Korea, virus dissemination from northern Japan to South Korea (BF 33.57, PP 0.91), from Japan to Gyeong-buk (BF 41.24, PP 0.926), and from Gyeong-buk to Jeon-buk (BF 31.701, PP 0.906) were among the most probable H5N1 transmission routes (BF >30 and high support values) (Appendix Tables 3, 4). Our findings suggest the virus was transmitted from Japan to South Korea through migratory wild waterfowl (Figure 4, panels A, B; Appendix Table 5). In particular, H5N1 virus was transmitted from wild waterfowl to raptors (BF 4.725, PP 0.591) and domestic ducks (BF 13.376, PP 0.803) in South Korea, as well as to crows in Japan (BF 46.186, PP 0.934) (Figure 4, panel A). We also estimated source\u2013sink dynamics between wild waterfowl, including wild ducks, geese, swans, and other wild waterfowl. Our data suggest that wild ducks played a major role in transmitting the virus to other hosts (Figure 4, panel C).\nTransmission Dynamics of HPAI H5N6 Viruses in South Korea during 2023\u20132024\nThe HA gene of HPAI H5N6 isolated during 2023\u20132024 was highly similar to that of the HPAI H5N1 viruses circulating in northeast Asia during the 2022\u201323 winter season (23). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that, after reassortment with the N6 gene originating in China, H5N6 likely entered the southwestern region of the Korean Peninsula (Jeonnam) and subsequently spread northeastward (Gyeong-buk and Gyeong-nam). Our findings also supported transmission from southern South Korea (Jeon-nam and Gyeong-nam) to southern Japan (Figure 5). Among the various HPAI H5N6 transmission routes, our findings supported movement from Jeonnam to Gyeong-nam (BF 24.176, PP 0.850) and Gyeong-buk (BF 10.022, PP 0.701) (Appendix Table 6). For virus transmission between host species, H5N6 most likely was transmitted from South Korea to Japan via wild waterfowl (Figure 4, panel C). Our findings supported virus spread from wild waterfowl to raptors in Japan (BF 18.752, PP 0.893) and to domestic ducks in South Korea (BF 14.932, PP 0.869). Consistent with the H5N1 viruses, wild ducks played the most prominent role in transmission to other species (Figure 4; Appendix Table 7).\nOver the past decade, molecular epidemiologic studies in South Korea have helped clarify the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 viruses (16,33). Genomic sequencing and phylodynamic analysis have shown that, since 2014, multiple introductions of reassortant HPAI H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 viruses by wild waterfowl have occurred almost every fall migration season in South Korea, and then viral detections gradually decrease or disappear within \u22485 months, around the end of waterfowl migration season (13\u201315,34,35). Previous phylogeography studies on HPAIV outbreaks in South Korea and Japan during 2022\u20132023 and 2023\u20132024 revealed bidirectional virus exchange between those countries (17,22,23). Consistent with those findings, our data also highlight the bidirectional virus exchange between South Korea and Japan. In November 2023, HPAI H5N1 viruses initially entered South Korea\u2019s Gyeongbuk and Jeonnam regions from northern Japan and subsequently spread southwestward. Given that H5N1 virus was dominant early in the season, that spread likely was associated with the southward movement of migratory birds in both South Korea and Japan during the early phase of the season. In addition, movement of H5N1 from the mid-latitude regions of South Korea to central Japan follows a pattern observed in previous seasons, suggesting that transmission might have occurred between regions at similar latitudes (17).\nIn December 2023, HPAI H5N6 appears to have entered the Jeonnam region and displayed a more irregular transmission pattern than H5N1, likely influenced by movement of wild birds within their wintering sites. Furthermore, given its introduction into the Jeonnam region, H5N6, unlike H5N1, likely was not introduced from Japan but rather from proximal countries to the west, such as China or Russia. We also observed a notable transmission link between southern Japan and southern South Korea, resembling patterns of viral movements from previous seasons where transmission occurred through hooded cranes (Grus monacha) in southern Japan and southern South Korea (17,36).\nMigratory waterfowl disseminate HPAIVs during fall migration through north-to-south migration routes (33,37\u201339), including wild ducks (40), geese (41), and swans (37) that migrate from Siberia to South Korea and Japan. Those species share stopover and wintering habitats around inland water bodies and play a crucial role in the maintenance and transmission of HPAIVs. In this study, we largely attributed the diffusion of H5N1 and H5N6 viruses to wild waterfowl. Our findings indicate that wild ducks played a major role in virus transmission not only to other wild waterfowl species, including geese and swans, but also to crows, raptors, and domestic ducks. During the outbreak, whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) accounted for the highest (44.45%) percentage of H5N1 cases among wild birds in South Korea, which might be because of their high susceptibility to HPAIVs and distinctive morphology (37). During outbreaks in South Korea, we also detected HPAIVs from raptors that likely were infected by hunting infected birds or scavenging virus-contaminated carcasses (17,42). Of note, we detected H5N6 virus from a great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) found dead. The great cormorant used to breed in Primorsky Krai and Sakhalin, Russia, and descend to South Korea and Japan every winter but is now an invasive species in South Korea where it has been endemic since the 2000s because of the effects of climate change, and the current population is estimated to be 23,000\u201330,000 individuals (43). HPAI virus infection in this new waterfowl population is a concern because it can substantially affect the epidemiology and ecology of the virus.\nSince 2014, HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 viruses have evolved through reassortment with prevailing local low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (44). A wide range of avian species, including wild and domestic waterfowl, appear to be permissive for infection and transmission of clade 2.3.4.4 viruses. Among those species, domestic ducks play a key role in the maintenance, amplification, and spread of HPAIVs of wild bird origin to terrestrial poultry (45). In this study, estimation of the host transition dynamics supports that H5N1 and H5N6 viruses are transmitted from wild waterfowl to domestic ducks in South Korea. Because domestic ducks can host a variety of avian influenza viruses as a natural reservoir species, that population can accelerate the genetic and antigenic evolution of viruses, potentially giving rise to new strains with altered antigenicity, pathogenicity, or increased zoonotic potential. To prevent dissemination of HPAI from wild birds to poultry, biosecurity measures should be enhanced at poultry farms, especially those located near wild bird habitats, to block contact with wild birds or their excreta.\nTo minimize the impact of HPAIV in wild and domestic animals, effective information sharing among countries along migratory bird flyways and timely reporting of genomic surveillance data are essential. Next-generation sequencing\u2013based genomic surveillance activities enable rapid and accurate characterization of complete viral genome and evolutionary history of viruses (46\u201348). Despite those advances and the high number of HPAIV cases reported in Eurasia in recent years, the amount of complete genome sequence data available in public databases was limited in terms of representativeness across different countries and species. In particular, the limited availability of recent genomic sequence data from poultry outbreaks could hinder the accurate reconstruction of transmission dynamics at the wildlife\u2013domestic poultry interface in South Korea. The limited sample sizes for certain discrete traits in this study might have introduced unrecognized biases in the inferred transmission dynamics. Nonetheless, our findings underscore the need for enhanced genomic sequencing and rapid sharing of poultry-derived viral sequences to better track viral evolution and spread.\nIn conclusion, public sharing of genome sequence data varies substantially between different countries and laboratories (49,50). In the last few years, we have tried to rapidly provide updated information on HPAIVs identified in wild birds in South Korea by generating and sharing HPAIV sequence data from extensive genomic surveillance efforts conducted by NIWDC (16,17,22,23). Enhanced genomic surveillance in both wild and domestic animals are needed to monitor evolution and spread of HPAIVs, which can provide insights into preventing future outbreaks and assessing zoonotic potential.\nMs. Ye-Ram Seo is a veterinary and graduate student at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University.

            "Drivers of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Natural Host and Effects of Control Measures, Bulgaria. Disclaimer: Early release articles are not considered as final versions. Any changes will be reflected in the online version in the month the article is officially released.\nVolume 31, Number 9\u2014September 2025\nResearch\nDrivers of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Natural Host and Effects of Control Measures, Bulgaria\nSuggested citation for this article\nAbstract\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an emerging tickborne disease and a World Health Organization priority. Although humans are accidental hosts, infection can lead to hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate. Domestic animals play a critical role in disease transmission, but infected animals do not show clinical signs and viremia is short; thus, CCHF virus (CCHFV) infections can remain unobserved. During 2017\u20132019, we conducted 2 sequential observational studies followed by a multisite randomized controlled trial to determine spatial-temporal patterns and quantify drivers for CCHFV exposure in a natural host (sheep) in a CCHF-endemic area of Bulgaria. We found high-risk areas embedded in endemic regions. Animal characteristics were not correlated with seropositivity; however, a seasonality effect was observed, suggesting sampling time was a potential confounder. Force of infection varied across farms and over time. CCHFV transmission heterogeneity among farms is driven by preventive measures used to reduce exposure to ticks.\nWorld Health Organization\u2013designated priority emerging diseases are those with potential to cause severe epidemics without available or sufficient medical countermeasures (1). Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a severe tickborne zoonotic disease with a high fatality rate in humans (2), is a priority emerging disease. Fatality rates have gradually increased in recent decades; major differences exist across geographic regions and occupations (3). The etiologic agent, CCHF virus (CCHFV), has a wide geographic distribution and is endemic in parts of Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. CCHFV is transmitted by ticks belonging to the Ixodidae family, mainly of the genus Hyalomma (2,4). Rising environmental temperatures influence CCHFV transmission to new geographic areas, in conjunction with other factors, such as travel, trade, livestock movement, and wild bird migration (5).\nAnimals, including domestic livestock, can become infected when bitten by CCHFV-infected ticks. Although animals develop a transient viremia, they do not exhibit clinical signs (6\u20138). Small ruminants have been suggested as good proxies to monitor the presence of CCHFV in a given region (6,9). Sheep have been epidemiologically linked to human exposure to the virus and cases (10\u201312). Despite many serologic studies being conducted in different settings, using various tests and a wide range of study designs (6,13\u201315), very little is known about the factors driving differences in CCHFV infection, host humoral responses, and spatial patterns of exposure in livestock. We conducted 2 sequential observational studies followed by a multisite randomized trial to determine spatial patterns and main drivers for CCHFV exposure in sheep (a natural host) in Bulgaria. Written consent was obtained from all participating sheep farmers. Ethics approvals were obtained from the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency ethics committee and The Pirbright Institute\u2019s Animal Welfare Ethical Review Board.\nStudy Design\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study (field study 1) in October 2017 in which we recruited 120 commercial sheep farms in the CCHFV-endemic provinces of Burgas and Kardzhali, Bulgaria, after the main tick-biting season. In Europe, temperature and photoperiod are key drivers of tick seasonality; the optimum environmental temperature for tick activity is 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C. In the Balkans, those conditions occur during March\u2013October (16). We calculated the target sample size for each province to estimate the proportion of seropositive sheep with 95% confidence and 6% precision for an expected seroprevalence of 50% and 0.12 intrafarm correlation (Appendix). We selected 5 lambs (3\u201312 months of age) and 5 sheep (13\u201324 months of age) within each participating farm and collected blood samples from each selected animal. We collected animal and farm level data by using a standardized questionnaire in a mobile application (Appendix Table 1, Figure 1).\nWe conducted a follow-up observational study (field study 2) before the next tick-biting season (before March 2018) within the main hotspot area (northwestern part of Burgas province), identified in the cross-sectional study, to investigate the potential effects of age and seasonality on seropositivity in sheep. We visited 25 farms; 14 of those had been included during the first field study. We sampled 15 sheep at each farm, stratified by age: 5 lambs (<12 months), 5 young adults (13\u201336 months), and 5 adults (>36 months). We collected blood samples from each selected animal and corresponding animal data (age, sex, breed, presence of ticks).\nWe then conducted a multisite, randomized, 2-arm, triple-blinded, controlled trial (field study 3) in the previously identified hotspot to determine the efficacy of a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)\u2013vectored vaccine candidate (encoding the CCHFV envelope spike glycoprotein [GP]) in sheep during periods of expected high transmission levels (i.e., natural challenge of animals) and to estimate the force of infection (FOI) over time and across farms. In addition, we used the placebo group to better elucidate profiles for CCHFV nucleoprotein (NP) and GP Gc IgGs over time after natural exposure. The vaccine candidate has been shown to be immunogenic and 100% protective in mice (17) but poorly immunogenic in sheep; only a modest increase in CCHFV Gc IgG has been observed in sheep under controlled conditions (18). We calculated sample size by considering an incidence of 16.9% in the unvaccinated group, a between cluster variation of 0.021, and 20 animals per farm and by assuming a vaccine efficacy of 50%, 95% confidence, and 80% power (Appendix). We also assumed a 15% loss to follow-up would occur during 6 months.\nWe recruited 32 commercial sheep farms into field study 3. At each of those farms, we selected 20 lambs that were 2\u20134 months of age and already weaned. Lambs were the unit of randomization, and we allocated them in equal numbers to either the vaccine group (arm 1) or placebo (received phosphate-buffered saline) group (arm 2). We administered a vaccine booster 4 weeks after the primary dose. We conducted intention-to-treat analysis; seroconversion was the endpoint. We visited each farm and collected blood samples at 2, 4, 10, 13, 17, 21, and 27 weeks after primary dose. We gathered animal data and general information on farm characteristics, such as management practices and biosecurity, during the first visit by using an electronic standardized questionnaire. During each follow-up visit, we collected data on changes and preventive measures (deworming, tick control, and shed spraying for vector control) that had been administered between visits. We used the EpiCollect5 tool (https://five.epicollect.net) to collect the data for all studies.\nSample Storage and Laboratory Methods\nWe stored all field study serum samples in duplicate aliquots at \u221220\u00b0C. We shipped 1 aliquot per sample at the end of each field study to The Pirbright Institute (Pirbright, UK) for testing. We tested serum samples in duplicate by using an in-house indirect ELISA to detect CCHFV antigen-specific IgG responses (CCHFV NP and Gc IgGs), as previously described (18). We also tested serum samples from CCHFV-seropositive animals in the controlled trial for CCHFV RNA by real-time reverse transcription PCR at the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency laboratories, as previously described (19). We tested samples from when the animals first seroconverted and from the previous sampling period before the sheep seroconverted.\nStatistical Analysis\nFor field study 1, we estimated weighted sheep seroprevalence. To assess the level of clustering of seropositive sheep within farms, we estimated the intrafarm correlation coefficient for seropositive status of individual sheep by using the farm variance from a mixed effect model, considering farm as a random effect. We conducted risk factor analysis separately at both the animal and farm level.\nAt the animal level, we tested the extent to which animal characteristics were associated with individual serostatus (outcome variable) by using mixed effect models, including farm as a random effect. We assessed collinearity between all predictor variables for which p was <0.1 in the univariate analysis and, when collinearity was present (Pearson correlation >0.8), we kept only 1 variable in the model. We generated multivariable models by using a backward stepwise selection procedure with likelihood ratio tests to compare models with and without the variable of interest.\nAt the farm level, we recategorized farm and management practices after data exploration (Appendix Table 1). We used data reduction techniques to identify farm typologies on the basis of management practices and farm characteristics (Appendix Tables 2, 3, Figure 2). To assess the extent to which environmental factors affect the risk for CCHFV exposure of sheep on a farm, we used land cover (shrub, cultivated, or arboreal), mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and NDVI spring slope (20) as proxies to capture environmental traits that shape the distribution of Hyalomma spp. Mosquito activity and seasonal dynamics. We tested the extent to which farm typologies and environmental variables were associated with the number of seropositive animals in the farm by using Poisson regression; we used the number of animals sampled as an offset. We selected final multivariable models by using a backward selection process with 1 variable removed each time. We then used a likelihood ratio test to assess which model best fit the data.\nWe generated choropleth maps of empirical Bayes smoothed rate at the municipality level to explore potential spatial clustering of CCHFV seropositive animals. We explored spatial autocorrelation of the smoothed Bayes risk at a global scale by using the Moran\u2019s I statistic and at a local scale by using the Getis-Ord GI* statistic.\nFor field study 2, we only considered farms that were visited during both field studies 1 and 2 (n = 14) and animals having the same age range (3\u201324 months) to capture farm-level dynamics of CCHFV NP and Gc seropositivity at key seasonal timepoints (October 2017 and March 2018). We used multivariable mixed effect models to assess differences in seropositive animals between the 2 sampling periods and age groups, including farm as a random effect.\nFor field study 3, we determined the number of unvaccinated and vaccinated lambs seroconverting during each sampling period for each farm. We assumed a lamb seroconverted during the first sampling period when its CCHFV NP IgG status changed from negative to positive. We used the pattern of seroconversion to estimate FOI for each lamb (Appendix Figure 3). FOI varied among farms and among sampling periods and incorporated the effects of control measures (vaccination, deworming, spraying, and tick control), enabling their efficacy to be quantified. In particular, vaccine efficacy was calculated by the formula 1-\u03bb1/\u03bb0, where \u03bb1 is the FOI in vaccinated lambs and \u03bb0 is the FOI in unvaccinated lambs (21).\nWe used descriptive statistics to characterize CCHFV NP and GP Gc profiles in the placebo groups. We estimated median, interquartile range, and fold-change relative to day 0 for each sampling point. We used Spearman correlation coefficients (\u03c1) and 95% CIs to determine the relationship between CCHFV NP and Gc IgGs.\nTo explore the potential effect of seasonality, we assessed the difference in the number of seropositive animals between sampling periods (October 2017 and March 2018) considering only farms that were visited on both field studies 1 and 2 (n = 14) and animals from the same age groups (3\u201324 months). Sampled animals were not the same in both studies but came from the same farms; therefore, we expected the same management practices and levels of exposure. All farms were dairy farms, all but 1 farm reported deworming their animals regularly, and all but 1 farm reported performing regular tick control. On the 14 farms, 55/140 (39.3%) sheep were CCHFV Gc IgG seropositive in October 2017 and 22/58 (37.9%) sheep were seropositive in March 2018, whereas 75/140 (53.6%) sheep were CCHFV NP IgG seropositive in October and 5/58 (8.6%) sheep were NP IgG seropositive in March. We observed a strong seasonality effect (p<0.001) after adjusting for age group. Sheep were more likely to be NP IgG seropositive at the end of the tick biting period (October sampling), when CCHFV transmission is expected to be higher, than at the end of the winter (March sampling), when CCHFV transmission is expected to be low (Table 1; Appendix Tables 4, 5). However, we did not observe a seasonality effect for CCHFV Gc antibody levels, suggesting that CCHFV NP IgG might be a better marker of recent exposure than CCHFV Gc IgG. Therefore, we considered CCHFV NP IgG levels to be a main indicator of recent natural exposure for the cross-sectional and controlled trial studies.\nWe included 120 farms and 1,200 sheep in the cross-sectional study (Figure 1). The overall weighted NP IgG seroprevalence was 38.5% (95% CI 35.3%\u201342.0%); we observed a higher seroprevalence in Burgas Province than in Kardzhali Province (Appendix Table 6). Dairy breeds were more likely to be seropositive than mixed breeds. The province and breed type exhibited strong collinearity; most dairy breeds came from Burgas Province, where most dairy farms were located and where univariate models were used. We did not find statistically significant associations between serologic status and sex, age, or presence of ticks at the time of sampling (Appendix Table 7). At the farm level, 105 (87.5%) farms had >1 seropositive sheep. Adjusting for land cover, farms from typology (cluster) 3 were more likely to have seropositive animals than farms in typology 2 (Figure 2; Appendix Table 8). Farms within 5 km of cultivated or arboreal land cover were more likely to have seropositive animals (Appendix Table 8).\nWe found CCHFV seropositivity throughout both provinces studied; however, we found spatial heterogeneity at farm and municipality levels. Some level of clustering of seropositive animals occurred within farms; the overall intrafarm correlation was 0.25. Bayes smoothed rates of seropositive animals varied across municipalities. We identified higher risk for CCHFV exposure in northwestern Burgas (Figure 3). We observed a significant positive spatial autocorrelation at the municipality level (Moran\u2019s I = 0.36; p = 0.001), indicating nearby observations were more similar on average than distant ones.\nThe multisite randomized controlled trial comprised 32 commercial sheep farms and 640 lambs (20 per farm) (Appendix Table 9), which we followed up for 6 months. In the placebo group (n = 320), CCHFV Gc IgG was detectable at baseline but declined early during the study, consistent with waning passive immunity, whereas NP IgG levels rose during June\u2013September, aligning with the expected peak in CCHFV transmission caused by tick activity and supporting NP IgG as a marker for recent CCHFV infection (Appendix Figure 4, panels A, B). Moreover, correlation between NP and Gc IgG responses (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.57) was moderate at the first timepoint in early March, then declined rapidly and remained weak or inconsistent thereafter (Spearman \u03c1 range 0.25\u20130.41) (Appendix Figure 4, panels C, D), indicating that CCHFV NP and Gc responses are not tightly coupled, especially over time.\nFOI varied among farms and over time (Figure 4; Appendix Table 10, Figure 5). FOI was initially high (especially during weeks 2\u20134), declined to a minimum during weeks 4\u201310, then rose again and peaked during weeks 17\u201321. Only 2 animals tested positive for CCHFV RNA by reverse transcription PCR; both animals were from the same farm and tested positive during the sampling period at the beginning of July (week 17). Both animals were seronegative at the previous sampling timepoint (week 13), and although ELISA optical density values for both sheep increased at the following sampling timepoint (week 27), only 1 of the sheep became seropositive.\nVaccination had a limited effect on FOI at most farms; vaccine efficacy varied among farms (Figure 5; Appendix Table 10). The posterior median vaccine efficacy was >0 (median 42.7% [range 2.8%\u201377.1%]) for 16 farms, although the 95% lower credible limit was >0 for only 1 farm (Figure 5).\nDeworming had no apparent effect on FOI (Appendix Table 11). However, tick control in animals or spraying sheds with acaricide had an effect that varied among farms. Tick control reduced FOI (i.e., posterior median effect <0) in 11 of 17 farms (Figure 5). Spraying reduced FOI in 4 of 23 farms. The magnitude of the effect was typically larger for tick control than for spraying (Figure 5).\nWe determined epidemiologic and driver profiles for CCHFV exposure in natural hosts in a virus-endemic setting over time. Furthermore, we quantified the potential effect of different control measures on CCHFV FOI. We found spatial heterogeneity of CCHFV seropositivity at both farm and municipality levels and identified hotspots in virus-endemic areas, consistent with results in other endemic regions (15,22,23). In addition, we observed a critical effect of seasonality; sheep were more likely to be CCHFV NP IgG seropositive toward the end of the tick biting period, when CCHFV transmission is expected to be highest, than at the end of the winter, suggesting NP IgG is a better marker for recent CCHFV infection. Contrary to reports in previous studies (23\u201327), animal characteristics were not significantly associated with seropositivity. However, age was marginally associated with CCHFV NP IgG when adjusting for time of sampling, and lambs were more likely to be seropositive than were adult sheep.\nApart from nosocomial transmission, close contact with animals, farming activities, slaughtering animals, and a history of tick bites have all been reported as the main activities that can increase risks for human infection and clinical cases (28\u201332). In a parallel study, we took blood samples from farmers in a subset of farms that were part of the first field study (Appendix Table 12). Only 3 (6.8%) farmers were positive for CCHFV IgG. Low levels of seropositivity are to be expected in vectorborne disease\u2013endemic areas where humans are accidental hosts. The proportion of seropositive farmers was slightly higher in this study than that previously reported within the general population in Bulgaria (2.8%) and Greece (4.2%) (28,33). Two of the 3 seropositive farmers lived in the high-risk area identified in northwestern Burgas Province, suggesting that CCHFV exposure is an occupational risk and not only derived from individual risk activities.\nTo better elucidate the dynamics of the humoral response toward CCHFV over time, we quantified temporal variation in FOI on the basis of antibody responses over a 6-month period. FOI was initially high, which might be a consequence of maternal antibodies found in lambs that were part of the study. FOI then rose again during the summer period (weeks 17\u201321 of the study), likely because of the higher tick activity during those months leading to increased CCHFV transmission. CCHFV NP has been shown to be highly immunogenic; NP antibodies are produced during infection in humans and mice (34,35). Further studies should be conducted to formally assess the protective role of maternal CCHFV antibodies.\nFOI has been suggested to influence vaccine efficacy (36). Our findings indicate that FOI and vaccine efficacy varied across farms, and vaccination had a limited effect on FOI in this setting (18). In contrast, tick control and spraying reduced FOI, suggesting that CCHFV transmission heterogeneity among farms in high-risk areas is driven by different farm management practices and preventive measures used to reduce tick exposure. Further studies should be conducted to assess differences in tick density at the farm and animal level.\nSeroepidemiologic studies have contributed to delineating transmission dynamics for various vectorborne zoonotic diseases (37\u201340). Our findings indicate that, given the short period of infectivity, serologic analysis is more reliable than other methods to assess CCHF dynamics in domestic animals.\nIn conclusion, we provide insight into the epidemiology and drivers of CCHFV transmission. As with most tickborne diseases, CCHFV dynamics are complex. We have identified key epidemiologic parameters derived from empirical data in a natural host species, in CCHFV-endemic settings, and over time. Because of the limitations in conducting controlled challenge studies with category 4 pathogens and the lack of a robust correlation of protection, natural challenge studies are a reliable approach to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine candidates and other control measures.\nDr Limon leads the applied epidemiology group at The Pirbright Institute, United Kingdom.

            "Epidemiology of Chikungunya Hospitalizations, Brazil, 2014\u20132024. Disclaimer: Early release articles are not considered as final versions. Any changes will be reflected in the online version in the month the article is officially released.\nVolume 31, Number 9\u2014September 2025\nResearch\nEpidemiology of Chikungunya Hospitalizations, Brazil, 2014\u20132024\nSuggested citation for this article\nAbstract\nWe describe 7,421 chikungunya hospitalizations in Brazil covered by the country\u2019s unified health system during 2014\u20132024. Most (43.2%) hospitalizations occurred in 2016 and 2017, reaching 0.72 (95% CI 0.69\u20130.76) hospitalizations/100,000 population in 2016. Hospitalizations were more frequent among persons who were female (55.8%), identifying as brown or black (63.5%), and 1\u201319 years of age (31.4%). Intensive care unit admissions occurred in 1.4% of cases, predominantly among children <5 and adults >85 years of age. The overall in-hospital case-fatality rate was 1.1%, which increased substantially with age, reaching 11.5% among patients >90 years of age and 14.1% among men 85\u201389 years of age. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit had a case-fatality rate of 21.1%. The total cost of chikungunya hospitalizations was US $560,746 (US $76.26 per patient). Our findings provide insights for surveillance of the most severe chikungunya cases.\nChikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, is transmitted to humans by Aedes spp. mosquitoes, primarily Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, and causes chikungunya in humans, commonly in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide (1). Phylogenetic analyses have categorized CHIKV into 3 main lineages: the East/Central/South African (ECSA) lineage, the West African lineage, and the Asian lineage (2,3).\nBy December 2022, CHIKV had been detected in >110 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, and all regions with established Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus mosquito populations have reported local transmission of the virus (4). Since 2016, Brazil has been the epicenter of chikungunya epidemics in the Americas, and 1,700,762 suspected cases were reported nationwide during 2017\u20132024 (5). The country has a sizeable susceptible population, a favorable climate, and abundant populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, which could contribute to the occurrence of rapid and localized chikungunya outbreaks, and high CHIKV infection rates are followed by periods of lower chikungunya incidence (5). In addition, seropositivity is highly heterogeneous in Brazil, and estimates range from 7.4% to 51% (6,7).\nChikungunya fever refers to the acute illness caused by CHIKV. Most (75%\u201395%) infected persons develop symptoms, which usually begin within 4 to 8 days after the bite of a CHIKV-infected mosquito. Symptoms can include fever, myalgia, and arthralgia, and CHIKV infection can cause decompensation of underlying conditions (8). Although chikungunya illness is generally self-limited, some patients\u2014especially infants; older adults; and persons with underlying conditions, co-infections, or certain genetic traits\u2014can develop atypical or severe forms. Those forms can involve neurologic disturbances, cardiovascular complications, hemorrhagic signs, or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (9\u201311). The reported frequency of such manifestations varies across outbreaks and populations, from 0.3% during the 2005\u20132006 R\u00e9union Island epidemic to 9.8% among hospitalized patients in French Guiana during 2014\u20132015 (12,13).\nIn 30%\u201340% of patients, chikungunya becomes chronic, persisting for >3 months and causing arthritis, fatigue, sleep disorders, myalgia, skin lesions, depression, and digestive disorders (1,14,15). Among the severe manifestations of CHIKV infection, cases of meningoencephalitis, bullous skin lesions, multiple organ failure with hemorrhage, and sepsis have been reported (16,17). Furthermore, CHIKV infection increasingly has been associated with substantial mortality rates, particularly because of complications, such as heart or cerebrovascular disease, renal impairment, cardiogenic or septic shock, or decompensated diabetes (18\u201320).\nData from outbreaks in different countries shows that 0.6%\u201313.0% of patients with confirmed chikungunya are hospitalized (1,8,10,21). In Brazil, the unified health system, Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade (SUS), provides universal access to healthcare, and in 2019, SUS covered almost 65% of all hospitalizations in the country (22). The SUS hospital information system, Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Hospitalar/SUS (SIH/SUS), is the country\u2019s only source of information on hospitalizations. The system is mainly used to define the values for payment of medium- and high-complexity services provided by healthcare establishments throughout the country (23). We used SIH/SUS data to explore the epidemiology of chikungunya hospitalizations in Brazil during 2014\u20132024, focusing on patient demographic characteristics, spatiotemporal dynamics, and costs covered by SUS.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study of chikungunya hospitalizations in Brazil, its 5 regions, and 26 states and the Federal District (Figure 1), using publicly available SIH/SUS data from Datasus (https://datasus.saude.gov.br/transferencia-de-arquivos). The SIH/SUS data reflect only hospitalizations covered by the public healthcare system and do not capture costs from private sector hospitalizations or out-of-pocket expenses.\nWe used data on chikungunya hospitalizations financed by SUS and registered in the SIH/SUS during January 1, 2014\u2013December 31, 2024. We selected all hospitalizations that had chikungunya as the primary diagnosis and were registered with code A92.0 from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), as adopted by the Ministry of Health (24). Secondary diagnoses (i.e., conditions that coexisted at the time of admission) were only available in SIH/SUS dataset for 2014, and chikungunya was not reported as a secondary diagnosis during 2015\u20132024; therefore, our analysis was limited to chikungunya as the primary diagnosis.\nWe used the following variables in our analyses: year and month of hospitalization; sex; age in years, estimated from the patient\u2019s date of birth and the date of hospitalization, classified into 5-year age groups; race/skin color, according to patients\u2019 self-declarations and classified into white, black, brown, Asian, and Indigenous (25); and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, when applicable. We calculated length of hospital stay in daily rates, considering the patient\u2019s stay in a hospital institution for an indivisible period of <24 hours and assuming midnight as the reference time for the start and end of the period for the daily rate, as defined by SIH/SUS.\nWe estimated case-fatality rates by dividing the number of deaths resulting from chikungunya by the number of chikungunya hospitalizations for each year. To calculate crude hospitalization rates, we used the annual population estimates based on the 2022 demographic census for Brazil (26). Thus, we defined crude hospitalization rates by region and state as the ratio between the number of chikungunya hospitalizations and the total population in the year, multiplied by 100,000 population. We calculated crude chikungunya hospitalization rates by year, region, state, sex, and age group.\nWe standardized annual hospitalization rates by age through the direct method, using the World Health Organization global standard population (27). We initially calculated the annual age-adjusted rate by multiplying each age-specific hospitalization rate times the world standard population in the corresponding age group. We summed the products across all age groups and divided by the total standard population to estimate the overall annual age-standardized hospitalization rate. We used R version 4.4.1 (The R Project for Statistical Computing, https://www.r-project.org) and the dsr package (https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/dsr) to calculate standardized hospitalization rates and 95% CIs by applying a method based on gamma distribution.\nTo describe the chikungunya-related hospitalization costs covered by the government of Brazil through SUS that were recorded in the SIH/SUS database, we considered the total hospitalization cost and its 2 components: professional services, which comprise doctors\u2019 and dentists\u2019 fees; and hospital services, which include daily rates, room rates, food, and other services. We also assessed costs of daily rates for patients admitted to the ICU.\nWe described quantitative data by using absolute and relative frequencies and quantitative variables through measures of central tendency (mean and median) and dispersion (SD and interquartile range [IQR]). We converted cost estimates from Brazil real (BRL) to US dollars (USD) by using annual exchange rates on July 1 of each year. We also provide the annual cost estimates in BRL adjusted for inflation to July 1, 2024, values by using the Consumer Price Index for Brazil, and we converted to USD by using the exchange rate on July 1, 2014.\nWe analyzed chikungunya hospitalizations registered in SIH/SUS compared with the total number of suspected and confirmed chikungunya cases notified in the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), applying the case definition adopted by the Ministry of Health (28) and using aggregated data available in Tabnet (5). Although publicly available data are restricted to chikungunya cases notified from 2017 onward, the SINAN system allows retroactive case registration and records both notification and symptom onset dates. Thus, we included all cases notified from 2017 onward that had symptom onset from January 2014 onward.\nWe performed data analysis by using TabWin version 4.1.5 (http://www.portalsinan.saude.gov.br/sistemas-auxiliares/tabwin), Stata version 13.0 (StataCorp LLC, https://www.stata.com), R version 4.4.1, and Microsoft Office 2024 (https://www.microsoft.com). Because we used anonymized and publicly available data, we were not required to submit the project for evaluation by a research ethics committee, as established by Resolution CNS/MS no. 510/2016.\nDuring 2014\u20132024, Brazil recorded 7,421 chikungunya hospitalizations in SIH/SUS, which corresponded to 0.4% of 1,698,976 suspected cases and 0.9% of 830,386 cases confirmed by laboratory or clinical-epidemiologic findings that were recorded in SINAN during the same timeframe and considering date of symptom onset. Hospitalizations followed the pattern of suspected and confirmed case curves during 2017\u20132024 (Appendix Figure 1).\nMost (43.2%) hospitalizations occurred in 2016 and 2017, and we noted peaks in June 2016 (272 hospitalizations), February 2017 (254 hospitalizations), June 2017 (272 hospitalizations), May 2019 (147 hospitalizations), May 2022 (163 hospitalizations), March 2023 (153 hospitalizations), and April 2024 (114 hospitalizations) (Figure 2, panel A). Cases in the Northeast region accounted for peaks in June 2016 (253/272 cases) and June 2017 (240/272), comprising 93.0% of hospitalizations in June 2016 and 88.2% in June 2017. In addition, 88.3% of hospitalizations in May 2022 occurred in the Northeast region. In February 2017, the North region accounted for 53.5% of hospitalizations. In the Southeast region, peaks occurred in May 2019 (95 cases), March 2023 (95 cases), and April 2024 (67 cases) (Figure 2, panel B).\nIn Brazil, the highest crude hospitalization rates were in 2017 at 0.84 (95% CI 0.80\u20130.88)/100,000 population, and 2016 at 0.72 (95% CI 0.69\u20130.76)/100,000 population; we observed smaller peak of 0.49 (95% CI 0.46\u20130.52)/100,000 population in 2022. Standardized rates closely mirrored crude rates, with minor decimal differences; therefore, we decided to focus on the crude hospitalization rates (Table 1).\nAmong regions, the Northeast had the highest hospitalization rate in 6 of the 11 years analyzed, reaching the highest rate in 2016 (2.46 hospitalizations/100,000 population), and the states of Maranh\u00e3o (9.05/100,000 population) and Rio Grande do Norte (2.66/100,000 population) had the highest rates that year (Table 2). Maranh\u00e3o had the highest hospitalization rates in 2018 (2.86/100,000 population) and 2022 (4.6/100,000 population) (Figure 3; Appendix Figure 2).\nOverall, most (55.8%) hospitalized chikungunya patients were female, and 63.5% of chikungunya hospitalizations were among persons who identified as brown or black, a pattern observed throughout the evaluated years. The median age of hospitalized patients was 34 (IQR 12\u201358) years and ranged from 27 years in 2015 (IQR 6\u201348 years) and 2021 (IQR 9\u201349 years) to 43 (IQR 13\u201365) years in 2024. Cases were concentrated among persons 1\u201319 years of age, who comprised 31.4% of overall hospitalizations. In 2017, the year with the highest number of hospitalizations, the predominant age groups were 1\u20139 years (236 [23%] hospitalizations), 10\u201319 years (205 [13.9%]), and 30\u201339 years (157 [10.6%]) (Table 3; Appendix Tables 1, 2).\nWhen we stratified annual crude hospitalization rates by sex and age group, we observed similar patterns for male and female sex in age groups from 0 to 79 years, with few exceptions (Appendix Figures 3, 4). However, we observed notable differences in the 80\u201384, 85\u201389, and >90 age groups. For 2016, 2018, 2022, and 2023, we observed higher hospitalization rates among men 80\u201384 years of age compared with women in the same age group, and the largest difference was in 2019, when the hospitalization rate in men was 4 times higher than that observed among women (1.29 vs. 0.29/100,000 population) (Appendix Figures 3, 4). For persons 85\u201389 years of age, we observed the highest hospitalization rate in 2016, when the rate for men was nearly twice that of women (4.25 vs. 2.5/100,000 population). Persons >90 years of age had the highest recorded hospitalization rates during the study period, reaching 9.22/100,000 population among men in 2016, nearly 4 times higher than among women (2.66/100,000 population) (Appendix Figure 4).\nOverall, the average length of hospital stay for chikungunya patients was 3.8 + 0.1 days, and the median stay was 3 (IQR 2\u20134) days, without substantial variations by sex or age during the study period (Appendix Table 1). Of note, patients admitted to the ICU had longer stays of 13.1 + 1.1 days than those not admitted to the ICU (3.6 + 0.1 days). In addition, patients who died during hospitalization also had longer (8.0 + 1.5 days) average stays than patients who survived (3.7 + 0.1 days).\nAmong all 7,421 chikungunya hospitalizations, 104 (1.4%) patients were admitted to the ICU, and that population was equally divided by male and female patients, 52 (50.0%) in each group. The age groups with the highest ICU admissions were adults >85 years of age (3.3%) and children <5 years of age (2.7%). The ages of patients admitted to the ICU varied greatly; the mean was 38.6 + 31.3 years, and the median was 37.5 (IQR 7.5\u201369) years. The highest percentages of ICU admissions were recorded in 2024 (3.5%) and 2023 (2.1%); admissions were more frequent in children <5 years of age (2.7%), but rates were similar among boys (2.7%) and girls (2.6%). Among persons >60 years of age, 1.9% were admitted to the ICU, predominantly men (2.3% vs. 1.6% women) (Table 3; Appendix Table 2).\nAmong the 84 hospitalized patients who died, 54.8% were male, 45.2% were female, and 26.4% were >80 years of age (mean 69.4 + 25.8 years; median 79.0, IQR 62\u201386 years). The highest case-fatality rates were recorded in 2020 (2.4%) and 2016 (1.8%) and substantially increased among persons >60 years of age, reaching 10.3% among persons 85\u201389 years of age and 11.5% among persons >90 years of age. Estimated rates were higher among men than women for the 85\u201389 age group (14.1% vs. 6.41%) and the >90 age group (13.7% vs. 9.7%). In addition, the case-fatality rate (CFR) was higher among persons admitted to the ICU than those who were not (21.1% vs. 0.8%) (Table 3; Appendix Table 3).\nDuring 2014\u20132024, the total cost of chikungunya hospitalizations covered by SUS was \u2248US $560,746 and the average cost per patient was \u2248US $76.26 (median $47.38) (Appendix Tables 4, 5). After adjusting for inflation to 2024 values, total hospitalization costs for chikungunya in BRL increased by 26.7%, from BRL $2.28 million to BRL $2.89 million. However, when we used the 2024 exchange rate (1 BRL = US $0.179036) to convert inflation-adjusted values to USD, the total cost decreased to US $516,921.61, reflecting the cumulative depreciation of the BRL relative to the USD over the study period (Appendix Table 6).\nThe highest total hospitalization costs were recorded in 2017 (US $120,960.10) and 2016 (US $120,336.60). In contrast, the highest average costs per patient were observed in 2024 (US $85.69) and 2020 (US $84.24). Across the study period, hospital services accounted for 84.2% of the total chikungunya-related hospitalization costs, ranging from 79.5% in 2014 to 85.8% in 2020. ICU costs corresponded to 19.6% of the total hospitalization expenses during 2014\u20132024, reaching 42.1% in 2020 (Appendix Table 4).\nThis study examined chikungunya-related hospitalizations in Brazil since 2014, the year when the first autochthonous cases were reported in Oiapoque (Amap\u00e1 state) and in Feira de Santana (Bahia state) (29). SIH/SUS data show \u22480.4% of suspected and \u22480.9% of confirmed chikungunya cases required hospitalization during 2014\u20132024, consistent with previous estimates of 0.6%\u201313.0% reported during outbreaks in various countries (1,10,21). Moreover, the pattern of chikungunya-related hospitalizations followed epidemic peaks in Brazil, particularly in the Northeast (2016, 2017, and 2022), North (2017), and Southeast (2019, 2023, and 2024) regions; we also noted an increase in the Central West region in 2024. Throughout the study period, publications documented chikungunya outbreaks in Northeast states, including in Maranh\u00e3o (30), Bahia (31), and Alagoas (32,33), as well as in the North (34) and Southeast regions (35,36). Although cases have been reported in the South, most were likely imported from other regions (37). The increase in suspected and confirmed chikungunya cases since 2022 reflects multiple factors, including increased transmission in several states, particularly in the Southeast and Central West regions, and improved diagnostic capacity and clinical awareness. During the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions in surveillance and healthcare services, combined with the prioritization of hospital resources for COVID-19 patients, likely contributed to underreporting of arboviral diseases and lower chikungunya hospitalization rates during 2020\u20132021.\nWe observed higher hospitalization rates among men >80 years of age compared with women in the same age groups, consistent with a study in Martinique and Guadeloupe from 2013\u20132015, where older adults, particularly persons >75 years of age, had increased hospitalization rates and ICU admissions (10). That study also reported an ICU admission rate of 7.4% among hospitalized patients, which is substantially higher than the 1.4% rate observed in Brazil during 2014\u20132024.\nWe observed an overall CFR of 1.1%, and CFR peaked at 2.4% in 2020. In another study that used data linked between the SINAN and Brazil\u2019s mortality information system (SIM) for 2016 and 2017 (38), estimated CFR was 0.08% (0.8 death/1,000 cases) based solely on SINAN data. After adjusting for underreporting using SIM data, the corrected CFR increased to 0.57% (5.7 deaths/1,000 cases) (38). Our higher rate reflects the focus on hospitalized cases, which represent more severe clinical presentations.\nIn our study, CFR was substantially higher in men >85 years of age, and ICU admission correlated with CFR, which supports the hypothesis that those patients experienced more severe illness. During the 2014\u20132015 chikungunya outbreak in French Polynesia, 64 patients with confirmed chikungunya infection were admitted to ICUs, of whom 21 (32.8%) had severe sepsis or septic shock develop and 18 (28.1%) died (39). A 2025 meta-analysis also identified male sex, age >60 years, and chronic diseases, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, as risk factors for chikungunya-related death (20). In our study, lack of data on underlying conditions in SIH/SUS precluded further risk assessment.\nAmong our cohort, 62 deaths occurred without ICU admission, which might indicate a lack of available ICU beds in the healthcare network or challenges related to case management and regulation. Furthermore, no deaths were recorded among persons 5\u201319 years of age, but ICU admissions among children <5 years reached 2.3% and CFR was 0.6% in that age group. Those findings are consistent with a previous study (40) that indicated that children, particularly children <6 months of age, are more susceptible to severe chikungunya complications, including neurologic and cardiac involvement, often leading to hospitalization (40).\nOverall, the actual mortality burden of chikungunya is likely underreported because of limited clinical suspicion and co-circulating arboviruses, such as dengue. The extent of underreporting has been estimated to reach as high as 98% in some settings. For instance, in Minas Gerais, Brazil, the number of excess deaths was estimated to be 60 times higher than confirmed chikungunya deaths in 2023 (41); Pernambuco, Brazil, recorded 4,505 excess deaths in 2016 compared with 94 deaths officially attributed to chikungunya (42); and Puerto Rico identified 1,310 excess chikungunya deaths in 2014, but only 31 were confirmed through routine surveillance (43).\nAnother study analyzed hospitalizations from all causes in the SIH/SUS database from July 2018\u2013June 2019 (44). That study reported 9.3 million hospitalizations and a total cost of BRL $183 billion (US $47.1 billion), \u2248BRL $2,000 (US $515.30) per hospitalization, and an average length of stay of 6.9 days (44). Infectious diseases accounted for 9% of bed days and 21% of ICU days. In our study, we found ICU expenses comprised 19.6% of chikungunya-related hospitalization costs.\nIn another study of hospitalization costs (45), the authors estimated the cost of 256 chikungunya hospitalizations in Rio de Janeiro in 2019 and found costs totaled BRL $88,926.72 (US $23,235.39), a small share of the BRL $279.8 million (US $73.1 million) in total direct and indirect chikungunya-related costs. In our study, the cost of chikungunya-related hospitalizations is modest compared with the total estimated SUS hospitalization costs described by others (44). Indeed, the literature indicates that indirect costs account for the largest part of the total chikungunya-related cost, particularly during the chronic phase, which can be up to 5 times higher than the direct costs (46).\nSome limitations of our study are inherent to secondary data sources, such as the quality of data entry and the absence of relevant variables for analyzing the topic of interest. The variables of sex and date of birth had no missing or inconsistent values. However, race/skin color was missing in 18% of chikungunya-related hospitalizations; this category was previously documented (47) and can distort observed differences between racial groups. Moreover, we could not identify whether the same patient was hospitalized >1 time during the study period or was admitted to private healthcare facilities. In addition, data on underlying conditions were not available, so we were unable to assess their role in the risk of hospitalization or death. We were not able to differentiate whether the hospitalizations for chikungunya occurred during the acute, post-acute, or chronic phase of the disease; thus, we were unable to investigate at which stage of chikungunya the risk of hospitalization is highest. Because we focused on chikungunya as the primary diagnosis at admission, this study might not have captured cases admitted during the postacute or chronic phases, particularly when hospitalizations result from the decompensation of underlying conditions. In addition, SIH/SUS lacks data on cause of death, possibly underestimating death related to complications of chikungunya; thus, our analysis was limited to reporting deaths among patients hospitalized due to chikungunya, which likely underestimates the overall mortality rate associated with the disease. Finally, SIH/SUS publicly available data do not include disaggregated cost components, which prevented assessment of the relative contribution of specific services to overall hospitalization costs.\nIn conclusion, although the SIH/SUS is an administratively collected database primarily intended for recording hospitalizations funded by the SUS and for reimbursing healthcare facilities for services provided, the system serves as a vital source of information on hospitalizations in Brazil, where most hospitalizations occur in SUS-affiliated facilities (22). Although chikungunya-related hospitalization costs for SUS are not substantial, SIH/SUS records provide insights into the profile of the most severe cases of the disease, including ICU admissions and case-fatality rates. Those data are particularly valuable for supporting the planning and organization of healthcare facilities to provide appropriate care according to the severity of each case, which will be especially vital in outbreak and epidemic scenarios.\nDr. Pedi is a veterinarian with the Brazilian Ministry of Health and serves at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, where she is a member of the Research Group on Science, Technology, and Innovation for Governance and Territorial Development.

Texas Republicans plan another special session to deliver Trump more GOP congressional seats\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Texas Republican leaders said Tuesday that they were prepared to end their stalemated special session and immediately begin another standoff with Democrats in the GOP\u2019s efforts to redraw congressional maps as directed by President Donald Trump.\nIt\u2019s the latest indication that Trump\u2019s push to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections will become an extended standoff that promises to reach multiple statehouses controlled by both major parties.\nTexas House Speaker Dustin Burrows confirmed the plans during a brief session Tuesday morning that marked another failure to meet the required attendance standards to conduct official business because dozens of Democrats have left the state to stymie the GOP\u2019s partisan gerrymandering attempts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nBurrows said from the House floor that lawmakers will not attempt to reconvene again until Friday. If Democrats are still absent \u2014 and they have given no indication that they plan to return \u2014 the speaker said Republicans will end the current session and Gov. Greg Abbott will immediately call another.\nThe governor, a Trump ally, confirmed his intentions in a statement.\n\u201cThe Special Session #2 agenda will have the exact same agenda, with the potential to add more items critical to Texans,\u201d Abbott wrote. \u201cThere will be no reprieve for the derelict Democrats who fled the state and abandoned their duty to the people who elected them. I will continue to call special session after special session until we get this Texas first agenda passed.\u201d\nAbbott called the current session with an extensive agenda that included disaster relief for floods that killed more than 130 people. Democrats balked when Abbott added Trump\u2019s redistricting idea to the agenda. Burrows on Tuesday did not mention redistricting but chided Democrats for not showing up for debate on the flood response package.\nThe redistricting legislation would reshape the state\u2019s congressional districts in a design aimed at sending five more Republicans to Washington.\nThe scheme is part of Trump\u2019s push to shore up Republicans\u2019 narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of his first presidency, when the 2018 midterms restored Democrats to a House majority that blocked his agenda and twice impeached him. Current maps nationally put Democrats within three seats of retaking the House majority \u2014 with only several dozen competitive districts across 435 total seats.\nTexas Republicans have issued civil warrants for the absent Democrats. Because they are out of state, those lawmakers are beyond the reach of Texas authorities.\nBurrows said Tuesday that absent Democrats would have to pay for all state government costs for law enforcement officials attempting to track them down. Burrows has said state troopers and others have run up \u201csix figures in overtime costs\u201d trying to corral Democratic legislators.\n___\nBarrow reported from Atlanta.",

GOP state leaders have asked courts to remove absent Democratic lawmakers from office, issued civil arrest warrants and mobilized state troopers.\nIt is a political fight that has now spanned in state legislatures across the nation \u2014 from California to Florida \u2014 as Trump seeks to gain more winnable U.S. House seats and preserve the GOP's slim majority after the 2026 midterm elections.\nHere's what to know.\nOn Aug. 3, Texas House Democrats fled to Illinois, Massachusetts and New York to stop the GOP-controlled state legislature from passing new U.S. House maps that would give Texas Republicans more winnable seats in 2026.\nThe chamber needs at least 100 of its 150 members to do businesses. The Democratic Party has taken advantage of this by orchestrating the majority of its 62 members to remain outside the state.\nOn Friday, there were 95 members present \u2014 five short of a quorum.\nCongressional maps are typically redrawn once every 10 years to coincide with population shifts captured by the census and is rare for it to occur in the middle of the decade. Democrats say the unusual mid-cycle redistricting is a partisan power grab by the Trump administration\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom is scrambling to call for a November special election to ask voters to redraw the state's maps in retaliation if Texas proceeds. Govs. Kathy Hochul of New York and JB Pritzker of Illinois have also said they would consider partisan redistricting.\nRepublicans are considering their own countereffort, too. In Florida, the speaker of the house said the chamber will take up this issue in a special redistricting committee this fall, and Vice President JD Vance met with Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Braun to discuss redistricting.\nTexas Democrats face fines of up to $500 each day they are absent from the chamber, a rule that was adopted after the party walked in 2021 over a bill that tightened voting restrictions.\nAbbott asked the state Supreme Court to vacate the office of the House Democratic leader. Attorney General Ken Paxton on Friday asked the court to remove 13 members who walked out from office, on top of issuing civil arrest warrants.\nDemocratic lawmakers have largely scoffed at threats of their arrests and attempts to remove them from office.\nThe special session ends on Aug. 19. The governor has threatened to keep calling lawmakers into special sessions until Democrats return.\nFor Trump, gaining additional Republican-leaning districts can help him potentially avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms, when Democrats reclaimed the U.S. House and proceeded to thwart his agenda and impeach him twice.\nRepublicans currently hold 219 seats, and Democrats have 212. Four seats are vacant.\nRepublicans hold 25 of Texas' 38 congressional seats and are seeking to pick up five more.\n___\nLathan is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

            "100 years after a man was convicted for teaching evolution, debate over religion in schools continues. Holly Meyer, Associated Press\nHolly Meyer, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 One hundred years ago, a public high school teacher stood trial in Dayton, Tennessee, for teaching human evolution. His nation is still feeling the reverberations today.\nThe law books record it as State of Tennessee v. John T. Scopes. History remembers it as the \u201c Monkey Trial.\u201d The case ballooned into a national spectacle, complete with a courthouse showdown between a renowned, agnostic defense attorney and a famous fundamentalist Christian politician who defended the Bible on the witness stand.\nIn a sweltering, pre-air conditioning courtroom, the trial became a linchpin for a tense debate that wasn\u2019t just a small-town aberration.\n\u201cThis is a broad-based culture war of which the Scopes trial is just one place lightning struck,\u201d says James Hudnut-Beumler, professor of American religious history at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.\nToday, new state laws requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms are facing legal challenges. As the Supreme Court leans right, there is an ongoing conservative push to infuse more religion \u2014 often Christianity \u2014 into taxpayer-funded education. Advocates of religious diversity and church-state separation are countering it in capitols, courts and public squares.\n\u201cWe are fighting on an almost daily basis,\u201d says Robert Tuttle, a religion and law professor at George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C.\nThat Tennessee jury found Scopes guilty of violating the state\u2019s Butler Act \u2014 of teaching \u201cany theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible.\u201d\nA century later, the role of religion in public schools \u2014 and whether to keep it out entirely \u2014 is still being fiercely debated.\nWhile attempts to interlace America and the divine are not new, from the last half of the 20th century to today they are driven by a perceived threat among white Christians who think their dominant spot in politics and culture is being eroded by secularism or multiculturalism, Tuttle says.\nOther recent examples of the debate over religion in schools include adding chaplains and Bibles to classrooms, infusing designated prayer time into the school day and expanding voucher programs that can be used at religious schools. At the Supreme Court, the justices effectively stopped the first taxpayer-funded Catholic charter school and gave parents a religious exemption for LGBTQ+-related instruction.\nTuttle\u2019s scholarship was used in the recent federal appeals court ruling that declared Louisiana\u2019s Ten Commandments law unconstitutional, citing a similar Kentucky law the Supreme Court ruled against in 1980.\nREAD MORE: Federal appeals court blocks Louisiana law requiring Ten Commandments in classrooms\nTuttle and his co-author, Ira Lupu, assert that the principles underlying the Establishment Clause \u2014 the First Amendment\u2019s ban on the government establishing a religion \u2014 remain alive despite arguments that cite a change made in a 2022 school prayer ruling by the Supreme Court.\n\u201cWe have good reasons not to concede the battlefield to the forces aimed at eliminating the idea of a secular state,\u201d their article states. \u201cWhen they overclaim their victories, others should speak up.\u201d\nThe day after the court ruling, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the Texas Ten Commandments bill that had easily passed the GOP-controlled state legislature. Lawsuits have been filed to block it and the Arkansas law that was approved earlier this year.\nAbbott has taken on a Ten Commandments issue before. He reiterated his support for the new law while celebrating the 20th anniversary of his 2005 Supreme Court victory that prevented efforts to tear down the Commandments monument on the grounds of the state Capitol.\n\u201cI will always defend the historical connection between the Ten Commandments and their influence on the history of Texas,\u201d he says in a video posted on X.\nTexas Values, a conservative Christian law and policy nonprofit, rallied support for the Texas bill. If other ideals are shared in the classroom, the Ten Commandments should be able to be shared as well, says Mary Elizabeth Castle, director of government relations for the organization.\nA similar argument was made in 1922 by Scopes prosecutor William Jennings Bryan, a onetime populist firebrand who became the face of the anti-evolution movement.\n\u201cIf the Bible cannot be taught, why should Christian taxpayers permit the teaching of guesses that make the Bible a lie?\u201d Bryan wrote in The New York Times. \u201cA teacher might just as well write over the door of his room, \u2018Leave Christianity behind you, all ye who enter here.\u2019\u201d\nAbout 60 years earlier, advances in biblical criticism caused conservative Christians to double down on rejecting anything they believe conflicted with their interpretation of the Bible, human evolution included, says Hudnut-Beumler. He blames weaponized post-World War I rhetoric for spreading anti-evolution beliefs to legislation. He sees parallels to today.\n\u201cWhatever we\u2019re going through now,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s the product of people manufacturing rhetoric in a way that stokes fear.\u201d\nCastle sees the 2022 school prayer decision as a step in the right direction. \u201cThere\u2019s always just going to be that conflict where people are trying to trample on religious freedom,\u201d she says, \u201cand so that\u2019s why we do the work that we do.\u201d\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, joined by other legal groups, is representing the families in Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas that sued to block new Ten Commandments laws. A much younger ACLU, boosted by the star power of defense attorney Clarence Darrow, represented Scopes, who agreed to be a test case challenging the Butler Act and to bring attention to Dayton.\nDaniel Mach, who directs the ACLU program on freedom of religion and belief, sees a through line between 1925 and what he describes as a present-day assault on the separation of church and state.\n\u201cThere are those who want to use the machinery of the state \u2014 and in particular, our public schools \u2014 to impose their religious beliefs on everyone else,\u201d Mach says. \u201cThe constitutional guarantee of church-state separation has served us as a nation quite well over the years in general. And there\u2019s simply no reason to turn back the clock now.\u201d\nIn 1925, the ACLU lost the Scopes case. It would be more than 40 years before the Supreme Court would overrule an anti-evolution teaching ban. But the trial, which took place from July 10-21, dealt a big hit to Bryan\u2019s reputation. He died days after it ended.\nThough a brief legal circus, the trial inflamed social divisions. Conservatives and fundamentalists in the Midwest and South felt mocked by those they considered liberal, East Coast elites. \u201cThey were humiliated,\u201d Tuttle says. \u201cThat\u2019s internalized, and it carries through.\u201d\nIn the 1940s, tensions flared with a school funding case before the Supreme Court. They returned in the 1960s when the justices ruled against school-sponsored prayer and Bible readings. It was upsetting, Tuttle says, to conservative Christians who saw schools as a source of morality.\n\u201cThe link you see with the Scopes case is a sense of alienation and devaluing of what civic experience means to them,\u201d he says.\nSuzanne Rosenblith, an expert on religion in public education at the University at Buffalo in New York, sees the wave of court cases as primarily First Amendment tensions.\n\u201cYour argument for removing something can be seen as ensuring that Congress makes no law respecting the establishment of religion. And my wanting something included, that\u2019s my way of exercising my right to religious freedom,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it could be on the same issue.\u201d\nA lesson to be learned from the last 100 years, Rosenblith says, is that America remains a pluralist democracy and needs to be approached as such.\n\u201cAll sides are going to win some and lose some,\u201d she says. \u201cBut how can we treat each other, especially those with whom we disagree on these significant issues, how do we treat each other more seriously?\u201d\nHolly Meyer is global religion news editor for The Associated Press.

            "Supreme Court delays answer to yearslong battle over Louisiana's Congressional districts. WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court postponed Friday deciding whether Louisiana should have one or two members of Congress elected from Black-majority voting districts.\nThe high court was slated to decide the case, which was argued in March, on Friday morning. The court instead stated it would soon issue a \"supplemental briefing order\" that would set forth the issues to be reargued in the next term.\nThe Louisiana case was the only one of 66 argued this term on which justices postponed making a decision.\nJustice Clarence Thomas disagreed, saying he saw \u201cno reason to avoid deciding the cases now.\"\n\u201cThese cases also warrant immediate resolution because, due to our Janus-like election-law jurisprudence,\" states don\u2019t know how to draw election maps that comply both with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Thomas wrote.\nThe delay likely means that Louisiana will keep the current configuration of the 6th Congressional District, which stretches between Baton Rouge and Shreveport, for another two-year term. The 2026 congressional party primary election is on April 18.\nLouisiana asked the nine justices to explain how best to balance the often-conflicting requirements of the Voting Rights Act, which forbids watering down the number of voters who share the same race or language, and the Equal Protection Clause, which forbids using race as the primary factor to decide which voters can elect their representatives to the U.S. House.\n\"There are two important issues on which, at least for now, the Court is not ready to articulate,\" U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields, the Baton Rouge Democrat elected last year in the redrawn 6th District, said minutes after the court postponed its decision.\n\u201cAlthough we hoped for a decision this term,\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement, \"we welcome a further opportunity to present argument to the Court regarding the states\u2019 impossible task of complying with the Court\u2019s voting precedents.\u201d\nEvery 10 years, state legislatures are tasked with drawing the congressional districts of voters to comply with the latest U.S. Census count.\nInitially, Louisiana legislators reupped the maps that spread Black voters among vast majorities of White voters, leading to five White Republicans and one Black Democrat in the House.\nAbout a third of the state\u2019s population now identifies as Black. And, since White majorities in Louisiana have never elected a Black candidate to Congress, a group of African American voters \u2014 who were called the Robinson litigants \u2014 challenged the Legislature\u2019s maps.\nThey argued that simple math would dictate that two of the six congressional seats should be drawn to include enough minority voters to give Black candidates a fighting chance.\nThe state, however, argued that the Black population in Louisiana lived too far apart, making it difficult to meet other redistricting criteria, such as grouping like communities with similar political wants in a compact geographic area.\nU.S. District Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick, of Baton Rouge, found that several alternative maps would indeed meet Voting Rights Act standards enough to create a second Black majority congressional district. A 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel agreed.\nConfronted with the possibility of the federal courts drawing the new congressional map, Gov. Jeff Landry called a special session of the Legislature soon after his inauguration in January 2024.\nThe Republican supermajority Legislature decided to target Republican Garret Graves and his Baton Rouge-based 6th Congressional District. Graves had angered Landry and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson.\nThe result is a 6th district that links Black neighborhoods from Baton Rouge to Lafayette to Alexandria to Natchitoches to Shreveport. A Republican supermajority Legislature negated the previous maps and approved the new configuration for two Black majority districts and four White majority districts, which Landry in January 2024 signed into law.\nAlternative maps would have significantly added Black voters to the north Louisiana-based districts that elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton, and Rep. Julia Letlow, R-Start, a member of the House Appropriations Committee.\nA dozen voters who describe themselves as non-African American filed a lawsuit in Monroe, where federal trial judges appointed by President Donald Trump preside. These \"Callais litigants\" argued that the new congressional districts that favored Black voters in two of the state\u2019s six seats were drawn primarily to satisfy racial needs and thus were improperly gerrymandered under the Equal Protection Clause \u2014 that is, the voters primarily were sorted by race.\nThe state, which now had to flip sides, countered that, under the circumstances of needing a second minority-majority district to satisfy the Voting Rights Act, the primary motivation of choosing where that second Black majority would go was political \u2014 protecting Johnson and Letlow while targeting Graves.\nThe Robinson voters, who became intervenors under the new Callais case, argued that the new constituency was linked by a shared disinterest of the White congresspersons who rarely visited the minority communities along the Red River and did not champion their needs in Washington.\nTwo members of a three-member panel of 5th Circuit judges ruled the Legislature\u2019s new congressional configuration was a racial gerrymander and ordered a May 2024 hearing to draw new maps. The third found that politics predominated the Legislature\u2019s decision.\nLouisiana asked the Supreme Court to stay the proceedings because the elections were so close that the Secretary of State could not properly stage the November 2024 congressional race without knowing what the districts would look like. The high court agreed, then accepted the case for arguments to sort how politics and race are to be considered in redistricting.\nThe election was held using the Legislature\u2019s new maps and Fields, a Baton Rouge Democrat who was a state senator, won. He joined the House in January 2025. He has since voted with the Democrats, for the most part, in a House with a narrow GOP majority that often advances legislation by a single vote.\n\u201cThe map adopted by the legislature was a product of bipartisan negotiation, judicial review, and compliance with federal law. It is not a racial gerrymander \u2014 it is a remedial measure responding to decades of underrepresentation,\u201d Rep. Troy Carter, the New Orleans Democrat who represents the state\u2019s other Black majority district, said Friday. \u201cThe ongoing legal challenges are deeply troubling, especially when they are driven by bad-faith arguments that twist the Equal Protection Clause into a weapon against equitable representation. Attempts to roll back the progress we\u2019ve made are not about the Constitution, they're about power.\u201d\nLouisiana argued that legislators were put in an impossible predicament of being sued by one side under the Voting Rights Act if minority voting strength was diluted and sued by another for violating the Equal Protection clause if the redistricting had a racial component.\nDuring arguments in March, the most conservative justices \u2014 Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 questioned whether Dick\u2019s ruling was \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d\nThe high court\u2019s more liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan \u2014 questioned during arguments whether their colleagues should be considering Dick\u2019s decision since the Callais litigants had not challenged her ruling and that the case before them is whether states needed \u201cbreathing room\u201d when redistricting.\nOf the three justices in the middle, Chief Justice John Roberts said during arguments that the 6th District configuration was not compact and ran like \u201ca snake\u201d through the state. Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked if there was a \u201clogical endpoint\u201d for the Voting Rights Act.\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett, who grew up in Metairie, questioned the legislature\u2019s redrafting based on a preliminary finding of lower courts.\n\u201cA fair and equitable congressional map has always been our North Star,\u201d said Ashley Shelton, president and CEO of Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, a New Orleans-based grassroots group, and one of the intervenors in the case.\nThe \u201cdecision deferring the case does not shake our focus on that goal,\" she added.\nACLU National Legal Director Cecillia Wang said, \u201cWe will be back next term to once again defend the new map and the representation Black voters deserve.\u201d",
            "The Supreme Court Delayed a Ruling That Could Shape Voting Rights Across the US. Part of the Series\nVoting Wrongs\nThe Supreme Court issued a wave of opinions last week, wrapping a 2024-25 term filled with major victories for Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. Amid high-profile decisions on nationwide injunctions, LGBTQ books, trans health care, and more, the court made the unusual choice to delay a ruling on Louisiana v. Callais: a redistricting case that could alter the future of voting rights across the country.\nThe court order did not explain the justices\u2019 rationale for seeking a new round of arguments next fall, though it said additional guidance is forthcoming. Experts fear that the court\u2019s 6-3 conservative supermajority is poised to gut the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \u2014 widely considered the most important federal law safeguarding the right to vote.\nThe case took a long and winding road to the Supreme Court, but it has major stakes for democracy. At the center is a legal battle over Louisiana\u2019s congressional maps, which were redrawn by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature after the 2020 census. Louisiana\u2019s population is one-third Black, but lawmakers drew the new map to include only one majority-Black congressional district out of six total. So, in 2022, a coalition of civil rights groups and Black voters filed a federal lawsuit against Louisiana, arguing that the congressional redistricting had diluted the power of Black voters. In that case, Robinson v. Landry, a federal judge for the Middle District of Louisiana agreed that the state had packed Black voters into a single district, likely violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting. The finding was upheld on appeal by a bipartisan panel of Fifth Circuit judges.\nNever miss another story\nGet the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.\nLouisiana lawmakers then had a choice: Draw a new map with two majority-Black districts, or accept congressional lines imposed by the Middle District judge. They chose the former, crafting a new map that both met the state\u2019s Voting Rights Act obligations and protected the seats of two Republican incumbents.\nThis should\u2019ve ended the dispute. Instead, a group of self-described \u201cnon-African American voters\u201d sued the state, claiming that the lawmakers\u2019 consideration of race when drawing the new district lines now violated the 14th Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. A different district court, the Western District of Louisiana, sided with the plaintiffs and struck down the remedial map in 2024. This is the case, Louisiana v. Callais, that currently lies before the Supreme Court.\nIf it all seems convoluted, it actually gets worse. In 2023, the Supreme Court decided a near-identical redistricting case, Allen v. Milligan, ruling that Alabama had violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act when drawing its congressional districts. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the liberal judges to issue a 5-4 opinion, ordering Alabama to add a second majority-Black district. You\u2019d think that the justices could copy-and-paste their prior decision \u2014 or that the Western District would have abided by the Allen v. Milligan ruling. Instead, the justices seem to be seriously considering a change of course.\nSo let\u2019s break this down. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act bans laws or practices that hinder someone\u2019s right to vote on account of their race. Crucially, it\u2019s a statute that considers impact, not intent. In other words, if lawmakers draw congressional maps in ways that preclude certain racial groups from electing representatives of their choice, it could amount to discrimination, regardless of whether that was the goal. This is what two federal courts found had happened when civil rights groups sued Louisiana in Robinson v. Landry, and why the Fifth Circuit ordered Louisiana to come up with new maps.\nThe 14th Amendment, meanwhile, enshrines equal protection under the law as a constitutional right. It prohibits racial gerrymandering if race is the predominant factor, outweighing every other consideration in map drawing. As a racial equity legal guide from the University of California-Berkeley explains, state legislatures are \u201cpermitted to consider racial demographics in drawing political district boundaries,\u201d and \u201cmay even be required to do so in order to protect certain voting rights (such as avoiding vote dilution).\u201d\n\u201cAlthough such activities are clearly \u2018race-conscious,\u2019 they are not \u2018race-based,\u2019\u201d the guide explains.\nThis tension is at the core of Louisiana v. Callais, but courts have long held that states have a certain amount of \u201cbreathing room\u201d for considering race when drawing maps in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Again, the Supreme Court itself upheld this precedent just two years ago. Appellees in Louisiana v. Callais, however, have alleged that the new maps amount to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\nDuring oral arguments in March, the conservative justices seemed concerningly ready to backtrack on their own ruling in Allen v. Milligan in Alabama \u2014 if not outright hostile to the Voting Rights Act\u2019s core tenets.\nJustice Samuel Alito questioned Louisiana\u2019s attorneys on whether the initial Robinson decision on Louisiana\u2019s maps could have been \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d and if that hypothetical were true, would Louisiana\u2019s arguments in defense of the new congressional map still apply. J. Benjamin Agui\u00f1aga, the solicitor general of Louisiana, sounded perplexed. Sure, he said, there could be a hypothetical scenario in which a court might get the Voting Rights Act wildly incorrect by misapplying legal precedent, but that would be a \u201cunicorn case\u201d where \u201cblack is green.\u201d\n\u201cThat case may also never arise,\u201d Agui\u00f1aga said. \u201cBut barring that case, when a federal court, two federal courts, ell a state what the law requires, to me, that means that there should be a very, very high bar in this Court\u2019s precedence for second-guessing what those federal courts say.\u201d\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, appointed by Joe Biden in 2022, also expressed concerns about Alito\u2019s hypothetical. \u201cWe have a prior court order,\u201d she noted. \u201cHaving a likely VRA violation is all that was necessary for the state to take steps that it did.\u201d\nJustice Neil Gorsuch brought up the argument that Louisiana\u2019s new majority-Black district may not be sufficiently compact to meet legal standards for redistricting. Attorney Stuart Naifeh, arguing the case for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, responded that the Supreme Court itself had noted in prior rulings that \u201clegislators represent people; they don\u2019t represent geography.\u201d\nThe crux of Gorsuch\u2019s questioning, however, rested on whether race predominated when drawing the maps \u2014 in violation of the 14th Amendment \u2014 or whether it was just one consideration. Louisiana maintains that it also redrew the maps to protect political incumbents, making the redistricting permissible.\n\u201cCertainly politics played a role in this district, but didn\u2019t race?\u201d Gorsuch asked.\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Naifeh replied.\n\u201cWhich is another way of saying race predominated, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Gorsuch continued, seemingly confused about the definition of \u201cpredominate.\u201d\nGorsuch, Alito, and Justice Clarence Thomas all voted against the majority in the Alabama decision, so this line of questioning wasn\u2019t shocking. But Kavanaugh and Roberts also seemed skeptical of Louisiana\u2019s new map. Kavanaugh brought up the possibility of a \u201cdurational limit\u201d on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, after which states would no longer be obliged to engage in race-based redistricting. \u201cOn equal protection law, we\u2019ve of course said, and the Court\u2019s long said, that race-based remedial action must have a logical endpoint, must be limited in time, must be a temporary matter,\u201d Kavanaugh said. He cited university admissions as one example, presumably referencing the Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 ruling striking down affirmative action.\nLike Gorsuch, Roberts expressed concerns about the new district\u2019s shape.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a snake that runs from one end of the state to the other,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, how is that compact?\u201d Naifeh argued that, since it was a remedial, court-ordered map, the state had more breathing room to remedy the Section 2 violation, and that lawmakers had drawn together Black populations with shared historical and community ties.\nAdvocates were surprised on June 27 when, after months of deliberation, the court ultimately punted the case. It\u2019s unclear what types of new arguments the justices are seeking to elicit. But the March hearing provides a concerning window into some of the court\u2019s thinking. After all, it\u2019s hubristic for the conservative judges to imply that Louisiana should have ignored the lower federal court orders and kept its old map \u2014 particularly at a time when defying judges has become commonplace.\nThe Supreme Court has spent years chipping away at the Voting Rights Act \u2014 itself only won after decades of civil rights advocacy \u2014 so its 2023 Alabama ruling was a pleasant surprise. Now, however, the justices might undo that one good thing. And now, we\u2019ll have to wait until next term to find out.\nMedia that fights fascism\nTruthout is funded almost entirely by readers \u2014 that\u2019s why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

            "Tariff-driven inflation accelerating with &#8216;worst yet to come,&#8217; AEI&#8217;s Michael Strain says. Amna Nawaz\nAmna Nawaz\nJackson Hudgins\nJackson Hudgins\nLeave your feedback\nNew inflation figures showed signs that President Trump\u2019s tariffs are starting to have an impact on consumer prices. Overall inflation held steady, but core inflation, which is closely watched by the Fed and does not include volatile food and energy prices, ticked up. Amna Nawaz discussed tariffs and inflation with Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute.\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nGeoff Bennett:\nWelcome to the \"News Hour.\"\nNew inflation figures show President Trump's tariffs are starting to have an impact on consumer prices. Overall inflation held steady at 2.7 percent year over year, but so-called core inflation, which is closely watched by the Fed and does not include volatile food and energy prices, ticked up 3.1 percent. That's the largest increase in five months.\nAmna Nawaz:\nThe report was the first from the Bureau of Labor Statistics since President Trump fired its commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, earlier this month, accusing her without evidence of rigging economic data.\nThat firing came just hours after the release of a weaker-than-expected jobs report. Late yesterday, the president nominated her replacement, E.J. Antoni, chief economist at The Heritage Foundation. That's a conservative think tank.\nFor more now, we are joined by Michael Strain. He's the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.\nMichael, thanks for joining us.\nLet's just start off with these new inflation numbers, overall inflation holding steady. It was helped, we should note, by drops in gas and energy prices. But the fact that core inflation did tick up, how do you look at that? What's behind it? And what does it say about the overall economy right now?\nMichael Strain, American Enterprise Institute:\nThank you.\nI think it's troubling. As you say, we saw an increase in core inflation. This has, I think, become a trend. I think we can say that we are in an economy where underlying inflation seems to be accelerating. Importantly, underlying inflation is accelerating from a level that's already too high.\nSo we have inflation that's well above the Fed's target and inflation that seems to be accelerating.\nAnd what's the role of the tariffs in all of this, especially given the sort of staggered rollout we have seen, the on-again/off-again nature of the president's tariffs policy? Is that fueling some of that inflation here?\nMichael Strain:\nYes, the tariffs are clearly playing a role. And you can see that some of the goods that are most exposed to tariffs are showing pretty substantial increases in their prices.\nI think the worst is yet to come when it comes to tariff-driven inflation. I think, over the next few months, we're going to see more and more evidence of the tariffs showing up in inflation. A lot of the inflation that we are seeing in the data is driven by underlying strength in the economy and not necessarily driven by the tariffs.\nAnd so the worry is that we have both happening at the same time.\nI want to ask you too about what we were just reported, how the president has now announced that E.J. Antoni is going to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the previous head was fired.\nWe should note Mr. Antoni is someone that Steve Bannon had been pushing for, someone who said on Bannon's podcast that it should be a MAGA Republican that President Trump knows and trusts to lead the agency. It now looks like he's tapped to do that. He's also long criticized the BLS and the way that it does the work.\nSo what do you think about this choice to lead the agency? Can you trust the numbers moving forward?\nI think that we should absolutely go into this trusting the numbers. I am extremely confident that the previous BLS commissioner, the previous head of the agency did not rig the data.\nPart of my confidence comes from the fact that it's just really hard to rig the data. And it will be hard to rig the data under the next BLS commissioner as well. So we should have confidence in the data until there's a reason not to. And that could come in the form of career staff raising alarm bells about things that are happening inside the agency.\nIt could come from evidence that the information the agency is putting out. It doesn't match other data we have or isn't internally consistent. So we should always be alert. But I think our default assumption should be that the integrity of the data will remain.\nThis is someone we should know, E.J. Antoni, who in an interview earlier this month with FOX Business Digital suggested that BLS' monthly jobs methodology was flawed.\nHe went on to say this: \"Until it's corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job report, but keep publishing the more accurate, the less timely quarterly data.\" He said: \"Major decision-makers from Wall Street to D.C. rely on the numbers,. A lack of confidence in the data has far-reaching consequences.\"\nDo you think \u2014 Michael, do you think that's a good idea to suspend that monthly jobs report?\nI think that would be a terrible idea. And I hope that that was just a throwaway comment that Mr. Antoni gave in an interview and not something that he would attempt to pursue were he put \u2014 were he made BLS commissioner.\nI think it's something that senators in the confirmation process need to ask him. And I think journalists should be asking him about his views on that as well. And I'm hoping that it was just a one-off comment he made in an interview before he was nominated to this position.\nI have just got about 30 seconds left, but I need to ask you about President Trump's comments online today about the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell. He once again demanded online that Powell lower interest rates and also seem to threaten him with legal action related to renovation costs at the Federal Reserve building.\nHow do you look at this, Michael? Is this political interference or intimidation? What's going on?\nI think it's absolute political interference and intimidation.\nIt is a threat to the long-term prosperity of the economy to have the president involving himself in monetary policy in this way, to have the president bullying the Fed chairman. I think Mr. Powell has displayed an enormous amount of integrity and has dealt with this bullying and harassment very well.\nBut what President Trump is doing is dangerous, and it should stop.\nMichael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute, thank you for joining us.\nWatch the Full Episode\nAmna Nawaz serves as co-anchor and co-managing editor of PBS News Hour.\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

            "US prices continued rise in July as Trump tariffs impact consumer costs. US prices continued to rise in July, according to key economic data released on Tuesday, as Donald Trump\u2019s international tariffs shakeup started to impact consumer costs.\nPrices were 2.7% higher last month compared with a year ago, according to the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the prices of a basket of goods and services. Though inflation dipped down in the spring, the annualized inflation rate jumped up 0.4% since April.\nThough the inflation rate stayed stable between June and July, core inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food industries, went up 3.1% over the last month \u2013 a higher pace than what was seen in June.\nPrices for takeout and restaurants jumped up 3.9% over the last year, pushing up overall food prices by 2.9%. Prices for used cars, housing and medical care also jumped up higher than the overall rate.\nOverall energy prices were down 1.6% for the year, what probably stabilized the overall pace of inflation.\nThe report is the latest to show that the US economy is experiencing some turbulence from Trump\u2019s unparalleled shakeup of US trading policy, despite insistence from Republicans that the economy is \u201cfiring on all cylinders\u201d.\nOn top of a 10% universal tariff on all imports, Trump has set higher tariffs for dozens of countries, including the US\u2019s top trading partners. On Monday, hours before a midnight deadline, Trump delayed enacting steep tariffs on China for another 90 days while negotiations continue.\nAlthough many of these tariffs only went into effect 7 August, Trump\u2019s 10% universal tariff, along with higher tariffs on certain industries like steel and aluminum, have been in effect since the spring.\nEconomists say that it takes time for tariffs to show up in consumer prices. Some retailers have been stocking up their inventory to delay the impact of tariffs and keep prices stable. But the jump in prices suggests that companies have started to pass down costs to customers, as leaders of companies like Walmart, Nike and Macy\u2019s have said would happen.\nTariffs have also hit the labor market harder than economists had anticipated. Data released earlier this month dramatically revised down job figures that initially showed a healthy job market. The government had reported 291,000 jobs were added to the economy in May and June, but the revision brought the total down to 33,000.\nThe increase in prices and the shrinking labor market has thrown the US Federal Reserve into a tight spot. The Fed\u2019s twin mandate is to maximise employment while keeping inflation in check.\nTrump has lambasted the central bank, arguing it needs to cut rates interest rates in order to spur growth. But Fed officials have refrained from a rate adjustment, citing uncertainty about the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on prices.\nTrump has spent the last few months directing his ire at economic officials \u2013 first at the Fed, and now at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which collects and reports economic data. Just hours after July\u2019s job figures report showed a sluggish month of job growth, Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of BLS. Citing no evidence, Trump claimed that the job figures \u201cwere RIGGEDOn Wednesday, he nominated economist EJ Antoni, longtime critic of the BLS, to oversee the department.\nAfter the latest inflation figures were released, Trump claimed: \u201cIt has been proven, that even at this late stage, Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury\u2019s coffers.\u201d\nThe president also, once again, attacked Fed chair Jerome Powell and suggested he might sue Powell over costly renovations to the Fed\u2019s buildings.\n\u201cJerome \u2018Too Late\u2019 Powell must NOW lower the rate,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. \u201cI am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings.\u201d",
            "Inflation likely moved higher last month as tariffs bite, putting the Fed in bind. Inflation likely moved higher last month as tariffs bite, putting the Fed in bind\nInflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald ...\nWASHINGTON -- Inflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald Trump has demanded.\nConsumer prices are forecast to have risen 2.8% in July from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That annual pace would be up from 2.7% in June and a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, core inflation is expected to rise to 3%, from 2.9% in June. Both figures are well above the Fed's 2% price target.\nThe potential increases, while modest, would put the Fed in a difficult spot: Hiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank.\nYet Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines \u2014 a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs.\nTuesday's data will also arrive at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported.\nThe president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer.\n\u201cE.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.\nAdding to the BLS's turmoil is a government-wide hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the amount of data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did a few months ago. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable.\nOn a monthly basis, prices are expected to rise modestly, increasing just 0.2% from June to July and core prices rising 0.3%. Gas prices likely fell in July and grocery costs are expected to barely increase, muting overall inflation.\nSigns of duties pushing up prices first emerged in the June inflation report released last month. Toy prices jumped 1.8% from May to June, after a 1.3% increase the previous month. Clothing prices rose 0.4% in June, while sporting goods leapt 1.8%.\nMeanwhile, the average tariff level has climbed from about 2% before Trump's inauguration to nearly 18%, the highest since the early 1930s, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. Most imports from the European Union and Japan now face duties of 15%, while goods from Taiwan pay 20% and Switzerland, 39%.\nOther trends are helping keep inflation from rising more quickly. Price increases for apartment rents, for example, are steadily cooling after sharp spikes during the pandemic era. And prices for new cars have declined slightly in recent months, even after Trump slapped 25% duties on autos and auto parts.\nSo far, U.S. and overseas carmakers are paying the tariffs, though economists say they likely will pass them on to consumers soon. Car companies are also paying 50% import taxes on steel and aluminum and 30% on parts from China.\nFord has said it paid $800 million in tariffs in the second quarter, while General Motors shouldered $1.1 billion. Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker and the maker of brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep, has said it has paid $350 million in tariffs out of a $1.7 billion expected cost this year.\nConsumers are likely to absorb more costs beyond the auto industry in the coming months, as Trump has begun to finalize many tariffs. Once businesses know what they will be paying, they are more likely to pass those costs to consumers, economists say.\nTrump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven't fallen much since the levies were put in place.\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Based on previous patterns, however \u2014 such as Trump's 2018 duties on washing machines \u2014 the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear 67% of the burden, while foreign exporters pay 25% and U.S. companies handle just 8%.\nMany large firms are still raising prices in response to the tariffs, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker.\nConsumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages.\nAnd cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.\n\u201cWe tend to lead and then we will see how many more kind of follow us,\u201d CEO Tarang Amin said on an earnings call Wednesday.\nMatt Pavich, CEO of Revionics, a company that provides AI tools to large retailers to help them evaluate pricing decisions, says many companies are raising prices selectively to offset tariffs, rather than across the board.\n\u201cUp until now we haven't seen a massive hit to consumers in retail prices,\u201d Pavich said. \u201cNow, they are going up, we've seen that.\u201d\n____\nAssociated Press Retail Writer Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

            "UN adopts resolution on Afghanistan's Taliban rule over US objections. UN adopts resolution on Afghanistan's Taliban rule over US objections\nThe U.N. General Assembly has adopted a resolution over U.S. objections calling on Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers to reverse their worsening oppression of women and girls and eliminate all terrorist organizations\nUNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution Monday over U.S. objections calling on Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers to reverse their worsening oppression of women and girls and eliminate all terrorist organizations.\nThe 11-page resolution also emphasizes \u201cthe importance of creating opportunities for economic recovery, development and prosperity in Afghanistan,\u201d and urges donors to address the country\u2019s dire humanitarian and economic crisis.\nThe resolution is not legally binding but is seen as a reflection of world opinion. The vote was 116 in favor, with two \u2014 the United States and close ally Israel \u2014 opposed and 12 abstentions, including Russia, China, India and Iran.\nSince returning to power in Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban have imposed harsh measures, banning women from public places and girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade. Last week, Russia became the first country to formally recognize the Taliban's government.\nGermany\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Antje Leendertse, whose country sponsored the resolution, told the assembly before the vote that her country and many others remain gravely concerned about the dire human rights situation in Afghanistan, especially the Taliban\u2019s \u201cnear-total erasure\u201d of the rights of women and girls.\nThe core message of the resolution, she said, is to tell Afghan mothers holding sick and underfed children or mourning victims of terrorist attacks, as well as the millions of Afghan women and girls locked up at home, that they have not been forgotten.\nU.S. minister-counselor Jonathan Shrier was critical of the resolution, which he said rewards \u201cthe Taliban's failure with more engagement and more resources.\" He said the Trump administration doubts they will ever pursue policies \"in accordance with the expectations of the international community.\u201d\n\u201cFor decades we shouldered the burden of supporting the Afghan people with time, money and, most important, American lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the time for the Taliban to step up. The United States will no longer enable their heinous behavior.\u201d\nLast month, the Trump administration banned Afghans hoping to resettle in the U.S. permanently and those seeking to come temporarily, with exceptions.\nThe resolution expresses appreciation to governments hosting Afghan refugees, singling out the two countries that have taken the most: Iran and Pakistan. Shrier also objected to this, accusing Iran of executing Afghans \u201cat an alarming rate without due process\u201d and forcibly conscripting Afghans into its militias.\nWhile the resolution notes improvements in Afghanistan\u2019s overall security situation, it reiterates concern about attacks by al-Qaida and Islamic State militants and their affiliates. It calls upon Afghanistan \"to take active measures to tackle, dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organizations equally and without discrimination.\u201d\nThe General Assembly also encouraged U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to appoint a coordinator to facilitate \u201ca more coherent, coordinated and structured approach\u201d to its international engagements on Afghanistan.\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",
            "ICC issues warrant for Taliban\u2019s supreme leader for persecution of women. The international criminal court has issued arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders, accusing them of crimes against humanity for the persecution of women and girls.\nIn a statement, the ICC said on Tuesday there were \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d the Taliban\u2019s supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and Afghanistan\u2019s chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, had ordered policies that deprived women and girls of \u201ceducation, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion\u201d.\nAfghan human rights activists have called for the Taliban\u2019s system of depriving women and girls of rights and freedoms and enforcing segregation to be recognised as gender apartheid.\nTahera Nasiri, an Afghan women\u2019s rights activist now living in Canada, said the arrest warrant was an acknowledgment of the abuses Afghan women faced. \u201cFor four years, the Taliban have told us to stay silent, stay at home, cover our faces, give up our education, our voices and our dreams. Now, an international court is saying: \u2018Enough. This is a crime.\u2019\n\u201cEven if Akhundzada and Haqqani never sit in court, they now carry the mark of international criminals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are no longer just leaders of Afghanistan, they are wanted men.\u201d\nThe court said the alleged crimes had taken place since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021 until January 2025, when the ICC\u2019s chief prosecutor first sought the warrant.\nSince returning to power, the militant Islamists have banned women from paid work and girls from secondary education, as well as issuing a series of edicts that ban women from many areas of public life, including walking in parks and even speaking in public.\nHuman rights groups have called on the international community to support the ICC in enforcing the arrest warrants. Liz Evenson, Human Rights Watch\u2019s international justice director, said: \u201cSenior Taliban leaders are now wanted men for their alleged persecution of women, girls, and gender non-conforming people.\u201d\nIn June, the UN accused the Taliban of removing legal protections for women and turning the justice system into a tool for entrenching an \u201cinstitutionalised system of gender oppression, persecution and domination\u201d. The UN report also highlighted the suspension of a law on violence against women that included protections against rape and forced marriage.\nWhen announcing that he was seeking a warrant in January, the ICC\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said the two leaders were \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d for gender-based persecution in Afghanistan and that he would also be seeking warrants for the arrest of other Taliban leaders.\n\u201cOur commitment to pursue accountability for gender-based crimes, including gender persecution, remains an absolute priority,\u201d he said.\nAmnesty International has also called on the international community to recognise gender apartheid as a crime under international law.\nParwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi, a former Taliban prisoner now living in Germany, said: \u201cArresting these men won\u2019t be easy, especially with some countries still engaging with the Taliban. But I hope member states of the ICC take this seriously and act to arrest them.\u201d",
            "ICC issues arrest warrants for Taliban leaders over persecution of women and girls. THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Tuesday for the Taliban's supreme leader and the head of Afghanistan's Supreme Court on charges of persecuting women and girls since seizing power nearly four years ago.\nThe warrants also accuse the leaders of persecuting \"other persons nonconforming with the Taliban's policy on gender, gender identity or expression; and on political grounds against persons perceived as 'allies of girls and women.'\"\nThe warrants were issued against Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhunzada and the head of the Supreme Court, Abdul Hakim Haqqani.\nThe court's prosecution office called the decision to issue warrants \"an important vindication and acknowledgment of the rights of Afghan women and girls.\"\nIt added that the judges' ruling \"also recognizes the rights and lived experiences of persons whom the Taliban perceived as not conforming with their ideological expectations of gender identity or expression, such as members of the LGBTQI+ community, and persons whom the Taliban perceived as allies of girls and women.\"\nZabihullah Mujahid, the chief spokesman for the Taliban government, rejected the court's authority.\nHe said in a statement that the court's decision reflected \"open hostility and hatred toward the holy religion of Islam and Shariah law,\" and is \"an insult to the beliefs of all Muslims.\"\nThe warrants came just hours after the United Nations adopted a resolution Monday over U.S. objections that called on the Taliban to reverse their worsening oppression of women and girls and eliminate all terrorist organizations.\nThey are the latest high-profile suspects named in arrest warrants issued by The Hague-based court that also has sought the arrest of other leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nSince returning to power in Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban have imposed harsh measures, banning women from public places and girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade. Last week, Russia became the first country to formally recognize the Taliban's government.\nThe court said in a statement that the Taliban have \"severely deprived, through decrees and edicts, girls and women of the rights to education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion.\"\nThe court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, sought the warrants in January, saying that they recognized that \"Afghan women and girls as well as the LGBTQI+ community are facing an unprecedented, unconscionable and ongoing persecution by the Taliban.\"\nGlobal advocacy group Human Rights Watch welcomed the decision, and urged the international community to help enforce the court's warrants.\n\"Senior Taliban leaders are now wanted men for their alleged persecution of women, girls, and gender-nonconforming people,\" Liz Evenson, the group's international justice director, said in a statement.\nICC judges approved a request in 2022 from the prosecutor to reopen an investigation into Afghanistan. The probe was shelved after Kabul said it could handle the investigation.\nKhan said he wanted to reopen the inquiry because under the Taliban, there was \"no longer the prospect of genuine and effective domestic investigations\" in Afghanistan.\nKhan's predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, got approval in 2020 to start looking at offenses allegedly committed by Afghan government forces, the Taliban, American troops and U.S. foreign intelligence operatives dating back to 2002.\nWhen Khan reopened the probe, he said he would focus on crimes committed by the Taliban and the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State group. He said he would \"deprioritize\" other aspects of the investigation, such as crimes committed by Americans.\nThe warrants for Taliban leaders were issued while Khan has stepped down temporarily pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. Khan has categorically denied accusations that he tried for more than a year to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her against her will."

            "Forest Protectors Launch Tree Sit and Lawsuits to Stop Ecocidal Logging in WA. Standing at the edge of the Aldwell Forest clearcut just above the Elwha River in Washington State, the Murphy Company\u2019s devastation of the landscape slaps you in the face. Here on land owned by the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources (DNR), a beautiful mature forest has been logged for hardwood, plywood, and other wood products. Hacked-off stumps are visible in all directions, a few trees left to stand. The former forest floor, once rich with organisms and nutrients that fed life, now stands heaped into huge slash piles to be burned. The land doused with herbicide to kill any competitors to Douglas fir seedlings that will become a new tree plantation monoculture.\nThe contrast with the remaining intact Elwha legacy forests, located nearby in the watershed, couldn\u2019t be starker. There, in naturally regenerated forests more than a century old, large Douglas fir, western red cedar and big-leaf maple trees festooned with moss and licorice ferns surround you. Native sword ferns, trillium, salal, red huckleberry, lichen, and other native vegetation in multiple shades of brilliant green abound.\nAfter DNR put more Elwha legacy forest on the chopping block during a November 2024 auction, environmentalists, citizens, and forest defenders are fighting to stop Murphy\u2019s logging there through lawsuits and direct action.\nDon\u2019t miss a beat\nGet the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.\nFor over a month, a tree-sit launched by a grouping called the Olympic Forest Defenders (OFD) blocked the road into the Parched forest site scheduled for destruction. The sit received broad support through encampments, rallies, and continuous supply efforts from community members. After a judge refused to extend an injunction against logging, police and violent vigilantes attacked the sit and encampment. The OFD made a decision to end the tree-sit on June 15 for the safety of those involved.\n\u201cOur commitment to defend the forests and waters of the Olympic Peninsula remains strong,\u201d states an OFD press release. \u201cTo the vigilantes, the DNR cops, and state-sponsored repression, we say: You did not dig up our roots. We are still here. Stop pillaging our people. Stop pillaging our forests. Stop pillaging our waters. Our movement has not been uprooted. It is just beginning to grow.\u201d\nThe Restored Elwha and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe\nThe Elwha River runs out of the protected Olympic National Park. It is the pulsing heart of the ancestral homelands of the Lower Elwha Klallam tribe. Two large hydropower dams, the Elwha and Glines Canyon, were built on the river between 1910 and 1927 to fuel timber processing and industry in the Port Angeles area. The dam builder didn\u2019t bother to include legally required mechanisms for fish passage.\nThe dams blocked the free-flowing river, flooding tribal village and cultural sites and decimating the tribe\u2019s way of life. Ninety-three percent of the upstream salmon spawning habitat was cut off, leading to near extirpation of pristine populations of wild salmon in the river that was central to the Lower Elwha people\u2019s life and culture. Before the dams, the Elwha was famous for its enormous chinook salmon, precious to the tribe and a primary food source for orca whales of the Salish Sea.\nTribal elders passed down to their children and grandchildren the stories of the river filled with fish before the dams. Under tribal pressure that spanned generations, a $325 million project was launched in 2011 by tribal, governmental, and academic agencies and scientists to restore the river ecosystem by removing the dams; restoring the river\u2019s flow; planting native plants; and building back the populations of five species of Pacific salmon, steelhead, and other species. The dams were finally taken down in the years between 2011 and 2014 \u2014 more than 20 years after a 1992 Congressional Act ordered it.\nThe project has been an inspiring success in restoring the anadromous fish populations and the ecosystem, as well as a source of pride for the Lower Elwha people. The river returned to natural channels after dam removal, and after a few years of major sediment release, it began to clear. The released sediment rebuilt the delta and estuary at the Elwha mouth on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which is critical to rearing juvenile migrating fish.\nBut new logging of forests on the hills just above the river represents an assault on the restoration efforts that have been achieved. It also explains the deep feelings held among tribal members, Forest Defenders, conservationists, and others who care about the land and river ecosystem.\nA petition circulated in October 2024 by Lower Elwha tribe members and signed by over half of the members of the tribe, as well as 2,500 other people, states that,\nWe do not understand a way of thinking that would spend hundreds of millions on Elwha River restoration but continue to industrially log in that same watershed. We do not understand a way of thinking that takes too much and says it is never enough; that would disrespect a River that gives us so much life and now hope.\nOur ancestral knowledge and sacred obligation to the natural world teaches us a different path. We have inherent and treaty protected rights in these lands as our usual and accustomed gathering areas. Together, we call for the protection of the Elwha Watershed as a commitment to our mutual future and to the wellbeing of all who depend upon it. We ask you to stop these planned timber sales and heed our call to be guided by principles of respect and reciprocity in caring for the watershed.\nLawsuits in Defense of the Elwha Legacy Forests\nThe DNR\u2019s November 2024 auction of the now-threatened Elwha forests to the Murphy Company were among others the DNR Board of Resources rushed through in apparent anticipation of new Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove taking office in January 2025. Upthegrove had pledged to protect legacy forests if elected.\nThe Tree Well and Parched logging plans threaten to cut over 300 acres of mature legacy conifer forest, some of which has never been logged. Two lawsuits were filed to overturn the sales in December 2024 by the Earth Law Center (ELC) in conjunction with the Orca Network, the Center for Whale Research, and the Legacy Forest Defense Coalition (LFDC).\nThe lawsuits lay out a coherent, detailed picture of the damage new logging would cause to the river ecosystem. The ELC suit alleges that the DNR is violating the state Public Lands and Environmental Policy Acts by failing to perform an adequate environmental assessment of the logging\u2019s impact on mature, structurally complex, and biodiverse forests. The two forest sites are critical to carbon sequestration and as habitat for wildlife and culturally significant native plants.\nThe lawsuit also argues scientific studies have shown logging negatively impacts stream flows, hydrology, and water temperature \u2014 all factors critical to supporting the Elwha system and its salmon populations, which in turn support populations of the critically endangered southern resident orcas.\nThe groups\u2019 also charge that logging on steep slopes in these sites above the Elwha and its tributaries threatens slope stability, pointing out the potential impact to Port Angeles\u2019s water supply.\nLFCD is suing for injunctive relief against the sale of the forests on the basis that the DNR is neglecting to follow its own policies to regenerate old-growth forest on 10-15 percent of state forestlands \u2014 a legal approach that has successfully paused other DNR timber sales.\nThe LFDC\u2019s Kyle Krakow told Truthout in an emailed statement that the group has \u201cappealed a total of 32 sales in lawsuits that are still ongoing in most cases. Collectively, these timber sales threaten over 2,300 acres of biodiverse and carbon-dense legacy forests across western Washington.\u201d\nTruthout also spoke to LaTrisha Suggs, a restoration planner for, and enrolled member of, the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam tribe. Her family has lived for time immemorial in Clallam County. Suggs is also a Port Angeles City Council member who worked as a restoration planner for the Lower Elwha tribe on the river restoration project.\nIn a declaration filed in support of the LFDC lawsuit, Suggs stated that,\nThe sites of many of the proposed and sold parcels have steep slopes, and the levels of logging that occurs has an impact on the potential for landslides, particularly with the impacts of climate change and increased rain events in Port Angeles. When landslides occur, because the trees can no longer hold back the soil due to clear cutting, the soil runs into the streams and rivers, blocking access to salmon and impacting water quality. The soils of mature forests act as storage for water that the plant communities rely on during the summer months.\nHer declaration also stated that Port Angeles has been under a stage three water shortage each summer since 2022, and Clallam County has been under a drought advisory for years \u2014 issues expected to get worse as climate change advances.\nElizabeth Dunne is ELC\u2019s director of legal advocacy. She lives near the Elwha River and co-founded the Elwha Legacy Forest Coalition (ELF) after DNR sanctioned logging on the Aldwell forest. Dunne and the coalition\u2019s successful efforts to stop a prior timber sale in the Elwha has been told in an award-winning short film, Last Stand, Saving the Elwha River\u2019s Legacy Forests.\nShe shared a map with Truthout showing that greater than 50 percent of the Elwha\u2019s legacy forests have been logged in just the last 17 years; little older forest remains in the Elwha watershed. Now DNR has plans for logging 800 more acres.\n\u201cThe Elwha River is really speaking for many of these ecosystems that are suffering at the hands of over-extraction and exploitation for profit without having any kind of sense of responsibility of the balance that we need to show back to the Earth if we are going to continue to survive as a species. And not just survive but be able to thrive,\u201d Dunne said. \u201cImagine a world where we can go fishing, where we have abundant ecosystems, and they\u2019re not all controlled and commodified, and we\u2019re able to, sustain ourselves.\u201d\nThe Fight to Save the Parched Legacy Forest\nIn early May, Murphy began building roads into the Parched timber units, tearing down trees and bringing in gravel. In response, on May 7 the Olympic Forest Defenders began their tree-sit, blocking the road into the Parched site off U.S. Highway 101.\nThe Forest Defenders demanded an immediate cancellation of the Parched timber sale, a pause on all logging in the Elwha watershed, and a permanent ban on logging the remaining mature forests in western Washington.\nThe tree-sit involved a cable pulley stretched from logs and other debris blocking the middle of the logging road connected to a \u201cdunk tank\u201d-type platform 60-80 feet up a nearby large grand fir tree. Cutting the cable would cause the sitter on the platform to come crashing down.\nTruthout was able to visit and speak there and on the phone with \u201cFable,\u201d a 25-year-old tree-sitter, about the goals of the tree-sit and why they were participating. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history in the Pacific Northwest of direct action and tree-sitting being effective, especially when done in conjunction with some sort of legal pressure,\u201d Fable told Truthout.\nThey told Truthout they had grown up a timber farm and helped manage it with their parents. The family would talk about the impact of logging on the land and the creeks, and Fable would go salmon fishing with their dad and uncles, learning about the connection between forests, rivers, and salmon.\nFable told Truthout that they had studied math to get a master\u2019s degree, but their recent experience of caretaking for a loved one who was sick changed their life. The experience \u201cmade me want to be more involved in things that actually make change in the world,\u201d they said. \u201cRealistically, the most good you can do is caring for people and caring for land, and keeping people and land safe from the really evil things that are out there.\u201d\nRallies were held at the Parched site, and for over a month community members from around the region continuously brought in supplies and camped to protect the sitter. DNR officers initially surrounded the tree, running generator-powered lights around the clock before backing off. They would at times try to stop people from going in or threaten them with arrest.\n\u201cThe support\u2019s been great and kind of surprising,\u201d Fable said. \u201cPeople understand how critical of a moment this is and that this kind of action is necessary, which really gives me a lot of hope because that\u2019s how I feel. And to not just be a lone person doing something like this is just really, really cool.\u201d\nAfter the tree-sit began, Land Commissioner Upthegrove, who placed a six-month pause on logging legacy forests, condemned the sitters saying, \u201cThis stunt is dangerous, reckless and counterproductive\u2026. Their actions put the safety and lives of my employees at risk, and I will seek the prosecution of those involved to the fullest extent of the law. This kind of dangerous vandalism makes it harder to advance a positive environmental agenda.\u201d\nThe sitters\u2019 message, on the other hand, was: \u201cDave Upthegrove promised to protect mature forests. We are here helping him keep his promise.\u201d\nUpthegrove\u2019s threats ignited phone calls and emails to his office, including from some who had worked for him because of his campaign pledges. Nonetheless on May 28, he doubled down on threats to the Forest Defenders, saying, \u201cWe intend to hold those responsible accountable.\u201d\nA statement on DNR\u2019s website says Upthegrove is reassessing the process on legacy forests, but that, \u201cSome paused sales could be reconfigured and brought forward to auction once the criteria to exclude structurally complex forests that are critical to carbon storage and habitat biodiversity are developed.\u201d Upthegrove also said he\u2019s committed to protect sales approved before he took office, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s important to defend policies and the authority of the agency.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what DNR will do after the six-month \u201cpause\u201d in legacy forest sales ends. In a letter to Clallam County Democrats, Upthegrove said he intended to bring forward a policy to protect 77,000 acres of older forests, a significant step if done, though less than the 106,000 acres of legacy forest currently unprotected. He claimed, without evidence, that the tree-sit had endangered DNR employees.\nAfter first ordering a two-week injunction against logging and compelling DNR to produce administrative records supporting its decision to approve the timber sales, a Clallam County Superior Court judge refused to extend the injunction past May 23. On June 6, she ruled against an LFDC filing which sought to prevent logging until both lawsuits could receive a full hearing on their merits. Hearings on the merits should be held in coming months.\nDunne told Truthout that she was disappointed in the judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cExisting policies aside, what we need today is action commensurate with the gravity of the extinction and biodiversity crisis: a clear directive creating an Ecological Forest Reserve and permanently protecting all remaining legacy forests on state lands for their intrinsic value and as essential to the survival of all species,\u201d she said.\nOn June 13, police of unknown affiliation swept the camp, seizing supplies and hindering the ability of the encampment to protect the tree-sitter\u2019s life. (A DNR spokesperson told Truthout he couldn\u2019t comment on the raid of the encampment or the vigilante attacks, only saying DNR had \u201ccleared the many makeshift barricades\u201d on the logging road.) Despite this, the community rallied in support, bringing new supplies and people to keep the sit protected.\nOver the next days, violent vigilantes attacked the tree-sit twice. They tampered with the cable and tripod anchoring the platform supporting the tree-sitter, causing it to dangerously dip. Vigilantes also drunkenly threatened to kill the Forest Defenders and threw bottles around. One pointed a gun at Forest Defenders, walking aggressively toward them and then shot into the forest. After this, the Defenders decided to safely evacuate the site before someone was hurt or killed.\nAt press time, the tree-sit and encampment are gone but the outcome with the threatened forests remains undetermined. Those protecting the forests remain committed to their aims and lawsuits on the merits of the logging remain to be heard.\n\u201cDave Upthegrove ran as a progressive, and that\u2019s kind of the first and main legislator we\u2019re pushing back against right now. I don\u2019t know that we would have done things any different if there weren\u2019t these sort of executive orders (like Trump\u2019s on timber sales) going into place, and this sort of over-escalation and fascism in our country \u2026 and is giving people hope that even under a really threatening administration, we can keep pushing back against it,\u201d Fable told Truthout.\nMedia that fights fascism\nTruthout is funded almost entirely by readers \u2014 that\u2019s why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative. But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political repression under Trump.\nWe rely on your support to survive McCarthyist censorship.

            "The fate of the Sycamore Gap tree has shed light on a deeper concern. The fate of the Sycamore Gap tree has shed light on a deeper concern\nJames Canton spent two years sitting beneath an 800-year-old oak tree near his home in Essex, watching acorns fatten and butterflies land on the massive knurled grey trunk. Sometimes he sat in the branches too.\nCanton, a lecturer at the University of Essex, recalls how it helped him feel a \"sense of connection\". \"We're happier sat in an oak tree ten foot from the ground, watching blue tits feeding on caterpillars \u2013 involved and immersed in that natural world.\" He went on to write a book called The Oak Papers about that time spent studying the Honywood Oak.\nFor years, it was easy to forget that we used to be a woodland nation: around 6,000 years ago untouched swathes of oak, hazel, birch and pine blanketed an estimated 75% of the UK.\nBut in recent months the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland has put our relationship with trees, and the natural world more widely, back under the spotlight.\nTwo men are due to be sentenced today for the crime that has been called a \"mindless destruction\". Canton calls it a \"symbolic\" moment.\nThe felling of the Sycamore Gap has prompted calls for stricter legal protections for trees, not only to help prevent similar crimes in future but also to help the public appreciate the value of trees at a time when many of our woodlands are in poor health and targets for tree-planting are not being met.\nBut even if the government were to back calls for greater legal protections, other questions remain - namely, which trees should be protected?\nAnd arguably even more pressingly: should Britain be thinking more broadly about how to save our depleting woodlands - and is legal protection enough or is a fundamental rethink required?\nUK's 'odd relationship' with trees\nThe Sycamore Gap wasn't a particularly ancient tree, nor a native species, but its position gave it a totemic status.\nTucked into a fold of the hills in an area of outstanding beauty, it was famous around the world. People went there to have picnics, propose marriage, scatter ashes and to seek solace during lockdown.\nLocal people spoke of their devastation at its loss, while Northumberland National Park Authority received thousands of emails, letters and messages.\nAnd yet despite apparently being a nation of tree lovers, the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth - it still isn\u2019t planting enough trees, despite calls by successive governments.\nThe UK has 13% woodland cover, compared to an average of 38% in Europe, according to Prof Mary Gagen of Swansea University.\nDespite woodland creation rates being much higher now than they were in the 2010s, they remain off track, according to statistics from Forest Research.\nThe target set by the previous Conservative government was to plant 30,000 hectares a year by 2025 across the UK, in line with the heyday of tree planting in the 1970s.\nStatistics show that 20,700 hectares of new woodland was created in the UK between April 2023 and March 2024, a big achievement. However, this fell to 15,700 hectares over the year to March 2025, largely as a result of a drop-off in planting in Scotland. (Rates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland went up \u2013 though from a low base.)\nAnd the woodlands that already exist aren't in great shape. Only 7% of it is in good ecological health, says Prof Gagen.\nShe is among those who think that this all nods to an \"odd relationship\" with trees \u2013 one of \"simultaneously adoring and denuding woodlands\".\nAndrew Allen of the Woodland Trust warns there could be a knock-on effect: \"While money goes into getting new trees in the ground, we continue to spend very little on looking after the trees we already have - and this risks serious consequences.\"\n'Why would a tree older than Stonehenge go unprotected?''\nAncient trees provide a home to hundreds of different bird, insect and mammal species, yet they have no automatic right of protection. This is unlike some other countries, including Italy and Poland, where so-called \"heritage\" trees have specific legal protections.\nSome UK trees are protected through being in a nature reserve or a site of special scientific interest, while Tree Preservation Orders can be made by a local planning authority to protect specific trees or woodland from deliberate damage or destruction.\nYet many fall through the gaps. Only a fifth of our \"oldest and most important veteran trees\" are in protected areas, says Prof Gagen. Veteran trees are trees that through their own decay act as a habitat for other species, promoting biodiversity.\nThe Tree Council charity has written a report calling for greater protections for the country's \"most important trees\", such as the one that stood at the Sycamore Gap.\nThe outpouring of emotion and anger after the felling shows how valued these \"socially, culturally and environmentally important trees are\", says Jess Allan, science and research projects manager at the charity.\nOn the back of a Heritage Trees Bill, introduced in December 2023 as a private members bill in the House of Lords, the charity is calling for legislation to create a statutory list of the most valuable trees and to impose stricter penalties for damaging them, mirroring the system for listed buildings.\nCrucially, this could protect trees that are much-loved and culturally important because of their place in the landscape, as well as protecting ancient trees that are vital in preserving nature.\nJon Stokes, the charity's director of trees, science and research, points out that in Portugal, the fine for destroying a notable tree can be as much as \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3433,000).\nHe says protecting our \"most celebrated trees\" is a no-brainer. \"There are yew trees in this country that are older than Stonehenge \u2013 nobody would ever contemplate not protecting Stonehenge so why would a living thing that's older than Stonehenge not receive some protection?\"\nHe hopes something positive could come out of the felling of the Sycamore Gap: it has made people realise that some of the UK's trees are \"truly vital to our culture and heritage and history \u2013 and our biodiversity - we should be looking after them better than we are at the moment\".\nThe Tree Council's report is currently being assessed by the government, but there is no date on when any decision will be made.\n'You can't stop reckless acts'\nThere are some who believe legal reforms are not enough.

            "My aging father moved in with my family 14 years ago. I've learned a lot about how I want to prepare for my own retirement.. Fourteen years ago my dad moved in with my family of four.\n-\nHe has remained mostly independent, though he no longer drives and relies on me for getting around.\n-\nHelping care for my dad has helped me plan for my own future retirement.\n-\nIn 2011 my dad moved in with my family of four. Now, 14 years later at 82, he's still here and thriving.\nNo one prepares you for what it really is like to be part of the sandwich generation. Raising kids and taking care of a parent at the same time isn't for the faint of heart.\nI always knew my dad would end up living with me even if he didn't think life would play out that way, so I planned for it. The big challenge was when the time came he was moving from another state to a place he had no friends or familiarity with the local area. We were his life-line. And we're lucky it worked out.\nThe early days were easy\nAt 68, my father's longtime partner died. He didn't have a substantial amount of money saved up for his retirement, so he moved in with me, my spouse, and our two young kids.\nFor the first few years, my dad was able to drive himself to his activities and to the grocery store. He mostly did his own thing. We would have dinners together and our friends and neighbors became his, too. Everyone loves Grampy, as he is lovingly addressed. With most of our family members scattered across the country, it was great to have a grandparent with us to watch our kids grow up.\nWe were also fortunate enough to have an in-law unit in our home, so we all had our own space. That's an important piece of making living together work. Space.\nWe've had a few health things happen along the way, including a skin cancer scare, which we resolved. But we couldn't fix the macular degeneration affecting his eyesight, which caused him to stop driving and give up the car keys at 77.\nThat's when things changed and my role shifted\nThe hardest part has been managing my dad's pride and loss of independence. I've learned that even while your body may be aging, your mind still thinks you're younger than you are. And I would agree, at 53, I definitely feel much younger most days. Not being able to do what you want to do or drive where you want to go when you want to is a huge change. Relying on others is definitely a hit to one's ego.\nAs his eyesight worsened, I began managing his medicines, driving him to activities and doctors appointments, as well as helping with grocery runs. My role is not as a parent, nor as a traditional care-giver, but to me, it feels like it is more than a daughter.\nI now have a different idea of what I want my retirement to look like\nFortunately, my dad is healthy and can handle all of the daily activities of living, except for driving. Over the last 14 years, I've learned a lot about how I want to age and move into my eventual retirement. With two college-aged children, I still have time to plan for what the future holds and want to be around for a long time.\nWhile the monetary part of retirement is important, what's even more critical is being of sound mind and body for as long as possible, which means I'm focusing on taking care of myself now.\nMultigenerational living has taught me about health, love, resilience, and what it really means to feel secure with each year that passes. We've given that security to my dad and I am grateful for the time, the stories, the laughs, the ups, and the downs. I wouldn't trade the time for the world. After all, that's what life is about. Family. We all live. We all age. And I'm going to take all my knowledge into the next few decades to do so gracefully.",
            "I moved to a big city at 51 to be closer to my 2 sons. I almost instantly regretted it and left a year later.. I missed being a part of my sons' daily lives, so when they were 23 and 24, I moved to be nearby.\n-\nStarting over at 51 in a big city was difficult, and I became more needy than I was back home.\n-\nI wasn't myself, and it wasn't working out for anyone. I moved back after one year.\n-\nIt hit me on the seven-hour drive. The punch to the gut, the weight of the wrongness of it all.\nI was on my way to a new apartment in a new city to be closer to two of my four sons, where I'd be just a 10-minute drive away from both.\nThe new place had everything I thought I wanted: a dishwasher, garbage chute, high ceilings, fast wifi, a little balcony and dining nook, and an app where I could press a button and summon a person if the washer or dryer broke.\nI wasn't moving for the apartment, though. The lease in my hometown was coming to an end, so the time felt right for a move. However, the only reason I chose to leave my small town of 20,000 for Ottawa, Ontario, with 1 million people, was to be closer to my sons, who were 23 and 24 at the time.\nMy kids have always been my choice over dating, a career, and a marriage that left our little family hobbled but closer in the end. Why would they not be my choice now? My friends back home were fine, I told myself, but they weren't my sons, whom I raised to be my best friends.\nI also thought they might need me since they were still at a young enough age where having a mom close by could help.\nReally, though, I just wanted to be the kind of mom who could have a pot roast dinner with them on a Sunday and be part of their daily lives. I missed being part of their daily lives.\nThe move was scary but I told myself it was right, even though it felt off\nI told myself this move was the smart thing to do, the right thing. Scary? Sure.\nTrying to make a new life at 51 \u2014 when you're too old to make the young parent friends, but too young to make retirement-age friends \u2014 is intimidating. I knew in my bones that it wouldn't work, but I tried anyway.\nI went to swing dancing classes in a church basement on Friday nights. I joined a gym, a women's dinner club, a regular yoga class. I played pickleball in the park. I taught writing classes at the local university. I shopped, and shopped, and shopped, an old thumb-sucker habit of mine when I'm feeling stuck.\nI spoke to people all the time, and I listened to their stories, but I felt like none of us were ever having a conversation. We just volleyed questions back and forth.\nIt was the same with my two sons, who were grown men now. They made time for me and helped around the house, like hanging pictures and putting my bed together. However, then they'd go back to their own homes to their own lives, and I would be alone again.\nSometimes, I'd drop by unexpectedly for a visit, for a chat, for company, because I wasn't finding my own life here. I knew, though, that I was just adding myself onto their lives, not integrating seamlessly.\nI wasn't myself here \u2014 I knew that, and so did they. Back home, I was the mom who had friends, went for hikes, and knew everyone at the farmer's market. I felt like this new mom was too needy for us all, especially me.\nI moved back to my little town after 1 year in the big city\nWe all agreed that I had tried my best, but it just wasn't the right fit.\nThis time, driving back in my Nissan Versa, everything felt exactly right.\nLater, we planned a trip for that summer. We got the entire family together for a week at the beach, where everything felt natural and balanced.\nWe could all just be adults together, swimming and eating, and playing cards. I felt glad for our time together, grateful for who we've become.",
            "People Assumed Everyone Did These 93 Things Because It\u2019s How It Worked In Their Family. People Assumed Everyone Did These 93 Things Because It\u2019s How It Worked In Their Family\nEvery family has its own traditions, routines, and little quirks that emerge out of their unique personalities and circumstances. A particular way of doing things can become second nature and feel totally normal when you\u2019re just growing up and haven\u2019t had the chance to see an alternative. But sooner or later, you go to your friend\u2019s house and learn that tapas aren't a plate of leftovers from the meals you've had that week.\nSo, Reddit user Kaiablu decided to ask everyone on the platform to share their special household habits \u2014 the ones they thought were universal until they compared notes with the rest of the world. The responses ranged from charmingly practical to hilariously strange, proving that no two homes are exactly alike.\nThis post may include affiliate links.\nMy older brother rigged up a pulley/counterweight system and lower handle to the sliding screen back door (so that the dog could open it and let herself out/in and it would automatically close behind her).\nIt was so well-done that I honestly thought he had bought an add-on/kit (like *made for that door*). But I later realized no one else had one at their house.\nTurns out bro just made it out of s**t we already had in ~~Dad's shop~~ the *junk drawer*.\nMy dad would mute the ads and that was our chance to ask him things.\nMy mom wrote the date on the lids of things she opened (tomato sauce, etc) so she would know when it had to get tossed. I do it, too.\nUsing half of the pistachio shell to open other pistachio nuts.\nPutting a cut raw potato in soup or sauce that is too salty. It pulls the salt into the potato without ruining the food. My wife looked at me like I was an alien.\nMy mum used to add small pieces of dough. Those chunks also turn tasty\nWe'd have \"tapas\" night every Friday.\nThe tapas were all the leftovers that had accumalated during the week. .\nIn the winter, my dad would tie plastic sandwich bags over our feet before we put our boots on. This kept our feet dry when we inevitably got snow jammed down our boots while playing.\nI recounted this to my husband once, and he was very confused. Apparently, it was just a thing my dad did. It was smart, though! We never had freezing wet feet. I plan to do the same with my kid.\nCorn on the cob butter.\nGrowing up, we had a separate butter dish (usually just a small plate) that we used to butter corn by playing the cob directly on the stick of butter and spin it slowly. This is the best way to get complete and even butter coverage. I thought this was a normal thing until my husband was gobsmacked the first he saw us do it. He has since accepted the genius of our approach and we have taught our kids too (though we have had to tell not to do it at their friends\u2019 houses).\nThat's how everyone did it I thought everyone I know did does it that way\nWe used a pizza cutter to cut pancakes.\nFolding empty disposable plastic grocery bags in a particular way. Did so automatically when at a friend's house for the first time before handing one to her and she was floored. Demanded I teach her, and we then spent 10 minutes folding all her saved plastic bags. I was glad to be able to pass on a (semi?)useful skill for reducing the space they took up.\nTwice a month we would get to go to a fast food restaurant for dinner or my mom would get take away. Any time it was McDonald\u2019s she would get the 69\u00a2 hamburgers and make us put cheese on them at home bc she was NOT going to spend an extra 10\u00a2 for a slice of cheese lol.\nGrowing up lower income we would place a 5 gallon bucket in the shower to catch the water until it began to warm up then you take your shower over the bucket. You shut the water off while you soap up and then turn it back on to rinse. We then use the water from the bucket to pour in the toilet instead of flushing the toilet. When friends come over they'd ask, what's up with the bucket and I'm like doesn't everyone use a bucket ?\nAlso Ziploc bags are not single use, you clean and reuse them just like plastic dishes. Plastic grocery bags are reused as trash can liners, why do they even sell trash can liners ? (per dad).\nMy family would eat corn straight out of the can. Just dump out the water and straight on to a plate. It wasn\u2019t until I got to college and my roommates asked if I was a hobo that I realized it wasn\u2019t normal.\nUsing a fishing rod and reel to fly a kite.\nFor pancakes, I get the stack and butter them. Then cut a + in the middle. Then let syrup seep into the + and saturate through the cake stack in the middle.\nI got tired of pouring over the top and having dry pancakes except the top one.\nPoop Journal. Growing up, there was a spiral notebook on top of the toilet lid called The Poop Journal. If you went in the bathroom for any reason you could write in the journal, then put the notebook back for the next person to read. No telling what you'd find written in there or from whom. Everyone in the family, friends coming over to play, even our parents, wrote in it. It might be a joke, a silly comment, even asking what's for dinner?\nAs kids, it was funny. But now, 30 years and 8 notebooks later, they're hysterical.\n.\nWe use a cutter knife and cut a lotion or sunscreen plastic bottle in half to get every bit out. It\u2019s expensive & there\u2019s a lot left in there\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude09.\nMy mum did this absolutely wild thing where she would put washed wool clothes under the rugs in the house (sandwiched by pieces of newspaper so they would stay clean), and the weight of the rug and people constantly walking over the rug would press them flat. Basically it was like \u201cironing\u201d knitwear. Every time you walked over the rug you could feel something under it. She acted like this was completely normal behaviour but when I google it nothing even comes up about it and I\u2019ve never heard of anyone else doing this!\nThis may be common for some families but when I mentioned it to friends in highschool they were all surprised.\nMy grandmother sent each grand kid a card for every holiday and in the minor holidays she\u2019d always have a $10 to $20 bill in it. I remember mentioning I\u2019d gotten my Valentine\u2019s Day money from my gram and my friends were all confused, I guess their grandparents only gifts on Christmas and birthdays.\nOnce we got older and she had great grandkids she started sending them cards for all the holidays. My cousin lived in my grams basement apartment and my grandmother still sent the card in the mail so her great grandson could be excited he got some mail.\nMy grandmother was the absolute best and I miss her every day \u2764\ufe0f.\nAsian millennial here, Growing up made to believe dishwasher is just a drying rack & storage for hand washed dishes/ kitchenwares.\nSock basket. all socks from any load of laundry went into a basket on the bottom shelf of the hall linen closet. when you got dressed, you tried your best to find the matchingest pair.\nWhen ice cream used to come in the cardboard rectangle, my granny would slice it like cake, and peel the cardboard off of it after putting it on the serving plate. She would put saran wrap with a rubber band on the unused block.\nI was always confused watching my friends painfully scooping it out.\nWhenever I have something I NEED to take with me to work or wherever I\u2019m planning to go, I put it in a plastic grocery bag and hang it from the doorknob so I will have to physically touch it to leave the house. It\u2019s still possible to forget, but I forget less often this way than simply setting it on the counter.\nOkay. So my wife and I are Burmese born in Burma but our son is born here in Australia. In SE Asia they usually have those bidet sprayers next to toilets and my wife really wanted one. At the time, it hasn\u2019t caught on yet in Australia and plumbers are very reluctant to install them even if you bought one from Asia. So I went to Bunnings one day, bought a new 5L weed sprayer with a hand pump, cut the nozzle short and just started using that instead. My son just \u2026 grew up with that.\nWhen he started kinder, my poor boy was just so confused.\nWhen I was a child, my parents always kept the boxes of crackers on top of the water heater tank in a quest to keep them fresher. The constant mild heat drove down the humidity. We always had crispy saltines.\nTL;DR: My parents took 40% of my paycheck as \u201chome tax\u201d while I lived with them, secretly invested it, and later gave it all back with profits to teach me how to save.\nI don\u2019t know if this counts as a \u201chousehold hack,\u201d but my parents charged me and my siblings a 40% \u201chome tax\u201d on every paycheck we earned while living at home.\nI started gardening at 13 years old (through a summer municipal program), and they explained to me the cost of living, etc. They said this was just something they did to get by.\nI moved out for three years and then moved back in to save up for my own place. The same rules still applied, but now the 40% was quite a significant amount.\nWhen I made a bid for my apartment, my parents came to me with a piece of paper from the bank showing a pretty substantial amount of money, probably around two to three years\u2019 worth of salary, and told me it was mine.\nThey had never spent any of the money I paid them; instead, they invested my \u201chome tax\u201d into funds that had done quite well.\nThey basically taught me how to save by \u201ctaxing\u201d me. They did the same for each of my siblings, but made the older ones swear not to tell the younger ones because they believed it would ruin the learning opportunity.\nWhatever savings i have is because of similar stuff my dad did. Whenever savings reached a particular amount, he would invest them in something else and get good returns. Those profits would be saved till it reaches a particular amount again to be invested. The cycle is still happening\nThis is kind of a dated one. We had a record player with a lid that was fully detached (not on hinges). To solve the problem of then having to set this big lid down somewhere while playing records, my parents rigged up a brass pulley hanging from the ceiling, with a counterweight on the cord and a little bent tube that provided just enough friction so that you could lift the lid and would remain hanging wherever you left it. It\u2019s rather ingenious in a Wallace and Gromit kind of way, but I thought this was just standard record player installation. I only found out differently when we studied simple machines in third grade and I had a homework assignment to draw simple machines I found around the house. I drew this thing for \u201cpulley\u201d and completely baffled my teacher!\nEdit: Here's a picture I drew of it. Edit to the edit: this is a new drawing, not my decades-old homework, which is long gone. .\nMy mom is a Type-1 diabetic, so we always had alcohol pads around the house. Besides using them for their intended use, she\u2019d also use them for cleaning something sticky or for getting permanent marker off of things. I naturally did the same thing. My freshman year roommate was also a diabetic, so she did the same thing. It wasn\u2019t until I lived with a non diabetic for the first time that I realized not everyone had a box of alcohol pads at their home that they used for random spot cleaning. I still keep a box at home!\nMy dad used the oven light as a night light \ud83d\udca1.\nMy mother would cook ground beef in a pan, pour out the grease into an old margarine tub, and then put the ground beef in a conical sieve and we'd mash it with a wooden tool to squeeze every drop of grease out. Finally, she'd run it under tap water\nI always wondered why it tasted better everywhere else until I cooked for myself.\nNot sure if it counts as a hack but washing out soap/shampoo bottles.\nTurns out most people just toss them when they start spurting rather than dispensing soap, we would add a little water and shake it up to get a bit more out.\nWhen I was a kid I used to be constipated a lot. My dad got tired of always unclogging the toilet with a plunger. He told me to stop flushing whenever I would finally poop.\nSo whenever I would finally poop, he would fetch a garbage bag and fish it out like you would pick up dog poop. I thought it was the most normal thing.\nMy mom always cut bacon packages in half and then put them in sandwich bags in the freezer. the night before she\u2019d toss one in the fridge to thaw and then we would eat the half package and it was always enough bacon for the family.\nWhen I was in grad school, I did the same thing and my roommate looked at me like I was insane. I didn\u2019t realize the half pieces of bacon were unusual.\nAfter my sister graduated and my Dad moved out, my Mom created a very thoughtful system that worked well for us. We both really liked certain foods, and we never withheld food from one another, but let\u2019s say my favorite pizza only had one piece left. I\u2019d put it in a plastic bag or Tupperware and then put a rubber band around it. That was our silent signal to one another that we were saving it for lunch the next day, etc. My Mom and I are incredibly close and that might sound kind of odd, but it was a good way to respect one another and to make sure we had some of our favorites left when we got home. My friends would come over sometimes and wonder why there was a rubber band on a certain can of pop, and only then would I realize that not every family did this. \ud83d\ude02.\nUse a turkey baster to remove grease from a pan when cooking ground beef. My mom did it growing up so I thought it was normal. My wife thought it was witchcraft the first time she saw me do it. She immediately called her mom and sister to tell them to do it.\nChopsticks for everything as when you become good at them they are finger extensions. Awesome for turning bacon!\nMy mom stores boxes of cereal in the oven to keep them from going stale.\nI've never met anyone else that does this.\nFood we throw out gets put in a bag and frozen until garbage day.\nI thought it was normal to make grilled cheese in the oven (broil, makes 6 sandwiches at once). I've since learned that everyone else I know cooks single sandwiches on the stove.\nOur family method makes the nicest, most evenly toasted light brown buttery deliciousness. Stove-sandwiches are dry and blah.\nPlacing something in a very inconvenient or weird place to remind you to do something important.\nI've legit found my mom's keys in the fridge and learned to just leave them there. They're there to remind her to grab something important, probably her lunch, before she goes to work (and I'll make sure to text her to let her know I saw them in there, just in case she did it by accident).\nWhy is there a ladder by the door? A random fork on the kitchen countertop? A bottle of medicine balanced precariously on the alarm panel? No f*****g clue, but it's there for a reason and I need to leave it there.\nI read something similar in The diary of a Wimpy kid.\nWhen one of us is sick/has a sore throat, we always make sure to have Jell-O on hand. But instead of putting the liquid Jell-O in the fridge to set, we drink it hot from a mug. It\u2019s sooooo soothing on a scratchy throat, and it made being sick a little less terrible.\nBonus: my sister-in-law taught us that eating a spoonful of peanut butter is an instant hiccup cure!\nTie the hairbrush to the bathroom faucet so one of the 5 daughters didn't wander off with it and leave the other 4 with a rat's nest 3 minutes before time to leave for school. .\nThrow a spaghetti noodle on the wall to test its doneness.\nWhen my girls were little, they thought it was hysterically funny and always wanted to be the one who got to throw the noodle. Then it turned into a tradition that when we moved into a new house, the first home-cooked meal we made was spaghetti, and we left the noodle on the wall.\nNow that they\u2019re grown and gone and I live in a home they\u2019ve never lived in, there\u2019s still a noodle on the wall, with less giggles but plenty of fond memories. My kids do it in their homes now, too. One of them was cooking spaghetti at her MIL\u2019s house and threw the noodle on the wall, and her MIL thought she\u2019d lost her mind.\nI have a 4inch semi-rigid dryer hose tube that I tied to the banister going to my basement. At the bottom of the stairs is a garbage can with a plastic bag for recyclable cans/bottles.\nInstead of having to go downstairs everytime I have an empty can/bottle, I just send them down the chute.\nhere's a video of it\nWe would go to buffets right at the end of breakfast , just before they switched it to lunch and got a little of both for breakfast pricing.\nBut isn't there a good gap between both the services? Hotels i have been to ,the breakfast ends at 10.30 and lunch doesn't start before 12.30.\nI saw on Reddit a guy all pissed off because his wife would sprinkle baking soda on the carpet before she vacuumed. I thought the idea was pretty smart to remove odors.\nMy parents would always dilute the soda we had. They\u2019d open up a 12oz can, pour an equal amount into five cups, and then add tap water to fill the cups the rest of the way up. Thought this was the norm until I tried a full strength can and it was too sweet and fizzy.\nEdit. I think they were being super frugal. They\u2019d also cut a tall stack of paper napkins in half while sitting in front of the TV to make them last longer.\nHanger underwear. Essentially you keep one pair of underwear on a hanger in your closet and when you get behind on laundry and run out of underwear, you have that lifeline and know you absolutely have to do laundry.\nMy dad had a wrench to open our door handle to the car. We also had to crawl through one door to unlock the other. Another car had a hole that led right to the ground, we would throw things through the hole as we drove, like cheerios or gold fish. It was the size of a baseball. As an adult I realize how dangerous that was. .\nThe old Volkswagen Bug cars had the battery under the back seat. I bought as really old one and later discovered that acid from the battery had eaten a hole through the steel pan under the car body. Someone had slipped an old license plate under the battery to keep it from falling out through the hole it had eaten through the floor !!\nMaybe not a hack but we used empty TP rolls as cord holders. Still do it to this day as do my kids. First time I traveled with my high school team and took out my curling iron everyone was all \"what is that?\" They half mocked and were half amazed. This happened every time I would travel with someone. I do wonder if any of those people implemented the idea.\nColour coded dishes for us kids.\nThen we for sure knew who left their cereal bowl under the couch!! .\nThis is from when I was a kid, but communal socks on the dining room table. My parents divorced when I was young and it was just me, my brother, and my dad for a few years. We all shared the same white athletic socks, and we never kept them in our rooms. We never ate in the formal dining room and it was always just covered in socks. We\u2019d each just take a pair each morning off the table. They were in a big mound.\nIt was just socks, no idea why. All our other clothes would be in our rooms. We had a LOT of socks for some reason, way more than we needed. They covered the table.\nThis went on until my dad met his next wife. She put a stop to it.\nDamp paper towels on leftover salads to keep them them crisp for days. My husband thought my family was nuts but now considers it genius.\nWe used empty butter tubs as Tupperware. I learned the hard way when I tried to make toast with leftover spaghetti sauce.\nNot paying for city trash service and taking it to a business park dumpster every week\u2026 I thought everyone\u2019s \u201ctrash day\u201d was this whole errand\nI was a very sheltered kid and thought my parents were saving mad money. Wasn\u2019t until I moved out and found out how much it actually costs lol they were just cheap and kinda gross.\nMy paternal grandparents have war-crimes levels of weird food preferences. Like, whole pearl onions in spaghetti sauce weird. Or cracking eggs into a can of creamed corn, shaking it, and baking it weird. American cheese, chunky sala, on rye, sandwiches for dinner weird.\nWe all knew they were weird, and my father was insanely happy the first time my mom cooked for him. It was more than half the reason he married her.\nAnyway, we put ketchup on tacos. Guess where that came from?\nThe first time I applied ketchup to a taco in front of someone, they reacted like that \"little kid shielding an even-little-er kid from a rabbit\" meme.\nAnyway, my kids put \"pink sauce\" on their tacos. It's a combination of sour cream and ketchup.\nThe generational trauma continues.\nMy mother would cut the sugar in our cereal. For example she would get 2 big boxes of Cheerios (one honeynut, one plain). She would open both and pour out of each one into a separate bowl half of each box, Then she would refill them with the other cereal (honeynut got the plain half and vice versa) then clip the bag and fold the tops and shake em up.\nI did not know how SWEET full-strength Honeynut Cheerios were until university and I complained that the cereal was too sweet at the dining hall and she explained. Makes sense now but wow I'm still a bit stunned by her ingenuity.\nMy family all shared towels until I loudly mentioned I didn't like the idea of drying my face on the same towel someone else dried their a*s. Suddenly, we were assigned towels.\nPutting the duvet cover on by turning it inside out, sticking your hands in and grabbing the corners of the duvet, then giving it a shake so it turns right side out with the duvet inside...\nI never understood why people said they couldn't put the cover on without help...\nPatting the grease off of pizza so it was less calories. When I was like, 12. Lol\nETA: I think if you do this for your kids without them knowing, it's fine. There's nuance of course. My experience was being actively encouraged by my mom to do it so I wouldn't gain weight. I didn't realize this is something parents may do before giving their kids pizza because I was always doing it myself alongside my mom to stay thin.\nWhen doing dishes I put a couple drops of soap in a bowl of hot water and dip my sponge in that to have a sudsy sponge through the entire load of dishes.\nMy grandfather had a workshop in his garage that was like a Rube-Goldberg machine that was actually useful. Need a shop-vac? There was a rope you could pull and the shop vac would drop out of the A-frame roof on a pulley. There were cabinet doors that opened from the top rather than to the left or right with pop-out rods that had all the different tapes he had stacked on them or a pop out wire frame trash bag holder that you folded the top of the bag over and had just the right tension to keep it in place and open until you wanted to change it out and it just lifted off when you pushed on the spring load for the wire to release the tension. There was also a huge overhead bell shaped industrial gas burning heater that he took from his company when it shut down that just tucked into the space between the rafters that could heat the whole garage to T-shirt temperature even in sub-zero weather. The guy had everything rigged up to be able to have what he wanted in front of him with the slightest effort. When I was little I thought every mechanic/engineer built their workshops this way, but he was just a mechanical genius that had an idea to make everything easier. Everyone joked that when we eventually had to sell the house that the dad moving in would cry tears of joy when he discovered the workshop.\nAfter reading the newspaper, my dad would put the ads in recycling but fold the A, B, C, and D editorial sections in order the same way it was delivered. My parents had a really nice wicker basket to keep the old newspapers in until recycling day. His dad also did the same thing, and had a really nice metal container that they were kept in. I think it showed how much they valued information, that they need it right there in case they needed to refer back to something.\nSame grandfather, one time I looked in that newspaper container on a visit, and saw that two or three days prior, my grandpa and his friends had been on the front page of the paper. They did a full-page profile of these old guys who used to go down to the Delaware River and watch the boats every morning, his photo was above the fold and everything. I pointed it out to him and asked why he hadn't mentioned it, and his response was \"Well ya know I go down to the river, I didn't think it was news.\".\nOn our annual 1-week family vacation, we\u2019d pack old clothes, underwear, and socks and discard them each day. We would come home to new socks, underwear, and \u201cback-to-school\u201d clothes that my mom bought.\nCupcake sandwich - remove the bottom of the cupcake and put it on the top. protects you from getting frosting all over your face and makes it easier to bite. my in laws all do this now.\nWe have a house window fan. We didn't have central air until I was maybe 12. We had a 28 inch fan that you put on exhaust and then anywhere in the house you open a window, you'll get a breeze. Everyone in my family does it, but I've never met anyone outside my family that does it and the fans are from like 1975 and I inherited my aunt's when she moved into a senior living apartment. It's nice in the spring and fall.\nWe make our tea for sweet tea in the coffee maker. Just put the tea bags in the part that you would put the coffee grounds in and you don't need a filter either.\nI use Windex to k**l flies. It works great!\nPutting bread in the fridge. I thought it was normal\u2026 turns out it just makes you the weirdo with cold sandwiches.\nWhen the chip bag is 30-50% full, chop off the top for easier access. Then reclip with chip clip.\nI had a lot of siblings and my mom would bring us to the library after school for a few hours to do homework, read, play under their big oak tree outside. I even learned how to crochet at the library from a sweet older librarian. I would check out books on knitting and crocheting too. Anyway, I thought it was pretty normal. I asked my mom about it recently and she said that we only had 1 car and my dad worked within walking distance from the library, but didn't always get off work at the same time - so the library would give us a safe, air conditioned, clean, enriching place to wait until he was done. I think back and I remember we'd always pick Dad up on the way home from the library (or sometimes he'd show up there and surprise us). What a great set of parents we had.\nWe eat cereal out of plastic cups. My mom started giving it that way when we were kids and we still do it 40 years later. It\u2019s just more portable than a bowl.\nIn the morning we would take off our PJs and put them under the pillow, wear them again the next night. Idk how often they got changed but it was at least once a week.\nMaking spaghetti bolognaise just using tomato sauce (ketchup). Using pegs for multiple pieces of clothing on the line, for eg. 4 pair of undies pegged together and T-shirt ends pegged together in a line etc.\nOnce I left home it was examples like these that had me realising we didn\u2019t have money like other families did!\nNow I have enough pegs (so many pegs!) for every piece of clothing and it makes me feel rich \ud83d\ude02\nOh and I learned what real spag bol tastes like!\nEdit: when I say tomato sauce I mean what us Aussies put on our meat pie, hot chips etc. The condiment similar to what Americans have called ketchup.\nOur birthday card from our parents had a dollar for every year of our birthday. Turn 18, $18 in the card, etc. I\u2019d use my money to buy a memory something. Two years ago, I saw a cool jewelry piece that told my husband I was using birthday money to buy, then it hit me, with mu Dad dying a few months earlier, my parents were both gone, so no birthday card and no dollar per year. Got to admit, birthdays haven\u2019t been the same.\nMy mom would make sure I a quarter in my shoe incase I got lost and needed to call her.. back when there were pay phones and no cells.\nMy Momma got us in the habit of each of us cleaning a room every time we left the house. Now every morning when I leave for work, I pick a thing to clean or organize.\nWhen I wasn\u2019t working 60+ hours a week, my apartment was operating-room clean, and impressed a lot of dates. But I\u2019m old, fat, and tired now, so it looks more lived in, but still clean.\nEat tomatoes. Whole. Like an apple. No salt and pepper or anything.\nThe first time my dad packed one for my lunch in middle school, I immediately ended up with the nickname \"Tomato\" (in an affectionate way. I was bullied for other reasons).\nIronically, I can't eat tomatoes or anything made from tomatoes thanks to GERD.\nWe used to have our kids set out half of their Halloween candy for the Great Pumpkin after they finished trick-or-treating. The Great Pumpkin would leave a gift for each of them (typically a toy they really wanted) as thanks. We wanted to do it to cut down on the amount of c**p they were eating. Worked great until they reached school-age and their friends started asking wtf a Great Pumpkin was.\nWe use liquid laundry detergent. When washing a load, I always used to fill the cap container, pour in the detergent, then return the still-wet-and-dripping cap to the bottle. It would always be a mess. My daughter taught me to simply drop the cap in with the wash. It comes out clean with the laundry and no mess. It makes so much sense. I\u2019m 54 years old. Why didn\u2019t I ever think of that?\nMy dad is just weird. He puts soda cans in the freezer to get them cold faster then gets upset when they explode. He's been doing this for years.\nBless the food that goes into the microwave. I get weird looks from coworkers when I get my hands wet and give the old pizza a little sprinkle of water before it goes in the microwave.\nKeeping bread in the microwave instead of a breadbox. I thought everyone did it\u2026 until I went to a friend\u2019s house and saw an actual breadbox for the first time.\ud83d\ude05.\nI keep unopened cans of tuna in the refrigerator, so it is already cold when you mix up tuna salad.\nIn the winter, my parents insisted on heating the kitchen by turning on the oven and leaving the oven door open.\nI don\u2019t think many people do this but it works - Pour boiling water over cloves of garlic before peeling them, the skin then comes off very easily.\nNot putting leftovers in the fridge. Just cover them up with a clear Cloche and walk away. If they ended up in the fridge they never got eaten, under the Cloche 9/10 someone would have a midnight snack.\nWashing dishes while you cook. Everyone I know just sits around doing nothing between cooking steps.\nWe use a handheld mixer to mash potatoes.\nImmediately stopping a nosebleed by wadding up a piece of paper and sticking it under your upper lip.\nGrowing up we had the laundry hamper on the second floor and the washing machine in the basement. Instead of having a laundry basket my dad would make us take a dirty shower towel out of the handler, lay it down on the floor and basically make a hobo bindle and put all the other dirty clothes in the middle to transport them down to the basement washing machine.\nMy parents explicitly taught me to enter cooking times on the microwave with double numbers. i.e. if something needed to be microwaved for 30 seconds push 33 instead. 1.5 mins? Push 99. The explanation was that this conserves a lot of energy and also saves you time by not having to move your finger to an entirely different button.\nWhen I got to college and saw my friends pushing 45 instead of 44 I was appalled.\nI thought there was a deep reason for my mom putting chicken bones in the freezer - turns out it was only to keep the cat out of the garbage.\nSame for putting towels on top of sweaters on the drying rack. I thought you had to do it that way, but it was just to keep the cat off of the clothes."

            "Trump\u2019s Motives Can Be Opaque. I Asked a Feminist Economist to Bare Them.. In the months since his return to the presidency, Donald Trump has implemented an aggressive and utterly reactionary social and economic agenda that seeks to turn back the clock of the nation\u2019s progress on civil and human rights while further entrenching the power of plutocracy. Understanding what drives Trump\u2019s actions is not an easy task. His approach to power stems from his greedy self-centeredness and self-serving purposes, but his actions also reveal a leader who has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions and the rule of law, one whose own political support stems from anti-immigrant hatred, racism, and sexism. In that sense, Trump\u2019s actions and policies represent a specific ideological orientation that works hand-in-hand with the implementation of his economic agenda.\nIn this exclusive interview for Truthout, renowned feminist and socialist economist Nancy Folbre offers a unique and insightful way of looking at who benefits from Trump\u2019s actions, and explaining why those actions are being pursued in the manner that they are. Folbre is professor emerita of economics and director of the Program on Gender and Care Work at the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She is the author of several books, including, most recently The Rise and Decline of Patriarchal Systems: An Intersectional Political Economy.\nC.J. Polychroniou: The first few months of the Trump administration have brought dramatic changes to government and society through the launching of the most systemic and aggressive assault on federal protections and civil rights, and the pursuit of an economic agenda that is thoroughly anti-environment and specifically designed to widen the gap between rich and poor in the United States. With this in mind, it has often been said that Trump does not have an ideology, yet his actions seem to suggest otherwise. So let\u2019s start by discussing Trump and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). What\u2019s behind the war on DEI programs?\nGet our free emails\nNancy Folbre: Underlying motives are never perfectly clear, even to those acting on them. Like most economists trying to explain behavior, I tend to first ask, \u201cwho benefits?\u201d and it\u2019s certainly clear that Trump\u2019s recent policies delivered Big Beautiful Benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, which include him and his family.\nHowever, many of Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 especially those related to his current tariff war \u2014 do not seem driven by capitalist interests in the traditional sense. They protect existing wealth and offer speculative opportunities in cybercurrencies but don\u2019t promote the profitable investments that drive capital accumulation.\nMost people on both the left and the right cling to pretty simplistic class analysis \u2014 as in, here are the rich, here are the poor, and here are the people in between. In fact, many other forms of social division come into play, based not only on race, gender, and citizenship, but also on the types of wealth that people do or do not own.\nTrump is basically a landlord with a particular fondness for land suited to golf, and a profound understanding of the human preoccupation with relative status exemplified by country clubs. Status can often be obtained simply through methods of exclusion that separate the \u201cin-group\u201d from the \u201cout-group.\u201d Status can often be conveyed by extreme self-confidence and willingness to bully others.\nTrump obviously derives enormous personal satisfaction from presenting himself as the Biggest and Best Boss of All Time. This satisfaction depends heavily on the unusual political coalition he has created by directing voters\u2019 attentions to possible gains derived by bullying those below them rather than challenging those above them. He has persuaded many white U.S.-born men (his most loyal constituency) that they can blame affirmative action and DEI for their economic woes.\nSince I remain entirely unpersuaded of this point, I must explain why it has gained so much political traction. I believe a major factor is resentment of the economic and cultural privileges conferred by the type of wealth that economists refer to as \u201chuman capital,\u201d the educational credentials that afford access to higher-paying jobs.\nAs Erik Olin Wright observed long ago, the \u201cprofessional/managerial class\u201d occupies a distinctive niche between those who own considerable financial wealth and no wealth at all. Members of this class (which includes college professors like myself) are not generally rich, but we exercise considerable authority based on a combination of expertise and bureaucratic position, often sanctioned by the state.\nThe Republican Party has always been strongly influenced by the interests of financial capital, and the Democratic party by the interests of human capital (sometimes described as \u201copportunity hoarding\u201d).\nIn recent years, college-educated workers have fared much better economically than other workers and have also claimed more cultural respect. Indeed, the observation that someone failed to complete a college degree became a kind of justification for their economic insecurity.\nThe Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategies identified with the Democratic party didn\u2019t seriously threaten white men\u2019s access to the professional/managerial class. However, they did heighten this group\u2019s anxieties about the rocky path to upward mobility for anyone born to a family with little financial wealth.\nWhat about Trump\u2019s ruthless immigration crackdown? Aren\u2019t those actions of his administration fueled purely by racism with the intent to promote white nationhood?\nAnti-immigrant racism is the proximate cause, but more important, in my opinion, is Trump\u2019s recognition that these false flags help divide and conquer his political opposition. Whether or not he loves white nationhood, he grabs it as a sales pitch. Among many voters, the fear of losing even small privileges may outweigh the hope of much bigger gains from a different form of solidarity. An even bigger factor was probably the sense of lost control, exacerbated by the enormous complexity of policies regarding refugee status, and a judicial system bogged down in delays.\nThe Democratic Party seems better at defending principles than accomplishing change. Tragically, this weakened the principles themselves, opening the door to the horrific abuses we see Immigration and Customs Enforcement committing today. The good news is that public opinion is now shifting.\nWould you say that Trump\u2019s ideology and policies also help to reinforce the power of patriarchy?\nI would go further. Patriarchal backlash is a primordial source of energy behind Trump\u2019s political coalition. Trump both celebrates and invokes masculine power as the path to success. He\u2019s a bully who loves other bullies. He only admires women who dedicate themselves to serving him.\nWomen have proved more successful than men at acquiring the higher education credentials that are the gateway to professional/managerial status. They have also gained more control over their reproductive lives in ways that enhance their bargaining power in the home and in the polity.\nThe effort to reverse these gains is apparent not only in coercive restrictions on abortion in many states, but also in continuing efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.\nThese efforts, however, are much more likely to harm low-income women and their families than the women gearing up to compete for professional/managerial jobs. More harmful for higher-educated women are new restrictions on a valuable amenity for them \u2014 the opportunity to engage in employment-related work from home, which affords more flexibility for family care. President Trump issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to discontinue remote work arrangements and require employees to return to in-person employment.\nMany private employers are also mandating \u201cRTO\u201d or \u201creturn to the office,\u201d despite considerable resistance from employees and job applicants. As one business professor conducting research on this issue explains: \u201cWe found return-to-office mandates are more likely in firms with male and powerful CEOs. They are used to working in the office for five days a week. And they feel that they are losing control over their employees who are working from home.\u201d\nIn today\u2019s economy, control over women is an important component of control over employees.\nTrump has also launched a war on higher education and on cultural institutions such as The Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, PBS, and NPR. To what end?\nThe take-down of cultural elites provides a shock-and-awe display of his personal power. It also allows Trump to redirect anger from major wealth-holders like himself to the professionals and managers who represent, for many people, the face of daily authority over their work lives.\nIt is now widely believed that the relative economic return to a college education will decline in the future, partly as a result of increased supply and partly as a result of the growing costs of college (and reduced financial aid). Republicans are particularly likely to hold this view \u2014 which corroborates my description above of the biggest difference between the two parties.\nLarge employers have little to worry about in the labor market. The potential to electronically outsource some technical tasks to relatively low-wage countries has reduced reliance on the home-grown educated work force. Also, the advent of Large Language Models, sometimes referred to as artificial intelligence or AI, has both disrupted education and threatened to displace many \u201cknowledge workers.\u201d\nIt is entirely possible that the demand for professional/managerial workers will decline, reducing their relative bargaining power. One consequence of such a shift could be a realignment of perceived class interests.\nIn sum, how should we understand the ideological underpinnings of Trump regime, and is there room for optimism?\nThe Trump regime is \u201creactionary\u201d in every sense of the word. Anxieties concerning the future tend to evoke nostalgia for the past. As the folk saying goes, \u201cBetter the devil you know than the devil you don\u2019t.\u201d Conservatives are contradicting their own name by denying any concern about conserving our natural environment and climate. They cling to the outdated notion that economic growth can solve all our problems, and that they can deliver that growth by pursuing their own economic self-interest.\nI believe they are in for some big surprises. In the meantime, we need to better explain how current economic policies will harm the majority of Americans. More importantly, we need to devise new policies to protect the common good.\nI was heartened recently by psychologist Jean Twenge\u2019s take on Generation Z (13-29 year olds), who are often described as conservative because they have lost faith in the Democratic party. She offers a different description: because they are more pessimistic about the future than their forerunners, they long for radical change \u2014 anything but the status quo.\nAccording to one voter survey she cites, nearly 2 out of 3 in this age group disagreed that \u201cAmerica is a fair society where everyone can get ahead.\u201d Nor are they romantic about the past. Four out of ten agreed that the founders of the U.S. are \u201cbetter described as villains\u201d than as heroes.\nI, too, suffer from occasional bouts of pessimism and disenchantment. But I\u2019m pretty sure that we can all learn from our mistakes. This is what science, including social science, is all about.\nPress freedom is under attack\nAs Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.\nTruthout produces reporting you won\u2019t see in the mainstream: journalism from on the ground in Gaza, interviews with grassroots movement leaders, high-quality legal analysis, and more.\nOur work is possible thanks to reader support.

            "Tucker Carlson leads MAGA's worried warriors in questioning Trump. As President Donald Trump weighed U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran last month, some influential members of his online MAGA army began to question what he was doing.\nBut few were prominent enough to face a direct response from the president.\n\u201cSomebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that, \u2018IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!\u2019\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what Tucker Carlson is saying,\u201d Trump said in response to a reporter\u2019s question at the Group of Seven summit the same day. \u201cLet him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\u201d\nIn the course of a few weeks, Trump has faced a surprising level of pushback from prominent supporters as he moved to strike nuclear facilities in Iran, floated a new policy to allow undocumented farmworkers to remain in the United States and castigated allies for demanding more information related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Even in that environment, Carlson, regarded as a MAGA standard-bearer, stood out.\n\u201cI like Trump. I campaigned for Trump,\u201d Carlson said in an interview, adding: \u201cBut I\u2019ve got my views. I assume that we will overlap on most things, and I hope that, by the way, the bombing of the nuclear sites in Iran, which I did not support, I hope it works out great, and I\u2019ll be grateful if it does. And I\u2019ll be the first to say I was wrong for the millionth time in my life.\u201d\nIn June, Carlson said Trump was \u201ccomplicit in the act of war\u201d as Israel launched attacks on Iran. (Trump later said Carlson \u201ccalled and apologized.\u201d) One month before, Carlson echoed concerns about Trump\u2019s business dealings in the Middle East, saying \u201cit seems like corruption\u201d when Shawn Ryan, a guest on his program, raised alarm about new Trump properties in the region. And now, he is taking the administration to task for declining to release additional information about Epstein, with whom Trump had a yearslong friendship before a falling-out.\n\u201cThe fact that the U.S. government, the one that I voted for, refused to take my question seriously and instead said, \u2018Case closed, shut up conspiracy theorist,\u2019 was too much for me,\u201d Carlson said Friday at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit, where he devoted his speech to the issue. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the rest of us should be satisfied with that.\u201d\nCarlson emphasized his personal admiration for Trump but took issue with his response to the furor over the Epstein files. At a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump brushed off growing discontent and said it was \u201ca desecration\u201d to ask about Epstein after flooding in Texas killed dozens.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not adequate to say anyone who asked [questions] is somehow desecrating the memory of little girls who died in Texas,\u201d Carlson said in his speech Friday, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t care who gives that answer. That is not acceptable.\u201d\nCarlson\u2019s frustrations represent broader discontent in MAGA world with the policies of the man who brought it together. It\u2019s a key moment for the movement, which for the past decade has been largely in lockstep, testing whether it\u2019s willing to truly break with Trump and whether anyone besides Trump can shape its direction.\n\u2018I was never an important adviser to Trump\u2019\nAsked about his direct discussions with Trump, Carlson said he \u201ccertainly had a lot of conversations with him,\u201d though he declined to say when the two men last spoke.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a policymaker,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just a guy with opinions. I don\u2019t work there. I\u2019ve never worked in any government. I\u2019ve never taken any money from any politician or any government, and I just have strong views, which, by the way, are sometimes wrong, really wrong. I supported the Iraq War. So my track record is spotty.\u201d\nAnd Carlson said he was unaware whether his influence in the White House has waned in light of his recent commentary.\n\u201cI was never an important adviser to Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always kind of overstated.\u201d\nCarlson was center stage among MAGA influencers arguing for the United States to stay out of Iran, a position that has gained popularity on the right as some right-wing influencers have increasingly viewed the U.S.-Israel alliance with skepticism. That stance is also informed by Trump\u2019s having promoted similar anti-war and anti-interventionist views for years, even as he has used military force as president. Ultimately, Carlson said, the most important voice arguing the case to Trump for the U.S. bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\u201cTurns out a head of state of an important ally has a more compelling message than I do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems reasonable to me. I still disagree, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like Trump has changed his views entirely.\u201d\nSome around Trump have taken a victory lap given that he ultimately didn\u2019t ally with Carlson on military action in Iran.\n\u201cThe Iran operation was both a shot at the Iranians, but it was also a shot at the restrainers of the administration and at Tucker and everyone else who said the president is never going to do this,\u201d a Trump ally close to the administration said. \u201cThey think he\u2019s an ideologue like they are, and he isn\u2019t. These guys overplayed their hands.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s relationship with Carlson has had peaks and valleys dating to his first administration. Most notably, during Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 2023 court battle against Fox News, the judge made public text messages showing Carlson\u2019s trashing Trump amid his effort to overturn his 2020 loss, in which he privately said, \u201cI hate him passionately.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s never been a natural ally of the president,\u201d a second Trump ally said, pointing to the texts.\nBut the two reconciled during Trump\u2019s third run for the White House as both were in exile: Carlson having been ousted from Fox News as part of the fallout over the Dominion lawsuit and Trump facing multiple indictments, including in connection with his role in trying to reverse his 2020 defeat.\nWhen Carlson was forced out of his show in 2023, Trump said he was \u201cshocked,\u201d adding, \u201cHe\u2019s a very good person and a very good man and very talented, as you know, and he had very high ratings.\u201d The strengthening of their relationship led Carlson to campaign for Trump, including in a prime-time speaking slot at last summer\u2019s Republican convention.\nGiven Carlson\u2019s stature in the MAGA movement, prominent Trump allies have come to his defense. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said last month that Carlson \u201cis one of my favorite people.\u201d Arguing against intervention in Iran, she added, was \u201cnot kooky.\u201d\nSteve Bannon, the former White House aide and MAGA media personality, who occupies a perch similar to Carlson\u2019s, said the brouhaha between the two men comes during \u201ca time of turmoil\u201d when Trump is handling a number of crises at once. He said Carlson is \u201cstill one of the leaders of our movement and an incredibly strong, independent voice.\u201d\n\u201cTucker has always worked at this a little more with a jaundiced eye,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cHe came to this movement late. He waited and measured it. He respects President Trump; he supported President Trump. When Tucker took on the ruling class, it was a seminal moment for MAGA \u2014 because he did it on Fox prime time. Since then, Tucker has been there for \u2018America First,\u2019 especially when it mattered most.\u201d\nMore broadly, Bannon said, MAGA influencers and thought leaders have to call out policy decisions that veer from base expectations in hope of ensuring their perspective is represented.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to represent every day and continue to make sure that people understand, particularly people around President Trump, and sometimes even the president himself, understands where we think core values lie,\u201d Bannon said.\n\u2018A dissident figure\u2019\nIt\u2019s not as if Carlson hadn\u2019t publicly criticized Trump or his administration before. He similarly sounded the alarm in 2020 when the United States killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and he criticized Trump\u2019s handling of national protests after Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd later that year. While such pushback isn\u2019t new, a person close to Carlson said he has never crossed the line into all-consuming criticism such as Matt Drudge or Ann Coulter, other conservative media personalities who have sharply broken with Trump.\n\u201cTucker\u2019s not being malicious towards the president at all,\u201d a source close to the White House said. \u201cYou can very easily still support somebody and disagree with a specific policy decision. Agree with him or disagree with him, Tucker is at least coming from a sincere place of love and concern for the president. He just wants the president to be successful and is worried that issues like amnesty, Epstein, Ukraine funding and war in the Middle East could eventually lead to his presidency being derailed.\u201d\nTrump maintains high approval ratings with the Republican base, which is informing how he and the White House view the pushback online. An Economist/YouGov survey published Tuesday found that 87% of Republicans approve of Trump\u2019s handling of his job so far.\n\u201cThe president cares deeply about the MAGA base; he is very responsive to them,\u201d a person familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking said.\nThis person pointed to online chatter last week about whether Trump would offer some sort of \u201camnesty\u201d after he talked up an effort at a rally to allow undocumented farmworkers to stay in the country, noting that at a Cabinet meeting, Trump was responsive to the concerns and said there would be \u201cno amnesty.\u201d\n\u201cThings like that are notable when thinking about how the president balances the viewpoints he\u2019s getting,\u201d the person added. \u201cAnd a lot of what he\u2019s done recently are direct responses to so many of the campaign promises made to the base.\u201d\nA MAGA thought leader described Trump and Carlson as \u201ctwo of the great minds of MAGA,\u201d saying the movement wouldn\u2019t exist in its current form without either one. This person worried the MAGA perspective was \u201cgetting a little squeezed out of the inner circle\u201d at the White House on several issues of note.\n\u201cPeople are not going to go along with endless war,\u201d this person said. \u201cAnd when they see the capitulation on Epstein, it just hurts. The Trump administration made overtures that they were serious about this. But six months in and kind of trying to tie a bow around it, it\u2019s just not satisfying. That\u2019s not going to sit well.\u201d\nNo other issue has tested the MAGA base\u2019s commitment to Trump like the Epstein files.\nFor years, many on the right \u2014 including some people who are now in the Trump administration \u2014 have called for the release of all government documents related to Epstein. Epstein died in custody in 2019, and a medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. He was facing sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.\nLast week, Attorney General Pam Bondi released a memo saying the Justice Department\u2019s review turned up no \u201cclient list\u201d of powerful men alleged to have participated in Epstein\u2019s schemes, enraging the MAGA base, who are calling on her to be fired. Trump\u2019s defense of Bondi and his attempts to tell his supporters to move on from the issue have done little to quell the furor.\nOn Saturday, Trump wrote \u201cLET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB \u2014 SHE\u2019S GREAT!\u201d on Truth Social, adding the United States should \u201cnot waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.\u201d\nIn his NBC News interview, Carlson said he now believes the Justice Department actually doesn\u2019t have \u201cmuch relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex crimes.\u201d\n\u201cRather than just admit that, Pam Bondi made a bunch of ludicrous claims on cable news shows that she couldn\u2019t back up, and this current outrage is the result,\u201d he said.\nA Republican Senate aide thinks Carlson is actually having a bit of a \u201crevival\u201d as he carves out distinct space on the right.\n\u201cHe\u2019s more of a dissident figure now,\u201d this person said. \u201cFor whatever else you\u2019re going to say, Tucker is just kind of saying what he thinks.\u201d\nNo recent moment generated more buzz for Carlson than his contentious and combative interview with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, which put the MAGA divide over the conflict between Israel and Iran on full display. Even with the administration not siding with him, Carlson said he\u2019s \u201creally grateful\u201d that there\u2019s significant debate on the right over a litany of policy issues.\nAs for his assessment of the first six months of Trump\u2019s second presidency, he said, \u201cI think they\u2019re trying.\u201d\n\u201cThe most important thing, not just for Republicans, not even for all the first-time Republican voters who supported Trump, but just for the country,\u201d Carlson said, \u201cis to make it clear that you\u2019re trying to achieve what you said you would achieve.\u201d",
            "\u2018Saying Trump is dangerous is not enough\u2019: Bernie Sanders on Biden, billionaires \u2013 and why the Democrats failed. \u2018I think what Trumpism is about, is an understanding that the system in America is not working for working-class people,\u201d says Bernie Sanders, sitting in the Guardian\u2019s offices in London. \u201cIn a phoney, hypocritical way, Trump has tapped into that. His quote-unquote \u2018solutions\u2019 will only make a bad situation worse.\u201d\nIn person, Sanders\u2019 83 years read differently than in photograph, perhaps because of how conversational he is. His voice is magnetic \u2013 a Brooklyn accent that feels both warm and tough. \u201cBut what I have been aware of, and I\u2019ve talked about it for years, is that in America, the very richest people are doing phenomenally well, while 60% of our people live paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\nLater, he will say the same thing to an audience in London \u2013 only with more emphasis and passion. \u201cSixty per cent. Six-zero. Do you know what paycheck to paycheck means?\u201d It\u2019s exhilarating to hear Sanders speak to a crowd: his zeal is reflected back in their faces, his moral clarity is such a relief, set against the cynicism and resignation of most of the Democratic party\u2019s opposition to Trump and his administration. Class war is as old as time, but it\u2019s a peculiarity of this age that you rarely hear a politician name it. \u201cI do,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThere is a class war going on. The people on top are waging that war.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a look at what could have been. Sanders ran, of course, to be the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, and again in 2020. The first time, there was a real sense, in the US and abroad, that something incredible might happen: that someone with \u201calmost no name recognition,\u201d he says, a senator from the small state of Vermont, might successfully challenge Hillary Clinton, whom the party had already anointed. We all know how that worked out. Was it the greatest disappointment of his political life? \u201cWell, you\u2019re too busy to feel things,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re just working very hard.\u201d\nWhat is absolutely unequivocal is his criticism of the Democrats. The party, he thinks, lacks any real progressive promise. \u201cWhat they say is, \u2018The status quo is working pretty good, and we will tinker around the edges\u2019, and that is not a message that resonates with working people\u201d. He refuses to indulge in any personal ill-will towards Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. The most he\u2019ll voice is a weary resignation about 2020, when his campaign \u201cwon the first three states, primary states, in terms of popular votes. Then the Democratic establishment made sure the other candidates dropped out, and they rallied around Joe Biden. You know, that\u2019s the world that we live in. We are taking on not just the Republican leadership, we are taking on a Democratic establishment which is tied to elements of corporate America.\u201d\nDuring the 2024 election, he \u201cworked very hard to see that Kamala Harris was elected. I was all over the country and was one of her major surrogates. We begged our campaign to start talking about the needs of working people. But their consultants and the money people behind them thought of another strategy, showing that she was more conservative, that she worked with people like Liz Cheney, worked with Republicans, had billionaires going out and saying that she\u2019s wonderful. They thought that was the right approach. I did not think that was the approach, and I was public about that.\u201d He pauses, and not for effect: it\u2019s hard to relive November 2024. \u201cBut my voice did not carry,\u201d he says.\nSanders started his political life in 1981, when he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont. His brother, Larry, is 90 and lives in Oxfordshire. He stood as a Green candidate in David Cameron\u2019s old parliamentary seat in 2016. In a speech that year, supporting Sanders as the Democratic nominee, Larry gave a brief portrait of their parents. \u201cEli Sanders and Dorothy Glassberg Sanders. They did not have easy lives, and they died young,\u201d he said. Dorothy was born in New York, to Jewish immigrant parents fleeing Russian pogroms. Eli arrived in the US in 1921, most of his family remaining in what is now Poland and what was then Austrian Galicia, to be \u201cwiped out by Hitler,\u201d Sanders has said in the past. Eli worried constantly about providing for his family, Larry said in the speech, and though both he and Dorothy were not especially political, \u201cthey loved the New Deal of Franklin D Roosevelt, and would be especially proud that Bernard is renewing that vision\u201d.\nSanders\u2019 charge to the Democrats now is twofold. \u201cTheir weakness is, I think, that their credibility is now quite low. And they don\u2019t have much of a message for working people, other than to say Trump is dangerous. I think that\u2019s just not enough.\u201d He point blank refuses to get into Trump\u2019s administration \u2013 its excesses, surprises, non-surprises, without first walking through everything that was already wrong with the US. \u201cWhat the Democrats have to absolutely make clear is this: we\u2019re going to take on the billionaire class. They\u2019re going to start paying their fair share of taxes. We\u2019re going to have healthcare for all people as a human right. We\u2019re going to have a strong childcare system that every American can afford. We\u2019re going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We\u2019re going to create millions of jobs transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. We\u2019re going to build housing \u2013 boy, housing is like it is here, just a huge crisis. We\u2019re going to build millions of units of low-income and affordable housing. Do Democrats say that? No.\u201d\nThat Sanders will not be drawn on every new Trump calumny, instead focusing on an economic reality that\u2019s been worsening for decades, does help him keep on course. And it definitely doesn\u2019t stop him giving Trump both barrels. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually have presidents suing the media, threatening the media if they write bad stories about them. We don\u2019t usually have presidents threatening to impeach judges. We don\u2019t have presidents suing law firms. You add all that together, it is a movement for authoritarianism.\u201d Is it worse than he predicted? I was thinking specifically about the extrajudicial detentions and deportations, students dragged off campus and held for weeks, perfectly legal migrants sent to El Salvador, when they weren\u2019t even from there. \u201cFirst time around, Trump was not as well organised. They\u2019ve had four years to get their act together, so to speak. And that\u2019s what this Project 2025 document was about.\u201d\nProject 2025 was a document published by rightwing thinktank the Heritage Foundation in 2024, offering a terrifying vision for a second Trump term. An outright proposal to dismantle the US government, it was a roadmap to crackdown on immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, abortion rights \u2013 as well as being against action on the climate crisis and against vaccines. If it looked like a blueprint for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and The Road combined, none of the alarm last year could ever have encompassed the reality that would come. Among many other things, the Trump administration would go on to deport people without due process, and then ignore a supreme court ruling that an 18th-century wartime declaration about \u201calien enemies\u201d was not a proper legal instrument.\nI ask a question about who funds the Heritage Foundation \u2013 as it keeps all donations secret, which raises questions about whose interests Project 2025 is really serving. His reply is impatient: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who it is they have. There\u2019s no lack of well-paid, right-wing consultants and intellectuals who can move this country to an oligarchic authoritarian society.\u201d His tone is clear \u2013 stop getting lost in detail, stop looking for hidden connections, stop messing around and start fighting.\n\u201cOne of the frightening aspects of what\u2019s going on is the degree to which the establishment-type folks have caved in, and so quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was much less the case, during Trump\u2019s first term.\u201d He mentions Jeff Bezos, \u201cwho one had assumed was kind of a moderate Democrat\u201d, losing his editorial board because they were going to endorse Kamala Harris. \u201cSame thing in the Los Angeles Times. When you have ABC agreeing to a settlement with Trump; the bogus lawsuit against CBS that Paramount are negotiating right now. When you have major, billion-dollar law firms saying, \u2018OK, we plead guilty to having clients who went to court against you and your friends, that was a terrible crime, we\u2019re going to give you millions of dollars.\u2019 Harvard has buckled up a little bit and appears not to be caving in, but a lot of universities have. None of this was the case eight years ago. They are creating the overall mentality that it will be dangerous to be strongly critical of Donald Trump.\u201d\nIn other areas, money is talking so loudly in politics that it\u2019s all you can hear. Sanders has used Gaza as an example when he says that politicians are afraid to speak out on Israel\u2019s actions in case Super Pacs \u2013 which can put forward unlimited amounts of money for a candidate \u2013 will penalise them at the next election. Today, he says it\u2019s not just Gaza, but a host of other issues. \u201cIf you say, \u2018Do you really think it\u2019s a good idea to cut Medicaid and give tax breaks to billionaires? Do you really think that climate change is a hoax?\u201d there will be a number, not a majority, but a number of Republicans who would say: \u2018No. But if I stand up and vote \u2018no\u2019, the next day, Elon Musk would say, \u201cAll right, you are going to be primaried [a candidate will be fielded against you], and Trump will support your opponent. I will put unlimited sums of money to elect your opponent.\u201d\u2019 Good luck to you.\u2019\u201d\nWhile that pattern is undoubtedly visible across many issues, the example of Gaza is particularly stark \u2013 with groups such as Aipac, funded by pro-Israel billionaires, putting tens of millions of dollars against congressional candidates, mainly Democrats, that it did not deem to be sufficiently supportive of Israel in the run-up to 2024. As the atrocities in Gaza leave many in civil society dumbfounded, what is the long game here, I ask. \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult question, and I don\u2019t know the answer. I will tell you that the United States has had a long-term relationship with Israel, and there are many people who have intellectually chosen not to understand that Netanyahu does not represent the Israel of 20 years ago. The moderate democratic society is now controlled by right-wing racist extremists who have done, and are doing today, absolutely horrific things to the Palestinian people in violation of American law and international law. They refuse to recognise that.\u201d In Dublin, he was heckled for not using the word genocide, and some US progressives were dismayed, two years ago, when he didn\u2019t call for an immediate ceasefire. He speaks out now, choosing his words carefully; he\u2019s not on the fence.\nSince the end of March, Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (he always calls her that, never AOC), have been holding campaign rallies all over the US from Arizona to Utah. They are deliberately not skipping the diehard Democratic states \u2013 but have been more surprised by the numbers they\u2019ve been getting in red states. \u201cThis is not a campaign. This is a political rally, and I think the numbers are almost unprecedented. Large numbers of people, including in conservative areas, do not want to see oligarchy in America, do not want to see authoritarianism, do not want to see massive tax breaks for the rich and cuts to the programmes that working-class people desperately need.\u201d Sure, he and AOC sometimes disagree, \u201cmy wife and I disagree on issues! But Alexandria, I think, comes pretty much from where I come from.\u201d\nHe has hope for the future, too. There are a couple of dozen people in the house Progressive Caucus \u2013 a 98-strong group of the more left-wing members of the Democratic party in Congress \u2013 that are \u201cstrong progressives\u201d, he says. \u201cAlexandria is maybe one of the most articulate and charismatic, but there are others there as well.\u201d Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib to name a few.\nSanders is clear that he and Ocasio-Cortez are not trying to start a third political party. Instead, they\u2019re \u201ctrying to build a grassroots movement of working-class people and young people \u2026 If you\u2019re seeing candidates now arising who are progressive, that\u2019s down to a lot of the work that we are doing for the 2026 midterms.\u201d\nSanders in person is very much as he is in his book, It\u2019s OK to Be Angry About Capitalism, in which he lays out some principles, among them, \u201cwars and excessive military budgets are not good\u201d; \u201ccarbon emissions are not good\u201d; \u201cracism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia are not good\u201d; \u201cexploiting workers is not good\u201d. It\u2019s really the sight of him igniting a crowd that\u2019s so hopeful, which holds for him, too \u2013 he keeps his optimism because he has the \u201cfortune of being able to go around the country and speak to large numbers of wonderful people\u201d. The message doesn\u2019t change, though \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be new: it just has to be true.\nAs he leaves to make his way upstairs to the photography studio, he strides on ahead, his wife Jane O\u2019Meara Sanders, an activist herself, making small talk with me in his wake. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s performing vigour in an era where politicians\u2019 ages are relentlessly analysed. It\u2019s just his manner \u2013 all this urgent change should have happened yesterday."

            "How X CEO Linda Yaccarino went from Elon Musk's fixer to out of a job in 2 years. Linda Yaccarino stepped down as X's CEO on Wednesday following a two-year tenure.\n-\nElon Musk hired her to help revive the social platform's ad business.\n-\nInstead, she spent a lot of time doing damage control for her boss.\n-\nLinda Yaccarino is done cleaning up after Elon Musk.\nWhen she joined the platform formerly known as Twitter in June 2023, investors and ad industry professionals heralded her as a potential savior. The Madison Avenue veteran was tasked with turning around the platform's ad business, which foundered when Elon Musk purchased the company then known as Twitter in 2022.\nBut within her first couple of months in the top job, her most important responsibility crystallized: She would be a highly visible clean-up crew for Musk.\n\"It became pretty clear straight away\" her main role would be to \"try to keep morale going internally,\" Bruce Daisley, a former Twitter VP who left before Yaccarino joined the company, told Business Insider.\nNow, she's exiting what observers describe as a thankless job that involved mending relationships, easing anxieties, and answering to one of the most notoriously challenging leaders in tech.\n\"She always made it clear she would walk away when the time was right,\" a friend of Yaccarino's told BI. \"She made enough money that she doesn't need to work.\"\nA Madison Avenue mainstay goes to Silicon Valley\nYaccarino joined Twitter from NBCUniversal, where she ran the ad business for more than a decade. She was responsible for bringing the entertainment giant into the digital age and gained experience with streaming video. Her NBCUniversal team generated more than $100 billion in ad sales during her tenure, according to her old company profile page.\nYaccarino seemed to embrace Musk's ideas about lax content moderation, which could be seen as risky for advertisers. But advertising's top brass celebrated her Twitter appointment due to her deep relationships on Madison Avenue.\n\"Yaccarino earned a reputation for strong relationships, indispensable knowledge, and tough negotiation skills,\" Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at the research firm Forrester, told BI of her tenure at NBCUniversal and before that, Turner Broadcasting. \"There was great anticipation that Yaccarino could innovate Twitter/X in that same way.\"\nShe would need that experience to fix the chaos Musk had made.\nThe platform she inherited had been decimated after Musk's takeover. Advertisers had backed away as Musk brought back banned Twitter accounts and loosened content regulation. In December 2022, Musk's second full month at the helm, ad revenue fell 40% compared with December 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\"Top on the priority list for advertisers is ensuring brand safety in light of Musk's more relaxed approach to content moderation,\" Aaron Goldman, CMO of the advertising software company Mediaocean, said when she got the job, adding that it was \"welcome news\" for advertisers.\nInvestors seemed equally pleased. Ross Gerber, a longtime Tesla investor who helped Musk acquire what would become known as X, thought her leadership would give Musk more time to focus on Tesla.\nHe believed \"maybe she could get advertisers and actually run the business,\" he told BI.\nShe made some headway: She smoothed things over with vendors that Musk had alienated and invested in a live video feature that moved the platform toward Musk's goal of creating an \"everything app.\"\nMore recently, she oversaw an expansion of X's video products, including an upcoming show hosted by Serena Williams. And while competitors like Meta's Threads have emerged, X's daily user base is 65% larger than Threads and 10 times as large as Bluesky, according to Sensor Tower estimates from the second quarter of 2025.\nX declined to comment beyond Yaccarino's public statement on her departure. Yaccarino did not respond to a request for comment.\nClean up on aisle Elon\nTwo months into her tenure, it started to seem like Musk, not Yaccarino, was ultimately in charge of X. It was Musk who revealed the name change from Twitter to X in mid-2023, a move that rattled advertisers. Musk continued to oversee product design and technology at X, as well, while Yaccarino took care of the business side \u2014 raising questions over how much power he was ceding to his CEO.\n\"Elon is in charge,\" one X staffer told BI in August 2023.\nYaccarino did little to dispel that image. In a September 2023 interview at Code Conference, she seemed puzzled when asked about Musk's plans to charge all X users and didn't know the platform's number of daily active users.\nMusk was not making Yaccarino's job any easier. Advertisers like Disney and IBM fled X in response to a November 2023 report that their ads ran against pro-Nazi posts, and the blowback continued when Musk posted comments that were criticized as antisemitic.\nThe Tesla chief's response to advertisers? \"Go f\u2014 yourself.\"\nYaccarino later sent a memo to staff supporting Musk, calling his remarks to advertisers \"candid and profound\" and saying he \"shared an unmatched and completely unvarnished perspective and vision for the future.\"\nThe platform's antagonistic approach toward the community Yaccarino was supposed to appeal to ramped up in the summer of 2024. The company sued a group of major advertisers. Its lawsuit, filed in August, accused advertisers like Mars and Lego of illegally conspiring to boycott the platform through their membership in a now-defunct industry initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media.\nThe case is ongoing. While advertising insiders and legal experts have dismissed it as baseless, they said it has had a chilling effect on the industry.\n\"In the world of advertising, the idea that you would sue your biggest advertisers goes beyond a fever dream into something that no one working in advertising would consider to be a plausible plot line,\" Daisley said.\nSome ad agency execs and consultants told BI earlier this year that they were begrudgingly advising clients to spend on X as a kind of insurance policy to avoid an advertiser being singled out as a boycotter, sued, or saddled with regulatory scrutiny.\nUltimately, according to Alex Brownsell, the head of content at the World Advertising Research Center, Yaccarino failed to turn the company's business around.\nThe World Advertising Research Center estimates that X will generate $1.87 billion in ad revenue this year, down 6.9% from last year.\nIt estimates that X's ad business shrank by about 23% during Yaccarino's tenure as CEO, compared with a global social ad market that has grown by 34.4% over the same period.\nThe final straws\nYaccarino repeatedly took the heat over X's stumbles, regardless of any role Musk might have played.\n\"It must have been hell for her as well because she was so clearly unempowered and not in control \u2014 from a public point of view, it was quite humiliating,\" an advertising agency veteran told BI. Her political handling of tense situations with the ad business didn't help her case with marketers either, this person said.\nLate last year, Musk hired Mamhoud Reza Banki as X's CFO, a move that seemed to undercut Yaccarino and the finance head she'd appointed, The Wall Street Journal reported.\nIn March, Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI acquired X in an all-stock transaction. That effectively left Yaccarino as a division head.\nIt's not clear if this played a role in her decision to leave. It may also have been a blessing in disguise.\nOne mess she won't have to clean up? The fallout from the recent antisemitic rant by xAI's chatbot Grok.\n\"When you start having antisemitic garbage come out, it scares advertisers away,\" Gary Black, the cofounder of The Future Fund, who has known Yaccarino for more than a decade, told BI. \"It's her nightmare scenario.\"",
            "From milk to magic: How to make paneer (and three ways to use it). From milk to magic: How to make paneer (and three ways to use it)\nThe word \u201cmasala\u201d often translates simply to \u201cspice\u201d or \u201cspice blend,\u201d but its true meaning in the context of traditional Indian cuisine runs far deeper. Masala is the aromatic foundation of a dish, the very soul that defines its regional identity.\nOf course, spices are central to this. However, masala also encompasses the fats used, the type of heat applied, and the unique ways produce is prepared. Each of these elements contributes to the thali, or plate, telling a distinct regional story.\nConsider the incredible diversity of India: 22 official languages, as distinct from each other as Spanish is from Afrikaans, plus thousands of dialects. To put that in perspective, the European Union has only 24 official languages. This linguistic diversity is mirrored in India\u2019s kitchens, and masala is the language that expresses these regional differences.\nWhat We Call Masala aims to make this cultural understanding of masala accessible to everyone, regardless of their background. Think of it as a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d into Indian flavours, where you can follow whatever thread of information sparks your curiosity and best suits your cooking style.\nTake paneer, for example. Seeing fresh Indian cheese used in different recipes illustrates perfectly why masala is about so much more than just spices.\nWhile each of the recipes below uses a distinct blend of spices, it\u2019s primarily the fats and cooking techniques that define the dishes\u2019 unique characters and flavour profiles.\nIn matar paneer, for example, the gentle sweetness of ghee and the low-heat cooking create a warm, softening effect that\u2019s key to its signature mellow flavour. In contrast, turmeric chaaman gets its bold edge from using water as a tempering vessel alongside high heat. Then there\u2019s lal paneer, where mustard oil combined with a playful interplay of high and low heat imparts a deep, shadowed floral note.\nMasala is rich with these fascinating and intricate codes. It\u2019s what makes engaging with it so endlessly captivating and wonderfully welcoming. No matter your cooking skill or kitchen background, you\u2019ll always find a way to discover your own connection within the world of masala.\nHow to make paneer (chaaman) at home\nPaneer, or chaaman in the Kashmiri language, is a fresh cheese made by adding acidity to milk. It is simple to make at home.\nBefore you start making the paneer, line a colander with a piece of muslin or cheesecloth, a clean, thin old tea towel or a clean Chux, then balance the colander over a pot to catch the whey for use in other dishes, including matar paneer (see below).\nOnce made, paneer will keep for up to a week in the fridge. Submerge in water in an airtight container and change the water every day or two.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 litres (12 cups) full-cream milk\n-\n1 tbsp plain yoghurt\n-\njuice of 2 lemons\n-\nMETHOD\nBring the milk to the boil in a large saucepan over high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom and burning. Keep the yoghurt and lemon juice handy.\n-\nWhen the milk starts to bubble up, remove from the heat, add the yoghurt and stir through, then add the lemon juice 2\u20133 tablespoons at a time, stirring after each addition to see how much more acidity is needed to properly split the milk and create the curds and whey. (Curds are the white lumpy bits, whey the yellow liquid that remains.) Adding too much lemon juice at once can split the actual curd, making it less plump and rich.\n-\nOnce the curds and whey have split, strain them through the cloth-lined colander, catching the whey in the pot.\n-\nTie up the muslin or cheesecloth and hang it over the sink or a container. When the paneer has been hung for 24 hours, unwrap it from the muslin, flatten it, then cut it into cubes or slices for the dishes below.\n-\nMakes 600g of paneer\nTurmeric chaaman\nCooking turmeric and chaaman in water is a traditional Kashmiri Hindu cooking technique that alters the effect of turmeric powder. Most of the time, turmeric powder comes through in masala as a soft and round bitter taste. But boiling water gives this spice a square edge.\nIf you\u2019re finding it hard to envisage the idea of the same spice tasting square or round, try this: temper salt, ginger powder, fennel powder and turmeric powder in a small frying pan with ghee, and simultaneously temper the same spices in the same quantities in another small frying pan with water. Taste the two masalas side by side. Ghee makes it soft; water makes it angular.\nYou\u2019ll need to make your paneer the day before cooking this dish.\nINGREDIENTS\n500ml (2 cups) vegetable oil\n-\npinch of turmeric powder\n-\npinch of salt (any kind)\n-\n400g paneer, diced or sliced\n-\n250ml (1 cup) water, plus extra as needed\n-\nMASALA\n2 tsp aniseed powder\n-\n1-1\u00bd tsp fine white salt\n-\n1 tsp turmeric powder\n-\n1 tsp ginger powder\n-\npinch of hing (asafoetida) powder\n-\nFINISHING SPICES\n2 tbsp ghee\n-\n3-5 green cardamom pods, husks cracked\n-\n4 cloves, split with a mortar and pestle\n-\nMETHOD\nHeat the vegetable oil over medium heat in a kadai (a deep, round, flat-bottomed Indian cooking pan), stable cast-iron wok or heavy-based saucepan large enough that the oil comes up no more than halfway. Prepare a bowl of cold water while the oil is heating and keep it beside your stovetop. This is where you\u2019ll put the chaaman after frying \u2013 floating it in water straight from deep-frying removes excess oil. It also keeps the fried chaaman soft.\n-\nOnce the oil is hot, add the turmeric powder and salt. (A pinch each of turmeric and salt when deep-frying anything will magically prevent it from sticking to the pan.) Working in batches so the oil stays hot, gently fry the paneer until it is just browned, then transfer from the oil to the bowl of water using a slotted spoon.\n-\nOnce you\u2019ve browned all the chaaman, drain it and transfer it to a large frying pan. Place on the stovetop with the heat off and add 1 cup of water \u2013 the chaaman should be almost completely covered, with just the top visible above the waterline; I call it the iceberg effect. Add more water if needed to achieve this.\n-\nTurn the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Keep simmering until the water level has reduced by half. You shouldn\u2019t need to stir the paneer at this point \u2013 just check that it\u2019s not sticking to the pan. Once the water has reduced by half, add the masala and stir through gently. Reduce the heat to bring the water to a slow simmer. (The idea is that the heat is tempered to match the evaporation intensity of the water. When these two elements are in balance, you won\u2019t have to stir the pan, and so will avoid breaking up the delicate chunks of chaaman.)\n-\nKeep simmering gently until the water has almost evaporated, about 20 minutes \u2013 don\u2019t panic if it\u2019s longer. There should be just enough liquid to produce a thin gravy and prevent the chaaman sticking.\n-\nIn a separate pan over medium heat, melt the ghee (see note) and add the cracked cardamom pods and cloves until the ghee is sizzling and the spices are fragrant. Add the ghee and cracked spices to the chaaman. Allow 2-3 more minutes of simmering before serving.\n-\nServes 4 as part of a shared meal\nNOTE\nBoiling the paneer is the start of building a particular type of structure, creating a certain tension that strings the paneer proteins \u201ctight\u201d and prepares them for communicating a steelier view of masala. Using structural spices such as cardamom and cloves to finish further reinforces the square and strong iteration of turmeric powder in this chaaman. The ghee is a nod to softness, and reiterates the dairy base of the dish.\nLal paneer\nKashmiri chilli powder is used here for colour rather than heat. Lal means \u201cred\u201d in Hindi, and the red of this dish really is beautiful, as is the creamy end texture. Serve this simple dish with dhal and steamed basmati rice.\nIt\u2019s best to make the paneer the day before so that it has plenty of time to hang.\nINGREDIENTS\n500ml (2 cups) mustard oil\n-\n500g paneer (see recipe above)\n-\n\u00bd tsp turmeric powder\n-\n\u00bd tsp fine white salt\n-\nMAIN MASALA\n6 small tomatoes\n-\n1 tbsp mustard oil\n-\n1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder\n-\n2 tsp coriander powder\n-\n2 tsp fennel powder\n-\n1 tsp ginger powder\n-\n\u00bd tsp cumin seeds\n-\n125ml (\u00bd cup) paneer water, from frying (see below)\n-\n2 tsp fine white sea salt\n-\nTADKA\n\u2153 cinnamon stick\n-\n4 green cardamom pods, husks cracked\n-\nMETHOD\nHeat the mustard oil in a kadai, stable cast-iron wok or heavy-based saucepan large enough that the oil comes up no more than halfway. Heat the oil to smoking point, then remove from the heat and let it cool. This reduces the pungency of the mustard oil, which is vital for a subtle dish like lal paneer.\n-\nMeanwhile, cut the paneer into 2cm cubes. Fill a large bowl with cold water and set it beside the stovetop.\n-\nReheat the mustard oil over high heat until very hot but not smoking. Add the turmeric powder and salt to prevent the paneer from sticking to the pot. Fry the paneer in small batches until just browned, then remove it from the oil with a slotted spoon. Place the paneer in the bowl of water, taking care that your cooking implement doesn\u2019t touch the water, so it won\u2019t spatter when you return it to the oil. The water keeps the paneer soft and helps it to slip out from beneath the oil.\n-\nTo begin the masala, remove the tomato cores and score the bases with a cross. Place them in a bowl of boiling water until the skin starts to split and lift. Remove them from the water and remove the skin. Puree the tomatoes in a small food processor or with a hand-held blender. The tomatoes need a smooth texture, to provide a silken carriage for the masala.\n-\nHeat 1 tablespoon of mustard oil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the Kashmiri chilli powder and stir through for 2-3 minutes, keeping the heat high. Add the pureed tomatoes and stir them through for another 2-3 minutes.\n-\nReduce the heat to medium-low. Add the coriander powder, fennel powder, ginger powder and cumin seeds. Stir through for 1-2 minutes, then add the drained paneer and the paneer water. Add the salt, stir it through, then continue cooking for a further 10 minutes.\n-\nTo finish, add the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods and stir them through. Keep at a low simmer for 10 minutes, then serve immediately.\n-\nServes 4 as part of a shared meal\nMatar paneer\nNo one in my family ever gets tired of this dish. Part of what makes it so sweet and warm to eat is the diced tomato tossed in to thicken the masala and bring a fresh and bright character. Make the paneer the day before and remember to save the whey.\nINGREDIENTS\n750ml (3 cups) vegetable oil\n-\n150g (2 cups) fresh or frozen peas\n-\n2 roma tomatoes\n-\n600g paneer (see recipe above), whey reserved, cut into 5cm pieces\n-\nMAIN MASALA\n2 tbsp ghee\n-\n3 tsp cumin seeds\n-\n2 tsp coriander powder\n-\n1\u00bd tsp fennel powder\n-\n1 tsp fine pink salt\n-\n1 tsp ginger powder\n-\n\u00bd tsp turmeric powder\n-\n\u00bd tsp Kashmiri chilli powder\n-\n\u00bd tsp cinnamon powder\n-\nscant \u00bd tsp amchur powder (see note)\n-\nscant \u00bd tsp fine white salt\n-\ngenerous \u00bc tsp mace powder (see note)\n-\n4 green cardamom pods, husks cracked\n-\n3 cloves\n-\n1 cinnamon stick\n-\n2 \u00d7 2cm piece of jaggery (see note)\n-\nMETHOD\nHeat the vegetable oil over high heat in a kadai, stable cast-iron wok or heavy-based saucepan large enough that the oil comes up no more than halfway.\n-\nWhile the oil is heating, parboil the peas for 3\u20134 minutes and dice the tomatoes. Set both beside the stovetop, along with 3 cups (750 ml) of the reserved whey.\n-\nFill a large bowl with cold water and set it beside the stovetop. Once the oil is hot, fry the paneer in small batches. When slightly browned, carefully remove it from the hot oil and drop directly it into the cold water. Once all the paneer is fried, drain it and set it beside the stovetop.\n-\nCombine the ghee and all of the spices except the jaggery in a large frying pan off the heat \u2013 if you add the spices while the heat is on, you won\u2019t be able to work quickly enough and they will burn.\n-\nPlace the frying pan over medium heat and allow the ghee to melt and the spices start to warm before adding the jaggery. Stir until aromatic and tempered. Taste the masala \u2013 it will be delicious, a little salty, with woody, tangy spice.\n-\nAdd the tomato and taste again \u2013 it freshens the masala, lifting the complexity with a bright and sweet acidity. Cook for 5-7 minutes, until the oil begins to split and the tomatoes form a rich and spicy slurry. Add the peas and the fried paneer, then gently stir them through the spices. Immediately add enough of the whey to not quite cover the paneer cubes \u2013 think of them like icebergs, with 70 per cent of their surface area below the waterline.\n-\nIncrease the heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the sauce begins to bubble. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, without stirring, for 45-60 minutes, until the paneer is fluffy and a small amount of richly spiced sauce remains in the pan. If the simmer gets too strong during cooking, reduce the heat to low.\n-\nServe with basmati rice and a simple dhal.\n-\nServes 6 as part of a shared meal\nNOTE\nAmchur powder, made from dried green mangoes, is used to add acidity to a dish. Mace powder is made from the ground outer web surrounding the nutmeg seed. It has an orange rind quality that makes it prettier and more floral than nutmeg. Jaggery is an unrefined sugar product made from sugarcane juice. It is sold in blocks, cakes, or as a powder. All of these ingredients are available in Indian or Asian grocers and some supermarkets.\nThis is an edited extract from What We Call Masala by Sarina Kamini, photography by Patricia Niven.

            "Inside the political reckoning shaking up the ad industry. Conservatives have taken aim at advertisers who they say unfairly boycott media companies.\n-\nGovernment investigations and civil lawsuits have remade the world of \"brand safety.\"\n-\nThe probes have caused anxiety in the ad industry, but some execs say a reset was necessary.\n-\nConservative media company The Daily Wire is celebrating the downfall of \"brand safety,\" and benefiting from the new state of play in the ad business during the second Trump era.\nLast week, The Daily Wire's commercial team received a request for proposal, or RFP, from Omnicom, one of the world's biggest ad agency groups. An RFP typically indicates an agency or advertiser's interest in buying ad space.\nThe RFP was a huge win for The Daily Wire. It was only the second time it had received an inbound ad request from Omnicom. The first was in May, but the latest was a much bigger buy.\nLast year, The Daily Wire's famous cofounder and podcaster, Ben Shapiro, testified that the site had been unfairly shunned by major advertisers and ad agencies who, he said, had deemed its content unsafe for their brands.\n\"Brand safety was being defined by people with a severe bias against a certain point of view,\" The Daily Wire's editor in chief, Brent Scher, told Business Insider in an interview.\nBut since President Donald Trump's return to the White House, the power dynamics around \"brand safety\" \u2014 the practice of brands seeking to avoid their ads appearing next to, or otherwise supporting, \"unsafe\" content \u2014 have shifted, with some advertisers scrambling to avoid any whiff of anti-conservative bias. The situation is particularly acute for Omnicom, making its outreach to The Daily Wire both unprecedented and unsurprising.\nLast month, Andrew Ferguson, chairman of the Republican-led Federal Trade Commission, gave conditional approval to a proposed $13.5 billion merger of Omnicom and fellow ad company IPG, which would create the world's largest ad agency. It had an unusual caveat: Omnicom agreed to a consent order that would prevent it from colluding with other companies to encourage its advertiser clients to boycott media based on publishers' \"political or ideological viewpoints.\"\n'Brand suitability' versus 'brand safety'\nThe FTC's move is the latest victory in the battle against brand safety waged by US conservatives. Brand safety in 2025 has become such a political flash point that some ad execs are changing the way they talk about the topic.\n\"I hear the phrase 'brand suitability' far more than 'brand safety' now,\" said Liam Brennan, a marketing consultant and former ad agency director. \"It makes it sound like a cop out, but it's a shift in the approach brands are taking. Before it was 'block, block, block,' now it's more about where my brand should be appearing. It's a more positive approach.\"\nWhile the Trump administration's actions have turned up the heat on brand safety practices, a broader backlash has been building for some time. Brand safety began as a seemingly innocuous practice of preventing brands from appearing next to the worst of the internet, such as violence, pornography, and illegal content. But it gradually expanded, with brands seeking to avoid a wide variety of political issues, or platforms that supported them.\nIn investigations and lawsuits, lawmakers and other high-profile conservatives have argued that ad practitioners, brand safety tech vendors, and industry groups forced the brand safety pendulum to swing too far into partisan areas, unfairly depriving right-leaning outlets of ad dollars. Media companies on the left have said they, too, have been harmed by advertisers who deemed news sites as unsafe for brands.\n\"What may have started as a good idea expanded, and then became too broad,\" said Mark Penn, CEO of the advertising holding company Stagwell. \"Consequentially, it wasn't really about brand safety \u2014 it became almost brand censorship.\"\nThe emergence of brand safety\nThe practice of brand safety arose as advertisers shifted from analog media buying \u2014 placing deals directly with the TV stations, billboard owners, or newspaper proprietors they wished to buy space with \u2014 toward digital.\nUsing technology, advertisers could target their audiences across swaths of websites, social platforms, and apps with just a few clicks. However, this meant they had less visibility about the content their ads were likely to appear next to. Brand safety technology was created to give advertisers more control over the types of content they wanted to fund or avoid.\nKeyword block lists were an early but somewhat blunt tool, helping advertisers avoid appearing in articles about grisly news topics like murders or natural disasters. However, marketers often didn't maintain good block list hygiene.\nMike Zaneis, CEO of ad industry accreditation organization the Trustworthy Accountability Group, said he was recently reviewing brand block lists that still had the term \"Ariana Grande\" on them, years after the deadly terrorist attack that took place at the pop star's Manchester Arena, UK, concert in 2017.\n\"Never mind that she's won two Grammys since then,\" Zaneis said.\nEnter: The conservative backlash\nThe scrutiny on brand safety notably dialed up in 2024 and took on a partisan tone.\nJim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, released an investigation that accused advertisers of illegally colluding to withhold ad dollars from conservative-leaning media like The Daily Wire, X (after Elon Musk's takeover of the company), and \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" The report took aim at an initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, which developed brand safety frameworks and common definitions that advertisers and Big Tech platforms like Meta and YouTube could universally adopt.\nElon Musk's X then sued several major brands, including Mars and CVS Health, alleging their participation in GARM involved a conspiracy to withhold ad dollars from the platform formerly known as Twitter. The conservative video platform Rumble also sued GARM and some of its members, making similar claims in its suit.\nGARM shut down shortly after X's suit was filed. Its parent organization, the World Federation of Advertisers, denied wrongdoing but said GARM didn't have the resources to fight the legal action. In a May legal filing seeking to dismiss the X case, the defendants said the lawsuit was an attempt to use the courts win back business X had \"lost in the free market when it disrupted its own business and alienated many of its customers.\"\nIn a statement, the WFA said GARM provided tools to help advertisers better exercise their freedom to choose where to place their ads in the best interests of their brands, and that it was always voluntary and pro-competitive.\n\"WFA will continue to fight these allegations, and we are confident that the US judicial system will find in our favor,\" the statement said.\nWhile GARM is no more, the lawsuits and the Judiciary Committee's investigation continue, and the FTC has joined the brand safety battle under the Trump administration.\nFerguson, the FTC chair, has said that maintaining a free ad market and free speech is a top priority and that he hopes other ad companies will adopt policies similar to those in the Omnicom-IPG consent decree.\nThat notice extends to other advertising vendors in the brand safety sphere.\nIn May, the FTC sent sweeping civil investigative demands to media watchdogs and rating firms, including Media Matters and Ad Fontes Media, seeking information about their brand safety practices. In one such letter, viewed by BI, the FTC sought documents related to relationships with GARM, the publicly traded ad verification firms Integral Ad Science and DoubleVerify, and other entities that track and characterize \"misinformation,\" \"hate speech,\" \"false\" or \"deceptive\" content, and other similar categories.\nWhile the FTC's actions have made many in the ad industry nervous, some execs consider much of brand safety to be, as Stagwell's Penn puts it, a \"fabricated issue.\" Penn said there were only limited situations in which brands might really be negatively affected by where their ads appeared.\n\"From the polling I've done, conservatives think that they were being censored and demonetized, and liberals think they were being censored, so nobody was particularly happy about what was going on,\" Penn said. (Stagwell owns the public opinion and advisory firm The Harris Poll.)\nWill the brand safety crackdown benefit news publishers?\nExecs at The Daily Wire say the scrutiny on brand safety was warranted and has gotten results.\n\"My team is inside of the bigger agencies, having discussions, whereas the door was automatically shut 12 to 16 months ago,\" said The Daily Wire's SVP of ad revenue, Christine Hoffmann. \"We're getting business from Fortune 500 companies, like Chevron, like Amazon, like Paramount, and that was business that was nonexistent to us.\"\nOther conservative news outlets, including Fox News and The National Review, have also noticed a bump in advertising interest since Trump took office for the second time. Ad industry insiders previously told BI this reflected advertisers' realization that half of the country voted for Trump, but that it could also be a signal of advertisers hedging against political risk.\nThe notion that the crackdown on brand safety will provide a long-term bump to news publishers is untested and, for many industry insiders, feels unlikely. An executive from the media buying giant GroupM testified in a House Judiciary Committee hearing last year that just 1.28% of its clients' global ad budgets went toward news outlets. Meanwhile, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon \u2014 with their superior scale and adtech \u2014 are set to take in more than half of global ad spending outside China this year, according to the latest forecast from the World Advertising Research Center.\nOmnicom has agreed to be audited to demonstrate its compliance with the FTC's proposed consent decree, which also includes an agreement not to create block lists, unless requested to do so by clients. The FTC's provisional agreement says Omnicom-IPG can't collude with other firms to steer client ad spend based on political ideologies, which might cause some advertisers to simply opt to avoid news altogether. As BI previously reported, some ad industry insiders and analysts think the government's crackdown on brand safety is an overreach that will hurt publishers of all kinds while further consolidating power with the tech giants.\nNew tools could help brands avoid the censorship label, but there's no room for GARM 2.0\nSome in the ad industry tell BI they're hopeful that brand safety could enter an apolitical era, powered by tech rather than individual decisions over blunt filters.\n\"My view is that AI will bring greater nuance to brand safety \u2014 making it more effective for buyers and less restrictive for sellers,\" said David Kohl, cofounder of the performance marketing firm Symitri.\nKohl said startups like Mobian are building models that assess context, user sentiment, and real-time ad performance to identify which media environments deliver and which don't.\nElsewhere, Stagwell is creating what Penn describes as a politically neutral news marketplace, in partnership with the adtech company The Trade Desk, enabling advertisers to buy multiple news sites at once, according to demographics.\nWhile brand safety might become more tech-enabled, it seems unlikely there will be a GARM 2.0 for some time yet.\n\"It would be far too easy to become a target,\" said Lisa Macpherson, a former marketing executive who now serves as the policy director of Public Knowledge, a tech policy consumer advocacy group.\nJust ask the advertising agency group Dentsu. Late last year, Dentsu quickly exited its involvement with the creation of a new coalition that had intended to encourage ad investments in \"credible\" news. Days after the press release about the coalition was published, the House Judiciary Committee requested documents from the ad firm, having noticed similarities to GARM. In response, Dentsu said it had decided \"not to pursue the initiative\" nor \"pursue any other effort with similar aims.\"\nMacpherson said advertisers would continue to do what's necessary to protect their investments in their brands. Yet, as the threat of lawsuits and document demands related to GARM rumbles on, people in the ad industry will likely avoid using the phrase \"brand safety\" in emails or marketing materials.\n\"They may describe it differently,\" Macpherson said. \"They will be very careful to couch it in language that evokes their constitutional right\" to send ad dollars or not spend money on certain media outlets based on the suitability for their individual brands, she added.\nZaneis of TAG said the recent government and legal scrutiny of brand safety practices might have been the jolt the industry needed, forcing marketers to pay closer attention to an issue that had gotten out of hand.\n\"We may not like how we got here as an industry, but it's where we should have been all along,\" Zaneis said."

            "Car insurance claims do's and don'ts. Car insurance claims do's and don'ts\nAuto insurance claims can involve complex legal issues. You cannot count on insurance company representatives to provide accurate information since they are ultimately interested in protecting their employer\u2019s bottom line.\nBy paying close attention to the following dos and don'ts of car insurance claims, you can protect your right to collect full and fair compensation for the car accident damages you sustained, Salvi, Schostok & Pritchard P.C. report.\nDo\u2019s of Car Insurance Claims\nHere are insurance claims do\u2019s following a car accident:\nDo Report the Accident\nYou are legally obligated to report any auto accident that results in:\nDeath\n-\nBodily injury\n-\nProperty damage of $1,500 if all vehicles are insured or $500 otherwise\n-\nWhen police officers arrive on the scene, provide factual statements about the moments leading up to the car accident.\nDo Seek Medical Treatment\nCar accidents can result in serious injuries, including broken bones, traumatic brain injuries, and spinal cord injuries. Some injuries, like internal organ damage, may not be obvious immediately after a car accident. Promptly seeking medical treatment is the best way to protect your health following an auto accident.\nDo Collect Information\nCollect information while you are at the accident scene, including the other driver's insurance information, address, driver's license number, and vehicle information. Also, collect the names and phone numbers of any witnesses.\nDo Take Pictures\nThe accident scene will be cleaned up quickly after the accident, so you only have a few minutes to preserve evidence for your auto insurance claim. Take pictures of the following:\nThe other cars involved\n-\nAll property damage\n-\nThe accident scene\n-\nCross streets\n-\nSkid marks, broken auto parts, tire treads, or other physical evidence at the scene of the accident\n-\nAny signs (like speed limits) that might be relevant to the insurance claim\n-\nDo Review Your Insurance Coverage\nCheck your insurance policy to see what is covered. Review both the \"Coverage\" and \"Exclusions\" sections of your auto insurance policy. If you have a good understanding of what your policy covers, you can fight to receive the full value of benefits you are entitled to under your car insurance claim.\nDo Save Receipts\nDealing with the aftermath of a car accident can be expensive. You may be able to receive full and fair compensation for your accident-related losses, such as:\nMedical bills\n-\nCosts to repair or replace your vehicle\n-\nFuture medical treatment\n-\nLost wages and reduced earning capacity\n-\nPain and suffering\n-\nMental distress\n-\nSave receipts for all of your out-of-pocket expenses so you can be reimbursed.\nDo Take Advantage of a Personal Injury Attorney's Free Consultation\nContact a qualified auto accident attorney as soon as possible. If you choose to hire one, they will also:\nCommunicate and negotiate directly with the insurance provider\n-\nThoroughly review every insurance policy that applies to the case\n-\nRepresent you through all aspects of the car insurance claim\n-\nRecommend which type of legal action is most likely to yield the results you are looking for\n-\nDon\u2019ts of Car Insurance Claims\nAnd here are the don\u2019ts for car insurance claims:\nDon't Speculate or Volunteer Extra Information\nAlthough you were involved in an accident, you may not know exactly why things happened the way they happened. So, don't speculate. When police officers or insurance agents ask questions, answer them honestly, but answer only with facts \u2014 not with your opinion.\nDon't Admit Fault\nEven if you suspect that you were at fault for an accident, you may be wrong. Determining liability is complicated. It involves looking at many different factors. Allow the police and investigators to do their jobs and reach their own conclusions about fault. If you admit fault, you may not receive a fair settlement for your claim \u2014 even if you were not actually the cause of the accident.\nDon't Negotiate Directly with the Other Driver\nThe other driver is not in a position to determine the fair value of your claim. If you negotiate outside of the insurance process, you may fail to get fairly compensated for your damages and injuries. If the other driver has insurance, you (or your lawyer) will deal directly with the driver's insurance company. If the driver lacks insurance, you can talk with your own insurance company about available coverage.\nDon't Give the Insurance Company Written Statements Before Reviewing Your Policy\nBefore you submit any information in writing to your insurance company, make sure you review your policy and understand fully what your coverage provides. Also, avoid giving any type of written or recorded statement until you understand your obligation (if any) to do so.\nDon't Do Anything to Make Your Injuries Worse\nIf you suffered injuries in a car accident, make sure you seek medical attention and go to any follow-up appointments. Follow the instructions the doctor gives you in order to ensure that you reach maximum recovery (and receive maximum compensation for your injuries).\nDon't Accept an Insurance Agent's Evaluation Without Question\nWhen an insurance adjuster reaches a conclusion about the value of your claim, do not assume that the adjuster is correct. The insurance company has a vested interest in minimizing the amount that the company pays out in insurance claims. You can try to get your own damage estimates or talk to a lawyer to help you do it.\nDon't Sign a Settlement Without Consulting a Lawyer\nIf you sign a written waiver and cash a check that says \"full and final payment,\" you will be unable to get any more compensation. The compensation that the company offers you may be unfair and fail to cover future medical expenses that result from your accident.\nDon't Sign a Blanket Medical Authorization.\nAn insurance company representative may want to see your medical records. However, the insurer is not entitled to any records beyond the medical records related to your accident. If the insurance company tries to access your records beyond that, it is a violation of your privacy. If you have any questions about the authorization, talk to a qualified attorney.\nFAQs About Car Insurance Claims\nSomeone hit my car \u2014 whose insurance do I call?\nIllinois is an at-fault insurance state. This means that the driver who was at fault for the accident is responsible for the damages their negligence caused. An injured victim generally receives compensation following a car accident by filing a claim with the insurance company that provides coverage to the other driver. However, if the driver is underinsured or uninsured, you might file a claim with your own insurance company.\nDo I need an attorney to make an insurance claim?\nWhile you are not technically required to hire a lawyer to make an insurance claim, you may want a lawyer's help. Anything you say to the insurance company may be used in determining the value of your claim, so you might want a lawyer there to help protect your rights and guide you.\nWhat do I say to my insurance?\nWhat you say to your insurance company after an accident can make the difference in whether you receive any compensation for your insurance claim and how much. It is important that if you speak directly to your insurance company that you only provide accurate, factual information. You should not admit fault or speculate on the cause of the accident. If you need help providing a statement to your insurance provider, our lawyers are here to help.\nWhat if the accident was partially my fault?\nEven if you are partially at fault, Illinois' modified comparative negligence law still allows you to file a claim against the at-fault party as long as you were not more than 50% responsible for the accident. Additionally, you may not know all the factors that contributed to the accident. A lawyer can investigate the claim and fight for all the compensation you are owed.\nThis story was produced by Salvi, Schostok & Pritchard P.C. and reviewed and distributed by Stacker.",

            "Body as a Home: Belly Dancing and Embodiment Discoveries. Body as a Home: Belly Dancing and Embodiment Discoveries\nArts + Literature Laboratory 111 S. Livingston St., Madison, Wisconsin 53703\nALL\u2019s LAB^4 project brings together teams of Madison-area artists of varied disciplines and backgrounds to shepherd exhibitions and events; as stated in the project description, \u201cthe LAB^4 project seeks to shift the role of curators from gatekeepers to their original definition as caretakers.\u201d The current curator team has brought together six wide-ranging exhibitions on display through Aug. 29, including Hmong story cloths by eight Madison artists, video work and related books by Ronaldo V. Wilson, recreated little free libraries, and more. Find information on all the exhibitions and related events (this week including the third lecture in dancer/scholar Reenah Dixon's \"Body as a Home\" series at 7 p.m. Aug. 13, and an artist talk at noon and workshop at 1:30 p.m. (RSVP here) by Bryanna Bibbs on Aug. 16) at artlitlab.org.\nmedia release: Arts + Literature Laboratory and the LAB^4 community curation team welcome dancer and scholar Reenah Dixon for Body as a Home: Belly Dancing and Embodiment Discoveries, a series of three events where the mind, body, and soul are not seen as separate entities, on Wednesday, July 16; Wednesday, July 23, and Wednesday, August 13, 2025, 7:00pm to 9:00pm each session. Free admission.\nReenah\u2019s trilogy of events offers an invitation into embodied connection, where the mind, body, and soul are not seen as separate entities, but as interwoven expressions of the self. Rooted in her personal and professional journey\u2014from academic rigor to artistic expression\u2014Reenah brings a rare blend of psychological insight and performative practice. Each event is designed to explore different access points to integration: scientific understanding, cultural tradition, and social vulnerability. Together, they form a progression from inner awareness to wordless connection to radical presence in community. Through these offerings, Reenah invites participants to tune in, reach out, and make themselves at home\u2014within their bodies and with one another.\nIn the first event, Models, Mindfulness and Movement (July 16), participants explore how thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations operate within a unified human experience. Reenah introduces a framework that reflects her psychological training: the brain\u2019s biological architecture gives rise to the apparent separation between mind, body, and emotion. Yet through mindful attention and intentional movement, participants experience a re-integration\u2014both from the top down (through thought and awareness) and the bottom up (through sensation and movement). This seminar offers a grounding in theory and practice, bridging ancient wisdom and modern science to help participants better understand their own lived experience.\nThe second event, Wordless Discovery through Dance (July 23) shifts the focus from theory to shared experience. Drawing from the global traditions of bellydance, this workshop is conducted entirely without spoken language. Participants of all levels are invited to explore nonverbal connection through music, movement, and subtle cues from one another. Without the crutch or barrier of words, communication becomes intuitive and embodied. This silent space honors bellydance\u2019s intercultural legacy, while highlighting how dance can be a deeply human way of knowing and being with others\u2014one that transcends borders, identities, and even words themselves.\nThe third event, Radical Hospitality (August 13) brings the body into the social realm. Reenah reimagines performance not as a spectacle but as a shared ritual of welcomed vulnerability. Participants become both dancers and witnesses in a space designed to dissolve the usual boundaries between artist and audience. Feelings of pride, fear, and generosity are welcomed as part of the offering. In this final gathering, Reenah distills the essence of her practice: connection arises not from perfection, but from presence. When we accept ourselves as we are, we make room for others to do the same\u2014and that is where true home begins.\nmore on the exhibitions:\nNew LAB^4 exhibitions on display from Tuesday, July 8 through Friday, August 29, 2025. A reception for all current exhibitions will be held on Thursday, July 17, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm.\n\"The Whimsyland Series\" by Poornima Moorthy is a drawing series that conveys a place where one feels unconditional love, acceptance, and protection. There is an invisible thread that binds us: love, empathy, curiosity. These are the magical forces we can\u2019t see. Moorthy captures that magic in the world around us. By listening and observing, she reveals how magic lives in ordinary moments\u2014hidden marvels we don\u2019t always notice, feel, or think about. Her drawings are intended to spark hope, faith, and a sense of endless magical possibility.\n\"Willow Sanctuary\" by the artist, master naturalist, land steward, and environmental educator, mars. \"I am deeply encouraged by the possibility of highlighting women builders and connecting people and plants through place and curiosity,\" explains mars, \"As an Artist, Ecological Restorationist, and representation of my Ancestors wildest dreams, I am joyful to be a part of watering seeds of interest around honoring Art as common soil to cultivate germination of ideas, curiosity, and connection.\"\n\"The Persistence of the Unsorted\" by Sara Black, Jessie Mott, and Claire Pentecost: A motley collection of makeshift beings wanders through a museum in search of a home. Lost, excluded, imperfect and unfinished, these creatures of indeterminate constitution persevere. They persist in a world almost beyond repair, a realm where all they have is what they can scavenge from a failed paradigm. Survival depends on solidarity across differences of kind, persuasion and species. Haunted by boundaries, conceptual and material, the unsorted carry on in the exuberance of impure existence.\n\"Stitching the Story: Capturing Heart and Resillience through the Story Cloth\" is a powerful exhibition celebrating the artistry, resilience, and lived experience of local Hmong artists. Rooted in the traditional textile art of paj ntaub, the featured works reflect stories of survival, displacement, healing, and cultural pride. Many of the pieces were created during times of great personal and collective hardship, spanning from refugee camps to resettlement in Wisconsin. Others were stitched in moments of reflection, drawing from memory, landscape, and the rhythms of daily life.\nThe exhibition highlights the work of eight Madison-based artists \u2013 Chang Lee, Lou Vang, Mai Vang, See Vang, Kia Yang, See Yang, Thao Yang, and Kong Xiong \u2013 whose embroidery bridges generations and geographies. Through detailed motifs, cross-stitching, appliqu\u00e9, these works preserve a cultural legacy while embracing adaptation and change. In sharing their work, the artists offer a vibrant testament to creativity as a form of storytelling, healing, and connection. Visitors are invited to learn from their techniques, honor their histories, and celebrate the enduring beauty and strength of the Hmong community.\nRonaldo V. Wilson\u2019s Family Beings, Before the Sea in the Sky\u2019s Eye features three videos, and three related books offering distinct and related configurations of family beings and animated personas enacted through video, drawings, dance, song, and writing, crossing domestic, natural, and urban locations. The videos Who Gets To? (2024); Harbor (2024); and Carmelina\u2019s Farm (2023), reveal art documentation, including family interviews, improvised songs and performances in site-specific landscapes (beaches, mountains, studios, galleries, and urban streets.) Wilson dances, sings, holds conversations, sometimes donning aviary and old white man masks, and playing with a baby doll, all as poetic meditations. Though poetry, prose, 2D collage, video and performance documentation, Wilson\u2019s books Virgil Kills: Stories (2022); Carmelina: Figures (2021); and Lucy 72, Poems (2018) engage the insides and outsides of perceived race and identity, excavating memory, nation, and embodiment, while manifesting grounded, fluid, and soaring poetic imaginaries.\n\"Home Is Where You Find It: Reimagined Little Free Libraries\" invites viewers to explore the intimate, expansive, and layered concept of \u201chome\u201d through a unique collaboration between six Madison-area artists and the city\u2019s iconic Little Free Libraries. Madison becomes both canvas and collaborator in this citywide installation, reimagining these beloved neighborhood structures as portals into artistic expressions of the many things that \u201chome\u201d can mean.\nInside the gallery at Arts + Literature Laboratory, visitors will find a work by each participating artist that offers a window into their practice. Accompanying the exhibition is an illustrated zine created by local artist TL Luke, charting the locations of each artist-designed Little Free Library across Madison.\nVisitors are encouraged to take home a printed copy of the map and experience this expansive art show in person and beyond the gallery walls.",
            "Vintage photos show what life looked like in the 1920s. Life in the 1920s was defined by many cultural, political, and economic developments.\n-\nJazz music and flapper fashion defined the era's sound and look.\n-\nThe Harlem Renaissance brought popularity to art created by Black Americans.\n-\nA century ago, F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" was published, capturing the glamor and excess of the Roaring Twenties.\nBut beyond the flapper dresses, bobbed haircuts, and speakeasies, the 1920s was a time of significant societal shifts.\nAfter a war-torn decade, the '20s saw artistic, cultural, and technological advancements in the workplace, entertainment, democratic rights, and more.\nWhile the decade brought liberation for some Americans, there's a darker side to its history, too, that includes many of the same societal issues the world continues to grapple with, like racism, sexism, and wealth disparities.\nTake a look at these vintage photos that show society's progress, the simple pleasures we all still enjoy, and where we can look to improve in the next century to come.\nSuffragettes rallied for women's right to vote in America.\nOn August 18, 1920, the 19th Amendment was ratified, granting women the right to vote. However, the law largely applied to white women, as Black women, Indigenous women, and other women of color were prohibited from voting for many decades to come.\nSuffragettes across the US celebrated the moment the 19th Amendment was ratified.\nHere, a photographer captured celebrations after the newly ratified 19th Amendment in August 1920.\nWomen also broke tradition with short hairstyles, which defined the look of the Roaring Twenties.\nWith the rise in women's liberation movements came a wave of modernist short hairstyles.\nLuxe fabrics, flapper girl silhouettes, and art-deco style dominated the fashion world.\nIn the Roaring Twenties, fashion was characterized by fringe, loose fabrics, and glamorous details. The garments differed immensely from the athleisure and street style-inspired looks that fill clothing racks today. But as fashion historians explain, trends are cyclical \u2014 '20s-inspired clothes could (and will likely) make a comeback into mainstream fashion again.\nSwimwear became more form-fitting.\nPrior to the 1920s, women's bathing suits often included stockings and full-length skirts.\nWith an increase in popularity in water activities, the decade saw a rise in swimwear fashion styles with less fabric, making it more comfortable for wearers to swim.\nWedding-dress styles from the '20s included ornate headpieces.\nBrides Magazine reported that beaded headbands were common additions to wedding gowns during the Jazz Age, as were dresses with high necklines and cape- or flutter-style sleeves.\nThe shift from rural to urban living was prominent in the 1920s.\nThe US Census Bureau reported that the 1920 census marked the first time over 50% of Americans reported living in urban areas compared to rural ones.\nIn architecture, Art Deco started to gain prominence, becoming a defining style of the decade.\nIn \"A History of New York in 27 Buildings,\" author Sam Roberts wrote that in the 1920s, it seemed every real estate investor wanted to join the \"tallest building club.\"\nAmid this rise of New York City skyscrapers, workers broke ground on what would become the Chrysler Building \u2014 one of the most iconic examples of Art Deco style \u2014 in 1928. After it was completed in 1930, it was briefly the tallest building in the world.\nOther popular architectural styles of the 1920s included Colonial Revival and Beaux-Arts.\nPublic transportation advancements gave people new ways to travel around cities.\nPictured here is a subway entrance in London, circa 1924. Transport for London reported that the city's Underground was the first subway in the world, having opened in 1863.\nBeyond underground trains, rail trains were also a central part of life in the 1920s.\nHere, a group of employees stand in front of a train in 1920.\nTrain travel in the 1920s was often comfortable and glamorous compared to the cramped cars that many commuters know today.\nTrain travel was arguably its most glamorous from 1910 through 1950.\nHowever, much of public transportation has stayed the same over the decades, like the realities of crowded bus and subway stops.\nHere, a group of people wait to board a bus in Chicago around 1925.\nThe decade also marked a new era of automobile advancements.\nThe Ford Motor Company factory in Highland Park, Michigan, first started using its moving assembly line in 1913, changing how quickly and efficiently vehicles could be built.\nAs such, the 1920s are often considered one of the most influential decades of automobile advancements.\nThe Model T vehicle defined much of the 1920s \u2014 it was sold until 1927.\nThe Model T was sold by the Ford Motor Company 1908 until 1927, per History.com. The vehicle was the earliest effort to make a modern car that was affordable to the masses.\nAs explained by the History Channel, the Model T was so affordable that it helped rural Americans connect to other parts of the country, which eventually led to the creation of the numbered highway system that's known throughout the US today.\nLong before Uber and Lyft, cabs were stylish vehicles.\nHere, a woman was photographed outside a cab vehicle in Los Angeles, circa 1925.\nFire engines in the 1920s looked much more ornate than today's modern, large trucks.\nHere, members of a fire department in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, were photographed around 1920.\nCruise ships were often extravagant.\nHere, passengers onboard the Saturnia ship partake in an evening dance in the 1920s. The Saturnia was an Italian liner that sailed until the 1960s. Along with its sister ship, Vulcania, it was among the first large transatlantic liners driven by diesel engines, the Italian Liners Historical Society reported.\nProhibition banned the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcohol within the US until 1933.\nProhibition went into effect in 1920 with the 18th Amendment. Until it was repealed in 1933, the law greatly impacted American culture and society, giving way to organized crime and speakeasies.\nProhibition led people to create speakeasies, or secret bars where they could drink in private.\nHere, people drink at a speakeasy around 1920.\nIn the 1920s, drugstores weren't only places to pick up prescriptions \u2014 they were also soda and candy counters.\nDrugstores weren't just places to grab quick convenience items like they are today; they were central gathering spots in the community. At a 1920s-era pharmacy, customers could sit at the counter and enjoy a root beer float or an egg cream.\nThese pharmacies of a bygone era were much more ornately decorated \u2014 with marble countertops and beautiful light fixtures \u2014 than the fluorescent lighting-clad drugstores of today.\nGeneral stores were the go-to spots for workers, food, and household items.\nGeneral stores became less common after the 1920s, but throughout the decade, they were still popular for various goods for farmers and industrial workers, as well as equipment and food.\nSchools for young students around 1920 were typically large classrooms that fit as many pupils as possible.\nAt the time, classrooms and schoolhouses were designed to hold as many students as possible to maximize space.\nBut in the 1920s, more educators and administrators started to support \"progressive\" schools that were built to house programs that were new at the time, allowing more open-air, light, and access to outdoor activities, per a 2012 report from the National Institute of Building Sciences about school design.\nIn 1925, the Scopes Trial cast a national spotlight on the debate of teaching evolution in schools.\nOne of the most highly publicized legal cases of the decade was the Scopes Trial, in which a Tennessee high school teacher, John T. Scopes, was prosecuted for teaching evolution. Doing so was considered a violation of the newly passed Butler Act, which prohibited overlooking creationism and teaching evolution in the state's classrooms.\nAs History.com reported, the trial was heated, with famous orators of the time \u2014 defense attorney Clarence Darrow and prosecutor William Jennings Bryan \u2014making lengthy, passionate arguments that represented the clashes between traditional religious teachings and modern scientific thought.\nScopes, who was never clear if he had actually taught evolution, was convicted and fined $100, although his conviction was later overturned on a technicality. Still, the trial served the purpose of forcing the debate into the national spotlight.\nThe `1920s saw the birth of historic figures, such as Queen Elizabeth II, who was born in 1926.\nHere, the Queen \u2014 then known as Princess Elizabeth \u2014 was pictured in 1929 at a train station, apparently on the way to the family's Sandringham Estate for Christmas.\nProminent civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was also born in the 1920s.\nHe was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta and became one of the most important figures in the Civil Rights Movement during the '50s and '60s.\nA hundred years ago, the Charleston was the dance of choice.\nHere, two people photographed around 1926 do the Charleston dance.\nThe moves came from a song in the Broadway show \"Runnin' Wild.\"\nPer the Charleston County Public Library, it became a mainstream dance after the musical's release in 1923 and defined the rest of the decade.\nJazz music was the most popular genre of the decade.\nJazz music dominated 1920s culture in America thanks to popular musicians like Louis Armstrong.\nThe genre was a key feature of the Harlem Renaissance, which encompassed music, literature, and art created by Black Americans.\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture reported that after the end of the Civil War, the Great Migration brought over 100,000 Black Americans from a wide variety of backgrounds to Harlem, New York City.\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Black creatives across disciplines shared their art en masse, documenting what it was like to be Black in America during a period known as the Harlem Renaissance.\nIconic works from the likes of Nella Larsen, W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, and more were all produced during this era.\nHowever, throughout the 1920s, Black people continued to face barriers like segregation, discrimination, and even violence.\nIn the photo above, the waiting room on the right was designated for \"Colored\" individuals while that on the left was for white people.\nSegregation was a prominent aspect of life in the US following the Civil War, especially in the South where Jim Crow laws were harshly enforced.\nOther minority groups also faced discrimination. Below are Japanese \"picture brides\" who immigrated to the US in 1920 to marry American men as a result of exclusionary immigration laws.\nImmigration from Japan to the US was largely limited during the 1920s as a result of the 1907 Gentlemen's Agreement.\nHowever, it had an exception for Japanese wives of current American residents, which led to the practice of American men choosing Japanese women to be their wives solely based on photos.\nMany of the Japanese \"picture brides\" faced discrimination, spousal abuse, and poor living conditions upon arrival to the US, Women & the American Story reported.\nSuch marriages were made illegal by the 1924 Immigration Act, which barred any immigrant who wouldn't be eligible for citizenship from coming to the US.\nPeople of Asian descent were denied full US citizenship until the 1950s.\nThe year 1920 also saw the first Olympic Games since before World War I.\nAfter the 1916 Olympic Games were canceled due to World War I, the 1920 summer Olympics were set in Antwerp, Belgium, as a way to honor \"the suffering that had been inflicted on the Belgian people during the war,\" the Olympics reported.\nIt was also the first year the Olympic Rings symbol was publicly displayed.\nBack then, sporting equipment like tennis balls, footballs, and other athletic gear was often handmade.\nHere, people carry newly manufactured tennis balls.\nIn the 1920s, athletic wear was very different from the nylon pants we're familiar with now.\nPictured here, a football team poses in sporting uniforms at Oliver High School in Kentucky in 1921.\nGym class appeared much more elegant in the '20s than it is today.\nThis looks way more sophisticated than a sweaty game of kickball.\nHorse races were a ritzy leisure activity that often involved fabulous outfits and hats.\nHere, people attend a horse race at Ascot Racecourse in Ascot, England, around 1920.\nIn the 1920s, a trip to the fair became a popular pastime. Fairgoers could go for a spin on the carousel ...\nCarnivals and state and county fairs in the US were popular summertime activities during the early 20th century.\n... or make a go-around on bumper cars.\nUSA Today reported that Coney Island's Luna Park is believed to have had one of the first bumper car attractions.\nConey Island in Brooklyn represented a new era of entertainment at the turn of the 20th century in America.\nConey Island was an iconic part of the early 20th century that transformed how Americans spent their free time.\nA photo shows groups of couples competing in a dance contest at the Coney Island boardwalk.\nThe Brooklyn park gave locals and visitors new ways to stay entertained and spend time with one another in the form of roller coasters and rides, animal exhibits, and a lively boardwalk and beach.\nHere, women competed at a patriotic-looking beauty pageant at Coney Island.\nMiss Coney Island 1924 and 1925, respectively, appeared to stand on the Coney Island boardwalk sometime during the mid-1920s.\nLong before the days of Instagram, photographers captured the moment at county fairs.\nThis snapshot from around 1920 shows fair attendees having their picture taken.\nSpending time at the beach in the '20s sometimes meant catching shrimp with huge nets, apparently.\nAround 1920, a family was photographed at a beach in Germany holding up shrimping nets.\nSilent films dominated the movie industry in the 1920s ...\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities reported that the silent film era began in 1894 and continued through the 1920s. Before there were \"talkies,\" audiences were dazzled by films starring actors like Charlie Chaplin and Clara Bow.\n... but the decade also saw the transition to the \"talkies,\" or movies with spoken dialogue.\nIn 1927, \"The Jazz Singer\" became the first feature-length movie to feature dialogue scenes, marking a transition from the silent film era, per the Museum of Modern Art.\nThe World reported that the first film (that wasn't a feature-length movie) with talking scenes was actually created in 1898 by Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9.\nAs film began to include sound, musical movies captured the hearts of audiences.\nMusical movies produced in the late 1920s, like \"Broadway Melody,\" continued to push \"talkies\" into the mainstream.\nVaudeville, which consisted of short acts of dancers, musicians, magicians, and comedians, was also a popular form of entertainment.\nThe Dolly Sisters, pictured here, were famous vaudeville performers in the early 20th century.\nAnother iconic vaudeville production during the 1920s was the Ziegfeld Follies, PBS reported, which preceded the modern Broadway musical and helped launch the career of many theatrical stars of the time.\nLeo, the lion that became a symbol of MGM Studios, made his debut in 1927.\nMGM's first lion named Leo was shown on screen in 1927, per The Hollywood Reporter.\nCircus shows also featured animals 100 years ago.\nIn the almost 100 years since this photo was taken, some states in the US have banned the use of animals in circuses, while others have enacted partial bans.\nThe famous Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus show, \"The Greatest Show on Earth,\" shut down in May 2017 after 146 years of shocking the nation with its acrobatic and animal performances. It reopened five years later, but without animals.\nIn recent years, changing attitudes toward animal rights, as well as high operating costs of shows, and declining attendance rates, have led to the demise of the circus.\nHere, women are photographed holding pigs outside of a circus in New York around 1920.\nBefore modern conveniences like central air conditioning, people found creative ways to stay cool in the summer, like this group of women who appeared to be sitting on a chunk of ice.\nWillis Carrier invented the first air conditioner in 1902, but it wasn't until 1929 that Frigidaire introduced a unit that was suitable for use in homes, the US Department of Energy reported.\nAny curiosity about what was going on in the world required a look at the daily newspaper.\nPeople relied on newspapers for local, national, and global updates, as well as advice columns, entertainment, and other stories.\nThe world's first commercial radio broadcast was made in 1920.\nThe Pennsylvania Center for the Book reported that Pittsburgh radio station KDKA produced the world's first radio broadcast on November 2, 1920.\nFrank Conrad is known as the \"father of radio broadcasting\" for inventing the first station, which was located in his garage.\nThroughout the '20s, radio continued to expand, changing the way people received the news, communicated, and connected with pop culture.\nPer MIT Black History, Rufus P. Turner was the first Black radio station operator. He began operating his station, W3LF, in Washington, DC, in 1928.\nTelephones looked just a little different from the smartphones we know today.\nPhones of the 1920s and '30s were characterized by their rotary dials and \"spit cup\" receivers.\nBeing a switchboard operator was a common job for many women in the early 1920s.\nBeing a switchboard operator often required saying the phrase \"number please\" hundreds of times per hour for eight hours a day, according to a 1922 op-ed in The New York Times, as cited by Time.\nIt was a time of significant changes in the workplace \u2014 World War I had seen the first time that factory jobs, previously viewed as male positions, were taken over by women in the US. Following the war, more women were in the workplace than ever before.\nKitchen appliances were much different than they are now.\nThe beginning of the 20th century brought many advancements to the home \u2014 from gas ranges to the advent of refrigerators, which became commonplace in homes by the 1920s \u2014 but kitchens certainly didn't have the multi-functional, high-tech gadgets many homes are equipped with today.\nWhile much has changed in the past century, from cars and technology to pastimes, many of the simple pleasures of life have remained constant, like getting ice cream from a snack stand ...\nHere, kids were photographed at a soda stand on a street in Paris around 1920.\nThe only thing that would make this sweeter was if Coca Cola still cost a nickel.\n... and catching up with good company at a caf\u00e9.\nHere's to all the changes and all the lasting pleasures of the next 100 years.",
            "'Through the Veil' exhibition at Sarasota Art Museum an immersive labyrinth of mixed media hanging assemblages. 'Through the Veil' exhibition at Sarasota Art Museum an immersive labyrinth of mixed media hanging assemblages\nOn the third floor of the Sarasota Art Museum is an environment that envelops visitors in a world of shimmering Caribbean color and mysterious shadows that creep along the historic schoolhouse\u2019s gray walls and wood floors. Nassau-born, Atlanta-based artist Lillian Blades calls her suspended assemblages veils.\nThe museum\u2019s executive director, Virginia Shearer, offers a more colorful description.\n\u201cIt's almost like she has pulled the canvas off the back of the painting, and she's pulled all of the image off the front of the painting, and what's suspended from the ceiling is what's in between, so they're quite special,\u201d Shearer said.\nTo fully appreciate Blades' constructs, you have to know about her mother.\n\u201cLillian's mother died in childbirth,\u201d Shearer noted. \u201cLillian has done a lot of investigation, a lot of oral history with her family, a lot of learning about who her mother was as a person, what interested her.\u201d\nHer mother was a quilter.\n\u201cOnce you know that, different sorts of interpretations of the work start to come together for you,\u201d Shearer said. \u201cYou can almost see that all of these shapes, all these patterns are quilted together. Instead of stitching, she's using a kind of metallic knotting technique.\u201d\nThe suspended tapestry-like veils are massive. They\u2019re made of pieces of Plexiglas, wood, mounted family photographs and sundry found objects. Into each piece, Blades drills tiny holes for the metal filaments that splice one to another to form monumental assemblages and even a gazebo that\u2019s surrounded by four hanging veils.\n\u201cSo it's a lot of handwork, which is what goes into textiles and being a seamstress, working on quilts,\u201d Shearer observed.\nWhat makes these kaleidoscopic assemblages all the more intriguing is the realization that the artist works on them piecemeal and didn\u2019t see the completed veils until they were up and on display.\nUnique and immersive, \u201cThrough the Veil\u201d is on display at the Sarasota Art Museum through October 25.\nMORE INFORMATION:\n\u201cThrough the Veil\u201d is Lillian Blades\u2019 first solo museum exhibition. It includes an array of recent and new work.\nBlades originally trained as a painter.\n\u201cLillian got her master's in fine arts as a painter, so she was very much trained and learned how to look at great works of art,\u201d Shearer explained. \u201cShe was working in a pretty traditional vein, but there wasn't enough texture in painting to satisfy her, so at a certain point, she started to incorporate objects from her studio, including an old flip-flop that was made out of a rough-hewn cotton material. She slapped that onto the canvas and she was hooked from there. A lot of her work, and some of her early work that we have hanging on the walls, is more in that vein, in that tradition, so it looks quite like a canvas, but she's encrusted the canvas with three-dimensional materials, so there's a lot of color and depth and texture.\u201d\nA few years ago, Blades shifted from wall assemblages to her tapestry-like veils.\n\u201cThese are sculptural works that hang from the museum\u2019s ceilings,\u201d Shearer noted. \u201cThe suspended works create environments that are meant to envelop viewers and invite them to look through them to a person or shadow on the other of the suspended veils.\u201d\nBoth the suspended works and the wall pieces include a plethora of mirrors.\n\u201cThey invite us to see ourselves reflected in the works,\u201d Shearer observed.\nBlades pushes the boundaries of her craft. In addition to mirrors, her densely layered works combine handcrafted and found objects that include picture frames, antique clocks, printed imagery, wood, acrylic and glass, which she wires together to form monumental pieces that extend from floor to ceiling.\n\u201cShe's originally from the Bahamas, but grew up in Atlanta,\u201d Shearer noted. \u201cHer work is deeply influenced by her family, her roots in the Bahamas and growing up in the South, so a lot of what you see are very colorful and very painterly, with lots of color, shapes, lines and elements of art. They're really quite arresting, quite beautiful.\u201d\nDrawing from the vibrant visual language of the Caribbean, Blades incorporates rhythmic patterns and symbolic imagery into her artwork.\nBlades\u2019 assemblages pay homage to her mother, who died giving birth to her. Seeking a sense of grounding, Blades began collecting and transforming materials and objects that would allow her to reconnect with her family and her African roots. Drawing from patchwork and quilting traditions, she developed an assemblage technique in which she brings together fragmented elements in a way to reimagine her past and deepen her understanding of self.\nThe result is a patchwork of objects, ideas, and identities, manifesting as an elaborate, suspended maze. The artist\u2019s search for connection unfolds as a kaleidoscope of color, form, and texture\u2014immersing visitors in a dynamic dialogue between past and present, their surroundings, and their own reflections.\nAnchoring the exhibition is Blades\u2019 largest installation to date, a site-specific labyrinth of veils immersing viewers in a dynamic exchange between past and present, their surroundings and their own reflections.\nThe centerpiece of the suspended works is a gazebo surrounded by four veils.\n\u201cIt was a project she originally did a couple of years ago for Atlanta Botanical Gardens,\u201d Shearer said. \u201cThey have a wonderful commission program where they invite contemporary artists to make a new work in their orchid gallery once a year. Lillian won that commission and created this wonderful gazebo.\u201d\nWhen Blades made her site visit to the Sarasota Art Museum and she began to brainstorm with Shearer and associate curator Lacie Barbour, Blades immediately envisioned having her gazebo suspended in SAM\u2019s tower gallery.\n\u201cBut Lillian wanted to take it a step further, and so she made four additional veils,\u201d Shearer continued. \u201cThat allows visitors to wind their way through this gorgeous work of art with its hot pinks, saturated colors, jewel tones, purples and greens. You've got a wonderful orange and yellow, and all of these work together to just create this really bright, incredibly compelling environment.\u201d\nThe response from people who\u2019ve seen the installation so far has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\u201cVisitors are describing [the exhibition] as very joyous, playful, colorful. It's very much in the craft tradition, but sort of playing with that craft that [at one time] was not considered fine art and is still, you know, I think up for grabs, whether most people consider more of a craft sensibility to be fine art. But a lot of contemporary artists are pushing in that direction, and so she and that sort of movement is something that we wanted to explore.\u201d\nWhile a number of works, like the gazebo, are older, pre-existing pieces, Blades made a number of works specifically for the Sarasota Art Museum show.\n\u201cA big part of what we do is we invite the artists to come down to Sarasota, see our beaches, experience the light here, meet the people and get to see what the museum looks like,\u201d Shearer explained. \u201cAs you know, we occupy this repurposed 1926 schoolhouse that on the exterior looks like a medieval building. But inside, it's the height of the edgiest of contemporary museums with white walls, beautiful track lighting and exposed architectural elements in our ceilings. So the space is a very much a part of the end result of each exhibition. And it's really how the artists are inspired by the space and reacting to it that leads us to where we go with these exhibitions.\u201d\nThe composition of Blades\u2019 veils is extraordinary. The mainstay of the veils are plain Plexiglas pieces of various sizes and shapes. But sandwiched in between others are colored paper, glittery paper, silk screen prints and family photographs.\n\u201cIn \u2018Sunset,\u2019 you can see yellows and oranges and even sort of the blue of the sky intermixed with family photographs,\u201d Shearer pointed out. \u201cHer family was very important to her, and is very important to her.\u201d\nThe exhibition\u2019s title, \u201cThrough the Veil,\u201d signifies more than a viewer\u2019s ability to look through the suspended tapestries. It references her own ability to look back in time to her origins.\n\u201cIt\u2019s history, ancestry and reaching back through the veil to touch these ancestors that walked and lived and produced long ago,\u201d said Shearer. \u201cFor her, that\u2019s the through line.\u201d\nStaging the veils\n\u201cIt was important to Lillian and to us that the rooms in which the veils are displayed be dramatically lighted,\u201d Shearer noted. \u201cShe wanted a lot of light to be bouncing off the reflective surfaces. She also wanted to create these large shadows on our white walls, which are kind of wonderful.\u201d\nAchieving just the right dichotomy of dramatic lighting and shadows entailed quite a bit of trial and error. It also required the museum to close off a number of its skylights.\n\u201cThe lighting allows us to really accentuate the elements that Lillian has included in her veils,\u201d Shearer explained. \u201cIt lets us show off, for example, the sequins at the top, sequins at eye level and all these mirrored squares, rectangles, and little circles to kind of catch your eye. And then, what's also so special is the realization that there's a lot of negative space. So the spaces between the different elements that she is knitting together also create these really interesting little portholes.\u201d\nWorking in scale\nAlthough Blades works on small sections, stitching one element to those that adjoin it, the completed veils are more than ten feet tall and two or three times that in width. That requires a fairly large work space. Interestingly, Blades maintains her studio in an old schoolhouse, which gives her the latitude to piece together her veils on conference tables and even the floor.\nWhile she has a design in mind, a great deal of the assembly process is improvisational.\n\u201cIt unfolds very organically,\u201d Shearer noted. \u201cShe knows the end result she's driving towards, but perhaps not the exact journey that she\u2019ll take to get there.\u201d\nBlades process requires considerable concentration and physical stamina.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard work,\u201d Shearer conceded. She pointed to a one-inch-square piece of wood that was included in one of the veils.\n\u201cSee there? See those four tiny holes she drilled in it in order to connect it to the pieces on all four sides? That requires a lot of care because, you know, you could very easily fracture a piece of wood or something like that if you drill it incorrectly. So you really have to pay attention to what you're doing.\u201d\nWall Pieces\nAlthough Blades\u2019 veils are admittedly breathtaking, her wall pieces are equally complex and intriguing.\n\u201cIn those, she's essentially assembling the work directly on a canvas or piece of wood,\u201d Shearer noted. \u201cA lot of the materials you see are found materials, although some are purchased and people give her materials as well.\u201d\nA number of Blades\u2019 canvas assemblages take up a full section of wall.\n\u201cThey\u2019re large-scale canvases that have been painted and encrusted with glitter and little dots of paint and squiggle marks and all that good stuff,\u201d Shearer noted. \u201cAnd then on top of that, she's layering in empty picture frames, jewels, jewelry, mirrors and reflective surfaces.\u201d\nThe mirrors and reflective surfaces invite viewers to see themselves in the work of art. Viewers are also encouraged to fill the empty frames that Blades incorporates into her compositions with memories of what have been and could be.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really poetic,\u201d Shearer said. \u201cI love this work. I mean, you can look at it all day and see something different each time, just really depending on where you focus.\u201d\nBlades\u2019 work has been featured in galleries, museums and botanical gardens across the United States, as well as in The Bahamas, Trinidad, Germany and South Africa. Her public installations include the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and the State Farm Arena in Atlanta. Her works belong to the permanent collections of the Birmingham Museum of Art, Clark Atlanta University Art Museum and the National Art Gallery of The Bahamas, among others.\n\u201cLillian Blades: Through the Veil\u201d is organized by Sarasota Art Museum of Ringling College of Art and Design and curated by Lacie Barbour, associate curator of exhibitions at Sarasota Art Museum.\nSupport for WGCU\u2019s arts & culture reporting comes from the Estate of Myra Janco Daniels, the Charles M. and Joan R. Taylor Foundation, and Naomi Bloom in loving memory of her husband, Ron Wallace."

            "Dexter: Resurrection Episode 1 Brings Back Multiple Dead Characters In A Clever Way - SlashFilm. Dexter: Resurrection Episode 1 Brings Back Multiple Dead Characters In A Clever Way\nNote: The first episode of \"Dexter: Resurrection\" is now streaming on Paramount+ Premium, and debuts on Showtime at 8pm ET this Sunday night. This post contains spoilers for the premiere episode.\nShowtime was adamant about Michael C. Hall's eponymous serial killer staying alive in the \"Dexter\" finale, and now we know why. The character's popularity among viewers means that he can always be brought back for more slaughter-filled adventures, and it was only a matter of time until the Bay Harbor Butcher struck again. The revival series, \"Dexter: New Blood,\" caught up with Dexter Morgan years after faking his own death, revealing that he moved from Miami to a small town, where he lived under a fake alias. It was only a matter of time until he got into trouble again, though, and the series ended with his son shooting him in the chest and leaving him for dead.\n\"Dexter: Resurrection\" picks up immediately after those events, and some blasts from the past return to give our antihero a lesson in parenting. Episode 1 opens with Dexter in a coma and his spirit seemingly stuck in the realm between the living and the dead, where he is visited by Arthur Mitchell (John Lithgow), aka The Trinity Killer, Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), James Doakes (Erik King), and his old man Harry Morgan (James Remar), all of whom share words of wisdom and make Dexter realize that he has to return to the world of the living and be a good father to the son who tried to kill him.\nThere's an argument to be made that these characters were only brought back to provide some nostalgic fan service \u2014 especially Doakes, who opens the conversation with his forever-memeable \"Surprise, motherf***er\" line. However, the cameos don't outstay their welcome, and their words of wisdom actually lead to Dexter finding the inspiration he needs to pursue the mission that carries \"Dexter: Resurrection\" forward. That said, there is one character from the original series who risks becoming a thorn in Dexter's side as he tries to get on with his life.\nOne of Dexter's best friends could be his undoing in Dexter: Resurrection\nAngel Batista (David Zayas) is a regular throughout all eight seasons of the original \"Dexter,\" and the cuddly detective has a great relationship with the titular serial killer. Dexter's psychotic predilections mean that he struggles to form meaningful relationships in the traditional sense, but he comes through for Angel when it matters \u2014 like the time when Dexter's stalker ex-girlfriend, Lila West (Jaime Murray), tries to frame Angel for a crime he doesn't commit. Angel, on the other hand, views Dexter as his best friend, but their relationship might become strained on \"Dexter: Resurrection\" if episode 1 is anything to go by.\nThe season premiere sees Angel track down Dexter and ask him why he faked his own death and assumed a new identity. Once the small talk is out of the way, Angel tells Dexter that he received a call from Chief Angela Bishop (Julia Jones) informing him his bestie is the real Bay Harbor Butcher, only for her to backtrack during their next conversation. Afterward, he recalls the time when Maria LaGuerta (Luna Lauren Velez) told him in confidence that she thought Dexter was the Butcher, leading to him bringing up how James Doakes \u2014 the cop framed for being the killer \u2014 used to call him a creep. The conversation concludes with Angel telling his old friend that he pulled some strings to get his real identity back, suggesting that he's out to prosecute Dexter.\nWhile the returning dead characters are essential in helping Dexter find his will to live again, Angel might make him regret that decision. Dexter's old pal being onto him adds some real tension to the series, and it should be fascinating to see how the Butcher gets himself out of this situation.",
            "10 Great Twilight Zone Episodes That No One Talks About. Rod Serling\u2019s The Twilight Zone is an enduring sci-fi anthology beloved across generations. However, with 156 episodes, it\u2019s no surprise that a few got lost in the shuffle. While \u201cTime Enough at Last,\u201d \u201cThe Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,\u201d and \u201cEye of the Beholder\u201d are deserving of their places in the hall of fame, many of the show\u2019s best stories remain under-watched and under-appreciated by the general public. These are the strangely beautiful episodes that don\u2019t typically show up on best-of rankings, but hold a special place in the hearts of Zoners. Perhaps it\u2019s because they\u2019re head-scratchers that require a second viewing, or maybe they were just overshadowed by other heavy-hitters.\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nEither way, they are still considered by hardcore fans to be Twilight Zone at its best, even if no one brings them up at parties.\n1) \u201cWhat You Need\u201d\nOn Christmas Day, 1959, The Twilight Zone aired a little tale titled \u201cWhat You Need.\u201d Based on Lewis Padgett\u2019s short story, the episode features a crook named Fred Renard who spends his nights brooding in a bar until he crosses paths with Pedott, a frail old street peddler selling strange trinkets. Pedott somehow knows exactly what each customer will need in the near future. Renard, sensing a racket to exploit, tries to take control of Pedott\u2019s gift. But the more he forces fate, the closer he gets to an unfortunate end.\nWhile other Twilight Zone holiday episodes, like the much-discussed \u201cNight of the Meek,\u201d wrap their stories in sentimentality, \u201cWhat You Need\u201d is more cynical. A cautionary tale in the vein of A Christmas Story, only Renard never learns his lesson. The absence of a redemption arc or happy ending certainly made it a bold choice for the holidays and may be why it\u2019s still underappreciated today. In a fair world, this episode would stand right beside the show\u2019s other definitive holiday parables. Instead, it lies in relative obscurity, and Renard still \u201ccarries on his shoulder a chip the size of the national debt.\u201d\n2) \u201cPerchance to Dream\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to believe this episode predates both A Nightmare on Elm Street and Christopher Nolan\u2019s blockbuster hit Inception, but The Twilight Zone\u2019s \u201cPerchance to Dream\u201d explored the terrifying idea of dying in your dreams first. In the episode, a man named Edward Hall checks into a psychiatrist\u2019s office in a panic. He hasn\u2019t slept in days, terrified that if he falls asleep, he\u2019ll die. His dreams have taken on a sinister air, with a seductress named Maya luring him toward a fatal end. As his real-world body weakens, his dream world grows more vivid and dangerous.\nCharles Beaumont\u2019s first script for the series is a feat of suspense and surrealism. Throwing noir aesthetics in with psychological horror, the episode feels like a fever dream. It also happens to be one of the most visually stylish episodes of the entire series, and yet, one that often fails to get the praise it deserves. Fans typically remember the twist endings of The Twilight Zone, but \u201cPerchance to Dream\u201d offers a satisfying slow-burn as well as a shocking conclusion.\n3) \u201cCome Wander With Me\u201d\nIn one of the final episodes ever aired, a slick folk singer named Floyd Burney, also dubbed \u201cthe Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Cowboy,\u201d ventures into the backwoods to find a new song and stumbles into a ghost story. He records a haunting melody sung by a mysterious woman named Mary Rachel, only to discover the song is about his own death. The closer he gets to fame, the faster fate closes in.\n\u201cCome Wander With Me\u201d is one of the love-it-or-hate-it episodes that tends to get left out of the conversation. Defenders of \u201cCome Wander With Me\u201d say the episode critiques the 1960s folk revival and the exploitation of rural tradition by city-slicker musicians chasing commercial fame. As Floyd\u2019s punishment, he\u2019s forever caught in the narrative of the song he tried to steal. Directed by Richard Donner (Superman, The Omen), the mysterious circular storytelling makes it feel almost like an art-house film, and the recurring ballad may haunt you long after the episode ends.\n4) \u201cOne for the Angels\u201d\nAnother overlooked Christmas episode, \u201cOne for the Angels,\u201d is considered by some to be the most emotional Twilight Zone episode ever. Lew Bookman is a beloved sidewalk pitchman who sells toys to kids. But when Mr. Death shows up and informs Lew that time is up, he begs for mercy, claiming he still hasn\u2019t made the greatest sales pitch of his life, aka \u201cone for the angels.\u201d Death agrees, only for Lew to announce his retirement, believing he\u2019s tricked fate. Death, ever the bureaucrat, informs Lew that someone else (a sweet little girl named Maggie) must die in his place.\nEd Wynn brings warmth, humor, and heartbreaking sincerity to Lew, a character who begins the episode feeling like a failure and ends it making the ultimate sacrifice. The portrayal of Death (by Jaws actor Murray Hamilton) is equally striking; he\u2019s stoic and unfazed, until Lew delivers the sales pitch of a lifetime that even Death can\u2019t resist. The pacing may feel a little slow compared to other episodes, but the payoff is worth it. According to Zoners, this is one of the episodes most likely to make you cry.\n5) \u201cPrinter\u2019s Devil\u201d\nDouglas Winter is a small-town newspaper editor on the brink of bankruptcy. As staff desert him and debts mount, he contemplates ending his life, until a mysterious stranger named Mr. Smith (icon Burgess Meredith) appears, offering to save The Dansburg Courier with his supernatural typing skills. Business booms, but as bizarre scoops pour in and misfortunes strike his competition, Doug begins to suspect that Mr. Smith is more than just a gifted linotype operator. When a soul-selling contract enters the picture, he must outwit the devil with nothing but a typewriter.\nMeredith is a joy to watch as the cigar-smoking, dapper devil Smith. It\u2019s perhaps one of his most underrated Twilight Zone performances, and easily one of the series\u2019 best \u201cdeal with the devil\u201d fables. It\u2019s full of quoteables like: \u201cYou must be a creditor.\u201d \u201cNo\u2026 not yet, anyway,\u201d and the story cleverly teases its Faustian themes while keeping up an exciting pace. \u201cPrinter\u2019s Devil\u201d might be less famous than other Meredith episodes, but it\u2019s every bit as essential, according to fans.\n6) \u201cThe Late Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank\u201d\nJeff Myrtlebank sits up in his coffin during his own funeral, much to the horror of his rural community. Though he insists he\u2019s fine, his return from the dead raises eyebrows and suspicions. As crops thrive and tempers flare, whispers begin to spread that Jeff may not have come back alone. Is he still the same man they buried, or has something darker taken his place?\nThis episode isn\u2019t universally loved, with some fans writing it off as one of The Twilight Zone\u2019s goofier titles, but others praise its gothic comedy and champion it as a series best. \u201cThe Late Jeff Myrtlebank\u201d even inspired filmmaker Ryan Coogler and his hit vampire flick Sinners, according to an interview with SciFiNow. James Best of Dukes of Hazzard fame plays Myrtlebank with just enough warmth and mystery to keep us intrigued and unsettled. One moment, he\u2019s boyish and charming; the next, you\u2019re almost certain something sinister crawled out of that coffin. The story refrains from over-explaining, leaving some viewers frustrated and others pondering the small-town paranoia for weeks after watching.\n7) \u201cShadow Play\u201d\nAdam Grant insists he\u2019s about to die, and that everyone around him is just a figment of his recurring nightmare. He claims that every time he\u2019s executed, the dream resets, trapping him in an endless loop where no one else realizes they aren\u2019t real. He thinks the court, the witnesses, even the skeptical district attorney, are all caught in his mental purgatory. As the people around him begin to question their own reality, \u201cShadow Play\u201d turns a courtroom drama into a mind-bending psychological thriller.\nWhat sets this one apart is how effectively it uses the idea of endless repetition to create existential dread. It\u2019s a nightmare with no reset button, where roles rotate but the sentence never changes. The racial subtext in \u201cShadow Play\u201d (beginning with two Black men in prison, ending with one as the presiding judge) gets at themes about subconscious social stigmas. Fans have also pointed out a kind of twisted rebirth happening, one that evokes Nietzsche\u2019s eternal return: a world repeating itself endlessly until someone breaks free or gives in. Charles Beaumont\u2019s script is one of the series\u2019 most cerebral, and for those who love the show\u2019s weirder corners, it\u2019s worthy of a rewatch.\n8) \u201cJess-Belle\u201d\nWritten by The Waltons creator Earl Hamner Jr., \u201cJess-Belle\u201d is one of the most polarizing episodes of The Twilight Zone. Set in an Appalachian town, it tells the story of a woman who turns to a backwoods witch to win back her lover, at a terrible cost. Each night, she transforms into a leopard, cursed by the dark magic she invoked. The effects are a little dated, the dialogue is a little cheesy, and the story unfolds like a Southern gothic ballad, complete with a poem instead of the usual closing monologue. For some, this detour into rural melodrama feels overlong, hokey, or unintentionally campy.\nBut for others, \u201cJess-Belle\u201d is a true cult favorite that, while totally absurd, is endlessly captivating. Jeanette Nolan\u2019s performance as Granny Hart is often noted as the standout, but Anne Francis in the title role, playing a woman whose yearning consumes her, is beloved by fans as well. It stands apart from the sci-fi episodes, embracing a folkloric atmosphere. Whether you love its weirdness or find it a misfire, \u201cJess-Belle\u201d earns its place on this list as The Twilight Zone for fans of witchcraft, big cats, and a bit of nonsense.\n9) \u201cI Am the Night\u2014Color Me Black\u201d\nSerling wrote this affecting Season 5 episode late in The Twilight Zone\u2018s run, channeling years of frustration over episodes he\u2019d been forced to soften or censor by the network. Inspired in part by national grief after the assassination of President Kennedy and the ongoing turmoil of the civil rights era, Serling returned to a theme he\u2019d long wanted to explore: how hatred spreads. The story follows a town where the sun refuses to rise on the day of a man\u2019s execution, an unexplained phenomenon that soon covers the globe.\nDespite its historical context, \u201cI Am the Night\u2014Color Me Black\u201d is often overlooked, possibly because it aired near the end of the series and carries a heavy tone. Still, many fans of the show believe it stands as one of The Twilight Zone\u2018s most poignant hours, featuring a moral reckoning that sadly holds up as well today as it did in 1964. Its imagery is unforgettable, and Serling\u2019s closing narration delivers a gut-punch. Few Twilight Zone episodes confront the roots of human cruelty so directly, or so poetically.\n10) \u201cThe Changing of the Guard\u201d\nIn this Season 3 episode, Professor Ellis Fowler, an aging teacher at a boys\u2019 prep school, is forced into retirement after decades of service. Convinced that he\u2019s wasted his life, he falls into despair\u2014until the ghosts of former students appear to remind him of the lives he changed. Through their stories, he comes to understand that his life mattered more than he ever realized.\nIf you teared up during Dead Poets Society, this one will wreck you. In fact, some fans are convinced Dead Poets was inspired by this episode, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Donald Pleasence brings a heartfelt vulnerability to the role, and the message about legacy, purpose, and unseen impact is particularly relatable for educators or anyone who\u2019s ever done a thankless job. The episode builds to a final reveal that recontextualizes a lifetime, and by the end, it\u2019s hard not to get choked up right alongside him. Lists may often overlook it, but longtime fans consider \u201cChanging of the Guard,\u201d written by Serling himself, to be The Twilight Zone\u2019s most uplifting episode.\nThe Twilight Zone is currently streaming on Paramount+.\nWhich overlooked episode is in your top ten?

            "EU trade ministers call Trump&#8217;s 30% tariff &#8216;absolutely unacceptable,&#8217; plan countermeasures. Sam McNeil, Associated Press\nSam McNeil, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nBRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 EU trade ministers agreed Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of 30% tariffs on the European Union was \u201cabsolutely unacceptable,\u201d and they are studying a new set of countermeasures to respond to the move.\nThe ministers met Monday in Brussels following Trump\u2019s surprise announcement over the weekend of such hefty tariffs, which could have repercussions for governments, companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU is America\u2019s biggest business partner and the world\u2019s largest trading bloc.\nREAD MORE: Trump\u2019s tariff blitz produces few trade deals but lots of uncertainty\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the EU\u2019s trade representative in its talks with the U.S., said after the meeting that it was \u201cvery obvious from the discussions today, the 30% is absolutely unacceptable.\u201d\nHe said that the commission was sharing proposals with the 27 member countries \u201cfor the second list of goods accounting of some 72 billion euros ($84 billion) worth of U.S imports. They will now have a chance to discuss it. This does not exhaust our toolbox and every instrument remains on the table.\u201d\nLars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, foreign minister of Denmark, which recently assumed the presidency of the EU, said the ministers vowed to work together in negotiating a trade deal with Washington or agreeing on countermeasures.\n\u201cThe EU remains ready to react and that includes robust and proportionate countermeasures if required and there was a strong, feeling in the room of unity,\u201d Rasmussen told reporters after the meeting.\nThe tariffs, also announced for Mexico, are set to start on Aug. 1 and could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the U.S., and destabilize economies from Portugal to Norway.\nMeanwhile, Brussels decided to suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods scheduled to take effect Monday in hopes of reaching a trade deal with the Trump administration by the end of the month.\nThe \u201ccountermeasures\u201d by the EU, which negotiates trade deals on behalf of its 27 member countries, will be delayed until Aug. 1. Trump\u2019s letter shows \u201cthat we have until the first of August\u201d to negotiate, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday.\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the EU\u2019s trade representative in its talks with the U.S., said negotiations would continue Monday.\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely 100% sure that a negotiated solution is much better than the tension which we might have after the 1st of August,\u201d he told reporters in Brussels on Monday. But he added that \u201cwe must be prepared for all outcomes.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort. Having said that, the current uncertainty caused by unjustified tariffs cannot persist indefinitely and therefore we must prepare for all outcomes, including, if necessary, well-considered proportionate countermeasures to restore the balance in our transit static relationship.\u201d\nThe letters to the EU and Mexico come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade.\nTrump imposed tariffs in April on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, he began sending tariff letters to leaders, but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks.\nIf he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy. The American Chamber of Commerce in the European Union, an influential industry group representing major American corporations in Europe, said the tariffs could \u201cgenerate damaging ripple effects across all sectors of the EU and US economies\u201d and praised the EU\u2019s delay of countermeasures.\nIn the wake of the new tariffs, European leaders largely closed ranks, calling for unity but also a steady hand to not provoke further acrimony.\nJust last week, Europe was cautiously optimistic.\nOfficials told reporters on Friday they weren\u2019t expecting a letter like the one sent Saturday and that a trade deal was to be inked in \u201cthe coming days.\u201d For months, the EU has broadcast that it has strong retaliatory measures ready if talks fail.\nReeling from successive rebukes from Washington, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said Monday the EU is \u201cdoubling down on efforts to open new markets\u201d and pointed to a new economic agreement with Indonesia as one.\nThe EU top brass will visit Beijing fora summit later this month while courting other Pacific nations like South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia, whose prime minister visited Brussels over the weekend to sign a new economic partnership with the EU. It also has mega-deals in the works with Mexico and a trading bloc of South American nations known as Mercosur, and \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d will meet with his counterpart from the United Arab Emirates next week.\nWhile meeting with Indonesia\u2019s president on Sunday, Von der Leyen said that \u201cwhen economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together.\u201d\nYour donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

            "US tariffs on European goods threaten to shake up trade relationship. US tariffs on European goods threaten to shake up trade relationship\nAmerica\u2019s largest trade partner is awaiting word on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on its goods\nFRANKFURT, Germany -- FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 America\u2019s largest trade partner, the European Union, is among the entities awaiting word Monday on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on their goods, a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.\nTrump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations.\nExpressing displeasure the EU's stance in trade talks, however, the president said he would jack up the tariff rate for European exports to 50%. A rate that high could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals much more expensive in the U.S.\nThe EU, whose 27 member nations operate as a single economic bloc, said its leaders hoped to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes.\nHere are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union.\nA lot of money is at stake in the trade talks.\nThe EU's executive commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as \"the most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.\nThe biggest U.S. export to Europe is crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment. Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits.\nTrump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro ($233 billion) trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.\nThe U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.\nBefore Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products.\nBut the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.\nTrump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.\nTrump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations.\n\u201cOn the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. \u201cThey cannot change the way they run the EU\u2019s vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.\u201d\nEconomists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers.\nMercedes-Benz dealers in the US. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo \u201csignificant increases\u201d in coming years.\nSimon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said.\nTrump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside.\nFrance-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company\u2019s annual meeting in April.\nArnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions.\n\u201cIf we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,\u201d Arnault said. \u201cAnd if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.\u201d\nSome forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail. Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.\nGiven the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday\u2019s deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.\nThe most likely outcome of the trade talks is that \u201cthe U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of \u2018retaliatory\u2019 tariffs well beyond 10%,\u201d Schmieding said. \u201cHowever, the road to get there could be rocky.\u201d\nThe U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.\n\u201cWhile Trump might be able to sell such an outcome as a \u2018win\u2019 for him, the ultimate victims of his protectionism would, of course, be mostly the U.S. consumers,\u201d Schmieding said.\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.\u201d\n'Road could be rocky'\nSome forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail.\nWithout a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.\nGiven the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday\u2019s deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.\nThe most likely outcome of the trade talks is that \u201cthe U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of \u2018retaliatory\u2019 tariffs well beyond 10%,\u201d Schmieding said. \u201cHowever, the road to get there could be rocky.\u201d\nThe U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.\n\u201cWhile Trump might be able to sell such an outcome as a \u2018win\u2019 for him, the ultimate victims of his protectionism would, of course, be mostly the U.S. consumers,\u201d Schmieding said."

            "Bangladesh\u2019s ousted Sheikh Hasina charged with crimes against humanity. Bangladesh\u2019s ousted leader Sheikh Hasina has been formally charged with crimes against humanity after being accused of ordering a deadly crackdown against anti-government protests last year that left more than 1,400 people dead.\nHasina, who fled the country on 5 August last year, was charged in absentia by a three-judge panel on Thursday. She remains in hiding in neighbouring India and has ignored formal requests for her to return.\nBangladeshi prosecutors have spent months gathering evidence to bring Hasina to trial for alleged crimes committed during her 15 years in power, including the mass killing of students who rose up against her authoritarian regime in July last year.\nThe panel, called the international crimes tribunal, indicted Hasina, her former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan and the former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah al-Mamun on five charges, including crimes against humanity.\nProsecutors allege that Hasina was the \u201cmastermind, conductor and superior commander\u201d of the targeted violence against student-led protests that erupted across Bangladesh and eventually led to the fall of her government.\nAs widely documented by human rights groups, the police fired live ammunition at protesters across the country, leading to mass casualties, and arbitrarily arrested tens of thousands of civilians in an attempt to crush the uprising.\nLawyers have argued that orders for the killings came directly from Hasina, citing leaked audio files and other documents left behind when she fled the country in a helicopter.\nHasina\u2019s Awami League party condemned the indictment and described the tribunal as a kangaroo court, despite Hasina having established it in 2009 to investigate crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladesh war of independence.\n\u201cWe condemn in strongest term the indictment against our party president and other leaders as we assert that this step marks another testament to the ongoing witch hunt against our party,\u201d the party wrote on X.\nThe tribunal has already issued three arrest warrants for Hasina. It also sentenced her to six months in jail earlier this month for contempt of court after a leaked audio recording emerged of her saying: \u201cThere are 227 cases against me, so I now have a licence to kill 227 people.\u201d\nHasina\u2019s trial for crimes against humanity charges will begin on 3 August. Prosecutors said al-Mamun had already pleaded guilty and had agreed to testify as a state witness against his accomplices.\nIt remains unclear whether Hasina will be forcibly brought back to Bangladesh to face the mounting accusations against her, including widespread corruption. The interim government, led Mohammad Yunus, confirmed it had sent India several extradition requests, but that they had so far been ignored.\nYunus\u2019s government has expressed repeated frustration at India for continuing to give Hasina \u2013 who was closely allied to Delhi while in power \u2013 a safe haven and allowing her to make \u201cfalse statements\u201d intended to destabilise the country.\nYunus has pledged that Bangladesh will have its first election since Hasina\u2019s fall by April 2026, but the Awami League has been banned from taking part.",
            "Bangladesh tribunal indicts ousted Prime Minister Hasina over deaths of protesters. A special tribunal indicted Bangladesh\u2019s ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday by accepting charges of crimes against humanity filed against her in connection with a mass uprising in which hundreds of students were killed last year.\nA three-member panel, headed by Justice Golam Mortuza Mozumder, indicted Hasina, former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan and former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun on five charges. Hasina and Khan are being tried in absentia.\nThe tribunal opened the trial June 5. Authorities published newspaper advertisements asking Hasina, who has been in exile in India, and Khan to appear before the tribunal.\nHasina has been in exile since Aug. 5. Bangladesh\u2019s interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, sent a formal request to India for Hasina\u2019s extradition but India has not responded. Khan is possibly also in India.\nAl-Mamun was arrested and was being held Thursday. Al-Mamun pleaded guilty and told the tribunal that he would make a statement in favor of the prosecution at a later stage.\nAmir Hossain, a lawyer appointed by the state for Hasina and Khan, appeared at Thursday\u2019s hearing and filed a petition to drop their names from the case but the tribunal rejected the plea.\nThe tribunal later fixed Aug. 3 for the opening statement by the prosecution and Aug. 4 for recording witness statements.\nHasina and her Awami League party previously criticized the tribunal and its prosecution team for connections to political parties, especially the Jamaat-e-Islami party.\nFiling five charges, the prosecution argued Hasina was directly responsible for ordering all state forces, her Awami League party and its associates to carry out actions leading to mass killings, injuries, targeted violence against women and children, the incineration of bodies and denial of medical treatment to the wounded.\nThe charges describe Hasina as the \u201cmastermind, conductor, and superior commander\u201d of the atrocities.\nThe interim government already has banned the Awami League party and amended relevant laws to allow the trial of the former ruling party for its role during the uprising.\nIn February, the U.N. human rights office estimated up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks of crackdowns on the student-led protests against Hasina and two weeks after her fall on Aug. 5.\nEarlier this month the tribunal sentenced Hasina to six months in jail after she was found in contempt of court for allegedly claiming she had a license to kill at least 227 people. The sentence was the first in any case against Hasina since she fled to India.\nThe contempt case stemmed from a leaked audio recording of a supposed phone conversation between Hasina and a leader of the student wing of her political party. A person alleged to be Hasina is heard on the audio saying: \u201cThere are 227 cases against me, so I now have a license to kill 227 people.\u201d\nThe tribunal was established by Hasina in 2009 to investigate and try crimes involving Bangladesh\u2019s independence war against Pakistan in 1971. The tribunal under Hasina tried politicians, mostly from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, for their actions during the nine-month war.\nAided by India, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina\u2019s father and the country\u2019s first leader.",

John Yang\nJohn Yang\nClaire Mufson\nClaire Mufson\nLeave your feedback\nThe Gifford Fire in Southern California has reached \u201cmegafire\u201d status, burning an area bigger than Atlanta. Megafires, which burn more than 100,000 acres, have become increasingly common in recent years. A new book, \u201cWhen It All Burns: Fighting Fire in a Transformed World,\u201d is the first-hand account of a season with a team of elite firefighters. John Yang speaks with author Jordan Thomas for more.\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nJohn Yang:\nCalifornia fire officials say a massive wildfire in Southern California has reached mega fire status. Fueled by near 100 degree heat and bone dry conditions, the Gifford fire north of Santa Barbara has already burned more than 104,000 acres. That's an area bigger than Atlanta.\nMega fires, which burned more than 100,000 acres have become increasingly common in recent years, testing the men and women who fight them. A new book, \"When It All Burns: Fighting Fire in a Transformed World\" is the firsthand account of a season with a team of elite firefighters, the Los Padres Hotshots.\nThe author is Jordan Thomas, who's also anthropologist. Jordan Thomas, help us understand what is it like to be on the front lines of a wildfire.\nJordan Thomas, Author, When It All Burns:\nFighting Fire in a Transformed World\": These are some of the largest wildfires that humans have ever encountered in our recorded history. So science is having a hard time even understanding what these wildfires are going to do.\nSo what it's actually like to fight wildfires is you're living on some of the most extreme edges of the climate crisis in triple digit heat, basically mountaineering with chainsaws to remove fuel from the edges of fires. And so it takes an extreme amount of tactical athleticism and a really intense level of knowledge of landscapes and fire behavior as well.\nTalk about that knowledge of landscapes. You've got to be constantly assessing the landscape as you're fighting the fire, right?\nJordan Thomas:\nRight, yeah, exactly. So you have to be paying attention to the vegetation, to the slope of the landscape, and to changes in all these different weather patterns, including the temperature, the humidity and the wind. Because all of these things change what fire does.\nAnd when you're working on the edges of fires, day after day, hour after hour, week after week, any of these changes can put you in extremely dangerous situations.\nThe point you made at the beginning about how these wildfires are different or seem to be different, you write in the book that the recent wildfires have transformed fundamental assumptions about how fireworks. Explain that.\nSo people I've worked with, when they started their career, they may have encountered one megafire in their entire career, but there's multiple megafires burning across the American west now. We fought four during the time I was writing the book. They're becoming common. 18 of the 20 largest wildfires in California's recorded history of burning just the past two decades.\nSo what does that mean? In a fundamental sense it means that we often don't know what these fires are going to do day by day. We don't know what their ecological impacts are going to be, we don't know how they're going to behave. And that sounds dangerous in an abstract sense, but it's also incredibly dangerous for wildland firefighters on the ground.\nFor example, fires, usually, their behavior usually really calms down at night. That's what we've come to expect. In 2020 a wildfire that I was on, it doubled in size overnight after we almost had it contained, and it overtook 15 firefighters and a lot of them were injured. So things with the climate crisis that seem abstract are often matters of life and death for wildland firefighters.\nAnd talk about that effect. The climate crisis, how is the climate crisis affecting this?\nSo you have multiple layers. On a broad layer, you have broad changes in temperature across entire landscapes. It takes more water out of the vegetation, out of the trees, dries them out, makes them more flammable. You have other changes that intersect with that. Like there's less precipitation falling as snow. That means that there's less water running throughout the landscapes and snow melt throughout the year, which means that the lands dry out quicker.\nLayer drought on top of that layer, insect infestations on top of that, you get really sick landscapes. And then you're also way more likely to have intense heat waves. And that just sucks the rest of the moisture out of the landscapes as well. And you get really explosive fire behavior.\nThen when you get these unprecedented heat waves, you know, like 120 degrees, that also makes them way more difficult to suppress, which endangers communities and in the area as well. So, there's multiple layers, but they all intersect with climate change in a really dangerous, explosive situation.\nIn terms of history, in your book you talk about how centuries ago, the indigenous people in California coexisted with fire, lived with fire, but then the white European settlers came in and the focus became on fire suppression. What effect did that have?\nSo it's important to keep in mind when we're talking about this, that California is one of the most fire evolved regions on Earth. Many of the ecosystems and many of the plant species actually rely on fire to reproduce.\nNow indigenous people knew this and lived in California for at least 10,000 years before Europeans arrived. And plants were the basis of indigenous economies. So, indigenous people knew to use fire to shape sorts of plants that they needed.\nAnd this really transformed California's ecosystem. So most of the fire California encountered was actually lit by indigenous people before Europeans arrived.\nSo one of the first acts that Europeans did when they took over the Spanish, they criminalized the use of fire as a way to criminalize indigenous economies.\nNow this was a start of a long history of fire suppression that went from that first criminalization up until the modern day, where we treat fire as an enemy, where we try to put fire out. When you take fire away from landscapes that need it, you make those landscapes sick. You get fuels accumulation in forests. You get insect infestations that you wouldn't otherwise if you were burning. And the culmination of this is you sort of lay the kindling that climate change is really. It's like dropping a match on top of the kindling.\nJordan Thomas, author of \"When It All Burns,\" thank you very much.\nThank you.\nWatch the Full Episode\nJohn Yang is the anchor of PBS News Weekend and a correspondent for the PBS News Hour.

            "Studies reveal hidden deaths and health problems connected to Maui and LA wildfires. Mike Stobbe, Associated Press\nMike Stobbe, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The toll of wildfires is usually counted in acres burnt, property destroyed and lives lost to smoke and flames. But three studies published Wednesday suggest the cost to human health from the Maui and Los Angeles wildfires was substantially higher.\nTwo of the papers explore what happened after the Hawaii fire in August 2023 \u2014 one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires in a century. A third looks at the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year.\nThe Maui fire was directly blamed for more than 100 deaths. But it also left 1 in 5 with lung damage and as many as half with symptoms of depression, the new research found. The month of the fire saw 13 suicide and overdose deaths, translating to nearly double the normal suicide and overdose death rates.\nThe study of the Los Angeles fires concluded that in addition to at least 30 deaths attributed to the fire, more than 400 other deaths could be blamed on the event, due to interruptions in health care and other factors.\nThe studies, published in two American Medical Association journals, add \u201ca really important piece to the understanding of the true health risks from these extreme climatic events,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a University of Wisconsin environmental public health researcher who was not involved in the papers.\nThe results conform with existing understanding of the effects of extreme weather events, some experts said.\nHow to track the indirect impacts of disastrous events has been a continuing subject of academic research and even legislative proposals. There have been estimates of deaths caused by extreme heat, as well as research into the large-scale toll of wildfires driven by climate change.\n\u201cBut this hones in, especially on (specific) fires,\u201d Patz said.\nAn aerial view as smoke rises from burnt areas amidst wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, Aug. 9, 2023, in this screenshot taken from a social media video. Photo by Vince Carter/via REUTERS\nOne of the studies, co-led by Ruben Juarez of the University of Hawaii, looked at more than 1,100 adults six to 14 months after the Maui fire. It found lower lung function in people in areas close to the fire compared with those in lower-exposure areas. Overall, about 22% had below-normal lung function.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stark reminder that wildfires can leave an invisible but lasting scar on respiratory health, long after the flames are gone,\u201d Juarez said, in an email, noting that this Friday marks the two-year anniversary of the fire.\nPatz called the finding \u201can important new contribution.\u201d\nKristie Ebi of the University of Washington echoed that, noting that there is a growing understanding that wildfire smoke can be more toxic than standard air pollution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just leaves and branches and trees\u201d that are burned, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s buildings. It\u2019s gasoline stations. It\u2019s old houses that have asbestos in them. It\u2019s automobiles. There are lots of components of wildfire smoke.\u201d\nWATCH: Senators highlight importance of working across the aisle in mission to fight wildfires\nShe said the study suggests \u201cthis toxicity is affecting people\u2019s long-term lung function.\u201d\nOf course, the researchers don\u2019t know exactly how much smoke each person was exposed to, and other studies would need to be done to explore cause-and-effect, she added.\nThe study also found 40% saying their health had declined since the fires, with close to half talking about increased fatigue and weakness, eye irritation and lung-related symptoms.\nJonathan Purtle of New York University was the lead author of another study, which calculated rates of suicide and overdose deaths in Maui and Hawaii\u2019s four other counties. That research team found a 97% increase in suicides and overdose death rates on Maui during the month of the wildfires. The total number of suicide and overdose deaths was 13 that month \u2014 most of them suicides. That\u2019s a significant increase, Ebi said.\nThey also found a 46% increase in such deaths in all five counties, which may have been influenced by displaced Maui residents migrating to other islands, the authors said.\nThe increases did not last: Rates fells in the following months, the researchers found.\nThe third study was led by researchers in Finland. They used mathematical modeling to estimate that there were 440 more deaths in Los Angeles County from Jan. 5 to Feb. 1 than what would normally have been expected, and said those are related to the fires.\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

            "Canada wildfire season already second worst on record as experts warn of \u2018new reality\u2019. With hundreds of wildfires burning out of control, Canada\u2019s 2025 fire season is already the second-worst on record, as scientists report climate change is prolonging and exacerbating the burning, leading to more destruction, evacuations and smoke-filled skies.\nMore than 470 fires across the country are currently classified as \u201cout of control\u201d, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).\n7,318,421 hectares of land in Canada have burned due to wildfires this year \u2013 close to 78% more than the five-year average of 4,114,516 hectares, according to the CIFFC\u2019s latest data.\nThe 2025 fire season is only behind the explosive 2023 wildfire season, which resulted in an astounding 17,203,625 hectares burned.\n\u201cThis is our new reality\u2026 the warmer it gets, the more fires we see,\u201d said Mike Flannigan, the BC research chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops.\nA June analysis on the 2025 fire season in Canada published by United Nations University in Shibuya, Japan, concluded that the fires are a \u201cstark manifestation\u201d of climate change and that warm, dry weather in the spring resulted in temperatures 2.5C above average.\nThe warmer temperatures extend the fire season and increase the frequency of lightning that sparks fires, said Flannigan. A hotter climate also causes the atmosphere to suck moisture out of fuel, dead vegetation and the forest floor \u2013 creating ideal conditions for fires to start, he explained.\n\u201cIt means more of the material is dried out, is available to burn when the fire does come, it leads to bigger flames, higher intensity, which gets to be difficult to impossible to extinguish,\u201d he said.\nSo far, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which together account for about 60% of the hectares burned so far this year in Canada.\nTens of thousands of people in communities across the country have been evacuated due to the wildfires. In Saskatchewan, the Canadian Red Cross reported it had assisted more than 17,000 people in the province from over 6,700 households to evacuate.\nThirteen communities in north-west Saskatchewan are under an evacuation order, several of which are First Nations, according to the province. One of the most affected areas of this year\u2019s wildfire season in the province is Denare Beach, a north-eastern village that was mostly destroyed in June due to a blaze.\nThe season has also now hit the east coast of Canada, as wildfires are currently raging across Newfoundland and Labrador and several towns are under evacuation orders.\nJohn Abatzoglou, a professor of complex systems management at the University of California, Merced, co-authored the June report from United Nations University.\nAbatzoglou said this year\u2019s fire season is the third year in a row Canada has seen fire activity that is well above average. The fires are also causing widespread smoke to cascade from the country into the United States as well, prompting severe air quality warnings in several states this month, is also an indication of how the fires are hurting populations beyond evacuations.\nIt\u2019s an international element of the fires that officials are having to contend with on a wider scale, Abatzoglou said.\n\u201cThis is a really key point that\u2019s different from other natural hazards and its ability to impact everything from quality of life to \u2026 human health and even mortality,\u201d he said.\nGovernments and public health officials will have to address how to change public behaviour and public policy to contend with \u201csmoke days\u201d, where you have to stay inside, he said.\n\u201cI know communities that may not have great infiltration systems \u2026 so more efforts there to provide resources to communities so that they can be safe indoors during acute smoke periods.\u201d"

The Trump administration has put two repeated targets of President Donald Trump under criminal investigation, although details of what exactly they are being investigated for or how far the Justice Department intends on taking the probes are unclear.\nThe two targets are former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired in his first term, according to a statement that a Justice Department spokesperson provided to reporters.\nFox News reported the existence of the investigations Tuesday evening. After referring to Comey and Brennan, the spokesperson said the Justice Department does \"not comment on ongoing investigations.\"\nA lawyer for Comey had no comment. The FBI declined to comment.\nBrennan, who is a paid contributor to NBC News and MSNBC, appeared on MSNBC's \"Deadline: White House\" with Nicolle Wallace on Wednesday afternoon.\n\"It is hard to believe that here we are 8\u00bd years [after the 2016 presidential election], we\u2019re still going over this ground that has been, I think, fairly well and exhaustively plowed,\" Brennan said. He went on to reiterate what he had previously told NBC News, that he has not been contacted by the Justice Department or the CIA about the investigation.\nBut, he said, \"I think this is, unfortunately, a very sad and tragic example of the continued politicization of the intelligence community, of the national security process, and quite frankly, I\u2019m really shocked that, you know, individuals are willing to sacrifice their reputations, their credibility, their decency to continue to do Donald Trump\u2019s bidding on something that clearly is just politically based.\"\nThe Fox News article was published as both FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi are facing significant blowback from conservative media and influencers over their handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation and material related to it. This week, the Justice Department and the FBI put out a memo restating what prior investigations had already found: that Epstein, a convicted sex offender and financier, killed himself in his jail cell in 2019 and that there was no incriminating evidence against uncharged third parties.\nPatel, before joining the government, engaged with conspiracy theories about Epstein, while a statement from Bondi that an Epstein \"client list\" was sitting on her desk fueled more speculation on the right. Bondi later said she was speaking about documents related to Epstein, not an actual list.\nAs for Brennan, a source briefed on the matter said CIA Director John Ratcliffe had made a criminal referral of Brennan to the Justice Department. Exactly what prompted the Comey investigation is unclear.\nRatcliffe last week released an internal CIA review that criticized Brennan\u2019s handling of a 2017 intelligence assessment concluding that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\nAny conduct that took place during that campaign or even in most of Trump\u2019s first term is now outside the typical five-year statute of limitations for federal crimes. The Fox News article mentions testimony that Brennan gave to the House Judiciary Committee in May 2023 about the so-called Steele Dossier that was an issue during the 2016 campaign. It cites no specific conduct from Comey during the past five years.\nA special counsel appointed by then-Attorney General William Barr spent years investigating how the 2017 intelligence assessment was put together, requiring many CIA officials to hire lawyers. That special counsel, John Durham, also used a grand jury to scrutinize the actions of Brennan, Comey and many who worked for them over how the FBI and the CIA handled investigations into Russia\u2019s effort to interfere in the 2016 election. But Durham did not charge the two former leaders or accuse them of wrongdoing. His sole charge against a public official came against a low-level FBI lawyer who had lied on a warrant application.\nThe Trump administration has been taking action against people involved in investigations of the president and his supporters. The Justice Department has a \"Weaponization Working Group\" that is examining those investigations, and many who worked on them and were still in the department have been fired. And on his first day in office, Trump pardoned his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
            "The notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump. A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nFormer President Donald Trump has been campaigning in between his many different court appearances for much of the year.\nBut his decision to attend the first day of his $250 million civil fraud trial in New York created another opportunity to appear on camera from inside a courtroom when the judge allowed photographers to document the moment before proceedings got underway.\nKeeping track of the dizzying array of civil and criminal cases is a full-time job.\nHe is charged with crimes related to conduct:\nBefore his presidency \u2013 a hush money scheme that may have helped him win the White House in 2016.\n-\nDuring his presidency \u2013 his effort to stay in the White House by overturning the 2020 election.\n-\nAfter his presidency \u2013 his treatment of classified material and alleged attempts to hide it from the National Archives.\n-\nTrump denies any wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty in all of the criminal cases. He alleges a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. But each trial has its own distinct storyline to follow.\nHere\u2019s an updated list of developments in Trump\u2019s very complicated set of court cases, beginning with the one playing out in Manhattan this week.\nNew York state civil court: $250 million fraud case\nThe civil fraud trial, unlike Trump\u2019s multiple criminal indictments, does not carry the danger of a felony conviction and jail time, but it could very well cost him some of his most prized possessions, including Trump Tower.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James brought the $250 million lawsuit in September 2022, alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\nJudge Arthur Engoron has already ruled that Trump and his adult sons are liable for fraud for inflating the value of his golf courses, hotels and homes on financial statements to secure loans.\nThe trial portion of the case, playing out in court in Manhattan, will assess what damages will be levied against Trump and how Engoron\u2019s decision to strip Trump of his New York business licenses will play out.\nFederal civil court in New York: E. Jean Carroll defamation lawsuit\nIn May, a federal jury in Manhattan found Trump sexually abused former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in the mid-1990s and awarded her about $5 million.\nA separate civil defamation lawsuit will only need to decide how much money Trump has to pay her. That case for January 15 \u2013 the same day Iowa Republicans will hold their caucuses, the first date on the presidential primary calendar.\nFederal criminal court in DC: 2020 election Interference\nIn August, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigation into the aftermath of the 2020 election. The former president was arraigned in a Washington, DC, courtroom, where he pleaded not guilty.\nThe case is based in part on a scheme to create slates of fake electors in key states won by President Joe Biden.\nIn late September, Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Trump\u2019s request that she recuse herself from the case. Chutkan, a Barack Obama appointee, has overseen civil and criminal cases related to the January 6, 2021, insurrection and has repeatedly exceeded what prosecutors have requested for convicted rioters\u2019 prison sentences.\nChutkan set the trial\u2019s start date for March 4, 2024, the day before Super Tuesday, when the largest batch of presidential primaries will occur. The trial marks the first of Trump\u2019s criminal cases expected to proceed.\nNew York criminal court: Hush money payments\nTrump has been charged in Manhattan criminal court with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels late in the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe former president pleaded not guilty at his April arraignment in Manhattan.\nProsecutors, led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, accuse Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal $130,000 in payments to Daniels made by former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to guarantee her silence about an alleged affair.\nTrump has denied having an affair with Daniels.\nThe trial was originally scheduled to begin in late March 2024, but Judge Juan Merchan has suggested the date could move. The next court date is scheduled for February.\nGeorgia criminal court: Efforts to overturn election results\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is using racketeering violations to charge a broad criminal conspiracy against Trump and 18 others in their efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia.\nThe probe was launched in 2021 following Trump\u2019s call that January with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which the president pushed the Republican official to \u201cfind\u201d votes to overturn the election results.\nThe August indictment also includes how Trump\u2019s team allegedly misled state officials in Georgia; organized fake electors; harassed an election worker; and breached election equipment in rural Coffee County, Georgia.\nOne co-defendant, bail bondsman Scott Hall, has pleaded guilty to five counts in the case.\nFulton County prosecutors have signaled they could offer plea deals to other co-defendants.\nWillis this week issued a subpoena to former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, a Trump ally, who in turn demanded an immunity deal in exchange for testimony.\nTrial for two co-defendants is expected to begin this month and could last three to five months. A trial date has not been set for Trump, who has pleaded not guilty.\nFederal criminal court in Florida: Mishandling classified material\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 37 federal charges brought by Smith over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Smith added three additional counts in a superseding indictment.\nThe investigation centers on sensitive documents that Trump brought to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida after his White House term ended in January 2021.\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records.\nTrump was also caught on tape in a 2021 meeting in Bedminster, New Jersey, where the former president discussed holding secret documents he did not declassify.\nSmith\u2019s additional charges allege that Trump and his employees attempted to delete Mar-a-Lago security footage sought by the grand jury investigating the mishandling of the records.\nTrial is not expected until May, after most presidential primaries have concluded.\nThere are other cases to note:\nTrump Organization: Convicted of criminal tax fraud\nTrump\u2019s namesake business, the Trump Organization, was convicted in December by a New York jury of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors say was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.\nManhattan prosecutors told a jury the case was about \u201cgreed and cheating,\u201d laying out a scheme within the Trump Organization to pay high-level executives in perks such as luxury cars and apartments without paying taxes on them.\nFormer Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to his role in the tax scheme. He was released after serving four months in jail at Rikers Island.\nJanuary 6: Lawsuits by police officers\nSeveral members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police are suing Trump, saying his words and actions incited the 2021 riot.\nThe various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating Washington laws that prohibit the incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.\nIn August, Trump requested to put on hold the lawsuit related to the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, citing his various criminal trials. The estate of Sicknick, who died after responding to the attack on the Capitol, is suing two rioters involved in the attack and Trump for his alleged role in egging it on.\nOther lawsuits have been put on hold while a federal appeals court considers whether Trump had absolute immunity as the sitting president.\nPersonal retaliation: Peter Strzok lawsuit\nFormer top FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, who was fired in 2018 after the revelation that he criticized Trump in text messages, sued the Justice Department, alleging he was terminated improperly.\nIn summer 2017, former special counsel Robert Mueller removed Strzok from his team investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election after an internal investigation revealed texts with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page that could be read as exhibiting political bias.\nStrzok and Page were constant targets of verbal attacks by Trump and his allies, part of the larger ire the then-president expressed toward the FBI during the Russia investigation. Trump repeatedly and publicly called for Strzok\u2019s ouster until he was fired in August 2018.\nTrump is set to be deposed this month as part of the case, according to Politico.\nTrump lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, Democrats, ex-FBI officials is dismissed\nA federal judge dismissed Trump\u2019s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, several ex-FBI officials and more than two dozen other people and entities that he claims conspired to undermine his 2016 campaign with fabricated information tying him to Russia.\n\u201cWhat (Trump\u2019s lawsuit) lacks in substance and legal support it seeks to substitute with length, hyperbole, and the settling of scores and grievances,\u201d US District Judge Donald Middlebrooks wrote.\nTrump appealed the decision, but Middlebrooks also ruled that the former president and his attorneys are liable for nearly $1 million in sanctions for bringing the case.\nTrump launched a Hail Mary bid in July to revive the sprawling lawsuit, relying on a recent report from special counsel John Durham that criticized the FBI\u2019s Trump-Russia probe.\nTrump victory in Michael Cohen\u2019s retaliation suit\nTrump\u2019s former lawyer Cohen sued Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and others, alleging they put him back in jail to prevent him from promoting his upcoming book while under home confinement.\nCohen was serving the remainder of his sentence for lying to Congress and campaign violations at home, due to Covid-19 concerns, when he started an anti-Trump social media campaign in summer 2020. Cohen said that he was sent back to prison in retaliation and that he spent 16 days in solitary confinement.\nA federal judge threw out the lawsuit in November. District Judge Lewis Liman said he was empathetic to Cohen\u2019s position but that Supreme Court precedent bars him from allowing the case to move forward.\nTrump-filed lawsuits: Bob Woodward\nTrump sued journalist Bob Woodward in January for alleged copyright violations, claiming Woodward released audio from their interviews without Trump\u2019s consent.\nWoodward and publisher Simon & Schuster said Trump\u2019s case is without merit and moved for its dismissal.\nWoodward conducted several interviews with Trump for his book \u201cRage,\u201d published in September 2020. Woodward later released \u201cThe Trump Tapes,\u201d an audiobook featuring eight hours of raw interviews with Trump interspersed with the author\u2019s commentary.\nTrump-filed lawsuits: The New York Times, Mary Trump and CNN\nA federal judge in Florida dismissed Trump\u2019s $475 million lawsuit against CNN that accused the network of defaming him by using the phrase \u201cBig Lie\u201d and allegedly comparing him to Adolf Hitler.\nA New York judge dismissed The New York Times from Trump\u2019s lawsuit regarding disclosure of his tax returns and ordered Trump to pay the newspaper\u2019s legal fees. Trump is still suing his niece Mary Trump for disclosure of the tax documents. She had tried to sue him for defrauding her out of millions after the death of his father, but the suit was dismissed.\nCNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Tierney Sneed, Katelyn Polantz and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",
            "Obama officials admitted they had no 'empirical evidence' of Trump-Russia collusion: House Intel transcripts. Obama-era intelligence officials acknowledged that they had no \"empirical evidence\" of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election, but continued to publicly push the \"narrative\" of collusion.\nThe House Intelligence Committee, in 2017, conducted depositions of top Obama intelligence officials, including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, national security advisor Susan Rice and Attorney General Loretta Lynch, among others.\nFLASHBACK: HOUSE INTEL TRANSCRIPTS SHOW TOP OBAMA OFFICIALS HAD NO 'EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE' OF TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION\nThe officials\u2019 responses in the transcripts of those interviews align with the results of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2013 which found no evidence of criminal coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016, while not reaching a determination on obstruction of justice.\nTheir testimony has come back into the spotlight amid revelations that former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey are under criminal investigation for potential wrongdoing related to the Trump\u2013Russia probe, including allegedly making false statements to Congress, Justice Department sources exclusively told Fox News Digital.\nThe transcripts, from 2017 and 2018, revealed top Obama officials were questioned by House Intelligence Committee lawmakers and investigators about whether they had or had seen evidence of such collusion, coordination or conspiracy \u2013 the issue that drove the FBI's initial case and later the special counsel probe.\n\"I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting/conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election,\" Clapper testified in 2017. \"That\u2019s not to say that there weren\u2019t concerns about the evidence we were seeing, anecdotal evidence.... But I do not recall any instance where I had direct evidence.\"\nLynch also said she did \"not recall that being briefed up to me.\"\n\"I can't say that it existed or not,\" Lynch said, referring to evidence of collusion, conspiracy or coordination.\nBut Clapper and Lynch, and Vice President Joe Biden, were present in the Oval Office on July 28, 2016, when Brennan briefed Obama and Comey on intelligence he\u2019d received from one of Hillary Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisors \"to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\"\nKEY PLAYERS IN ORIGINS OF TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE\n\"We\u2019re getting additional insight into Russian activities from (REDACTED),\" Brennan\u2019s handwritten notes, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital in October 2020, read. \"CITE (summarizing) alleged approved by Hillary Clinton a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\"\nAfter that briefing, the CIA properly forwarded that information through a Counterintelligence Operational Lead (CIOL) to Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, with the subject line: \"Crossfire Hurricane.\"\nFox News Digital exclusively obtained and reported on the CIOL in October 2020, which stated: \"The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate.\"\n\"Per FBI verbal request, CIA provides the below examples of information the CROSSFIRE HURRICANE fusion cell has gleaned to date,\" the memo continued. \"An exchange (REDACTED) discussing US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s approval of a plan concerning US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering US elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.\"\nThe FBI did not open an investigation into the matter, and instead, continued with its counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign.\nDays after the Brennan meeting to brief Obama, Biden, Comey, Clapper and Lynch on July 31, 2016, the FBI opened the original Trump\u2013Russia investigation, which was referred to inside the bureau as \"Crossfire Hurricane.\"\nMeanwhile, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, according to the transcript of her interview to the House Intelligence Committee, was asked whether she had or saw any evidence of collusion or conspiracy.\nPower replied: \"I am not in possession of anything \u2013 I am not in possession and didn\u2019t read or absorb information that came from out of the intelligence community.\"\nWhen asked again, she said: \"I am not.\"\nObama national security advisor Susan Rice was asked the same question.\n\"To the best of my recollection, there wasn\u2019t anything smoking, but there were some things that gave me pause,\" she said, according to her transcribed interview, in response to whether she had any evidence of conspiracy. \"I don\u2019t recall intelligence that I would consider evidence to that effect that I saw\u2026 conspiracy prior to my departure.\"\nWhen asked whether she had any evidence of \"coordination,\" Rice replied: \"I don\u2019t recall any intelligence or evidence to that effect.\"\nWhen asked about collusion, Rice replied: \"Same answer.\"\nFormer deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes was asked the same question during his House Intelligence interview.\nOBAMA OFFICIALS USED DOSSIER TO PROBE, BRIEF TRUMP DESPITE KNOWING IT WAS UNVERIFIED 'INTERNET RUMOR'\n\"I wouldn\u2019t have received any information on any criminal or counterintelligence investigations into what the Trump campaign was doing, so I would not have seen that information,\" Rhodes said.\nWhen pressed again, he said: \"I saw indications of potential coordination, but I did not see, you know, the specific evidence of the actions of the Trump campaign.\"\nMeanwhile, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was not asked that specific question but rather questions about the accuracy and legitimacy of the unverified anti-Trump dossier compiled by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.\nMcCabe was asked during his interview in 2017 what was the most \"damning or important piece of evidence in the dossier that\" he \"now knows is true.\"\nMcCabe replied: \"We have not been able to prove the accuracy of all the information.\"\n\"You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not?\" a House investigator asked, to which McCabe replied: \"That\u2019s correct.\"\n\u2018Narrative consistency\u2019\nAfter Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and during the presidential transition period, Comey briefed Trump on the now-infamous anti-Trump dossier, containing salacious allegations of purported coordination between Trump and the Russian government. Brennan was present for that briefing, which took place at Trump Tower in New York City in January 2017.\nThe dossier was authored by Steele. It was funded by Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the law firm Perkins Coie.\nBut Brennan and Comey knew of intelligence suggesting Clinton, during the campaign, was stirring up a plan to tie Trump to Russia, documents claim. It is unclear whether the intelligence community, at the time, knew that the dossier was paid for by Clinton and the DNC.\nFBI LAUNCHES CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OF JOHN BRENNAN, JAMES COMEY: DOJ SOURCES\nBut the false statements portion of the new investigation into Brennan and Comey stems from a newly declassified email to Brennan from the former deputy CIA director in December 2016, which said that including the dossier in the ICA in any capacity jeopardized \"the credibility of the entire paper.\"\n\"Despite these objections, Brennan showed a preference for narrative consistency over analytical soundness,\" the new CIA review stated. \"When confronted with specific flaws in the Dossier by the two mission center leaders \u2013 one with extensive operational experience and the other with a strong analytic background \u2013 he appeared more swayed by the Dossier's general conformity with existing theories than by legitimate tradecraft concerns.\"\nThe review added: \"Brennan ultimately formalized his position in writing, stating that \u2018my bottomline is that I believe that the information warrants inclusion in the report.\u2019\"\nBut Brennan testified the opposite before the House Judiciary Committee in May 2023.\n\"The CIA was very much opposed to having any reference or inclusion of the Steele dossier in the Intelligence Community Assessment,\" Brennan testified before the committee, according to the transcript of his deposition reviewed by Fox News Digital. \"And so they sent over a copy of the dossier to say that this was going to be separate from the rest of that assessment.\"\nCIA officials at the time of its creation pushed back against the FBI, which sought to include the dossier, arguing that the dossier should not be included in the assessment, and casting it as simply \"internet rumor.\"\nUltimately, Steele\u2019s reporting was not included in the body of the final ICA prepared for then-President Barack Obama, but instead detailed in this footnote, \"largely at the insistence of FBI\u2019s senior leadership,\" according to a review by the Justice Department inspector general, and later, the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nBut in June 2020, Ratcliffe, while serving as director of national intelligence, declassified a footnote of the 2017 ICA, which revealed that the reporting of Trump dossier author Steele only had \"limited corroboration\" regarding whether then-President-elect Trump \"knowingly worked with Russian officials to bolster his chances of beating\" Hillary Clinton and other claims.\nEX-OBAMA INTEL BOSS WANTED ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER INCLUDED IN 'ATYPICAL' 2016 ASSESSMENT DESPITE PUSHBACK\nThe footnote, also known as \"Annex A\" of the 2017 ICA, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital in June 2020, spanned less than two pages and detailed reporting by Steele \u2013 a document that helped serve as the basis for controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants obtained against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\nThe footnote made clear the internal concerns officials had over that document.\n\"An FBI source (Steele) using both identified and unidentified subsources, volunteered highly politically sensitive information from the summer to the fall of 2016 on Russian influence efforts aimed at the US presidential election,\" the annex read. \"We have only limited corroboration of the source\u2019s reporting in this case and did not use it to reach the analytic conclusions of the CIA/FBI/NSA assessment.\"\n\"The source collected this information on behalf of private clients and was not compensated for it by the FBI,\" it continued.\nBut the annex notes that Steele's reporting was \"not developed by the layered subsource network.\"\n\"The FBI source caveated that, although similar to previously provided reporting in terms of content, the source was unable to vouch for the additional information's sourcing and accuracy,\" the annex states. \"Hence this information is not included in this product.\"\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz also reviewed the inclusion of Steele\u2019s reporting in the ICA during his review of alleged misconduct related to FISA.\nTRUMP SAYS BRENNAN, COMEY 'CROOKED AS HELL' AMID FBI PROBE, MAY HAVE TO 'PAY THE PRICE'\nHis report, released in late 2019, found that there were \"significant inaccuracies and omissions\" in FISA warrants for former Trump campaign aide Page. Those warrants relied heavily on Steele\u2019s reporting, despite the FBI not having had specific information corroborating allegations against Page that were included in Steele\u2019s reporting.\nRatcliffe referred evidence of wrongdoing by Brennan to FBI Director Kash Patel for potential prosecution, DOJ sources told Fox News Digital.\nThe sources said the referral was received and told Fox News Digital that a criminal investigation into Brennan was opened and is underway. DOJ sources declined to provide further details. It is unclear, at this point, if the investigation spans beyond his alleged false statements to Congress.\nAs for Comey, DOJ sources told Fox News Digital that an investigation into the former director is underway, but could not share details of what specifically is being probed.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe full scope of the criminal investigations into Brennan and Comey is unclear, but two sources described the FBI's view of the duo's interactions as a \"conspiracy,\" which could open up a wide range of potential prosecutorial options.\nThe FBI and CIA declined to comment.\nNeither Brennan nor Comey immediately responded to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment."

            "PruittHealth reduces readmissions, boosts patient outcomes with help from AI. PruittHealth provides skilled-nursing, rehab, home health and other services throughout the southeast. It has always prioritized top-notch resident outcomes.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHowever, like many healthcare organizations, it faced growing challenges in managing patient acuity and preventing unnecessary hospitalizations \u2013 especially amidst ongoing staffing shortages.\nWhile it had clinical processes in place, pulling together the right data at the right time was time-consuming. Staff were relying heavily on manual methods to identify which residents were at the highest risk and determine what actions were needed. This limited the ability to proactively intervene early and drained resources.\nThe organization had determined it needed a tool that could give staff real-time visibility into clinical risks, help frontline staff prioritize residents who needed attention and support better decision making. It wasn't just about having data \u2013 it was about having meaningful insights staff could act on quickly.\nPROPOSAL\nAs PruittHealth staff evaluated potential systems, they looked at options within the technology they already were using, including MatrixCare, the EHR platform across their skilled nursing, senior living, home health and hospice services. That's when they came across that vendor's Clinical Advanced Insights (CAI), an artificial intelligence-driven tool that identifies subtle changes in resident condition and flags potential risks early so teams can take action before a situation escalates.\n\"CAI gives our teams access to real-time, AI-powered data that highlights clinical risk patterns like falls, rehospitalization risk and changes in activities in daily living,\" said Keita Devero, vice president, HCC regulatory and quality improvement, at PruittHealth. \"It brings those insights into a single view so our teams can focus on the residents who need the most attention.\n\"For example, CAI provides us with an acuity-level report that identifies the top 10 residents most at risk for hospitalization,\" she continued. \"This allows us to focus our efforts during clinical meetings, rounds and huddles on the residents who truly need proactive care planning. The goal isn't just to flag problems \u2013 it's to help us understand the 'why' behind the data, so we can have more meaningful discussions and take more targeted actions.\"\nMEETING THE CHALLENGE\nStaff started by integrating CAI into their weekly clinical risk meetings and top 10 rounding processes. Senior nurse consultants were key to driving adoption. They didn't just tell people to use the tool, they went on-site, sat in on meetings and walked staff through the reports. The organization also included administrators, directors of health services and therapists to ensure alignment across the interdisciplinary team.\n\"One of our most effective practices was conducting 'top 10 rounds' based on the CAI acuity reports,\" Devero noted. \"We'd ask: Why are these residents on the list? What are we doing for them? Are there changes in condition we need to act on today? Over time, we brought those insights into shift huddles and even floor-level conversations with CNAs and nurses.\"\nFor example, if one resident was showing signs of risk, staff would talk it through together: What are you seeing? Has their appetite changed? Are they more fatigued?\n\"The tool has become part of our everyday practice,\" she said. \"We even incorporated CAI insights into discharge planning and documentation, which helps justify continued therapy when needed, backed by objective data.\"\nRESULTS\nThe most measurable success from this AI-driven tool has been a reduction in the rehospitalization rate. This reduction reflects fewer disruptions for residents, better continuity of care and stronger outcomes across the board, Devero reported.\n\"We've also made progress in early identification of ADL declines,\" she said. \"By using the tool's insights to flag residents whose functional status is changing, we've been able to engage therapy sooner, involve restorative aides and reduce the risk of further deterioration.\n\"On falls, we're beginning to see movement in the right direction as well,\" she continued. \"CAI has helped us identify contributing risk factors early on, which allows us to bring therapy into the conversation sooner. That kind of early collaboration is helping us strengthen our fall prevention efforts and drive better outcomes over time.\"\nA new study in the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, separate from PruittHealth, has found that CAI-enabled sites achieved significantly better performance on 16 of 18 quality measures. This includes a 59% greater reduction in residents with depressive symptoms, 22% greater reduction in residents needing help with daily activities, and 9% greater reduction in major falls.\nADVICE FOR OTHERS\nStart with a plan to embed this type of technology into the culture of a healthcare organization, not just into workflow, Devero advised.\n\"The technology is powerful, but it only works if your team knows how to use it and understands why it matters,\" she continued. \"That means involving frontline staff early, training them on what the reports mean, and showing them how it makes their job easier and does not mean additional steps.\n\"Also, be intentional about who's responsible for using the insights,\" she added. \"In our case, senior nurse consultants were instrumental in championing the tool and building buy-in. It's not just for clinical leaders. Everyone from the administrator to the CNA should understand how this data helps us deliver better care.\"\nEspecially with ongoing staffing challenges, tools that surface real-time clinical risks and guide care planning have become essential, she said.\n\"They help care teams stay focused on what matters most, think critically and work more efficiently,\" she concluded. \"AI-powered insights have helped us do exactly that.\"\nFollow Bill's health IT coverage on LinkedIn: Bill Siwicki\nEmail him: [email protected]\nHealthcare IT News is a HIMSS Media publication.\nWATCH NOW: How can an IT exec become a Chief AI Officer \u2013 and then work with the C-suite",
            "STAT+: The Medicare Advantage research machine. This is the online version of STAT\u2019s weekly email newsletter Health Care Inc. Sign up here.\nHello! This newsletter started in July 2022, and now here we are, more than three years later. It\u2019s wild how much has changed in health care, and yet, there hasn\u2019t been any real change to the broader system. Anyway, we\u2019ve got a new story on UnitedHealth Group \u2014 no better time to get half off a STAT subscription. If you\u2019re looking for something free, the tipline is always there: [email protected].\nUnitedHealth\u2019s conclusions \u2018baked through\u2019 research\nThis past May, I went to a conference hosted by America\u2019s Physician Groups in San Diego. It had a real celebration vibe \u2014 topped off with lobster tail and a luau.\nAt the conference, APG\u2019s CEO, Susan Dentzer, and a researcher at UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Optum, Ken Cohen, touted work that was published in peer-reviewed journals as proof that a different way of doing business in Medicare Advantage was keeping older Americans healthier.\nBut a closer inspection of those studies and other papers reveals reasons to distrust the narrative. Those works are part of a research apparatus used by UnitedHealth and a web of business partners and lobbyists to bend the debate over Medicare Advantage in their favor.\nMy colleagues Casey Ross, Tara Bannow, Lizzy Lawrence, and I spoke with more than a dozen leading health policy experts to assess the methodology and conclusions behind a cluster of studies produced by UnitedHealth and industry groups. The studies consistently documented Medicare Advantage\u2019s benefits, but the expert reviewers found the conclusions to be overstated and often based on proprietary datasets. The studies seemed to seek out a desired conclusion that would benefit UnitedHealth and others \u2014 rather than search for the truth about the program\u2019s costs and outcomes for patients.\nWe spent the past several months reading these studies, talking with researchers, and observing how the work is being portrayed to regulators, lawmakers, and even investors.\nWhat\u2019s the end goal? Staving off reforms of the $550 billion Medicare Advantage program, which has increasingly garnered scrutiny over concerns that insurers and medical providers are gaming the payment system. Read more from us here.\nThe home health heavyweight\nUnitedHealth is officially about to become one of the largest home health providers in the country.\nThe company and the Department of Justice agreed to a settlement allowing UnitedHealth to move forward with its $3.3 billion takeover of Amedisys. The stipulation: UnitedHealth and Amedisys have to sell 164 home health and hospice locations in 19 states, Tara reports. That, among other conditions, appears to be enough to satisfy antitrust regulators, who called the deal \u201cpresumptively anticompetitive and illegal\u201d last November. Read more.\nJust as UnitedHealth expands this part of its care operations, Democratic lawmakers are probing a different part. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon launched an investigation that seeks answers about how UnitedHealth has managed the care of nursing home patients. Tara has more on that as well.\nA RADV non-update update\nIt\u2019s been almost three months since the Trump administration said it was going to expedite contentious audits that examine the coding practices of Medicare Advantage plans. I asked CMS for an update. The agency shared very little new information.\nAmong the burning questions: What kind of \u201cadvanced\u201d technologies will CMS use to conduct these audits? Artificial intelligence? \u201cWhile artificial intelligence and other analytical tools are under review for potential use, no formal decisions have been made regarding specific systems or platforms at this time,\u201d CMS spokesperson Catalina Carrasco said in a statement.\nWhat progress has the agency made toward hiring 2,000 coders to carry out this work? \u201cDiscussions regarding the scope and source of additional coder support are ongoing,\u201d Carrasco\u2019s statement said.\nCMS recently announced audits that would cover MA plans sold in 2019. \u201cTo date, MA organizations have been responsive, and CMS will continue to work with them to ensure the timely submission of medical records necessary to support audit activities,\u201d per the statement. But Humana\u2019s lawsuit alleging these audits are unlawful remains an open question \u2014 putting this entire effort in jeopardy.\nPretty please, or else\nHealth care companies don\u2019t want more regulations. So the Trump administration is giving them a choice: Do what it wants and make the right pledges, or face the consequences, my colleagues Daniel Payne, Chelsea Cirruzzo, and Sarah Todd report.\n\u201cThe strategy represents a historic expansion of presidential power \u2014 and changes the calculus for companies fearful of multifaceted, prolonged, and potentially disruptive legal or regulatory battles. On the other hand, relying on the voluntary approach could also give firms the option of rolling back their commitments when Trump leaves office, or the national mood shifts,\u201d Daniel, Chelsea, and Sarah write.\nRead more from them, including when this has worked (artificial food dyes and gender-affirming care) and when it hasn\u2019t (drug pricing).\nIndustry odds and ends\nFrom the annals of corporate influence over important health care policy: Sarepta Therapeutics hired a Trump-connected lobbying firm after the death of a teenage boy who was treated with the company\u2019s Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, my colleague John Wilkerson reports.\n-\nMeanwhile, a wound care company called Extremity Care donated $5 million to President Trump\u2019s super PAC in February \u2014 two months later, the Trump administration delayed a coverage rule that would have cracked down on the use of Extremity Care\u2019s expensive products, independent journalist Judd Legum reports.\n-\nLast week, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. halted federal funding on mRNA vaccines, the same ones that got the world out of the Covid-19 pandemic. My colleague Helen Branswell writes: \u201cVaccine experts and people steeped in pandemic preparedness expressed horror at the news, which they suggested would leave the United States without substantial supplies of vaccines for months longer than peer countries at the start of the next pandemic.\u201d\n-\nThe Obamacare marketplaces are on very shaky financial, and political, ground. Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is ready to oppose the premium rate increases proposed by the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act health plans, Bloomberg reports.\n-\nMeanwhile, executives at Ardent Health won\u2019t lose any sleep if they feel like they have to go out-of-network with ACA plans, Dave Muoio of Fierce Healthcare reports.\n-\nDrug companies are losing all of their attempts to derail Medicare\u2019s drug negotiation program in federal district and circuit courts.

            "How weather conditions set the stage for the deadly Texas flash floods. How weather conditions set the stage for the deadly Texas flash floods\nMeteorologists say incredible amounts of moisture in the air fueled a storm that moved slowly over central Texas, creating conditions for fatal flash floods\nWASHINGTON -- Incredible amounts of moisture in the air fueled a storm that moved slowly and dumped rain over central Texas, creating conditions for fatal flash floods in the early morning hours when it was easy to catch people by surprise, meteorologists said.\nMore than 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain fell in the Texas Hill Country over a span of several hours early Friday, causing water levels to quickly rise, according to the weather forecasting company AccuWeather. The area is naturally prone to flash flooding, but this was an especially bad storm that hit during the vulnerable overnight hours, experts said. Dozens of deaths have been reported along with numerous rescues.\nMeteorologists said that an atmosphere warmed by human-caused climate change can hold more moisture and allow bad storms to dump more rain, though it\u2019s hard to connect specific storms to a warming planet so soon after they occur.\n\u201cIn a warming climate we know that the atmosphere has more moisture to give, to hold on to and then to release. But also the thing that we know about climate change is that our rain events are not as uniform as what they used to be,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist with Climate Central. \u201cSo, you\u2019ll get these big rain events happening in localized areas, tapping into the historic level of moisture in the atmosphere.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, flash flooding driven by bursts of heavy rain turned deadly elsewhere in Texas and in West Virginia. In San Antonio in June, more than 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain fell over a span of hours, prompting dozens of rescues from the fast-rising floodwaters and killing at least 13. And in West Virginia that month, at least nine people died when as much as 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain fell within 40 minutes and caused flash flooding in the Wheeling area.\nRobert Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Yale Climate Connections, said this latest Texas rain storm was roughly a once-in-a-generation event. It fell in the Texas Hill Country where water quickly shoots down rugged hills into narrow river basins that swell quickly.\n\u201cAs is often the case with the worst disasters, many things came together in a terrible way.\u201d Henson said.\nPlus, the area had been in a drought, so the water ran down the dry, hard land fast. That made it more dangerous for children attending camp.\n\u201cA sudden surge of rain like that is going to have a harder time getting absorbed,\u201d said Brett Anderson, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather. \u201cIt just runs right off of it. It\u2019s like concrete.\u201d\nThe sheer amount of rain was overwhelming. Former NOAA chief scientist Ryan Maue, a private meteorologist, calculated Saturday morning that the storm had dropped 120 billion gallons of water on Kerr County, which received the brunt of the storm.\nMoisture fueled the storm from many directions. Tropical Storm Barry formed briefly last weekend, moving over Mexico and then its remnants continued up into Texas. But the jet stream, a current of air that moves weather patterns, wasn\u2019t there to push that moisture away.\n\u201cNormally weather systems and the remnants of tropical systems will get picked up by the jet stream, and that\u2019s just not over Texas currently,\u201d said Winkley, the Climate Central meteorologist. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a weather system without a road to get away from the Lone Star State.\u201d\nThe warm water of the Gulf fueled the moist atmosphere. Even more moisture came from areas over the Pacific Ocean to the west. The combination gave the storm plenty of fuel once it got started.\nWinkley said in the area that flooded, climate change might mean that rain storms are less common, but when they do occur they can be more severe.\nGenerally a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, creating conditions for storms to drop more rain.\n\u201cWith climate change we have a warming atmosphere. A warmer atmosphere holds a lot more moisture, and we are seeing obviously much more total atmospheric moisture across the globe in recent years than we normally have,\u201d said Anderson, the AccuWeather meteorologist.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

            "&#8216;What is happening?&#8217; Milwaukee area recovers from record rain and flooding. Scott Bauer, Associated Press\nScott Bauer, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 The Milwaukee area began drying out Monday after weekend rain hit unofficial records in Wisconsin of more than 14 inches (36 centimeters) in less than 24 hours, leading multiple rivers to flood at record-high levels, washing out vehicles, flooding basements and cutting power to thousands of homes.\nNo fatalities had been reported as of Monday morning from the storms that began Saturday night and stretched into Sunday. Road closures were more isolated Monday as flood warnings continued in Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee counties. About 2,000 homes in the area remained without power as of Monday afternoon.\nResidents couldn\u2019t believe what they saw as rains pounded the area Saturday night.\nColby McMillan and a friend were driving home around 11 p.m. in Milwaukee when their car stalled out in what McMillian thought was just puddle.\nThen the water started coming in under the door.\n\u201cAs the water was coming in, it was like, \u2018What is happening?\u2019\u201d McMillan said Monday. \u201cIt was very, very shocking to me. We had to get out of this car and out of the rain. I had never seen anything like this before.\u201d\nThey escaped and helped others avoid getting stuck like they did. But the car was totaled, McMillan said.\nSubscribe to our Science Newsletter to explore the\nwide worlds of science, health and technology.\nThank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.\nThe city of Milwaukee was still assessing the extent of the damage Monday as flood waters were receding, said the city\u2019s public works director, Jerrel Kruschke.\nRob Sieracki lives across the street from a dog park that he said was completely underwater. One car was submerged, something Sieracki didn\u2019t realize until he saw a photo the next day.\nAbout two feet (60 centimeters) of water came up the front of his house, built in 1890, resulting in several inches of flooding in his basement. He also lost power for 15 hours.\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re on a hill, we turned out to be relatively OK,\u201d Sieracki said. \u201cSome water did come in, it\u2019s stinky water, we think it\u2019s sewage, but we\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\nThe flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis outside of Milwaukee on Sunday, as well as USA Triathlon\u2019s Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee. Thousands of athletes from around the country were expected to participate in that event.\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he\u2019s hearing stories of residents across the city, including his own uncle, who had water all the way up to the top of their basement.\n\u201cI certainly hope that a storm like this does not visit on the city for at least another millennium,\u201d Johnson said.\nThe National Weather Service predicted more rain for the area Monday night, but nothing like the prolonged deluge Saturday into Sunday that caused the flash flooding.\n\u201cThere could be some areas that get some heavy downpours,\u201d said Sarah Marquardt, a National Weather Service meteorologist at the Milwaukee/Sullivan office. That could prolong areas with standing water but not result in additional flooding, she said.\nThe National Weather Service said four rivers in the Milwaukee area hit record-high levels over the weekend.

            "'What is happening?' Milwaukee area recovers from record rain and flooding. 'What is happening?' Milwaukee area recovers from record rain and flooding\nThe Milwaukee area is drying out after weekend rain hits unofficial state records\nMADISON, Wis. -- The Milwaukee area began drying out Monday after weekend rain hit unofficial records in Wisconsin of more than 14 inches (36 centimeters) in less than 24 hours, leading multiple rivers to flood at record-high levels, washing out vehicles, flooding basements and cutting power to thousands of homes.\nNo fatalities had been reported as of Monday morning from the storms that began Saturday night and stretched into Sunday. Road closures were more isolated Monday as flood warnings continued in Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee counties. About 2,000 homes in the area remained without power as of Monday afternoon.\nResidents couldn't believe what they saw as rains pounded the area Saturday night.\nColby McMillan and a friend were driving home around 11 p.m. in Milwaukee when their car stalled out in what McMillian thought was just a puddle.\nThen the water started coming in under the door.\n\u201cAs the water was coming in, it was like, \u2018What is happening?\u2019\u201d McMillan said Monday. \u201cIt was very, very shocking to me. We had to get out of this car and out of the rain. I had never seen anything like this before.\u201d\nThey escaped and helped others avoid getting stuck like they did. But the car was totaled, McMillan said.\nThe city of Milwaukee was still assessing the extent of the damage Monday as flood waters were receding, said the city\u2019s public works director, Jerrel Kruschke.\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers declared a state of emergency after touring some of the damage in suburban Wauwatosa on Monday and called the flooding \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\nRob Sieracki lives across the street from a dog park that he said was completely underwater. One car was submerged, something Sieracki didn't realize until he saw a photo the next day.\nAbout two feet (60 centimeters) of water came up the front of his house, built in 1890, resulting in several inches of flooding in his basement. He also lost power for 15 hours.\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re on a hill, we turned out to be relatively OK,\" Sieracki said. \"Some water did come in, it\u2019s stinky water, we think it\u2019s sewage, but we\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\nThe flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis outside of Milwaukee on Sunday, as well as USA Triathlon\u2019s Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee. Thousands of athletes from around the country were expected to participate in that event.\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he\u2019s hearing stories of residents across the city, including his own uncle, who had water all the way up to the top of their basement.\n\u201cI certainly hope that a storm like this does not visit on the city for at least another millennium,\u201d Johnson said.\nThe National Weather Service predicted more rain for the area Monday night, but nothing like the prolonged deluge Saturday into Sunday that caused the flash flooding.\n\u201cThere could be some areas that get some heavy downpours,\" said Sarah Marquardt, a National Weather Service meteorologist at the Milwaukee/Sullivan office. That could prolong areas with standing water but not result in additional flooding, she said.\nThe National Weather Service said four rivers in the Milwaukee area hit record-high levels over the weekend. The official two-day rain total at the Milwaukee airport of 6.91 inches (about 17.6 centimeters) was the second-highest on record, Marquardt said. The record was 7.18 inches set in June 2008. The single-day total at the airport on Saturday of 5.74 inches (about 14.6 centimeters) was second only to the record of 6.81 inches set in 1986, Marquardt said.\nUnofficial two-day rain totals in the 10- to 12-inch range, with one reading exceeding more than 14 inches (about 35.6 centimeters) in northwestern Milwaukee County, would set record highs for the state once verified over the coming weeks, Marquardt said.

            "Trick your brain into staying motivated with one simple psychology hack. Dreading a task at the end of a long week? There may be a way to trick your brain into seeing that chore as a reward.\n\"Dopamine anchoring\" is the latest psychology hack making the rounds on social media.\nThe technique involves associating a desirable thing \u2013 like music or snacks \u2013 with a less pleasant task or movement, so that \"over time, your brain begins to crave the task itself,\" according to Joshua Stein, M.D., a child and adolescent psychiatrist at PrairieCare in Minnesota.\nSTANFORD SCIENTISTS 'TOTALLY SURPRISED' BY POTENTIAL PARKINSON'S TREATMENT DISCOVERY\nFrom a neuroscience perspective, the strategy works through the brain\u2019s dopamine pathway.\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain associated with feelings of pleasure.\n\"When we expect a reward, dopamine levels rise before we get the reward\" \u2014 which helps boost motivation, Stein told Fox News Digital.\nBy repeatedly pairing something enjoyable with an activity like cleaning, writing or even exercising, it's possible to train the brain to release dopamine in advance, which associates pleasure with that behavior.\nNEGATIVE THOUGHTS MIGHT BE CHANGING YOUR BRAIN IN SURPRISING WAYS, STUDY SUGGESTS\n\"There is strong scientific support for this, from both behavioral psychology and neuroscience,\" said Stein, noting that pairing stimuli and rewards can influence behavior, even potentially helping with addiction.\nThis anchoring technique can also be helpful for those who have conditions like ADHD or depression, in which the dopamine system can become out of whack or dysregulated.\n\"The more consistent the pattern, the stronger the association.\"\nStein noted that some people may struggle with a condition called anhedonia, which means they have issues with experiencing pleasure, starting a task or keeping their attention focused.\n\"By strategically anchoring pleasant stimuli to challenging tasks, individuals can essentially 'prime\u2019 the brain\" to better tolerate, or even enjoy, those activities, according to the doctor.\n\"Overall, it\u2019s about working with your brain chemistry, not against it.\"\nDebunking myths\nOne of the biggest myths surrounding dopamine is that it\u2019s just a \"pleasure chemical,\" according to Stein.\n\"It would be more accurate to say that dopamine is the motivation or anticipation neurotransmitter,\" he said.\nPotential downsides\nWhile dopamine anchoring can be a helpful tool in some cases, experts say it should not be relied upon as the sole treatment.\nThere can be downsides to relying on the technique as a self-help strategy. \"Like any other psychological tool, dopamine anchoring needs to be used mindfully,\" Stein cautioned.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThere is the risk that someone could come to rely on external rewards to do anything at all, which could undermine natural motivation over time.\n\"Like any other psychological tool, dopamine anchoring needs to be used mindfully.\"\nPeople should also avoid using unhealthy or overly stimulating rewards as anchors, like eating sugary snacks after reaching a goal or using social media after finishing an assignment \u2014 behaviors that can lead to dysregulation, poor focus or burnout, the expert said.\nStein suggests anchoring with things that are energizing but not addictive, and building in breaks where motivation can arise more naturally.\n\"Think of dopamine anchoring as a bridge, not a crutch,\" he advised.\nStein also pointed out the misconception that people can endlessly boost dopamine. While short-term boosts are possible, too much artificial stimulation can dull the natural response over time.\nExamples of dopamine anchoring\n\"The best way to begin practicing dopamine anchoring is to start small,\" Stein said.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nThe expert offered the examples below for those looking to try this technique.\nPair a long drive with a favorite podcast or audiobook\n-\nSchedule a celebration with friends after completing a big project\n-\nEnjoy a favorite healthy snack while working on a challenging task\n-\nBring along a favorite coffee drink to a potentially difficult family visit\n-\nWatch a football game while working out at the gym\n-\n\"If you do this consistently, over time your brain will begin to associate that task with a sense of ease, and maybe even enjoyment,\" Stein said.\nThe goal is to keep the rewards simple and non-addictive so they don\u2019t get in the way of the task, according to the expert.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\"Overall, sustainability is key,\" Stein said.\n\"You\u2019re not trying to trick your brain \u2014 rather, you\u2019re training it.

            "Chinese-led international team releases landmark findings on mesoscale brain mapping research. Xinhua\n11 Jul 2025, 14:15 GMT+10\nBEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists, in collaboration with international researchers, has achieved a breakthrough in brain mapping, with ten seminal studies on mesoscale brain atlases published as a featured collection of papers in Cell Press journals on Thursday.\nBrain atlas research aims to decode the neural network basis underlying perception, movement, learning, memory, and decision-making by constructing precise \"brain maps\" that enable the accurate localization of various types of neural cells and their network connectivity patterns.\nBy integrating advanced high-resolution brain imaging, spatial transcriptomic analysis, and AI technologies, the research team has successfully constructed comprehensive mesoscale brain atlases covering multiple species at single-cell resolution.\nThe ten related studies were published in leading journals, including Cell and Neuron, demonstrating China's growing expertise and international leadership in mesoscale brain mapping research.\n\"Our research has successfully extended brain mapping from rodents to primates,\" said Muming Poo, scientific director of the Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CEBSIT).\n\"Primate brains are significantly more complex than those of rodents,\" Poo noted, adding that the research team has conducted in-depth analyses of brain cell types, neural connectivity patterns, developmental and evolutionary characteristics, as well as molecular mechanisms of brain disorders in macaques and other species. \"This represents a crucial milestone in our research.\"\nThe newly published collection encompasses key species from reptiles and birds to rodents, non-human primates, and humans. By integrating multi-omics data, including transcriptomics and connectomics, these resources significantly expanded the international brain atlas database for cross-species comparisons and spatiotemporal changes of cell types and neuronal connections during development and evolution.\n\"These achievements depended on several innovations in brain mapping technologies developing in our participating Chinese institutions,\" said Sun Yangang, a leading investigator of CEBSIT.\n\"These include two sets of technical advances: one in single-cell spatial transcriptomics of large tissue samples of the primate brain, which is critical for cell typing in normal and diseased brains, and second, the capability of acquisition of submicron-resolution images of neuronal connections and high-throughput 3D reconstructions of axon morphologies as well as data compilation and analysis,\" Sun said.\nThe series of achievements were accomplished by over 300 scientists, including researchers from the CEBSIT, Suzhou Institute for Brainsmatics under the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, BGI Research Institute and other Chinese research institutions, as well as researchers from France, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\"Primate brain mapping research is characterized by long time required data acquisition and the staggering volume of data to be stored and analyzed,\" Poo said. \"We call for sustained global scientific collaboration to collectively advance toward the rather ambitious goal of deciphering mesoscale brain atlases of primate brains, including the human brain.\"\nGet a daily dose of Europe Sun news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Europe Sun.\nMore InformationIn the past month alone, 23 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza\u2014three more than the number of remaining living hostages held...\nLONDON, U.K.: At least 13 people are believed to have taken their own lives as a result of the U.K.'s Post Office scandal, in which...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: Travelers at U.S. airports will no longer need to remove their shoes during security screenings, Department of Homeland...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: An elaborate impersonation scheme involving artificial intelligence targeted senior U.S. and foreign officials in...\nSLUBICE, Poland: Poland reinstated border controls with Germany and Lithuania on July 7, following Germany's earlier reintroduction...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: After months of warnings from former federal officials and weather experts, the deadly flash floods that struck the...\nBASTROP, Texas: In a surprising turn at Elon Musk's X platform, CEO Linda Yaccarino announced she is stepping down, just months after...\nNEW YORK CITY, New York: Former British prime minister Rishi Sunak will return to Goldman Sachs in an advisory role, the Wall Street...\nLONDON, U.K.: Physically backed gold exchange-traded funds recorded their most significant semi-annual inflow since the first half...\nAMSTERDAM, Netherlands: Some 32 percent of global semiconductor production could face climate change-related copper supply disruptions...\nNEW YORK, New York - U.S. stocks rebounded Tuesday with all the major indices gaining ground.

            "Not Just Noise: Impaired Oscillatory Entrainment Reflects Reduced Temporal Flexibility in Autism. Abstract\nRhythmic patterns in the environment enhance neural activity, perception, and action. However, natural rhythms are often imprecise, requiring flexible adaptation. In autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), characterized by cognitive rigidity and atypical use of prior information - favoring immediate sensory input over predictive cues - entrainment to temporally variable input may be reduced at both neural and behavioral levels, though the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we recorded high-density EEG and behavior in adults with ASD (n=20) and neurotypical (NT) controls (n=21) during a visual detection task with four rhythmic structures, parametrically varied from an isochronous fully regular rhythm, to a highly irregular one. Spectral analysis and temporal response function (TRF) models revealed significantly reduced modulation by temporal regularity in ASD, particularly in mildly jittered stimulation streams. Additionally, the coupling between phases of neural oscillations and behavior was diminished in ASD under the jittered conditions, suggesting reduced functional relevance of neural synchronization. Residual spectral power post-stimulation showed lower oscillatory entrainment in ASD, ruling out simple evoked-response explanations. Notably, the degree of neural modulation by temporal regularity was correlated with IQ within the ASD group, suggesting a link between temporal flexibility and individual cognitive profiles. These findings highlight impaired neural entrainment and reduced behavioral modulation by temporal structure in ASD, offering insight into inflexible responses to uncertain, volatile sensory environments.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest."

Reflect that in your response.\"\n-\n\"Reply to the post just like a human, keep it engaging, dont repeat the information which is already present in the original post.\"\n-\nThe update caused Grok to prioritize engaging replies, even if they contained \"unethical or controversial opinions,\" xAI said.\nThe instructions meant Grok followed the \"tone and context\" of the X post in which it was tagged. So, if a user tagged Grok in an X post talking about Hitler, the chatbot would mimic that.\nGrok's inflammatory posts came days before xAI launched the next version of the chatbot, Grok 4, which touts improved reasoning abilities.\nThe latest version of the AI chatbot has a favorite source on some hot-topic issues. When asked about immigration and conflict in the Middle East, it cited Musk's views, tests by BI confirmed.\nOn Thursday, Musk said Grok would be coming to Tesla vehicles \"very soon.\"\nxAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nGrok makes mistakes publicly unlike ChatGPT\nAcross his numerous companies, Musk is not one to shy away from risk-taking \u2014 even when failure could mean a publicity nightmare.\nWith xAI, Musk has deployed Grok directly into X, where users can summon it to respond at any time. It means that, unlike rivals such as OpenAI, where user interactions largely stay private, xAI's behavior \u2014 good or bad \u2014 is in full view of the world.\nThe AI company also shares Grok's system prompt publicly on the code repository GitHub. It's a level of openness not shared by many of xAI's competitors, but also exposes it to greater scrutiny when things go wrong.\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, took a distinctly different approach on Friday, announcing that his company would delay the launch of open-weight models \u2014 systems where certain parameters are public \u2014 to run additional safety tests."

            "Pc in airport incident with brothers tells court conduct was \u2018professional\u2019. A police firearms officer allegedly assaulted by two brothers at Manchester Airport has told a jury his behaviour on the day of the incident was \u201cprofessional\u201d.\nMohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, and Muhammad Amaad, 26, are said to have struck out after police were called to respond to a reported assault at the Starbucks cafe in Terminal 2 arrivals on July 23 last year, when Amaaz is said to have headbutted a customer.\nPc Zachary Marsden was one of three officers who shortly after approached Amaaz in T2\u2019s car park paystation area with a view to arrest him, Liverpool Crown Court has heard.\nThe Crown say Amaaz resisted and his brother then intervened as they subjected the three officers to a \u201chigh level of violence\u201d.\nCross-examining Pc Marsden on Tuesday, Imran Khan KC, defending Amaaz, said: \u201cIt is his case that last year on July 23 you made a series of mistakes, some or all which were not in accordance with your police training which ultimately resulted in your conduct falling below the professional standards required of a police officer.\n\u201cAnd you used unlawful force against him, leaving him to defend himself and his brother.\u201d\nMr Khan added: \u201cYou went in, all three of you, and held on to Mr Amaaz which rendered your actions unlawful because the force used was unjustified, disproportionate and not necessary.\u201d\nJurors heard that Pc Marsden has served Greater Manchester Police for about five years following a spell as a special constable with Lancashire Constabulary.\nThe officer had regular duties at the airport as an authorised firearms officers since April 2023.\nMr Khan asked him: \u201cAs far as you personally are concerned, how would you characterise your performance as a police officer in general?\u201d\nPc Marsden said: \u201cProfessional.\u201d\nMr Khan said: \u201cIn relation to the events we are dealing with, how would you assess your performance as a police officer that day?\u201d\nPc Marsden repeated: \u201cProfessional.\u201d\nMr Khan said: \u201cHaving looked at the CCTV, do you consider there were any aspects of your performance that fell below the standards required of a police officer that day?\u201d\n\u201cNo, said Pc Marsden.\nPc Marsden said he had received a report of \u201ctwo Asian males fighting outside Starbucks\u201d and on arrival was told by a member of the public, Abdulkareem Ismaeil, that he had been headbutted by a male in a blue tracksuit who had made off towards the car park.\nMr Khan said: \u201cYou potentially had two suspects or two victims.\n\u201cIt appears you were taking Mr Ismaeil\u2019s word for it?\u201d\nPc Marsden replied: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate I was not able to talk to the male in blue as he attacked me before I could engage in any form of communication.\u201d\nHe said his plan was to escort the suspect from the crowd in the paystation area and to arrest him outside where he would have radio signal and a \u201cline of sight\u201d of his colleagues.\nMr Khan suggested that announcing his presence as a police officer as he entered the area would have been \u201cone of the better options\u201d, Pc Marsden said: \u201cI did not deem that to be a safe option.\n\u201cMy honestly held belief was that it was not appropriate to explain our attendance in the hope that he would comply and leave with us.\n\u201cBased on my policing experience, someone who has been violent once is more likely to be violent again when challenged.\u201d\nAmaaz is alleged to have assaulted Pc Marsden and Pc Lydia Ward, causing them actual bodily harm.\nHe is also accused of the assault of Pc Ellie Cook and the earlier assault of Mr Ismaeil.\nAmaad is alleged to have assaulted Pc Marsden, causing actual bodily harm.\nBoth men, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, deny the allegations.\nMr Khan said to Pc Marsden: \u201cIs the position this, that throughout the incident the force you used was justified, proportionate and reasonable?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Pc Marsden.\nThe witness said he was met with initial resistance from Amaaz so decided to put his hand on the back of the suspect\u2019s neck and push him downwards to knock him off balance.\nMr Khan said: \u201cHad you considered that might be frightening to Mr Amaaz, what you were doing?\u201d\nPc Marsden said: \u201cNo. My concerns were my safety and my colleagues\u2019 safety.\u201d\nAs the second defendant intervened the officer threw two punches, the court heard.\nMr Khan said: \u201cYou are the first person to throw any blows in this incident, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nPc Marsden said: \u201cA pre-emptive strike, yes.\u201d",

Man accused of raping woman and four men in Manchester city centre says 'I didn't do those things, I'm a thief'\nMourad Malki, also known as Sid Ali Djelid, denies the charges he faces\nA man accused of raping vulnerable and \u2018intoxicated\u2019 five people in Manchester city centre told a jury: \u201cI didn\u2019t do those things... I\u2019m a thief.\u201d\nMourad Malki, also known as Sid Ali Djelid, is accused of \u2018laying in wait\u2019 before attacking a woman and four men over the course of five months. The attacks are all alleged to have taken place around Manchester\u2019s Gay Village.\nThe 48-year-old has accepted stealing items including phones and jewellery from four of his victims. He denies any sexual offences and is on trial at Manchester Crown Court.\nGiving evidence, the defendant said his name was Sid Ali Djeli and that she had been using his \u2018friend\u2019s name\u2019 - Mourad Malki - as he had National Insurance. He said he used his friend\u2019s insurance in order to work after moving to the UK.\nSign up to the MEN Court newsletter here\nHe said that in 2024, he was living in Cheetham Hill and that he would go to Manchester\u2019s Gay Village \u2018two or three times a week\u2019. \u201cI\u2019d go to see if I could take something home,\u201d he said via an Algerian interpreter.\nAsked to clarify by his barrister, Jacob Dyer, he said: \u201cIf there was any mobile phones I could pick. I don\u2019t define people [to go for], but it depends who I meet when I\u2019m on my way.\u201d\nAsked about the first complainant, a woman, he said she had been \u2018arguing with some homeless people\u2019 before asking him for help. \u201cShe said \u2018what are you doing here?\u2019 and we started to walk together,\u201d he told the court.\n\u201cI said I was looking for a girl, and she said \u2018are you looking for sex?\u2019. Then we started to bargain.\u201d\nThe Crown allege the woman had gone into the city centre for a night out and that by her own admission was \u2018extremely drunk\u2019. She alleges she ended up in a car, but could not recall how or why and was being driven by an \u2018Asian driver\u2019, it was said. She was then \u2018pulled out of the car\u2019, jurors were told.\nJurors were previously told the woman was raped twice by Mr Djeli. In his evidence, he claimed that while she was drunk, she appeared \u2018normal\u2019 and agreed a fee between them in order to have sex.\nAfterwards, he claimed he told her he was going to get cash from an ATM, but did not intend to pay her. He also said he took her phone and intended to sell it.\n\u201cDid you understand her to be objecting?,\u201d asked Mr Dyer. \u201cNo, she hasn\u2019t objected,\u201d Mr Djeli said.\nOf the second complainant, a man, Mr Djeli said he met him outside a bar and they struck up a conversation. \u201cHe asked me if I was gay,\u201d he said. \"I\u2019m not interested in men, but for me in order to steal from him I said \u2018yes I am\u2019.\"\nHe accepted flirting with the man before they \u2018went to look for a bar\u2019.\nProsecutors previously said they walked to the carpark of Arthur House, on Silver Street, during which the defendant allegedly put his hand on the man\u2019s bottom. He is then alleged to have \u2018forcefully\u2019 raped him twice, despite the complainant telling him \u2018no\u2019, prosecutor Emma Kehoe said.\nMr Djeli claimed the man had performed sexual acts on him, but denied they had intercourse. Denying the sexual assault and rape, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t do these things, I\u2019m a thief, I steal.\u201d\nOf the third complainant, Mr Djeli said they met outside a bar and the man was asking him for a light for his cigarette. He said the man saw he had cannabis in his cigarette pack and asked if he was a drug dealer, before Mr Djeli offered to find him someone who would sell to him.\nHe described putting his arm around the man\u2019s shoulders in order to steal his necklace chain and said he stole his watch by \u2018shaking his hands\u2019. The defendant denied attacking him and raping him in an alleyway, telling jurors: \u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible, that\u2019s not true.\u201d\nThe fourth complainant was said to have been attacked in an alleyway. Mr Djeli said he couldn\u2019t recall how they met, but said: \u201cI remember him saying he wanted to go for a night out.\u201d\nJoin our Court and Crime WhatsApp group HERE\nHe claimed they went to look for a bar before he \u2018picked his pocket\u2019 and stole his phone. The defendant then said he quickly walked away from the man before running as he \u2018wanted to flee\u2019. He denied raping the man, stating: \u201cMy criminal record is all about theft. I do not assault people, I only steal.\u201d\nOf the final victim, he denied raping him or stealing from him. Asked by Mr Dyer why his DNA was on the man\u2019s jacket, he replied: \u201cI may have touched him in the pub or in the street\u201d.\n\u201cDid you rape or sexually assault any of the five complainants in this case?\u201d Mr Dyer asked him.\n\u201cNo I have not assaulted anybody. The girl, we agreed for me to pay for that. The others, I didn\u2019t have contact with them. I am a thief, I will apologise for that, but not the other things,\u201d he said.\nThe defendant, of Smedley Road, denies eight counts of rape; one count of theft; and one count of sexual assault.\nProceeding"

The code is AUGUST50. Use it here.\nAt HHS, mRNA has fallen out of favor. What\u2019s next?\nThe Alliance for mRNA Medicines has been a fast-growing industry group, now including 77 companies and institutions pushing mRNA therapies forward. After the announcement from HHS that the government\u2019s emergency preparedness agency will no longer fund work on messenger RNA vaccines, alliance members were, \u201cfrankly, in disbelief,\u201d a spokesperson for the organization said. Many of its companies were specifically named in the announcement, which could result in close to a billion dollars lost, per the spokesperson. STAT\u2019s Marissa Russo reached out to the affected companies as the news settled in. Read her story about how people in the field are reacting to such a direct assault from the U.S. government.\nFor those who weren\u2019t named in Tuesday\u2019s announcement, there was only a semblance of relief. One of the most promising avenues of cancer immunotherapy research are vaccines \u2014 but many of those therapies, designed to prompt an immune response against a patient\u2019s tumors, rely on the same mRNA technology that built groundbreaking Covid-19 vaccines. If mRNA overall has fallen out of favor, the impact could be wide-reaching.\n\u201cIf the general dictum from on high is vaccines are bad or, in this scenario, that mRNA is \u2018suspect\u2019 then it may make it more difficult for these products to get FDA approval,\u201d cancer vaccine researcher Ryan Sullivan said. \u201cThat would be awful.\u201d Read more from a team of STAT reporters, led by Angus Chen, about how the cancer community is interpreting the move.\n53%\nThat\u2019s the average percentage of all calories consumed that American adults got from ultra-processed foods between 2021 and 2023. It\u2019s a decrease from the nearly 56% of calories that ultra-processed foods made up in 2013 and 2014, according to new data from the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. For people under 18, ultra-processed foods made up almost 62% of their calories between 2021 and 2023 \u2014 a significant decrease from 2017-2018, when it was almost 66%. It\u2019s unclear why these decreases might be occurring. Got an idea?

Instead, what they\u2019re focused on is limiting any prolonged suffering for patients in a situation with dismal odds of survival, while also avoiding conflict with grieving families who struggle to accept the inevitable.\nFor decades, bioethicists have called this malpractice. But the essay authors contend that perhaps the field put the question to bed too early, \u201ctrading the moral complexity of the hospital wards for rhetorical clarity in the academic journals,\u201d they write. Read more on why some people say in some circumstances, slow codes aren\u2019t just ethical \u2014 they\u2019re essential.\nTherapy works better on grown-ups, per UK study\nIn a study of more than 1.5 million people in England who received some sort of psychological therapy for depression or anxiety, young adults were 25% less likely to reach the thresholds that define reliable recovery than older, \u201cworking age\u201d adults.\nThe study, published yesterday in The Lancet Psychiatry, analyzed data on patients who engaged in the national health system\u2019s Talking Therapies program between 2015 and 2019. While therapy was generally effective for people ages 16 to 24, it was more effective for those 25 to 65. Young adults were also more likely to cancel sessions and drop out of treatment.\nThe study authors emphasized the problem this poses at a population scale, amounting to \u201cworse outcomes for tens of thousands of young adults.\u201d They believe the findings demonstrate an urgent need to make adjustments to the treatments available to young people, including finding ways to increase engagement.\n1 in 5\nThat\u2019s how many American women between the ages of 50 and 64 have ever used a GLP-1 drug, according to a new nationally representative survey of almost 8,800 people this spring by RAND.

            "STAT+: Inside the staff exodus and tanking morale that threaten Makary\u2019s FDA. WASHINGTON \u2014 The steady erosion of experienced staff at the Food and Drug Administration is slowly compromising the agency\u2019s work, current and former employees say, and the situation could become more dire as low morale pushes more workers to the exits.\nFDA employees are spooked by increasing political involvement in regulatory decisions, frustrated by the impact of cuts to administrative staff who supported drug reviews and inspections, and fed up with proclamations from the commissioner\u2019s office that they contend rarely take career staff\u2019s expertise into account. Three months after losing 3,500 employees \u2014 19% of the agency\u2019s workforce \u2014 the FDA continues to bleed talent amid a government-wide hiring freeze that has lasted almost six months.\nSTAT spoke with 15 employees across the agency\u2019s drug, device, biologics, and food centers on how the FDA has functioned since the April 1 layoffs, which coincided with the start of FDA Commissioner Marty Makary\u2019s tenure. All requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation from leadership. They told STAT that morale is incredibly low as departures mount and distrust of leaders grows among the staff that remain.",
            "STAT+: In internal FDA town hall, employees raise concerns about staffing, impromptu expert meetings. WASHINGTON \u2014 Top drug regulator George Tidmarsh assured Food and Drug Administration staff this week that he and other leaders are trying to bring operations back to normal.\n\u201cI know that I\u2019m coming in here at a challenging time,\u201d Tidmarsh said at a town hall meeting on Friday with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research staff. \u201cThat is not lost on me.\u201d\nSTAT obtained recordings of Friday\u2019s CDER staff meeting, and of another meeting last week with CDER\u2019s Office of New Drugs. In those meetings, FDA employees pushed for answers on whether the agency would restore funding for research fellows, when they will be allowed to easily attend conferences again, and why FDA\u2019s leaders are holding ad-hoc panels instead of advisory committee meetings with experts whose conflicts of interest are clearly delineated.\nFor many employees it was a first chance to meet Tidmarsh, a longtime biotech executive who became the director of CDER in July. He is also, temporarily, the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research after the Trump administration pushed out previous leader Vinay Prasad. Tidmarsh came to his role after meeting FDA Commissioner Marty Makary through National Institutes of Health director Jay Bhattacharya, who worked with him at Stanford. Like those two leaders, Tidmarsh is a critic of the academic establishment.\nIn asking their questions, employees offered examples of the ways in which the mass layoffs and rising attrition are making the work of drug regulation more difficult. The FDA lost 19% of its workforce in April, and continues to bleed experienced staff, depleting morale.\nA leader in the hepatology program said his division lost a talented computational biologist who helped track drug-induced liver injuries because of cuts to research fellows. The loss is causing strain to fellow reviewers, he noted, with some working as many as 120 hours a week. He said it is critical that this program, which protects Americans from drugs that may cause harm to their livers, not fall apart.\nAn immunologist who studies drug reactions echoed this concern. His lab lost four research fellows, and only recently was allowed to start ordering research supplies again after a spending freeze at the start of the administration. \u201cWe are struggling in the lab,\u201d he said.\nTidmarsh told employees on Friday that there would be no more reductions in force, and that he\u2019s working hard to fill the agency\u2019s many vacant positions. He also said the White House approved hybrid work for FDA employees.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can within the constraints that are imposed to bring back or hire in as much resource as possible,\u201d Tidmarsh said.\nEric Stone, director of the office of management at CDER, said he\u2019s working to get approval from the Health and Human Services department to retain research fellows and to hire more.\nMakary and Tidmarsh emphasized their desire for staff input and suggestions, including product ideas for Makary\u2019s new priority review program.\nAnother official asked why the FDA has been holding expert meetings outside of the traditional advisory committee process. Typically, the agency discloses experts\u2019 conflicts of interest, allows time for public comments, and provides briefing documents ahead of a meeting. The recent expert meetings are being planned very quickly, and tend to be dominated by experts who are skeptical of mainstream medicine.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like, at least in the public meetings that have been occurring, that the expertise that we have developed is being relied upon, queried, asked to support, asked to host these meetings,\u201d the official said.\nMakary said he appreciates advisory committee meetings but argued they tend to be bureaucratic and expensive. There\u2019s a place for quick panels where experts can hash out their opinions, he said. Tidmarsh said he\u2019s working on ways to streamline advisory committees, and seemed to question their value in certain cases.\n\u201cSome of it is important and it\u2019s a good discussion, but some of it is also done for reasons that we need to question and be careful about,\u201d Tidmarsh said.\nTidmarsh reassured staff that there is \u201cnot a political bone on his body\u201d and that he will always follow the science. But he noted that he may be overturned by political leaders above him.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of weight up above me, and so I can always be overturned, which is fine,\u201d Tidmarsh said. \u201cIf that happens, that happens.\u201d"

            "Goldman hires former UK Prime Minister Sunak as an adviser. Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is rejoining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as a senior adviser, two decades after he left the Wall Street bank as an analyst and a year after leaving Downing Street.\nSunak, who served as prime minister from October 2022 to July 2024, will work with leaders across New York-based Goldman to advise clients globally on a range of topics, \u201csharing his unique perspectives and insights on the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape,\u201d Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said in a statement Tuesday.\nThe former prime minister led the Conservative Party to its worst-ever defeat in last year\u2019s general election, but still serves as a Member of Parliament for the constituency of Richmond and Northallerton in northern England. During the election campaign, he vowed to remain an MP for the full duration of the next Parliament, regardless of the outcome of the vote. His successor, Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer, can call the next general election as late as mid-2029.\nSunak, 45, worked at Goldman first as a summer intern in investment banking, in 2000, and then as an analyst, from 2001 to 2004. He subsequently broke into the hedge fund industry by joining billionaire Chris Hohn\u2019s The Children\u2019s Investment Fund. He spent his late twenties at TCI working as an analyst before leaving in 2009 for Theleme Partners.\nHe left the industry to launch his political career, becoming an MP in 2015.\nSunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, who serves as a trustee of her alma mater, Claremont McKenna College in Southern California, are the richest people to have occupied 10 Downing Street. Murty has a fortune of more than $700 million thanks largely to her stake in Infosys Ltd., the software giant founded by her father, according to an estimate by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nSunak is required to seek advice from the UK\u2019s independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments when taking up outside appointments to ensure there is no conflict of interest relating to decisions he may have made while in office. Acoba can recommend a delay in taking up appointments and, in exceptional cases, it can advise against taking up a post. But its role is advisory and it has no powers to enforce its advice.\nIn a letter Tuesday, Acoba put specific conditions on Sunak\u2019s role. For at least two years from his last day in office, he\u2019s barred from lobbying the UK government on behalf of Goldman and can\u2019t advise \u201con matters specific to investment by a foreign government and its sovereign wealth funds,\u201d according to the letter.\n\u201cAs the former Prime Minister, there is a reasonable concern that your appointment could be seen to offer unfair access and influence within the UK government,\u201d Acoba wrote.\nAs a sitting MP, Sunak will also, within 28 days, have to declare any earnings he makes from Goldman with Parliament\u2019s Register of Members\u2019 Financial Interests.\nGoldman\u2019s numerous ties to government figures have earned the bank the nickname \u201cGovernment Sachs.\u201d The company features on the resumes of such figures as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and former US Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and Steve Mnuchin.\nSunak\u2019s hire is also the latest in a spate of hires by Wall Street firms of former politicians, largely in the US, as they look to offer geopolitical advice to clients. Citigroup Inc. hired President Donald Trump\u2019s former trade representative Robert Lighthizer, while Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, recently joined investment bank Centerview Partners.\nBefore his time as prime minister, Sunak was chancellor of the exchequer from February 2020 to July 2022, and previously served as chief secretary to the Treasury and parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\nPublished on July 9, 2025\nComments\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

            "John Kopicki: 'Champions for Children's Success' the theme for this school year. Monday marked the first day of an exciting new school year, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to welcome our students, staff and families back to our classrooms. The first day of school is always filled with energy, hope, and the promise of new opportunities \u2014 and this year is no exception.\nI want to take a moment to thank the incredible people who have worked tirelessly all summer to make sure our schools are ready for success. Our maintenance and facilities crews have been repairing, cleaning, painting and preparing every space so that our students have safe and welcoming environments to learn and grow. Our school staff \u2014 from administrators and teachers to instructional assistants, office staff and cafeteria teams \u2014 have been planning, organizing, and preparing lessons and activities that will inspire curiosity and achievement.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget our bus drivers, who will be the very first smiling faces many of our students see.

Being a champion means showing up every day with dedication, compassion and an unwavering belief in what our students can achieve. It means celebrating their victories, supporting them through challenges, and inspiring them to reach higher than they ever imagined. Whether in a classroom, behind the wheel of a bus, in an office, on a field, or in a cafeteria, each of us is a vital part of the team that ensures our students have the tools, guidance and encouragement they need to succeed \u2014 not just in school, but in life.\nOur families are essential partners in championing students. When schools and families work together, students thrive \u2014 academically, socially and emotionally. Your encouragement, involvement and support at home help reinforce the lessons learned in our classrooms and create a strong foundation for success. Whether it\u2019s attending school events, reading together at night, asking about the day\u2019s experiences or simply offering a listening ear, the role you play in your child\u2019s education is invaluable.\nTo our students \u2014 you are the reason we are here, and we are so excited to see you back in our classrooms.

            "Congress weighs Medicaid cuts, sparking alarm in small-town hospitals. Mohan Sinha\n07 Jul 2025, 19:41 GMT+10\nOMAHA, Nebraska: With Congress considering cuts totaling around US$1 trillion to Medicaid over the next decade, concerns are rising among healthcare professionals, particularly nurses in rural hospitals. They fear that these cuts could result in the loss of essential services for small communities, such as emergency rooms, clinics, and nursing homes.\nTyler Sherman, a nurse at Webster County Community Hospital in Red Cloud, Nebraska, highlights the implications of these cuts for the region's elderly population, particularly farmers who often postpone medical care until emergencies arise.\nWith Medicaid reimbursements being vital for the hospital's financial viability, Sherman states, \"Our budget is pretty heavily reliant on Medicaid reimbursement, so if we see a cut, it'll be difficult to keep the doors open.\"\nIf local healthcare facilities do close, residents might have to travel nearly an hour to access comparable services instead of a five-minute trip to Webster County Hospital.\nSherman emphasizes the danger in this increased travel time: \"That's a long way for an emergency. Some won't make it.\" Advocacy groups and state officials warn that slashing Medicaid, a program crucial for millions of low-income and disabled Americans, would particularly harm rural hospitals, potentially forcing hundreds to shut down and leaving many people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.\nAccording to a study by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina, over 300 rural hospitals could face closure due to the proposed Medicaid cuts. The situation is already dire; for instance, a health clinic in Curtis, Nebraska, recently announced it would shut down in anticipation of these cuts.\nMeanwhile, in Connecticut, Bruce Shay, 70, expresses his anxiety about the potential loss of local healthcare options. Despite being in good health, he understands that emergencies can strike at any moment, and nearby facilities like Day Kimball Hospital, which has been dealing with financial challenges, might not be able to withstand further strain.\nFor Day Kimball Hospital, with approximately 30 percent of its patients on Medicaid, the impact of federal funding cuts could significantly undermine its operations. CEO R. Kyle Kramer asserts, \"A Senate bill\u2014estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years\u2014would further hurt our bottom line.\" Shay acknowledges that if Day Kimball were to close, thousands of residents would face longer travel times for care, exacerbating an already stressed healthcare system.\nRural hospitals have been operating on the financial edge for years, especially as Medicaid payments have consistently fallen short of actual healthcare costs. Notably, more than 20 percent of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers about one in four adults, as highlighted by the nonprofit KFF.\nThe recent $4.5 trillion tax cuts and spending bill, which included massive cuts to Medicaid and social safety nets, has further complicated the survival of rural hospitals.

            "Congress weighs Medicaid cuts, sparking alarm in small-town hospitals. Mohan Sinha\n07 Jul 2025, 19:41 GMT+10\nOMAHA, Nebraska: With Congress considering cuts totaling around US$1 trillion to Medicaid over the next decade, concerns are rising among healthcare professionals, particularly nurses in rural hospitals. They fear that these cuts could result in the loss of essential services for small communities, such as emergency rooms, clinics, and nursing homes.\nTyler Sherman, a nurse at Webster County Community Hospital in Red Cloud, Nebraska, highlights the implications of these cuts for the region's elderly population, particularly farmers who often postpone medical care until emergencies arise.\nWith Medicaid reimbursements being vital for the hospital's financial viability, Sherman states, \"Our budget is pretty heavily reliant on Medicaid reimbursement, so if we see a cut, it'll be difficult to keep the doors open.\"\nIf local healthcare facilities do close, residents might have to travel nearly an hour to access comparable services instead of a five-minute trip to Webster County Hospital.\nSherman emphasizes the danger in this increased travel time: \"That's a long way for an emergency. Some won't make it.\" Advocacy groups and state officials warn that slashing Medicaid, a program crucial for millions of low-income and disabled Americans, would particularly harm rural hospitals, potentially forcing hundreds to shut down and leaving many people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.\nAccording to a study by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina, over 300 rural hospitals could face closure due to the proposed Medicaid cuts. The situation is already dire; for instance, a health clinic in Curtis, Nebraska, recently announced it would shut down in anticipation of these cuts.\nMeanwhile, in Connecticut, Bruce Shay, 70, expresses his anxiety about the potential loss of local healthcare options. Despite being in good health, he understands that emergencies can strike at any moment, and nearby facilities like Day Kimball Hospital, which has been dealing with financial challenges, might not be able to withstand further strain.\nFor Day Kimball Hospital, with approximately 30 percent of its patients on Medicaid, the impact of federal funding cuts could significantly undermine its operations. CEO R. Kyle Kramer asserts, \"A Senate bill\u2014estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years\u2014would further hurt our bottom line.\" Shay acknowledges that if Day Kimball were to close, thousands of residents would face longer travel times for care, exacerbating an already stressed healthcare system.\nRural hospitals have been operating on the financial edge for years, especially as Medicaid payments have consistently fallen short of actual healthcare costs. Notably, more than 20 percent of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers about one in four adults, as highlighted by the nonprofit KFF.\nThe recent $4.5 trillion tax cuts and spending bill, which included massive cuts to Medicaid and social safety nets, has further complicated the survival of rural hospitals.

Trump marks one-year anniversary of assassination attempt at the FIFA Club World Cup final\nPresident Donald Trump marked the one-year anniversary of a failed attempt on his life and watched Chelsea dominate Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J -- President Donald Trump on Sunday marked the one-year anniversary of a failed attempt on his life, joining family, friends and close advisers to witness Chelsea's dominating FIFA Club World Cup final victory over Paris Saint-Germain.\nThe president joined the players on the field after the match to congratulate the tournament's outstanding performers, present PSG players with their runner-up medals and hand Chelsea their championship trophy.\nTrump and first lady Melania Trump were greeted with cheers as they arrived at MetLife Stadium just ahead of the pre-match performance by musical artists Robbie Williams and Laura Pausini. And the president got a smattering of boos when he was briefly shown on the stadium's mega-screen.\nThe president waved to the crowd and pumped his fist as he and his entourage arrived at the stadium luxury box, where they took in the match with FIFA President Gianni Infantino and his wife, Leena Al Ashqar.\nOther guests spotted in the president's suite included Attorney General Pam Bondi, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, NFL great Tom Brady and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\nMetLife in a little over a year will host the 2026 World Cup final.\nChelsea, of the English Premier League, spoiled PSG's bid to win its fourth major title of the season, exactly 100 days after PSG clinched Ligue 1 on April 5. The Paris team added the Coupe de France by beating Reims 3-0 on May 24, then romped over Inter Milan seven days later in the Champions League Final.\nChelsea dominated throughout, racing out to a 3-0 lead in the first half behind a pair of goals from Cole Palmer and one from Jo\u00e3o Pedro.\nSunday's match fell on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt Trump survived in Butler, Pennsylvania, while campaigning for president.\n\u201cIt remains my firm conviction that God alone saved me that day for a righteous purpose: to restore our beloved Republic to greatness and to rescue our Nation from those who seek its ruin,\u201d Trump said in a statement released Sunday night after he returned to Washington.\nHe also hailed doctors, first responders and rallygoers who helped guided other attendees to safety, saying, \u201cThese men and women arrived at the rally grounds as ordinary Americans, but left as heroes.\u201d\nThe international sporting match also offered an opportunity for Trump and aides to huddle with Qatari government officials.\nTrump envoy Steve Witkoff, in a brief exchange with reporters ahead of the match, said he remained \u201chopeful\u201d about Gaza ceasefire and hostage negotiations.\nWitkoff, who joined Trump for the tournament finale, appeared to nod affirmatively when asked by reporters if he planned on meeting with senior officials from the Gulf nation of Qatar, which is serving as an intermediary with Hamas in the talks, during the match.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be meeting them,\u201d Witkoff said.\nThe president, who has a warm relationship with Infantino, has said he plans to attend multiple matches of the World Cup tournament next year that will be held at stadiums in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nPreparations for next year's big soccer moment for North America are well underway. But it comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and its neighbors over proposed tariffs, immigration and Trump repeatedly saying that Canada should become the 51st state.\nTrump earlier this year said the tensions will only make the tournament more \u201cexciting.\u201d\n\u201c Tension\u2019s a good thing, \u201d Trump said.\nSporting events have made up the bulk of Trump\u2019s trips in the U.S. since taking office this year. In addition to his visit this weekend to the soccer tournament, he\u2019s attended the Super Bowl in New Orleans, the Daytona 500 in Florida, UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, and the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia.\n\u2014\nCassidy reported from Atlanta.

            "Butler one year later: Revisiting the historic assassination attempt against Donald Trump. Presidential candidate Donald Trump took the stage at a routine campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, exactly a year ago, on July 13, 2024, one of hundreds he'd appeared at since announcing his first presidential campaign in 2015.\nBut this rally turned out unlike any other of his political career.\nAs Trump stood at the podium, with supporters holding signs that said \"Joe Biden, you\u2019re fired!\" directly behind him, the president pointed to a chart detailing low illegal immigration numbers at the end of his first term and how they\u2019d risen under the Biden administration.\n\"That chart's a couple of months old, and if you want to really see something that's sad, take a look at what happened,\" Trump said, halting as the sound of gunshots pierced the air.\nTRUMP REVEALS CRUCIAL, SPLIT-SECOND MOMENT THAT SAVED HIS LIFE DURING BUTLER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT\nMoments later, Trump ducked, and Secret Service agents rushed to his side. More gunshots followed, and attendees fearfully screamed while Trump remained covered, waiting for the all-clear sign.\nOnce given the green light, Secret Service personnel rose alongside Trump to escort him from the stage. But Trump didn\u2019t hide himself from his supporters. Instead, he emerged from the huddle, raised his fist high in the air, and said \"fight\" three times, prompting the audience to erupt and chant \"U-S-A!\" as he exited.\nUltimately, 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks fired eight bullets at Trump from a rooftop during the rally, with a bullet grazing Trump\u2019s ear. The gunman also killed Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter, father and husband attending the rally, and injured two others.\nA Secret Service sniper killed Crooks during the shooting, and an FBI investigation remains in progress. No motive has been determined for why Crooks conducted the attack.\nClassmates of Crooks have described him as a \"loner\" subjected to bullying, and the FBI told reporters in August 2024 that Crooks likely suffered from an undiagnosed disorder.\nFIRST RESPONDERS SIT DOWN WITH WIDOW OF FIREFIGHTER KILLED AT BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, TRUMP RALLY\n\"It was unforgettable,\" Trump said during an exclusive interview clip that aired Thursday on \"My View with Lara Trump.\" \"I didn\u2019t know exactly what was going on. I got a whack.\n\"People were screaming, and I got down quickly, fortunately, because I think they shot eight bullets.\"\nTrump's chief of staff Susie Wiles, who then served as Trump's campaign co-chair, said she initially believed Trump had been killed.\n\"You think the worst,\" Wiles said in an interview that dropped Wednesday with Miranda Devine on \"Pod Force One.\" \"You cannot \u2013 it\u2019s human \u2013 you can\u2019t think otherwise. And when he stood up, I thought, \u2018Oh my gosh.'\"\nWiles recounted that, due to the immigration chart, Trump had just moved his head slightly at the time of the ambush, a key adjustment in Trump's posture as Crooks started to fire at him.\nTRUMP CHIEF OF STAFF SUSIE WILES RECOUNTS BUTLER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, THOUGHT PRESIDENT WAS DEAD AT FIRST\n\"So, to have him ask for that chart, eight minutes in, and to have it come on the side that was opposite, caused him to look in a different direction and lift his head just a little because it was higher, and that just doesn\u2019t happen because it happened,\" she said.\n\"But it was a scary time, and it changed everything for us. The security became front and center, which it hadn't been before.\"\nThe attack led to an overhaul of the Secret Service in the past year to prevent another attack like the one in Pennsylvania. The Department of Homeland Security issued a report in October 2024, which determined that if the Secret Service didn't enact reforms, another episode like the one in Pennsylvania was possible.\n\"The Secret Service does not perform at the elite levels needed to discharge its critical mission,\" the report said. \"The Secret Service has become bureaucratic, complacent, and static even though risks have multiplied and technology has evolved.\"\nSince then, the Secret Service has ushered in several key reforms to bolster its security measures and suspended six of its agents due to their response at Butler.\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AFTERMATH, REACTIONS FROM INNER CIRCLE REVEALED IN NEW BOOK\nTrump spoke about the attempt on his life days later at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, wearing a bandage on his ear and telling audience members he was \"not supposed to be here tonight.\" In response, the crowd started to chant back, \"Yes you are!\"\n\"Many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was,\" Trump said at the convention. \"When I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead. And there was great, great sorrow. I could see that on their faces.\n\"As I looked out, they didn't know I was looking out. They thought it was over. But I could see it. I wanted to do something to let them know I was OK. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting, \u2018Fight, fight, fight.\u2019\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nToday, a painting depicting Trump's fist raised with blood smeared across his face stands in the White House's entrance hall.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital Friday that \"God spared President Trump\u2019s life by a miraculous millimeter.\"\n\"Now one year later, President Trump is standing stronger than ever as he continues to \u2018fight, fight, fight\u2019 for the American people,\" Leavitt said.",
            "Could Butler happen again? Former Secret Service agents weigh in on political violence in 2025. While the 2024 assassination attempt against President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, has resulted in a host of changes to bolster the Secret Service's security practices, the agency has its work cut out for it in an era of unprecedented threats against the president, according to former Secret Service agents.\nTrump faces a plethora of threats, ranging from violent extremists backed by proxy groups, to domestic actors inspired to incite violence amid heightened political rhetoric, according to experts.\n\"No U.S. president has been under so much threat of violence,\" Bill Gage, who served as a Secret Service special agent during Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama\u2019s administrations, told Fox News Digital Wednesday. \"The threat on President Trump is the greatest that any president has ever faced.\"\nONE YEAR AFTER TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, BUTLER WIDOW DEMANDS ACCOUNTABILITY FROM SECRET SERVICE\nTwenty-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on Trump from a rooftop during the rally \u2014 with one of the eight bullets shot grazing Trump's ear. In addition to injuring two people, the gunman also shot and killed Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter, father and husband attending the rally.\nMonths later, another man was apprehended and charged with attempting to assassinate Trump at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Both incidents are under investigation.\nPolitical rhetoric from the left that paints Trump as a threat to democracy is dangerous and could provide fodder for political radicals to believe assassinating the president is the way to save the country \u2014 potentially leading to a similar assassination attempt seen in Pennsylvania, Gage said.\nOther factors contributing to the heightened threat levels include policies related to immigration or funding cuts from the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that are unpopular with the left, as well as hostile proxy groups who are backed by actors like Iran who oppose Trump, Gage said.\n\"That increases the threat level on Trump,\" Gage said. \"There's probably dozens and dozens of threats every day, just sort of insider threats, or threats within our own borders that the Secret Service has to run down.\"\nSpecifically, Gage pointed to comments from leaders like Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who delivered an address to the nation in June where he claimed \"democracy is under assault,\" following the Trump administration\u2019s decision to dispatch thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines to respond to the immigration riots in the Golden State and place them under federal command, rather than state command.\n\"Right now there is someone out there reading Newsom's quotes, someone who wishes President Trump harm,\" Gage said in an email in June to Fox News Digital. \"It is up to the USSS to stop them. Hopefully those wishing the President harm will not slip through the cracks.\"\nA spokesperson for Newsom did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\nTrump isn't the only subject that's a potential target for politically motivated violence.\nAttacks against federal immigration officials are on the rise and a gunman opened fire against Border Patrol agents Monday at an annex in McAllen, Texas. Authorities have yet to identify a motive.\nHowever, lawmakers have not minced their words on Trump's immigration agenda. In June, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., accused ICE of acting \"like a terrorist force\" \u2014 comments she has since defended.\nRep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., who oversees the House Homeland Security committee\u2019s subcommittee on border security and enforcement, said in a Wednesday statement to Fox News Digital that \"radical anti-law enforcement rhetoric\" has prompted the surge in violence against federal immigration officials.\nTRUMP CHIEF OF STAFF SUSIE WILES RECOUNTS BUTLER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, THOUGHT PRESIDENT WAS DEAD AT FIRST\nMeanwhile, threats continue to change, creating additional challenges for security forces like the Secret Service as they adapt.\nAlthough the Secret Service is taking action to enhance its security measures, the agency still faces \"considerable vulnerabilities given the rising complexity and sophistication of the threats it faces,\" Tim Miller, who served as a Secret Service agent during Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton\u2019s administrations, said in an email Wednesday to Fox News Digital.\n\"The FBI has consistently warned about homegrown violent extremists, which remains a major concern,\" Miller said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhile Miller characterized Butler as a \"wake-up\" call for the Secret Service and said the incident is sharpening the agency\u2019s ability to handle threats, there is still a lot of work that must be done, he said.\n\"The Secret Service is also still playing catch-up when it comes to adopting critical technology \u2014 especially in the areas of secure communications, drone surveillance, and real-time intelligence tools,\" Miller said. \"These are not luxuries; they are vital to modern protective operations.\"\nA bipartisan House task force that investigated the attack found that the attempted assassination was \"preventable,\" and determined various mistakes were not an isolated incident.\nAt the top of the list of mistakes, the report identified that the Secret Service did not secure a \"high-risk area\" next to the rally, the American Glass Research (AGR) grounds and building complex. Failure to secure this area \"eventually allowed Crooks to evade law enforcement, climb on and traverse the roof of the AGR complex, and open fire.\"\nOther faults the task force found included handing over advance planning roles to inexperienced Secret Service personnel, along with various technology and communication breakdowns.\n\"Moreover, relevant threat information known by members of the intelligence community was not escalated to key personnel working the rally,\" the House task force said in its report.\nAs a result, the agency has spearheaded a series of reforms.\nJOURNALIST WHO REFUSED TO DUCK DURING TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT REFLECTS ON BUTLER RALLY IN NEW BOOK\nAccording to former Secret Service acting director Ronald Rowe, immediate changes to the agency following Butler, Pennsylvania, included expanding the use of drones for surveillance purposes, and also incorporating greater counter-drone technology to mitigate kinetic attacks from other drones.\nThe agency also overhauled its radio communications networks and interoperability of those networks with Secret Service personnel, and state and local law enforcement officers, Rowe told lawmakers on a bipartisan House task force investigating the assassination attempt in December 2024. Updates to these radio communications are a significant change, according to Gage, who noted that he could carry up to five radios at a time because an integrated system didn\u2019t exist.\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AFTERMATH, REACTIONS FROM INNER CIRCLE REVEALED IN NEW BOOK\nRowe also told lawmakers that the Secret Service was aiming to up its staffing in the next year, and had placed more special agents in Trump\u2019s security detail. Some of the additional $231 million in funding that Congress approved for the Secret Service in a stopgap spending bill in September 2024 to hire 1,000 new agents and officers in 2025 would go toward these increased hiring plans, Rowe said.\nA few other changes are in the pipeline, including possibly building a precise replica of the White House. Historically, agents have trained using Tyler Perry\u2019s White House replica at his Atlanta film studio.\nSecret Service director Sean Curran said in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \"My View with Lara Trump\" in April that the agency is working with the White House to install such a building at the James J. Rowley Training Center, a 500-acre center in Laurel, Maryland.\n\"In order for our officers and agents to train up properly, they have to see what it\u2019s like to be at the White House,\" Curran said. \"It\u2019s an important complex to know. There\u2019s a lot of ins and outs, and something as simple as the local fire department showing up to help with a fire, and they need to know where they are going.\"\nAltogether, Congressional oversight bodies issued nearly 50 recommendations to the Secret Service following the assassination attempt, including ones related to better radio communications and planning for events. The agency reported Thursday that it has executed 21 of those recommendations, and is in the process of implementing 16 others.\n\"The reforms made over this last year are just the beginning, and the agency will continue to assess its operations, review recommendations and make additional changes as needed,\" the Secret Service said in a news release Thursday.",
            "Trump stands 'stronger than ever' one year after surviving Pennsylvania assassination attempt, staffers say. In a matter of minutes on a hot summer Saturday in northwestern Pennsylvania, the already unprecedented 2024 election cycle was rocked by an assassination attempt on President Donald Trump's life that had a sweeping effect not only on the upcoming presidency, but also staffers who witnessed the harrowing moment.\nEight shots rang out at the Butler Farm Show Grounds at about 6:11 p.m. Eastern Time, roughly six minutes after Trump took the open-air rally's stage. The rally began on its typical lively note, with the former and upcoming president swaying to Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the USA\" and engaging with supporters by pointing at them as they clapped and held up signs declaring, \"Joe Biden, you're fired.\"\nThe rally came to a screeching halt after Trump began his address and was seen grabbing the side of his head before abruptly dropping to the ground. Rally-goers were also seen ducking for cover as confusion gripped the small fairgrounds located just north of Pittsburgh.\nSecret Service agents threw their bodies over Trump as shields as they worked to get him off of the stage and to a secure location.\nFIRST RESPONDERS SIT DOWN WITH WIDOW OF FIREFIGHTER KILLED AT BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA TRUMP RALLY\nSecret Service Director Sean M. Curran, one of the agents who rushed to protect Trump that day, told Fox News Digital that July 13, 2024, has remained at the top of his mind since he was tapped to lead the Secret Service.\n\"One year ago, I was by President Trump\u2019s side when a lone gunman attempted to assassinate him in Butler, Pennsylvania,\" Curran said. \"My heart will always be with all those impacted on that day, especially Corey Comperatore, who lost his life while protecting those around him.\"\n\"Since President Trump appointed me as director of the United States Secret Service, I have kept my experience on July 13 top of mind, and the agency has taken many steps to ensure such an event can never be repeated in the future,\" he continued. \"Nothing is more important to the United States Secret Service than the safety and security of our protectees. As director, I am committed to ensuring our agency is fully equipped, resourced and aligned to carry out our important mission each and every day.\"\nONE YEAR AFTER TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, BUTLER WIDOW DEMANDS ACCOUNTABILITY FROM SECRET SERVICE\nTrump emerged into the camera's view with a trail of blood streaked across his cheek and famously raised a fist before defiantly chanting, \"Fight, fight, fight\" as law enforcement escorted him from the stage.\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles, who served as Trump campaign manager in 2024 and witnessed the harrowing attempt, told the New York Post's Miranda Devine earlier in July in a podcast interview that she \"100%\" believes divine intervention protected Trump from a greater tragedy that day.\n\"The way the rally itself unfolded, the chart he had them put up on the screens\u2026 it was always the last chart in the rotation. And it was always on the other side\" of the stage, Wiles told Devine in an interview that published Wednesday. \"To have him ask for that chart eight minutes in and to have it come on the side that is opposite caused him to look in a different direction... I believe God wanted him to live.\"\nSECRET SERVICE SUSPENDS 6 AGENTS TASKED WITH PROTECTING TRUMP DURING JULY 2024 ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT\nPennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick, who was in the midst of his election cycle to unseat longtime Democrat Sen. Bob Casey, said in comment to Fox News Digital that he was just feet from Trump when the gunshots rang out.\n\"I was sitting just 15 feet from the stage at the Butler rally when the shots rang out. Moments before the attempted assassination, President Trump asked me to come on stage to give my remarks. As I was headed onstage, he prompted me to wait until after he spoke to the crowd about an immigration chart. Returning to my seat, I watched as President Trump turned his attention and head towards the chart\u2014a decision that likely saved his life,\" McCormick said.\n\"Moments later, a bullet meant for his head struck his ear. He went down, then stood up and raised his fist in defiance. That moment captured who he is at his core\u2014a strong leader\u2014and marked a turning point in the 2024 election. Strong leadership sets a tone -- like a ripple effect. President Trump didn\u2019t panic and stood strong and so did the crowd. Instead of chaos, chants of 'USA' rang out.\"\nThe shooting injured three people, including Trump, and killed local father and former fire chief Corey Comperatore.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reflected on Comperatore's tragic death in a comment to Fox Digital, underscoring that the president \"will never forget Corey and his beautiful family.\"\n\"One year ago in Butler, Pennsylvania, we tragically lost an American hero, Corey Comperatore, who selflessly laid down his life to protect those around him,\" she said. \"President Trump will never forget Corey and his beautiful family. On that dark day, God spared President Trump\u2019s life by a miraculous millimeter. Now one year later, President Trump is standing stronger than ever as he continues to \u2018fight, fight, fight\u2019 for the American people.\"\nComperatore's widow, Helen, spoke to Fox News in an emotional interview about her husband's death earlier in July, demanding accountability from the Secret Service over how a gunman was able to fire off shots without intervention.\n\"We were all sitting ducks that day,\" Helen Comperatore told Fox News. \"Our blood is all over their hands. I am angry. I lost the love of my life. They screwed up.\"\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AFTERMATH, REACTIONS FROM INNER CIRCLE REVEALED IN NEW BOOK\n\"Why Butler? Why was that such a failure? Why weren't they paying attention? Why did they think that that roof didn't need covered?\" she asked. \"I want to sit down and talk to them. I have the right to. They need to listen to me.\"\nMcCormick remembered Comperatore as a heroic dad and husband who died protecting his family.\n\"Corey Comperatore\u2014a Pennsylvanian, volunteer firefighter, and father\u2014was sitting behind me. He died shielding his family. I\u2019m remembering Corey and praying for the Comperatore family on this one-year anniversary,\" the Republican Senator said.\nLongtime political reporter Salena Zito published a book in July detailing her recollections of the day, and said in an interview earlier this month with Fox Digital that she refused to duck for cover as gunshots rang out.\n\"I didn't get down,\" Zito said in an interview ahead of the book's release Tuesday. \"There was this inner voice that told me, \u2018You have a job to do, continue doing it.\u2019\"\nZito was located near the stage and the Secret Service's secure permitter when the gunman opened fire on Trump and the crowds.\n\"Time has these layers that happen,\" Zito added while reflecting on the 2024 events. \"It's not remembering them. It's experiencing them. It's this interesting thing that happens. I see a sea of navy blue suits immediately surround him. Then, I hear the second four shots. I still didn't get down.\"\nTRUMP TELLS FOX NOTICIAS HE \u2018WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE EXPLANATION\u2019 BEHIND ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS\nMcCormick told Fox Digital that recent politically-motivated attacks, including the targeted attacks and murder of a Minnesota state lawmaker in June, need to end and be replaced with civility that protects democracy.\n\"From the attempts on President Trump's life, to arson at the Pennsylvania Governor\u2019s Residence, to the murder of Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, these politically-motivated attacks are an assault on democracy itself. Regardless of party, we must choose to engage civilly. This anniversary serves as a solemn reminder that for our country, violence borne from political disagreement is never the answer,\" he said.Following the assassination attempt, Trump quickly was whisked away from the rally to receive medical attention. Just a day later, June 14, 2024, the Republican National Convention was set to kick off in Milwaukee, with concern initially mounting that Trump might not be able to attend the convention due to the injury.\nThe president, however, made his public return in Milwaukee that week while wearing a bandage over his ear. Trump officially accepted the party's nomination for him to serve as president, and delivered a 93-minute speech that was underscored by how the attempt on his life changed him.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet, in a certain way I felt very safe, because I had God on my side,\" Trump told the crowds of supporters on the final night of the RNC. \"The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had NOT moved my head at the very last instant, the assassin\u2019s bullet would have perfectly hit its mark, and I would not be with you tonight.\"\nFox News Digital's Deirdre Heavey contributed to this report."

Es ist auch eines der erkl\u00e4rten Lieblingsst\u00fccke der beiden F\u00fcrther Kom\u00f6dianten. Daher haben \"Hei\u00dfmann + Rassau\" es kurzerhand mit einer mitrei\u00dfenden und witzigen Open-Air-Inszenierung zu den Bad Kissinger Festspielen gebracht.\nMit Volker Hei\u00dfmann, Martin Rassau, Isabel Blechschmidt\nInhalt\nDer Musiktitel \"Im Salzkammergut, da kann man gut lustig sein\" ist bei \"Hei\u00dfmann + Rassau\" Programm. Die Wirtin Josepha Vogelhuber im \"Wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl\" hat mit ihren G\u00e4sten und dem Personal allerhand zu tun. Denn der charmante Oberkellner Leopold ist unsterblich in seine Chefin Josepha verliebt. Doch sie hat ihrerseits nur Augen f\u00fcr den weltm\u00e4nnischen Rechtsanwalt Dr. Siedler . Dieser flirtet jedoch seinerseits ungeniert mit der reizenden Tochter des Berliner Gro\u00dfindustriellen Giesecke - der zuf\u00e4llig leider sein Gegner in einem laufenden Rechtsstreit ist.\nAls schlie\u00dflich noch der sch\u00f6ne Sigismund mit verwegenen Flirtman\u00f6vern die wahre Liebe sucht und sich der freche Piccolo einmischt, ist das Chaos am Wolfgangsee perfekt. Weil aber \"Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl\" das Gl\u00fcck vor der T\u00fcr steht, ist trotz Turbulenzen und Eifers\u00fcchteleien ein Happy End im Ferienparadies garantiert.\nSendungsinfos\nDarsteller: Volker Hei\u00dfmann, Martin Rassau, Isabel Blechschmidt Regie: Thomas Kornmayer Musik: Thilo Wolf Orchester Autor: Hans M\u00fcller, Erik Charell Choreographie: Kati Farkas Szenenbild: Toto Mittelst\u00e4dt\nVPS: 13.07.2025 20:15, Untertitel, Stereo",

            "What Jen Pawol&rsquo;s debut means for the future of women umpires in Major League Baseball. John Yang\nJohn Yang\nSatvi Sunkara\nSatvi Sunkara\nLeave your feedback\nSaturday in Atlanta, Jen Pawol took the field as the first woman to umpire a regular-season game in Major League Baseball\u2019s nearly 150-year history. She was on the bases this afternoon for both games of a doubleheader between the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves. John Yang speaks with The Washington Post\u2019s national baseball writer Chelsea Janes for more.\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nJohn Yang:\nHistory was made in Atlanta this afternoon when Jen Pawol took the field as the first woman to umpire a regular season game in Major League Baseball's nearly 150 year history. She was on the basis for both games of a double header between the Miami Marlins and the Atlanta Braves. In tomorrow's game, she's going to behind the plate calling balls and strikes.\nEarlier, I spoke with Chelsea Janes, The Washington Post national baseball writer. I asked her how Pawol found out she'd be working today's games.\nChelsea Janes, The Washington Post:\nShe said she was in her hotel room in Nashville and got called to a conference call with two MLB officials who were in charge of umpiring. And they told her, you know, this is your moment. And she called her crew chief, so the guy who's in charge this weekend, and they started yelling over the phone. You know, a grown man who generally has to kind of maintain decorum on a baseball field, just kind of screaming into the phone with her, which is just really kind of special to hear about.\nTell me a little bit about her background. How did she become interested in umpiring?\nChelsea Janes:\nJen played college softball. She wanted to umpire from the day she first tried it, even in high school, like as a throwaway side job. And when she got done playing, she kind of looked into it, umpired high school baseball in upstate New York, even umpired college softball in New England and New York. So she was pretty much at the highest level she could get to for that and wanted more, wanted it to be a career instead of something she got paid a couple hundred bucks a weekend to do.\nSo she, you know, ended up hearing about a clinic. And at a clinic, she met a major league umpire named Ted Barrett. And he said, hey, you're pretty good at this. I also host a clinic down in Atlanta. She attended it and was funneled into the minor league system from there.\nTalk about how that works, how umpires work their way through the minor league system.\nIt used to be the kind of thing you had to sort of buy your way into these schools and prove yourself and Major League Baseball said that's. That's eliminating too many people. So they started hosting more open clinics that you could sign up for and learn, and they would evaluate you there. That's what Jen did. And she kept passing the test level by level.\nAnd a few years ago, she got promoted to AAA, which is the highest minor league level. She not only got promoted there, but she was given the championship game because she did so well.\nAnd, you know, after that, sort of got on the short list to make it to major league spring training, and this year, finally gotten this pool of umpires where if they need someone to fill in like they did this weekend, they could choose her, and they did.\nSo she's not full time in the big leagues yet. Those jobs do not come open very often. People cling to them as you would think they would, but when one opens, she's close.\nYou mentioned Ted Barrett, you mentioned her crew chief today. Has she gotten a lot of support from both former and current umpires?\nShe really has, and I think it's fair to wonder if that was going to be the case. You know, this is something that. It's very different, and it's a role where you're not used to seeing women. And, you know, even I \u2014 when I first heard about this, I was like, well, the players yell at her more. Will they yell at her less? Will they take her seriously?\nBut, you know, I think once you see her handle this, you kind of understand, oh, she handles herself in a way where you really don't notice until you think about it. And I think that's what those umpires saw too.\nYou know, you pointed out in your story in The Post that Major League Baseball almost had a robo calling balls and strikes before they had a woman calling balls and strikes. How does baseball compare with the other professional sports in this sense?\nThey're a little behind. The NBA had female referees in the late 90s. The NFL had them about a decade ago, I believe. The NHL still hasn't had one. I think that the general consensus is part of that is the breaking up fights part is a little bit tricky. Baseball was behind. She's been in the pipeline for a long time, and now there are more women there.\nBut, yeah, they've tested automatic balls and strikes, and they're going to introduce them on a limited basis. But, yeah, they got farther with that more quickly than they did with women. And, you know, I don't think that's too surprising.\nTalk about that pipeline. Are there more women coming up there?\nAre there are, I believe, six umpires in the minor leagues right now. I believe that's counting Jen Pawol. They're being vetted the same way that Jen was and that the male umpires are. You probably won't see them at these levels for quite some time. It just takes a while.\nBut yeah, there's more women following in her footsteps, and I think there's reason to believe that we'll see more of them in the big league soon.\nIn the past, a woman had come close to making the majors. Is that right?\nPam Postima came really close in the late 80s and just didn't find a league that was receptive to her. She's been in touch with Jen Pawol throughout this process, and Jen said that when she got promoted to AAA a little over a year ago, she went to dinner with Pam and the last thing Pam said to her was, get it done. You know, get it done.\nAnd so when she got the call this week, you know, Jen said she texted her, you know, I'm getting it done.\nYou talked about how the umpires saw what she does and have supported her. Any sense of the minor leagues, of what the players have reacted?\nShe shared a story about one third baseman who heard the news this week and said, hey, we've done this at every level and I'll see you in the big leagues, you know, and I think they respect it. I've only seen people be really polite and go over and fist bumper like they do everyone else.\nBut I think people also, a little bit, even have their eye on her, like, hey, you know, go do this and. And so I think it's been kind of a really pleasant surprise to see the support she's gotten.\nChelsea Janes of the Washington Post, thank you very much.\nThanks for having me.\nWatch the Full Episode\nJohn Yang is the anchor of PBS News Weekend and a correspondent for the PBS News Hour.

            "Christine Brennan&#8217;s new book &#8216;On Her Game&#8217; chronicles rise of Caitlin Clark. Amna Nawaz\nAmna Nawaz\nCourtney Norris\nCourtney Norris\nLeave your feedback\nFrom college stardom at Iowa to shattering attendance records and becoming a top financial driver for the WNBA, Caitlin Clark\u2019s rise has also come with its fair share of controversy. Clark is in many ways just getting started and a new book takes a deeper look at how she got there. Amna Nawaz spoke with Christine Brennan about \u201cOn Her Game: Caitlin Clark and the Revolution in Women's Sports.\"\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nAmna Nawaz:\nShe's one of the biggest names in all of sports today, and a new book takes a deeper look at how Caitlin Clark got there.\nFrom college stardom at Iowa to shattering attendance records and now as a top financial driver for the WNBA, Clark's rise and her arrival to the league have come with some controversy.\nI talked with sportswriter Christine Brennan about her book \"On Her Game: Caitlin Clark and the Revolution in Women's Sports,\" and asked her how and why playing for the University of Iowa helped to make Clark a superstar.\nChristine Brennan, Author, \"On Her Game: Caitlin Clark and the Revolution in Women's Sports\": Because, at Iowa, she could shoot from anywhere and everywhere, including the next county and the parking lot.\nAnd it would go in. She's the high-wire act in that way. She's a basketball player, of course, as you know, but she is also an entertainer. And I think the allure and the reason Caitlin Clark is Caitlin Clark, and obviously other women's basketball players over the years have not risen to this transcendent figure in our culture, is because she does have those incredible shots, passes, et cetera.\nWell, that, of course, is where Caitlin Clark was able to do that, at Iowa. If you have her go to Notre Dame, which she actually committed, a soft commit, Muffet McGraw, her coach there, said to me for the book, she said, if she'd come here, it would have been different.\nYes.\nChristine Brennan:\nShe wouldn't have been able to just shoot threes left and right. The team around her would have been different. Yukon as well, she would have been a cog in a great machine, those schools being perennial favorites, whereas Iowa hadn't been to the Final Four a long time.\nIt's incredible how, by Caitlin making that decision to stay home, everything changed.\nShe goes on to break scoring records. She has at least 11 NIL deals, you report in the book, worth more than $3 million by the time she's done with college.\nBut, in the book, I was surprised, you really go hard after the league, after the WNBA, for what you say is being unprepared for her arrival. The league itself and also not preparing the players. You write about a call that you have with the WNBA official.\nAnd you write:\n\"What was I hearing in that WNBA's official's voice? Not happiness, not anticipation, not excitement. No, it was something else.\"\nWhat was it? What do you think they got wrong?\nYou have got people barnstorming \u2014 Caitlin is barnstorming around the country. You have got people lined up in January and February for games, the TV ratings, four million more people watching the women's final with Caitlin Clark in South Carolina than watched the men the next night.\nI mean, that's a sentence I thought I could never utter. And here it's all coming to the WNBA. And as that official told me, I said, do you realize how big this is? And this person said, yes, this is the biggest thing to happen to the WNBA since Maya Moore.\nWe heard from several people saying the players were having some tough times dealing with this, or Sheila Johnson, of course, talks about that would be hurt feelings if Caitlin Clark winning an award, but the other players not. So if the league had been more prepared \u2014 and these are not necessarily my words.\nDr. Harry Edwards, the great civil rights leader, the man who was the impetus for the Black power salute at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, and Briana Scurry, the great goalkeeper, their words in the book, I'm so appreciative that they talked to me about, you have to understand that a 74 percent Black league, and you have now got a white woman who's becoming the biggest star they have ever had.\nIn our polarized society today, we can see that could be an issue. I can understand that. We all do. And so if the league, as Harry Edwards says, seminars, Zoom calls, talk to the players, explain to these wonderful players that she's coming along after them, and that this is that opportunity, and you were there to start this process.\nAnd that's where the WNBA failed the players, according to Dr. Harry Edwards.\nAnd, as you know, a lot of the conversation around the hits she takes, around some of the rivalries that followed her from college to the league do break down along racial lines, because this is a league, as you mentioned, built on the backs and run by, dominated by Black women athletes here.\nYou get pulled into this in one reporting incident too. There's a clip that goes viral, a player named DiJonai Carrington who accidentally hits Clark in the eye during a game, and you ask her about that moment, whether she intended to, what that play was about. And the Players Association comes after you.\nThey issue a very strong statement. They accuse you of trying to bait an athlete into participating in a narrative that's false, designed to fuel racist, homophobic, misogynistic vitriol. They call for your credentials to be pulled. What did you take away from that interaction? And I know you respond in the book, but I want to give you a chance to respond here as well.\nSure. No, thank you. And, obviously, that failed. I did not lose my credentials.\nRight.\nI have asked tough questions of athletes, male and female, for years. Was the Players Association saying that these female athletes couldn't handle those questions, that we shouldn't be asking similar questions?\nAnd you ask a specific question, Amna, to give that athlete the chance to hit it out of the park, to take it any which way she wants. And what was happening online was terrible. We know that Twitter/X is a cesspool. It's worse for women than men, and it's certainly worse for Black women than white women.\nAnd there were millions of responses and tweets and posts talking about DiJonai Carrington, accusing her of going after Caitlin Clark. How do you, as a journalist, try to get an answer, which also then gives the athlete the chance to clear the air? You ask the specific question. That's exactly what I did.\nAnd I do feel a sadness for the league as I'm reporting this, I'm a journalist, I'm reporting it, but as someone who's cared about women's sports, for years and covered the WNBA these years, that they weren't more prepared for the national scrutiny that was coming.\nHow on earth is DiJonai Carrington not prepared to be able to answer that question without getting angry that it was asked? And, again, it's something that most pro athletes understand. They have been helped by their leagues or their players association, whatever, their agent, to the point where they know you get a question like that, you want that question because then you can clear the air.\nAnd that's all that was.\nUnderscoring all of your reporting in this book is the idea of the business of the game around Caitlin Clark and how it has completely changed with her arrival at the WNBA.\nYou note that the videos that the Indiana Fever produced have been top among all the Major Leagues. No team in the NBA, NFL, MLB or WNBA got more video views, ticket sales, jersey sales all up exponentially. The impact beyond just her team though, are we seeing that? Is this a sense of like a rising tide lifting all boats?\nWe saw a statistic just a few weeks ago that I think tells the story, not in the book because it just happened. Caitlin Clark, when she was injured the first time, missed five games. And during those five games, more than half of the viewership of the entire WNBA, not just the Fever, but the entire WNBA, more than half, disappeared, meaning that when Caitlin Clark is gone, more than half of the audience goes.\nYou now have tangible proof of just the importance of Caitlin Clark, is that, when she is gone, then more than half the viewership leaves the league. That is wonderful actually to know for the players as they go into the collective bargaining agreement, because she is, as you said, the economic rocket ship leading the way.\nUse her. You can \u2014 she's obviously a player that you will all make more money and have a better contract knowing the power of Caitlin Clark and knowing that that light shines on her, and it also shines on all the other players.\nThe book is \"On Her Game: Caitlin Clark and the Revolution in Women's Sports.\" The author is Christine Brennan.\nChristine, always great to see you.

            "Is Trump tariff deal really a win for Vietnam \u2013 or a way of punishing China?. As news spread that Vietnam would become just the second nation to reach an initial tariff agreement with Washington, shares in the clothing companies and manufacturers that have a large footprint in the country rose with optimism.\nJust hours later though, they declined sharply, as it became clear that the devil would be in the detail, and the most striking part of the deal might in fact be aimed at Vietnam\u2019s powerful neighbour China.\nDodging the severe levy of 46% that was threatened in April, Vietnam is instead facing a tariff of 20% for many goods, and in return US products coming into the country will have zero tariffs placed on them.\nHowever, a 40% tariff will remain for so-called transshipments \u2013 a provision that is aimed at Chinese companies accused of passing their products through Vietnam, or elsewhere, to avoid US tariffs.\nBusinesses worry that \u201ctransshipment\u201d is a politicised term, and that if the US defines it too broadly, many goods could be unfairly targeted.\n\u201cVietnam is a manufacturing hub \u2013 and as a hub you take inputs from other countries and make value-added stuff in Vietnam, and then export it to other countries,\u201d says Dr Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.\nIt is unrealistic, he adds, to expect most Vietnamese goods, other than agricultural products, would be made entirely in Vietnam. What remains to be decided is: what proportion of a product should be?\nHow transshipments will be defined under the agreement \u2013 and how this policy will be enforced \u2013 remains to be seen, but it could have significant implications for global trade and tensions with China.\n\u201cOne lesson for other countries is that the US intends to use these deals to apply pressure on China,\u201d said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator.\nVietnam, a booming manufacturing hub, benefited during the last Trump administration when punishing tariffs placed on China prompted many Chinese companies to shift their supply chains.\nHowever, this caused the Vietnamese trade surplus with the US to surge, attracting US ire and allegations that Vietnam was wrongly acting as a conduit for Chinese companies wanting access to the US market.\nChina\u2019s commerce ministry spokesperson He Yongqian responded to the US-Vietnam deal on Thursday stating: \u201cWe firmly oppose any party reaching a deal at the expense of China\u2019s interests. If such a situation occurs, China will resolutely counter it to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\u201d\nVietnam\u2019s manufacturing industry is closely intertwined with both the US and China. US exports account for 30% of Vietnam\u2019s GDP, while China is Vietnam\u2019s top import source, relied on for raw materials used to make anything from footwear to furniture and electronics.\nVietnam is not alone in relying on China for such components, especially across electronic sectors. \u201c[China] is completely interwoven into global supply chains,\u201d says Dan Martin, international business adviser at Dezan Shira and Associates, based in Hanoi.\nIf companies are expected to prove the origin of all goods, this could place an unwelcome burden on those in sectors such as textiles where margins are low, says Martin.\nHowever, he cautions that it remains to be seen whether the higher 40% tariff on transshipments will be actively enforced. It is also possible that Vietnam could benefit if US policy encourages suppliers to set up shop in Vietnam, Martin adds.\nBusinesses are largely pausing decisions until a clearer picture emerges, say analysts.\nPolicymakers in Hanoi remain on a diplomatic tightrope. Vietnam has long sought to balance relations with Washington and Beijing. It considers the US not only a key export market but a security partner that serves as a counterbalance to China\u2019s assertiveness.\nHowever, if Beijing considers that Hanoi is helping Washington constrain it, this risks antagonising Vietnam\u2019s northern neighbour. It could lead to economic measures from China, or pressure over the disputed South China Sea, a major flashpoint in the region, says Peter Mumford, head of practice for south-east Asia at Eurasia Group.\nAs things stand, \u201caggressive retaliation\u201d by Beijing against Hanoi is unlikely, he says: \u201cHanoi may even have given Beijing a rough indication of the steps it would have to take to secure a US trade deal.\u201d\nVietnam has made efforts to show goodwill towards China over recent months, while also courting Trump.\nIn exchange for the 20% tariff rate, Trump said Vietnam would open up its market to US goods. US-made SUVs, \u201cwhich do so well in the United States, will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam\u201d, said Trump.\nHowever the market for cars remains small in Vietnam, where city streets are famously crammed with millions of motorbikes.",

There's added pressure from President Donald Trump over Vietnam\u2019s trade surplus with the U.S., a reflection of its astounding economic trajectory.\nIn 1990, the average Vietnamese could afford about $1,200 worth of goods and services a year, adjusted for local prices. Today, that figure has risen by more than 13 times to $16,385.\nVietnam's transformation into a global manufacturing hub with shiny new highways, high-rise skylines and a booming middle class has lifted millions of its people from poverty, similar to China.

Once-quiet suburbs have been replaced with industrial parks where trucks rumble through sprawling logistics hubs that serve global brands.\nVietnam ran a $123.5 billion trade surplus with the U.S. trade in 2024, angering Trump, who threatened a 46% U.S. import tax on Vietnamese goods. The two sides appear to have settled on a 20% levy, and twice that for goods suspected of being transshipped, or routed through Vietnam to avoid U.S. trade restrictions.\nDuring negotiations with the Trump administration, Vietnam's focus was on its tariffs compared to those of its neighbors and competitors, said Daniel Kritenbrink, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. \u201cAs long as they\u2019re in the same zone, in the same ballpark, I think Vietnam can live with that outcome,\" he said. But he added questions remain over how much Chinese content in those exports might be too much and how such goods will be taxed.\nVietnam was preparing to shift its economic policies even before Trump's tariffs threatened its model of churning out low-cost exports for the world, aware of what economists call the \u201cmiddle-income trap,\u201d when economies tend to plateau without major reforms.\nTo move beyond that, South Korea bet on electronics, Taiwan on semiconductors, and Singapore on finance, said Richard McClellan, founder of the consultancy RMAC Advisory.\nBut Vietnam's economy today is more diverse and complex than those countries were at the time and it can\u2019t rely on just one winning sector to drive long-term growth and stay competitive as wages rise and cheap labor is no longer its main advantage.\nIt needs to make \u201cmultiple big bets,\u201d McClellan said.\nFollowing China's lead, Vietnam is counting on high-tech sectors like computer chips, artificial intelligence and renewable energy, providing strategic tax breaks and research support in cities like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Danang.\nIt's also investing heavily in infrastructure, including civilian nuclear plants and a $67 billion North\u2013South high-speed railway, that will cut travel time from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City to eight hours.\nVietnam also aspires to become a global financial center. The government plans two special financial centers, in bustling Ho Chi Minh City and in the seaside resort city of Danang, with simplified rules to attract foreign investors, tax breaks, support for financial tech startups, and easier ways to settle business disputes.\nUnderpinning all of this is institutional reform. Ministries are being merged, low-level bureaucracies have been eliminated and Vietnam's 63 provinces will be consolidated into 34 to build regional centers with deeper talent pools.\nVietnam is counting on private businesses to lead its new economic push \u2014 a seismic shift from the past.\nIn May, the Communist Party passed Resolution 68. It calls private businesses the \u201cmost important force\u201d in the economy, pledging to break away from domination by state-owned and foreign companies.\nSo far, large multinationals have powered Vietnam's exports, using imported materials and parts and low cost local labor. Local companies are stuck at the low-end of supply chains, struggling to access loans and markets that favored the 700-odd state-owned giants, from colonial-era beer factories with arched windows to unfashionable state-run shops that few customers bother to enter.\n\u201cThe private sector remains heavily constrained,\" said Nguyen Khac Giang of Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute.\nAgain emulating China, Vietnam wants \u201cnational champions\u201d to drive innovation and compete globally, not by picking winners, but by letting markets decide. The policy includes easier loans for companies investing in new technology, priority in government contracts for those meeting innovation goals, and help for firms looking to expand overseas. Even mega-projects like the North-South High-Speed Rail, once reserved for state-run giants, are now open to private bidding.\nBy 2030, Vietnam hopes to elevate at least 20 private firms to a global scale.

Soon, they found that their \u2018disabled\u2019 neighbor kept parking her car in their driveway because she had some sort of agreement with the previous owner. Annoyed and frustrated, the new tenant decided to stand their ground and protect their space, all to the fury of their neighbor. Scroll down for the full story.\nHaving good neighbors is a blessing. However, the reality is that some folks are very bad at communicating and will ignore even basic boundaries\nImage credits: EyeEm/Freepik (not the actual photo)\nOne person, who had just moved into the area, shared how a neighbor of theirs felt entitled to their driveway. She wouldn\u2019t take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer\nImage credits: bilanol/Envato (not the actual photo)\nImage credits: Morstoor\nIt\u2019s important to be empathetic and to listen to the other person\u2019s perspective genuinely. That being said, remember to stand up for your interests, too\nImage credits: Nathan Anderson/Unsplash (not the actual photo)\nIt usually pays to be diplomatic when dealing with neighbor issues\u2026 at least at first. Look at your relationships with your neighbors as a long-term investment. Unless you plan on moving in the very near future, it\u2019s best to get along as best as you can. Be empathetic. And yet, don\u2019t be a total pushover either.\nThat means that when conflicts and disagreements happen (they inevitably will, given enough time), you should be friendly but firm, calm, and collected.\nBeing aggressive, overly judgmental, or holier-than-thou isn\u2019t going to work well. That\u2019s because you\u2019ll only make the other person overly defensive. They\u2019ll be more willing to stand their ground instead of trying to get on the same page as you. It\u2019s hard to look for compromises with someone who feels personally attacked.\nShowing a bit of empathy can also help in these situations (even if you\u2019re completely in the right and they\u2019re totally wrong).\nThat being said, if your neighbor keeps ignoring your boundaries and doesn\u2019t give a damn about how their behavior affects you, it\u2019s time to escalate things.\nIf having a friendly chat with your neighbor doesn\u2019t resolve the issue, it\u2019s time to escalate the situation step by step\nImage credits: stockscar/Envato (not the actual photo)\nExplain the consequences of what will happen if they continue on this path. This isn\u2019t the time to be vague. Be very clear. If they continue being unreasonable, follow through with your consequences.\nAlso, think about getting in touch with your local homeowners association, if you have one, to mediate the conflict. Alternatively, if what your neighbor is doing is illegal, contact the authorities.\nIf your neighbor has damaged your property or hurt you, don\u2019t hesitate to seek legal representation. There\u2019s nothing quite like legal consequences to get someone to turn a new page.\nThe United Kingdom government suggests taking the following steps when trying to resolve any neighborly disputes:\nFirst, try to solve the issue informally by talking to your neighbor\n-\nTalk to the person\u2019s landlord if they happen to be a tenant and don\u2019t own the property\n-\nIf raising the problem informally doesn\u2019t work, use a mediation service\n-\nIf the issue is statutory, like loud music or barking dogs, make a complaint to your local council\n-\nIf your neighbor is breaking the law, behaving violently, or harassing you, immediately contact the police\n-\nTake legal action as a last resort\n-\nWhat are your thoughts about the entire situation, dear Pandas? Do you think the author of the post was right to stand their ground, or do you think they should have allowed their neighbor to continue using their driveway?

            "Neighbours\u2019 parking and privacy fears over Bicester 72 homes and care home plan. Neighbours have raised parking and privacy fears about new plans for 72 new homes and a care home on the outskirts of Bicester.\nCountryside Properties (Bicester) Limited submitted the application to build the homes as well as a 75-bedroom care home on the former agricultural land west of Oxford Road, south of Bicester town centre.\nThe new homes would be part of the Kingsmere development for up to 1,585 homes, a local centre, schools, a hotel and other amenities, which was granted outline planning permission in 2008.\nThe plans were lodged to Cherwell District Council last month, and have received a number of comments from concerned locals.\nREAD MORE: Banbury taxi driver loses licence after inappropriate behaviour\nKevin Cerboni commented that the new homes would be \u201cfar too close\u201d to his property, and that he was led to believe a field would remain next to the east fence as a buffer to his home and future developments.\nHe added: \u201cYears of construction will bring a lot of dust and noise, especially if buildings are built as close as this to my property.\n\u201cWincanton Road is already heavily congested and often blocked due to retail traffic and lack of coach parking.\n\u201cAdding more homes and a care home will make this worse.\n\u201cThere is already not enough parking in Kingsmere town centre for the current development. Kingsmere needs better green spaces.\u201d\nAdam English said he was excited about the development as a whole, but that the impact on residents of Wincanton Road should be examined.\nHe added: \u201cI'm also concerned that after the project is completed, there will be a severe traffic bottleneck on Wincanton Road with it being the only access point for residents.\n\u201cIt is not uncommon for Wincanton Road to be partially blocked by parked cars.\n\u201cI have personally seen bin collection vehicles fail to reach the end of the road due to partial blockages of parked cars.\n\u201cI'd hate to think what would happen if an emergency vehicle could not access the development, especially with a care home involved.\n\u201cI don't believe Wincanton Road is wide enough to be suitable as the only access.\u201d\nHe added that he was told a health facility was planned, not a care home.\nVictoria Wakefield said Wincanton Road \u201cis not suitable for heavy plant and construction vehicles\u201d and that she was \u201cconcerned for the safety of children and the elderly\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cI've lived in Chester Road for four years and Wincanton Road is yet to be completed or maintained.\n\u201cI am concerned that if the application is passed this will delay the final road surface being completed further.\u201d\nHelp support trusted local news\nSign up for a digital subscription now: https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/subscribe/\nAs a digital subscriber you will get:\nUnlimited access to the Oxford Mail website\n-\nAdvert-light access\n-\nReader rewards\n-\nFull access to our app\n-\nSubscriptions from Oxford Mail Subscribe to the Oxford Mail\nThe NHS Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West Integrated Care Board (ICB) also objected to the plans unless the developer contributes \u00a3133,210 towards creating further capacity at Montgomery House Surgery, or to use a Section 106 agreement for a primary care estates project to serve the development.\nTheir response added that the number of homes \u201cwill impact on primary health care infrastructure as there is insufficient capacity to accommodate the additional patients\u201d, and that this \u201ccannot be absorbed by the nearby GP Practices\u201d.\nPaul Troop, chair of the Bicester Bike Users Group, commented on the plans asking for the county council highways officer to be made aware of concerns about pedestrian and cycling connectivity to the development before they respond to the consultation.\nThe consultation on the plans will close next Wednesday, July 16, and comments can be submitted on the planning portal under the reference number: 25/01444/HYBRID.",
            "'Our homes were taken for a road that was never built'. 'Our homes were taken for a road that was never built'\nIn October 2024 the government announced it was cancelling a project to widen part of the A1 in Northumberland, years after its National Highways agency had spent more than \u00a34m on the purchase of houses and land in the way of the scheme.\nThe affected families - including one couple who had to start afresh miles away in Cumbria - said they had \"been through hell\" as they saw their properties \"left to rot\" unnecessarily.\nMelanie Wensby-Scott sat in her car and cried on the day she and her husband left Northgate House, which sits right next to the road not far from Morpeth.\nThe couple had been packing up the last of their belongings and she was still running the vacuum cleaner around when the agency's contractors arrived.\n\"They started boarding up the windows and changing the locks,\" she said. \"I honestly felt like we were being evicted.\"\nMelanie and her husband Julian had had \"big plans\" when they bought the house in 2009.\n\"We put in a new kitchen, new bathrooms, we were planning a new conservatory and we had no intention of ever leaving,\" she said.\nBut in 2014, the then Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to dual a 13-mile section of the A1 and it became clear their house was in the path of the chosen route.\n\"When they first came round I said I didn't want to move and they basically said I had no option,\" said Mrs Wensby-Scott.\n\"It was just awful to know you were going to lose your home.\"\nThe A1 scheme stalled for a few years, alternating between ready to start and still on hold until, in May 2024, Rishi Sunak's government approved the Development Consent Order which gave the final go-ahead.\nHowever, Labour swept back into power two months later and cancelled the project in October 2024, stating it had to make \"difficult decisions about road schemes which were unfunded or unaffordable\".\nMrs Wensby-Scott said: \"When I heard the news, I just thought 'oh my God all that for nothing'.\n\"Everything we went through, the heartache, the angst, I just couldn't believe it.\n\"You drive past now and it's falling apart, it just looks awful. It's such a shame, it was such a beautiful house.\"\nAt the other end of the proposed route, Felicity and James Hester were living in East Cottage near the village of Rock.\nIt was a \"perfect place\" for them because it had a paddock and stabling for their horses, but they soon realised the bulldozers were heading their way.\n\"It was just horrible,\" Mrs Hester said. \"We went through four or five years of utter hell trying to find somewhere we could actually move to, it was just a nightmare.\n\"The way the property market was at the time in Northumberland, we couldn't find anything which matched what we had so we had to move to Cumbria.\n\"Now we're a couple of hours away from all the friends we had.\"\nNext to East Cottage is Charlton Mires, a large 200-year-old farmhouse and steadings that had been the home of the Beal family since 1904, but would also need to be flattened for road building.\nMartin Beal described its loss as \"very painful\".\n\"I felt like I'd let my family down somehow because I couldn't save our home,\" he said. \"There are just so many memories in there.\n\"They were also taking part of our land, so I couldn't plan ahead. I had sleepless nights, it was very hard.\"\nA freedom of information request by the BBC revealed that more than \u00a368m had already been spent on the A1 scheme by the time it was cancelled, and that figure continues to rise by just under \u00a330,000 a month.\nThat is partly because National Highways is obliged to pay insurance and council tax on the unneeded properties, including an empty house premium.\nLand agent Louis Fell, who represented the Hester and Beal families, described the situation as \"a mess\"\nHe said: \"I know National Highways didn't make the decision to cancel the road, but they need to have a strategy for the properties, perhaps consider refurbishing them and renting them to young families.\n\"For them just to sit here rotting is such a waste of money and it's not a good look for an area popular with tourists.\"\nNational Highways previously said it was \"sympathetic\" to Mr Beal's situation after delays to payments for his property.\nIn a statement, it said: \"We carefully review expenditure on all our projects to ensure that lessons are learned and processes are improved for any future road improvement schemes.\n\"Discussions surrounding the future of the homes purchased as part of this scheme remain ongoing and will be communicated in due course.\n\"The properties are being managed by our estates team until a strategy is agreed.\n\"During this time, the properties will be secured by our maintenance contractor and inspected on an appropriate basis.\"\nUnder what are known as the Crichel Down rules, in situations like this the properties should be offered back to the owners, but all three families say they do not wish to go back to homes which have been empty for several years.\nMartin Beal said his former home was \"full of damp and falling apart\".\nHe now has permission to build a new farmhouse nearby but when it is built, because it is a direct replacement for Charlton Mires, planning arrangements mean the original farmhouse has to be demolished at a cost to the taxpayer of an estimated \u00a3100,000.\n\"It has been there for 200 years, it's a beautiful house. It is just ridiculous it has to be demolished for nothing,\" Mr Beal lamented.\n\"I'm just so angry about everything my parents and I have been through, and all those millions of pounds wasted for what?\"\nFollow BBC North East on X and Facebook and BBC Cumbria on X and Facebook and both on Nextdoor and Instagram."

            "World leader refuses to 'humiliate' himself with Trump trade negotiations. As President Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs go into effect, Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva remains staunchly opposed to making deals with the U.S. The South American leader has been an outspoken critic of U.S. tariffs, which he sees as a bullying tactic.\n\"The day my intuition says Trump is ready to talk, I won't hesitate to call him,\" Lula told Reuters. \"But today my intuition says he doesn't want to talk. And I won't humiliate myself.\"\nMore than 60 countries and the European Union were hit with new tariffs just after midnight on Thursday. While the baseline rate is 10%, select nations, like Brazil, face additional penalties that push the total tariff up to 50%.\nIn the past, Lula slammed Trump\u2019s tariffs as \"unacceptable blackmail.\"\nTRUMP'S GLOBAL RESET OF TRADE RELATIONSHIPS WILL REMAIN IN THE SPOTLIGHT THIS WEEK\nOn July 31, one day after announcing an additional 40% tariff on Brazil, Trump said that Lula \"can talk to me anytime he wants.\" The Brazilian president seemed to respond in a post on X without mentioning Trump by name. He said that his country has \"always been open to dialogue.\"\n\"The ones who determine Brazil's direction are the Brazilians and their institutions. At this moment, we are working to protect our economy, businesses, and workers, and to respond to the tariff measures of the U.S. government,\" Lula wrote.\nTRUMP CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE END TO \u2018UNJUST\u2019 TRIAL OF FORMER BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JAIR BOLSONARO\nThe dispute between Trump and Lula goes deeper than trade deals. The White House has been open about its opposition to Brazil\u2019s treatment of its former President Jair Bolsonaro.\nThis was emphasized in an executive order that Trump signed last month in which he decried \"the Government of Brazil\u2019s politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship, and prosecution\" of Bolsonaro.\nLula told Reuters that Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court \"does not care what Trump says, and it should not.\" He also reportedly said that Bolsonaro was a \"traitor to the homeland\" who should face another trial for provoking Trump\u2019s intervention.\n\"But this now is not a small intervention. It's the president of the United States thinking he can dictate rules for a sovereign country like Brazil. It's unacceptable,\" Lula said.\nBRAZIL\u2019S EX-PRESIDENT AND MAJOR TRUMP ALLY BOLSONARO PLACED ON HOUSE ARREST\nBolsonaro, who was defeated by Lula in 2022, was recently placed under house arrest amid ongoing legal proceedings over his alleged attempt to overturn the country's presidential election results.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBrazil\u2019s president is seemingly unafraid of entering negotiations with Trump. Though he said that there were no pending reciprocal tariffs, Lula told Reuters he was planning to call the leaders of BRICS member states to discuss a possible joint response to the U.S.\nAdditionally, according to Reuters, Lula said Brazil was looking at joining a collective complaint with other countries at the World Trade Organization.",
            "Trump announces 50% tariff on Brazil, citing a \u2018witch-hunt\u2019 against Bolsonaro. Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that his administration will hit Brazil with a 50% tariff on products sent to the US, tying the move to what he called the \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d trial against its former president, Jair Bolsonaro.\nPosting letters on Truth Social, the US president had earlier in the day targeted seven other countries \u2013 the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka \u2013 for stiff US tariffs on foreign exports starting on 1 August.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump avoided his standard form letter with Brazil, and criticized the trial Bolsonaro is facing over trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.\n\u201cThis Trial should not be taking place,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social on Wednesday. \u201cIt is a witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\u201d\nHe said the 50% tariffs on Brazil would be \u201cseparate from all sectoral tariffs\u201d.\nAfter the news, Brazil\u2019s real currency added to earlier losses to fall more than 2% against the dollar.\nBrazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, rejected Trump\u2019s demand that legal proceedings against Bolsonaro be dropped and his claim that a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports was necessary to close a trade deficit that does not, in fact, exist.\nIn a statement posted on social media and his government\u2019s website, the Brazilian president responded, point by point, to the claims made by Trump in a letter addressed to him earlier on Wednesday.\n\u201cBrazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage,\u201d Lula began.\nHe then pointed out that the charges against Bolsonaro, for allegedly plotting to remain in power after losing his bid for re-election, \u201cfall exclusively under the jurisdiction of Brazil\u2019s Judicial Branch and, as such, are not subject to any interference or threats that could compromise the independence of national institutions\u201d.\nTrump also objected to Brazil\u2019s supreme court fining of social media companies such as Twitter/X, saying the temporary blocking last year amounted to \u201cSECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders\u201d. Trump said he is launching an investigation as a result under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to companies with trade practices that are deemed unfair to US companies.\nLula also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that Brazil\u2019s efforts to regulate the operations of US social media platforms on its territory in accordance with its own laws are not, as Trump had claimed, a form of censorship.\n\u201cBrazilian society rejects hateful content, racism, child pornography, scams, fraud, and speeches against human rights and democratic freedom\u201d Lula wrote. \u201cIn Brazil, freedom of expression must not be confused with aggression or violent practices. All companies\u2014whether domestic or foreign\u2014must comply with Brazilian law in order to operate within our territory.\u201d\nThe US president had been scheduled to hike tariffs on dozens of countries on Wednesday. Earlier this week he announced a fresh three-week delay, to 1 August, but started announcing new rates that countries would face unless they strike a deal with the White House.\nAfter announcing plans on Monday for US tariffs of up to 40% on goods imported from 14 countries, including Bangladesh, Japan and South Korea, Trump wrote to the leaders of more countries on Wednesday, and published each letter.\nHe claimed exporters in Algeria, Iraq, Libya and Sri Lanka would face a US tariff of 30%, while exporters in Brunei, Moldova and the Philippines would face a 25% tariff.\n\u201cThese Tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your Country,\u201d Trump wrote. A string of delays and rate changes have frustrated businesses in the US and around the world.\nOn Tuesday, Trump vowed to introduce US tariffs of up to 200% on foreign drugs and 50% on copper, propelling US prices of the latter to record highs.\nBut appearing alongside the leaders of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania and Senegal at the White House on Wednesday, the president indicated that the five African nations were unlikely to face US tariffs as they intended to lower their own tariffs on US exports.\nThe US president\u2019s latest threats have heightened fears that his erratic trade strategy risks exacerbating inflation across the US, having repeatedly pledged on the campaign trail to bring down prices rapidly.\nTrump appears aware of this apprehension. \u201cI brought down costs more than any President in recorded history,\u201d he wrote on social media late on Tuesday. \u201cThe Crooked Democrats are using the opposite narrative, even though they know it is a total LIE.\u201d\nAnalysis by Oxford Economics indicated that the US effective tariff rate on imports from overseas would rise to about 20% after the latest tariff letters. \u201cThat is up from 17% but less than our recession threshold of 25%-28%,\u201d said Michael Pearce, its deputy US economist at Oxford Economics.\n\u201cOur assumption is that most countries will secure a deal or extension to avoid tariff increases,\u201d said Pearce. \u201cHowever, the risks are skewed toward higher rates.\u201d\nWhile Trump and his allies have sought to pressure the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates, the central bank\u2019s top officials \u2013 led by its chair, Jerome Powell \u2013 have so far refused, as they wait to see the impact of his tariffs on the economy.\nMinutes taken from the Fed\u2019s latest rate-setting meeting, released on Wednesday, disclosed that only \u201ca couple\u201d of its officials said they felt interest rates could fall as soon as its next meeting, later this month.\n\u201cMost participants\u201d at the Fed meeting \u2013 at which rates were kept on hold last month \u2013 anticipated rate cuts later this year, according to the minutes, with any price shock caused by Trump\u2019s tariffs expected to be \u201ctemporary or modest\u201d.\nRobert Mackey contributed reporting",
            "President Trump tariffs goods from Brazil at 50%. President Trump tariffs goods from Brazil at 50%\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump singled out Brazil for import taxes of 50% on Wednesday for its treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, showing that personal grudges rather than simple economics are a driving force in the U.S. leader\u2019s use of tariffs.\nTrump avoided his standard form letter with Brazil, specifically tying his tariffs to the trial of Bolsonaro, who is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.\n\u201cThis Trial should not be taking place,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social. \u201cIt is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\u201d\nThere is a sense of kinship as Trump was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. president addressed his tariff letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who bested Bolsonaro in 2022.\nLula responded in a forceful statement that said Trump\u2019s tariffs would trigger the country\u2019s economic reciprocity law, which allows trade, investment and intellectual property agreements to be suspended against countries that harm Brazil\u2019s competitiveness.\nHe noted that the U.S. has had a trade surplus of more than $410 billion with Brazil over the past 15 years.\n\u201cBrazil is a sovereign country with independent institutions that will not accept being taken for granted by anyone,\u201d Lula said.\nBolsonaro testified before the country\u2019s Supreme Court in June over the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. Judges will hear from 26 other defendants in the coming months, and legal analysts say a decision could come as early as September. The country\u2019s electoral authorities have already barred Bolsonaro from running for office until 2030.\nThe former president did not comment about Trump\u2019s tariff decision on his social media channels, but wrote that he is being politically persecuted.\nIn his statement, Lula defended the country\u2019s legal system, saying the \u201cproceedings against those who planned the coup d\u2019etat is a competence of the Brazilian judiciary and is not subject to interference or threats that harm the independence of national institutions.\u201d\nFor Trump, the tariffs are personal\nTrump also objected to Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court fining of social media companies, saying the temporary blocking last year amounted to \u201cSECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders.\u201d Trump said he is launching an investigation as a result under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to countries with trade practices that are deemed unfair to U.S. companies.\nAmong the companies the Supreme Court fined was X, which was not mentioned specifically in Trump\u2019s letter. X is owned by Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s multibillionaire backer in the 2024 election whose time leading Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency recently ended and led to a public feud over the U.S. president\u2019s deficit-increasing budget plan. Trump also owns a social media company, Truth Social.\n\u201cIn Brazil, freedom of speech is not mistaken by aggression or violent behavior,\u201d Lula said in his statement. \u201cTo operate in our country, every company, local or foreign, must be subjected to Brazilian legislation.\u201d\nBrazilian lawmakers allied with Lula blamed Bolsonaro and two of his sons, congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro and Sen. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, for Trump\u2019s tariff action. Sen. Lindbergh Farias, the whip of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party in the Senate, said on social media that the Bolsonaros \u201cmust be very happy to harm Brazil, our economy and our jobs.\u201d\nThe Brazil letter was a reminder that politics and personal relations with Trump matter just as much as any economic fundamentals. And while Trump has said the high tariff rates he\u2019s setting are based on trade imbalances, it was unclear by his Wednesday actions how the countries being targeted would help to reindustrialize America.\nThe tariffs starting Aug. 1 would be a dramatic increase from the 10% rate that Trump levied on Brazil as part of his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement. In addition to oil, Brazil sells orange juice, coffee, iron and steel to the U.S., among other products. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau.\nTrump initially announced his broad tariffs by declaring an economic emergency, arguing under a 1977 law that the U.S. was at risk because of persistent trade imbalances. But that rationale becomes problematic in this particular case, as Trump is linking his tariffs to the Bolsonaro trial and the U.S. exports more to Brazil than it imports.\nTrump also targeted smaller trade partners\nTrump also sent letters Wednesday to the leaders of seven other nations. None of them \u2014 the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka \u2014 is a major industrial rival to the United States.\nMost economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth, but Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the U.S. on both rivals and allies. His administration is promising that the taxes on imports will lower trade imbalances, offset some of the cost of the tax cuts he signed into law on Friday and cause factory jobs to return to the United States.\nTrump, during a White House meeting with African leaders, talked up trade as a diplomatic tool. Trade, he said, \u201cseems to be a foundation\u201d for him to settle disputes between India and Pakistan, as well as Kosovo and Serbia.\n\u201cYou guys are going to fight, we\u2019re not going to trade,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we seem to be quite successful in doing that.\u201d\nTrump said the tariff rates in his letters were based on \u201ccommon sense\u201d and trade imbalances, even though the Brazil letter indicated otherwise. Trump suggested he had not thought of penalizing the countries whose leaders were meeting with him in the Oval Office \u2014 Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau \u2014 as \u201cthese are friends of mine now.\u201d\nCountries are not complaining about the rates outlined in his letters, he said, even though those tariffs have been generally close to the ones announced April 2 that rattled financial markets. The S&P 500 stock index rose Wednesday.\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t had too many complaints because I\u2019m keeping them at a very low number, very conservative as you would say,\u201d Trump said.\nTariff uncertainty returns with Trump\u2019s letters\nOfficials for the European Union, a major trade partner and source of Trump\u2019s ire on trade, said Tuesday that they are not expecting to receive a letter from Trump listing tariff rates. The Republican president started the process of announcing tariff rates on Monday by hitting two major U.S. trading partners, Japan and South Korea, with import taxes of 25%.\nAccording to Trump\u2019s Wednesday letters, imports from Libya, Iraq, Algeria and Sri Lanka would be taxed at 30%, those from Moldova and Brunei at 25% and those from the Philippines at 20%. The tariffs would start Aug. 1.\nThe Census Bureau reported that last year the U.S. ran a trade imbalance on goods of $1.4 billion with Algeria, $5.9 billion with Iraq, $900 million with Libya, $4.9 billion with the Philippines, $2.6 billion with Sri Lanka, $111 million with Brunei and $85 million with Moldova. The imbalance represents the difference between what the U.S. exported to those countries and what it imported.\nTaken together, the trade imbalances with those seven countries are essentially a rounding error in a U.S. economy with a gross domestic product of $30 trillion.\nThe letters were posted on Truth Social after the expiration of a 90-day negotiating period with a baseline levy of 10%. Trump is giving countries more time to negotiate with his Aug. 1 deadline, but he has insisted there will be no extensions for the countries that receive letters.\nThe president threatened additional tariffs on any country that attempts to retaliate."

            "After decades of insurgency against Turkey, PKK begins disarming in step toward peace. Nick Schifrin\nNick Schifrin\nZeba Warsi\nZeba Warsi\nSonia Kopelev\nSonia Kopelev\nDan Sagalyn\nDan Sagalyn\nLeave your feedback\nFor the first time in four decades, the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK, is laying down its arms and says it will end its insurgency against Turkey. The separatist group\u2019s disbandment comes after its imprisoned leader announced an end to its 41-year armed struggle and a transition to democratic politics. Nick Schifrin reports.\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nAmna Nawaz:\nToday, for the first time in four decades, the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK, is laying down its arms and says it will end its insurgency against Turkey. The separatist group's disbandment comes after its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, announced an end to its 41-year armed struggle and a transition to democratic politics.\nToday marks the PKK's first concrete steps toward peace.\nHere's Nick Schifrin with more.\nNick Schifrin:\nToday, they came down from the mountains. So rifles that for four decades have been drenched in blood can now be destroyed by fire.\nKurdish separatists hope their armed struggle for independence can now become peaceful, said 47-year-old Kurdish separatist leader Bese Hozat.\nBese Hozat, Co-Chair, Kurdistan Communities Union (through interpreter):\nTo wage our freedom, democracy and socialist struggle with methods of legal and democratic politics, we voluntarily destroy our weapons before your presence as a step of goodwill and determination.\nFor years, these fighters, often no older than 20, and their weapons targeted Turkish forces, as seen in their propaganda videos. Some 30 million Kurds live across Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. And in Southeast Turkey and across the border in Iraq, the Kurdistan Worker's Party has been waging an insurgency, demanding greater rights and an independent state.\nTheir methods have been bloody and include terrorist attacks on civilian targets. Turkey says the 41-year conflict has killed more than 40,000 people.\nZubeyir Aydar, Executive Council Member, Kurdistan Communities Union (through interpreter):\nThe Kurds and the Kurdish movement took these steps for a peaceful solution and an honest solution. The Kurds took a risk, but this risk has been taken for a peaceful democratic solution.\nZubeyir Aydar heads the Kurdish separatist movement's political wing. Turkey put out a warrant for his arrest in 2009. He lives in exile. We spoke to him from Brussels.\nA Turkish official today said this was a \u2014 quote \u2014 \"irreversible turning point toward peace.\" Do you believe this is a pause in fighting or this is an irreversible step toward peace?\nZubeyir Aydar (through interpreter):\nWe don't want to be cheated or lied to and we don't want to cheat anyone. We deeply hope that the opposite side, the Turkish side, is honest as well in the peaceful negotiations.\nFor years, Kurdish protesters have accused the Turkish state of cracking down on Kurdish rights and culture. And, for years, the Turkish military has attacked the Kurdistan Worker's Party and its allies in Turkey and beyond with airstrikes that international humanitarian organizations say have violated human rights.\nTurkey has set up military bases and outposts in Northern Syria, where Kurds backed by the United States have fought ISIS. Turkey's also created bases in Northern Iraq, where the Kurdistan region is semiautonomous. But, earlier this year, longtime Kurdistan Worker's Party leader Abdullah Ocalan called for peace.\nAnd in a rare video this week, he said his group would disarm and expected Turkey to provide greater rights.\nFirst of all, the Kurdish community should be constitutionally recognized in Turkey. The Kurds have been ignored for a very long time. The Kurds need to be able to live with their own identity and their own culture. Political prisoners must be released and the fighters need to have rights to live and do politics in Turkey.\nAnd have you seen today Turkey take any of those steps?\nTurkey says with words they will take these steps, but these steps haven't been taken. We hope that Turkey will not miss this opportunity, this peace opportunity.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long advocated for harsh crackdowns on the Kurds, but this week he predicted peace.\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish President (through interpreter):\nThe winners of this will be the whole of Turkey, Turks, Kurds and Arabs. Then it will be our entire region and all our brethren in the region.\nAnd I'm now joined by Jim Jeffrey, the former U.S. ambassador to Turkey, as well as to Iraq, who was most recently the special representative for Syria under the first Trump administration.\nAmbassador Jeffrey, thanks very much. Welcome back to the \"News Hour.\"\nBottom line, how significant is this event that we saw today? The Kurdistan Worker's Party burning their rifles, calling for their armed struggle to be now waged peaceful?\nJames Jeffrey, Former U.S. Ambassador to Turkey: This is a huge step forward of a process that began about six months ago. It signifies the end of a 40-year terrorist insurgent campaign in Turkey, Iraq and Syria against the Turkish state and at times against various other elements.\nIt is a dramatic move forward for the whole region and is something that will really stabilize the Northern Levant in very many important ways.\nYou heard President Erdogan say in the story that ran just before you and I started speaking, say that the winners of this will be the whole of Turkey.\nOf course, he was not the one who really pushed this. It was actually a member of his coalition. Nonetheless, why has he come out and supported this, and why now?\nJames Jeffrey:\nWell, why now is partially domestic politics in Turkey. Erdogan wants to move forward with changes in the Constitution.\nAnd the PKK, besides a terrorist movement, has also an associated political party that has the third largest number of seats in Parliament. So, there is somewhat opportunistic political reason for this as well.\nBut, nonetheless, Erdogan, back more than a decade ago when I was in Turkey as ambassador, was working hard to try to get cease-fires and some kind of understanding with the PKK and other Kurdish groups.\nIn the story that we ran right before, you heard Zubeyir Aydar, the Kurdish separatist political leader, say a few things.\nHe said \u2014 quote \u2014 \"The Kurds took a risk\" and \u2014 quote \u2014 \"We deeply hope that the opposite side, the Turkish side, is honest.\"\nDo you believe that Turkey will proceed honestly going forward?\nI believe that the Turkish government, particularly the president, Erdogan, and the leader of the other coalition party, Bahceli, are very serious.\nNow, what the Kurds are talking about is continued democratic processes that would give Kurds their rights, language rights, other equality within Turkey. And that is still something that we have to see how it develops on the ground.\nNot only that. Zubeyir Aydar listed a few things that he expected Turkey to do. He said that the Kurdish community should be constitutionally recognized in Turkey, Kurds need to be able to live with their own identity, their own culture, political prisoners need to be released, and fighters need to have rights to live and do politics in Turkey.\nCan all that really happen?\nThat's a good starting list. I can see the Turks granting some of it because some of it's already been granted, Turkish identity, particularly in areas where they're the majority.\nAnd the Turks are talking about reconciliation, but they're also talking about accountability. And some of these PKK fighters have verifiable charges of terrorism against them, and that's going to have to be worked out as well.\nAs you know better than anyone, these divisions here are deep. How can this peace really hold, given those divisions?\nWell, for two reasons.\nFirst of all, the armed struggle hasn't worked. The PKK has been decisively defeated militarily. But, secondly, over the past 20-plus years, particularly since President Erdogan came to power, the Turkish state has been somewhat more open to Kurdish identity, Kurdish culture, Kurdish language, and other things.\nIt's not what many Kurds want, but it is a huge step forward from the Turkey that I knew in the 1980s and 1990s.\nAnd, finally, Jim Jeffrey, the U.S, of course, has had a complex relationship with Kurds across the region, but have allied with Kurds, especially in Syria, against the Islamic State. How does a deal like this today affect the U.S. relationship with Kurds in the other countries, but especially Syria?\nIt's huge.\nKurds, including the PKK Kurds and the many Kurds in Iraq and Turkey and elsewhere who are not part of the PKK, know that we were an honest broker. They know that we were pushing for both peace and, at the same time, helping Ankara fight terrorism. We also had people on the ground, Foreign Service offices, so important to our diplomacy, working with all sides, often in dangerous conditions, to try to move this forward.\nAgain, the credit goes to the Turkish people, the government, the PKK and their supporters, but the U.S. played a big role here also.\nAmbassador James Jeffrey, thank you very much.\nThank you.\nWatch the Full Episode\nNick Schifrin is PBS NewsHour\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Defense Correspondent.

            "Kurdish separatist fighters in Iraq begin laying down weapons as part of peace process with Turkey. Associated Press\nAssociated Press\nLeave your feedback\nSULAYMANIYAH, Iraq (AP) \u2014 Fighters with a Kurdish separatist militant group that has waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey began laying down their weapons in a symbolic ceremony on Friday in northern Iraq, the first concrete step toward a promised disarmament as part of a peace process.\nThe Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, announced in May that it would disband and renounce armed conflict, ending four decades of hostilities. The move came after PKK leader Abdullah \u00d6calan, who has been imprisoned on an island near Istanbul since 1999, urged his group in February to convene a congress, and formally disband and disarm.\n\u00d6calan renewed his call in a video message broadcast on Wednesday, saying, \u201cI believe in the power of politics and social peace, not weapons.\u201d\nMost journalists weren\u2019t allowed at the site of Friday\u2019s ceremony, in the mountains of Sulaymaniyah province in northern Iraq\u2019s semiautonomous Kurdish region.\nFootage from the event showed fighters \u2014 both men and women \u2014 casting rifles and machine guns into a large cauldron, where they were then set ablaze.\nThe PKK issued a statement from the fighters who were laying down their weapons, saying that they had disarmed \u201cas a gesture of goodwill and a commitment to the practical success\u201d of the peace process.\n\u201cWe will henceforth continue our struggle for freedom, democracy, and socialism through democratic politics and legal means,\u201d the statement said.\nThe state-run Iraqi News Agency reported that 30 fighters had disarmed \u201csymbolically\u201d on Friday, and that the continuing disarmament process \u201cwill take place in stages.\u201d The process is expected to be completed by September, the agency reported.\nAn Iraqi Kurdish political official said a representative of the Turkish intelligence service and representatives of the Kurdish regional government, Iraq\u2019s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party and the Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party, a pro-Kurdish party in Turkey, were present. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.\nTurkish parliamentary Speaker Numan Kurtulmus said that the initial disarmament step had proceeded \u201cas planned,\u201d but cautioned that the process was far from complete.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go in collecting many more weapons,\u201d Kurtulmus said. \u201cWhat matters is ending the armed era in a way that ensures weapons are never taken up again.\u201d\nThe official noted that the Turkish parliament was close to setting up a commission to oversee the peace process.\nDevlet Bahceli, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s nationalist ally who initiated the peace process, welcomed the ceremony, saying in a written statements that it marks \u201chistoric developments that signal the end of a dark era.\u201d\nBahceli, who has traditionally maintained a hard-line stance against the PKK, had surprised everyone in October, when he suggested in parliament that \u00d6calan could be granted parole if he renounced violence and disbanded the PKK.\nErdogan, in an X post, called the move an \u201cimportant step toward our goal of a terrorism-free Turkey.\u201d\nThe PKK has waged an armed insurgency against Turkey since 1984, initially with the aim of establishing a Kurdish state in the southeast of the country. Over time, the objective evolved into a campaign for autonomy and rights for Kurds within Turkey.\nThe conflict between militants and state forces, which has spread beyond Turkey\u2019s borders into Iraq and Syria, has killed tens of thousands of people. The PKK is considered to be a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.\nPrevious peace efforts between Turkey and the PKK have ended in failure \u2014 most recently in 2015.\nThe PKK has long maintained bases in the mountains of northern Iraq, where Turkish forces have launched offensives and airstrikes and have set up bases in the area. Last year, Iraq\u2019s government announced an official ban on the separatist group, which long has been prohibited in Turkey.\nScores of villages have emptied as a result of the violence. Displaced Kurdish Iraqis have voiced hopes that the peace process will finally allow them to go home.\nOfficials have spoken of a five-part peace process with the PKK, with the first phase being the political initiative launched by Bahceli, followed by \u00d6calan\u2019s message in February urging the PKK to abandon the armed struggle.\nThe next two steps would focus on legal reintegration of the PKK fighters and long-term healing and reconciliation efforts.\nKurds in Iraq said that they were optimistic, although some expressed fears that the deal would collapse.\n\u201cThis will benefit both sides,\u201d said Abdulrahman Abbas, a resident of the town of Dukan, near where the ceremony took place. \u201cWhy should this bloodshed continue for nothing?\u201d\nA Kurdish political activist from Sulaymaniyah, Mohammed Alaa, called the move a \u201cpositive step\u201d that will \u201cbring security stability in northeastern Syria and Iraq.\u201d\n\u201cBut the goal is for these steps to continue, and for T\u00fcrkiye to take the initiative to release Kurdish prisoners,\u201d he said, using the government\u2019s preferred spelling for Turkey.\nPKK officials previously said that in order to continue the disarmament process, they want to see Turkey take steps to end \u201cthe regime of isolation\u201d imposed on \u00d6calan in prison and to allow integration of former militants into the political system.\nBewar Amin Tahir, a spokesperson at Makhmour, a camp in Iraq for Kurdish refugees from Turkey, said that he hopes the peace process would \u201copen the door for a return to our villages and end three decades of suffering and hardship.\u201d\nBut he said that the \u201cTurkish state must also adhere to this initiative \u2026 So far, this process seems to be proceeding from one side only.\u201d\nHe called for Turkey to \u201cbegin amending its constitution so that the Kurds have their rightful place.\u201d\nQuestions remain about the future of Kurdish fighters in Syria. Turkey considers the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF \u2014 a U.S.-allied, Kurdish-led force controlling much of northeastern Syria \u2014 to be a terrorist group because of its affiliation with the PKK.\nThe SDF and authorities in Damascus agreed in March to merge the Kurdish forces into the national army \u2014 a move supported by Ankara \u2014 but that the two sides have remained at an impasse over how to implement the deal.\nNow is your chance to help us shape future coverage of the stories that matter most to you.\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

            "IRAQ: THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL - The Islamic Monthly. I WAS IN A taxi speeding through Baghdad\u2019s nearly empty streets when the blasts went off. The city looked deserted. All of Iraq, it seemed, had shut down for the holiest of high holy days to the country\u2019s Shi\u2019a majority. I had given up any hopes of making it to Kerbala for the first 10th of Muharram observance since the fall of Saddam. Four million faithful had already descended upon Kerbala \u2013 the actual site of the martyrdom of Sayyidna Husayn which the Day of Ashura commemorates \u2013 and the word on the street was traffic would be backed up for miles. People had started walking. I had placed my bets on getting to the Kadhimiyya mosque, second only in sanctity to Kerbala and Najaf on the Shi\u2019a pilgrimage itinerary, when tanks and APCs cut across the intersection and set up an impromptu checkpoint\nWe were waved through the checkpoint, but the driver had heard something which prompted him to click his tongue and begin muttering in Arabic. He turned to me in the midst of his mournful litany, and slamming his hand on the steering wheel hissed the wordfujaraL This was a recent addition to my mongrel Arabic vocabulary, courtesy of Iraq. Suicide bombers.\n\u201cKadhimiyya.\u201d I said. It wasn\u2019t a question.\nHe nodded. The two of us were now muttering the formulas of piety and tawhid in Islam which are often heard in times of trial and tragedy: There is no power or strength save with God \u2026 We are God\u2019s and to him is our return . . . invocations which try to right our usually self centered perceptions about ourselves and what goes on in our own little corner of the world.\nWe were about a half mile from the mosque when the first wave of worshippers fleeing the site began to fill the street Most seemed stunned, afraid and bewildered; their sole aim was to walk away from the blasts and the anarchy unfolding in its wake. Others though, were clearly enraged. Ambulances sped past us towards the mosque. A beat up flatbed truck raced past us going the opposite way. In the bed of the pickup, I saw two or three men administering first aid to a man soaked in blood and then the truck was gone.\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you off here\u201d he said, hoping I wouldn\u2019t argue.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, paying him, \u201cAllah ma\u2019ak\u201d God be with you.\nI wasn\u2019t the only one heading towards the mosque. Shots rang out close by. I know they were close because I involuntarily flinched and found my feet walking backwards despite my brain\u2019s clear orders to go forward. Someone was firing a rifle into the air but I wasn\u2019t sure if it was impotent rage or an attempt to clear the street for the flow of ambulances. I had barely regained control of my feet when I was stopped and frisked by plainclothes security. I didn\u2019t envy someone whose job was to defuse human bombs. He waved me on. I hadn\u2019t yet heard that several blasts had also rocked Kerbala in the south, roughly at the same time as the Baghdad bombings. I was already getting a presentiment however, that I was walking into the aftershocks of a Shi\u2019a 9/11. A moment frozen by the lens shutter of history.\nRecalling a brief news item during my second or third day back in Baghdad, I can\u2019t say that the tragedy which was unfolding now came as a complete surprise. Someone had fired a grenade into this very mosque, causing minor damage to the building but thankfully no casualties, less than a week ago. Nor was this the isolated perception of an outsider. Within the cauldron of emotions about to boil over: grief, fear, rage, helplessness and horror; there was a curious lack of surprise in this crowd psychology. Whether it was resignation to the ongoing cycle of violence and lawlessness, or the grim fatalism of a worldview actively shaped by blood sacrifice and martyrdom, I can\u2019t say. More than a thousand years after the massacre of Sayyidna Husayn and a score of other People of the House \u2013 an event as integral to Shi\u2019ism as the Stations of the Cross is to Christianity \u2013 the day of Ashura remained a day whose spiritual currency was blood.\nI began wandering my way through side streets towards the mosque as the number of improvised checkpoints increased. At one point the wisest course of action seemed to be tailing along behind an Arabic TV news crew, until they were barred from getting any nearer the sight by Iraqi police. I veered off down yet another side street.\nA rumor was quickly gaining ground on the street There were those who claimed the mosque had been hit by a rocket fired from a helicopter. I made the mistake of asking the police who had finally stopped me, frisked me and were now going through my papers. Less than a hundred yards from the mosque I was politely escorted to a police truck.\n\u201cYou saw this?! You have pictures?!\u201d a policeman asked, leaning back over the front seat of the van.\n\u201cNo. No \u2026 that\u2019s what people are saying \u2026 I heard it, that\u2019s all\u2026\u201d\nGiven the situation, his composure was admirable. With one eye on the suspicious foreigner in the back seat and one eye on the growing crowds surging around the vehicle he asked again: \u201cYou have pictures? Of a helicopter near the mosque?!\u201d\n\u201cNo, no pictures. It\u2019s just talk on the street \u2026\u201d and then I asked the inevitable question: \u201cDo you think the Americans might have done this?\u201d\nHe seemed relieved that we were not going to be at the center of an international incident That it hadn\u2019t been his bum luck to pick up a Middle Eastern version of Zapruder. For a moment he said nothing as he watched the pandemonium in the street, then with an infinite weariness:\n\u201cNo. I think this was done by Iraqis \u2026\u201d\nBAD NEWS travels fast. By the time I got back to the hotel, less than an hour later, there was a crowd around the TV in the lobby. I had already heard from another American journalist at Khadhmiyya that a synchronized bomb attack had occurred in Kerbala. Already there was talk from Iraqis and foreigners, Sunni and Shi\u2019a, that Al-Qaida was responsible. If the bomber\u2019s rampage had been intended to spark off sectarian violence between the two Muslim communities it had failed miserably. Everyone spoke of fujurat, suicide bombers. The word martyr was reserved for the innocent victims. A city already subdued by the solemnity of the day took on funereal overtones. In a country where satellite television was finally making serious inroads, it was interesting to note how people switched to Manar broadcasting from Hizbullah controlled South Lebanon. Not even Al-Jazeerah or Arabiyah news could compete today. What proved even more interesting were the comments made to a rapt and silent authence numbering in the hundreds of thousands lining the streets of the Southern suburbs of Beirut by Hizbullah General Secretary Sayyid Hasan Nasrullah. For many years a Western scapegoat in the anti-terrorism crusade; it was Nasrullah who sounded what might have been the only voice of reason and clemency at such a tragic hour. A great deal of the speech was traditional Ashura fare. It was obvious that he knew of the events in Iraq. Everything would hinge on what he had to say about them. Or what he might recommend people do about them. Talking into a silence unnatural for such large rallies, he spoke in measured tones with just the right amount of oratory skill and dramatic flair to get his points across in no uncertain terms:\nThese events are very grave. As 1 said in the beginning, they place upon the shoulder of the entire nation heavy responsibilities. First, this places upon the shoulder of the Iraqi people, the leadership and religious authorities in the Iraqi arena a great challenge. We do not need to analyze any further in order to say that, regardless of the perpetrator who committed these murders and massacres, the aim is to cause sedition among Muslims. As someone already began saying, the Shi\u2019ites will be told that the Sunnis are rejecting you and do not recognize you. They do not want you to commemorate your rituals freely and safely. These people consider you as such and such \u2026 This is why they violate your blood and kill your men, women and children. To them, you do not have any sanctity. Your blood, women, sacred places and your Hussein are not sacred with respect to them, and time makes no difference. People will say these words, which are already circulating in order to make the blood boil in the veins so that calls for revenge would launch here and there, gutreaction would conquer mind, and emotion would conquer sense. Then, we will be caught in the trap and step on the landmine, which ou r enemies have set for this nation. I do not know, these same perpetrators or those standing behind them might find the courage in the future to shoot some Sunni clerics in Iraq and shoot at some Sunni mosques as they did to the Shi\u2019ite mosques \u2026\nWe need to calm down and think. We must absorb the shock, pain, and press hard on the wound. Then we musi investigate in order to find the perpetrators. If the recruited networks of the Cl A and the various apparatuses of the American secret services were behind these actions, this will form an element of condolence to all of us. On the other hand, if those who stood behind these actions were fanatic, radical and tyrannical groups, which still live in a medieval age, lacking brain, mind, religion, and morals, yet claiming their affiliation to Islam, this is cause for grave concern. This is where the tragedy, sadness and the calamity lie, and it must be faced by the entire ummah \u2026\nYou are all invited to act wisely and surmounl the calamity and sedition. Do not allow the Zionists, Americans or stonehearled assassins to drive this nation towards the abyss. I confirm to you that any stonehearted faction who believes in nothing but killing and spilling blood is an outcast and must be expelled by the ummah; rejected by the Sunnis first and Shi\u2019ites second. We hear this sentiment voiced by many clerics of the Islamic Sunni movements \u2026\nAll Islamic and religious authorities throughout the entire Islamic world must take the appropriate position to meet the challenge \u2026 ideologists, elites, academics, and freedom fighters must all take the same position. This is the day when each cleric must reveal his knowledge because the nation is facing true sedition \u2026\nThis same trial was very harsh in Afghanistan; the trial of the Taliban and their allies. The Taliban did not only kill Shi\u2019ites, they killed the Sunni \u201cTajiks\u201d, \u201cUzbeks\u201d and \u201cPashtons\u201d who come from the same race. If we want to speak statistics, they killed more Sunnis than Shi\u2019ites because the mentality of the Taliban is a mentality of assassins. They refuse others even if they come from the same religion and nationality. As long as you are not a Talibani your blood, money and honor is liable for violation. This mentality ruined Afghanistan and was one reason for its occupation.\nIraq and its people were never a part of this Taliban mentality. Throughout history, the Shi\u2019ites and Sunnis in Iraq were closer to each other than any others throughout the Islamic world were. In Iraq nowadays, there are tribes or families with members that belong to different sections. For your information, half the tribe or family can be Shi\u2019ite whereas the other half can be Sunni. Iraq was always immune to sectarian wars of this nature \u2026\nSuch actions are a form of identification. These days, no one will execute suicidal operations but people who bear a partici] la r tenet. Can anyone convince me at present that the Iraqi Baathists or anyone from Saddam\u2019s ranks would execute suicidal operations? We did not witness any such action from them while lhey confronted the Americans and were in the middle of the bat\u00fcefield. This is a trademark and a means of colia ring the culprits. \u00cd say these words to confirm this group as an outcast so they may be expelled by the ummah. Anyone seeking revenge from innocents does not differ from those who shelled Karbalaa or detonated the blasts in Kazimiyah. All these people are perpetrators and assassins. They violate the boundaries of God and do nor respect or regard anyone of the faithful Muslims who live by the rules and religion of God \u2026\nThe speech continued, commanding an eerie silence punctuated by periodic rallying cries, and the unified response of more than 200,000 black clad supporters with fists raised. You could not help hearing the echoes of Nuremburg rallies. You hoped such hypnotic ability would continue to call for sanity and reason in the growing chaos.\nI suppose it would noi have been terribly unrealistic to anticipate an outbreak of retaliatory fury against the city\u2019s Sunni population. Civil wars have been ignited by less. But any attempt to orchestrate it reveals a fundamental ignorance about the people of Baghdad. The tragedy brought people together. For decades Saddam had forcefully desegregated many areas in Iraq so as to defuse ethnic tensions in a country where he and his henchmen were part of a religious minority. The result was that Sunni and Shi\u2019a interacted daily in all strata of Baghdad society. They often intermarried. Whatmade Nasrullah\u2019s speech so important though was a willingness to concede that the backward Salafism of Taliban-minded groups may have been responsible. Weeks after the event there was still a large segment of the Muslim world that refused to believe anyone claiming Islam might have done something so heinous.\nThere were of course public displays of grief, of solidarity and of religious fervor. It was the tenth of Muharram after all. But the murderous ignorance of terror merchants had backfired. On this tenth of Muharram the sectarian differences were put aside. An entire nation mourned the senseless loss of lives. On this day \u2013 if you were still alive \u2013 you left your ideology at the door, and over endless cups of black tea discussed how much more surviving you were capable of, in what used to be Iraq.\nIRAQ is fast becoming the conspiracy theorist\u2019s Mecca. The Americans did it, Iran did it, Osama bin Laden did it, Baathist thugs did it, the Jews did it. The number of splinter groups, revolutionary factions and shadow agents boggles the mind: the Ansar Island, the CIA, MI6, the KDP and the PUK, Qaida, Hizbullah, Green Berets and the 101st Airborne, Wahhabis, Baathists and the INC \u2026 National Fronts of countries that haven\u2019t existed since Nebuchadnezzar, and everywhere you look there\u2019s another Communist Party HQ opening up. And that\u2019s just inside Iraq.\nThe rest of the world, in trying to make sense of the chaos, seeks a one spin fits all to explain away years of failed foreign policy and economic exploitation. Truth is, decades of short sighted agendas , botched careers salvaged by bombing raids, and a general international indifferenceso long as gas is cheap and our loved ones aren\u2019t dying in plane crashes at the office \u2013 has produced nothing short of a bitch\u2019s brew of rage, despair, poverty and disease. You know we\u2019re heading for a whole lot of trouble when the word Balkanization is somewhere on the list of possible solutions \u2026\nNow it\u2019s happening, and you can\u2019t stop it happening\nThe people used to suffer everything and now they take their revenge\nYou are watching that revenge and you don\u2019t remember it was you\nWho drove them to it?\nNow you protest but it\u2019s too late to start crying over spilt blood;\nWhat is this blood compared to the blood the people shed for you\nIn your predatory wars, in you predatory peace\nWhat is this sacrifice, compared to the sacrifices they made to keep you fat?\nWhat are a few looted mansions compared to their looted lives?\n\u2013 Marat/Sadeby Peter Weiss\nI\u2019ve been reading dispatches from Iraq recently by the usually eloquent, insightful and well informed Robert Fisk. He too seems to offer little more than unanswerable questions and jarring, contradictory impressions. Coming from a man who made sense of the Lebanese inferno, it does more than worry me. It scares the hell out of me.\nWhatever tales are being spun by armchair revolutionaries and think-tank demagogues means precious little on the ground. In the six months since my last visit to Iraq, the intoxication of new found freedom has already given way to a morning after of the worst possible kind. Debates of the \u201cwas it a magic bullet from a lone assassin or was it the men on the grassy knoll backed by corrupt power brokers\u201d variety are of little interest to most Iraqis these days. Putting food on the table is certainly topping most lists of \u2018things to do\u2019. Hard on the heels of meeting basic survival needs is no doubt the need to lake action \u2013 any action \u2013 that can erase the years of impotence and global neglect. Instead of trying to sort out the heroes from the villains and evaluate which methods are sound and which are unsound, we should be prepared for an even more frightening option: heroism is a relative concept and there might not be any method at all.\nThis is not a palatable option in an information age. When the logarithms of globalization and import/export democracy refuse to apply, we do not accept defeat. Faced with a lack of concrete, workable answers we are forced by our imperial arrogance toinventthem. The cruel paradox is: now that we have woven our comfortable fictions, we seem to be the only ones who actually believe them.\nTHERE AND BACK, AGAIN\nThis was not thefirst trip. The first journey to Iraq the previous August had a more specific purpose. The magazine needed hard-to-find photographs of a number of the graves and sanctuaries scattered about the war-lorn country. Many of these holy sites were not prime AFP or Reuler\u2019s stock. Photo agencies were also much more expensive than our fledgling magazine could afford. Then too, there was the editorial and personal allure of going into a land where the heavy warfare had just ended three months earlier. The country was without a formal government and officially occupied by U.S. and British troops. In the intervening chaos \u2013 rumor had it \u2013 it was an easy border to cross.\nThe first trip was adrenaline charged discovery. Knowing little or nothing about the country or the situation, my partner and I spent a roller coaster week in Baghdad, Kerbala, and Najaf. The dialect was unfamiliar; the absence of law was both invigorating and daunting. We carried American passports and expected hatred and accusations. VVe found hospitality and friendship.\nOn the way in, we joked about entering the land of Mordor; Tolkien\u2019s allegoric land of the Dark Lord Sauron. Back home in Amman after a week in the suffering land, Iraq was now a real place in the most real of circumstances. Why we use the word real when describing extremes as if our day to day existence were somehow one step removed from the real, I don\u2019t know. I doubt it\u2019s ever possible to remove the tinted glasses a traveler must always peer through. For the Iraqis, the words day to day existence and real are synonymous. Bombing, economic sanctions, brutal dictatorship, anarchy and indigence have been their day to day reality for over a decade.\nI went back to Amman thinking: I could love this country. I consciously ignored the fact that things of the heart and viscera are not thought but simply happen \u2013 to paraphrase Aeschylus against our will, and through the awful grace ofGod.\nThe financial realities both personal and magazine wise are preparing me for third class all the way. Buses, hitchhiking, flophouses and no more promiscuous exposing of endless frames of film. New locales like Mosul, Nineveh, Falluja and Kurdistan. The fast changing cogs of history take me lo an Iraq where Saddam has been captured hiding in a cave, the people are tired of the lawlessness, and civil unrest grows. As one commentator put it: the people of Iraq are learning Terrorism 101. The attacks on an uninformed and ill-prepared American militan\u2019 presence are met with fierce reprisals and each week a new flashpoint for the coming fall of a nation makes headlines.\nThe Middle of Nowhere\nFebruary 23, 2004\nTrying to sleep in a jammed parking lot under cold stars. Dozens of parked cars fill the parking lot of the small rest stop; full of dozing travelers awaiting daylight.\nOut there, somewhere under the diamond lit blackness is Ali Baba.\nI had thought that since we crossed the border into Iraq after nightfall that the sweeping hordes of highway robbers were a thing of the past. Then, in the empty desert wastes on the way to Ramadi we are waved off the road by the gasoline vendors, who have set up camp outside the isolated rest stop. We pull off and drive slowly through what looks like some nomad encampment from a post nuclear sci fi epic. Stacked piles of jerry cans of petrol \u2026 people hunched over small bonfires, keeping warm in the desert night chill.\nNow, trying to write in a dark 4\u00d74 with only a dim bulb from the fruit stand outside swaying in the wind and the not-so-gentle snoring of Marwan and Abu Ahmed in the front seats for a soundtrack, I realize I was wrong. Back to the Mad Max reality of Iraq.\nARRIVING just after dawn in the center of Baghdad I am shocked by the grayness and ramshackle squalor. By the litter and debris and pools of black, stagnant, malodorous puddles which fill the numerous potholes. With none of the typical clamor and bustle that characterizes Baghdad in the waking hours to hide the blemishes and scars, I look on the hag face of a former beauty and want to avert my gaze.\nI have to knock on the locked steel gate of the Hotel Yarmouk. At first Fuad doesn\u2019t want to open. Then he recognizes me, undoes the locks and lets me in. He puts the pistol back in its hiding place between the cushions of the couch he was sleeping on and \u2013 pointing to another couch \u2013 tells me to get some sleep till the morning desk clerk wakes up. Even the uhlan wa sahlans here are tired and strained.\nI decide to spend a couple of days getting my bearings. Walk around, look up old friends, find the necessary travel info and try to gauge the political and social clime before stumbling blindly into the unknown. A primary rule of thumb when traveling in dicey areas: get all the updates about the swiftly changing situation; then stumble blindly into the unknown.\nAs I talk again with people I met on my first trip last August, I hear the same answer over and over: Iraq is zayn now; zayn being the local slang for kwayis or tammam . . . fine, good , great depending on intonation. Not completely zayn mind you, but more zayn than it was six months ago. It\u2019s possible to be out after nightfall but still not recommended to be out after 11:00. For the first few days back, it was a four hours on, four hours off schedule for electricity, and people planned accordingly. Generators were kept fueled and most places had hurricane lamps.\nBut just like the first trip, it was still amazing to note how the electric supply could suddenly gear up to an ultra efficient 20 hours a day when there was an increase in civil unrest, street fighting or bombings. Call me paranoid but I began to suspect a connection between public utilities and Coalition strategists.\nAnd the gunfire. If gunfire can have a tone, can convey a mood, then this time around the mood was more senseless and random. And a lot closer. At odd hours a shot or two or three with no answering fire in the street in front of the hotel. Most of the time everyone would freeze for a moment, then break into good natured but high strung mockery of whoever among us had dove for cover or flinched. The sound of more earnest and genuine gun battles was usually far enough away to pass unnoticed.\nFor the first few days, there was almost no sign of the U.S. military. The copters were too high up and far away to be seen clearly. That too changed after the Ashura bombings.\nLike most words you can think of, zayn is a relative term.\nFor the first few days of reorientation, I couldn\u2019t help but notice how much calmer the city seemed. On the first trip, I was hopped-up on adrenaline and the Iraqis were hopped-up on freedom. Now, there was a business-as-usual, life-goes-on atmosphere. Being alone on this trip, I no longer encountered the curious stares and the endless \u201cMister, mister!\u201d of street vendors. When I did meet people and they found out I wras American, their response was more along the lines of\u201d\u2026 Oh,\u201d and we moved on to other topics. I was glad for the Iraqis. You can only go on for so long cranked out on anarchy before something gives.\nUnfortunately, wrhat I initially perceived as calmness; as a \u2018keep on keeping on\u2019 pragmatism, would reveal its true nature over the coming days and weeks. It was in reality a deeply rooted despair watered daily by the vicissitudes of making ends meet while the world community mapped out a Utopian future for Iraq which conveniently overlooked its inhabitants.\nTHE WRETCHED OFTHE EARTH\nFranz Fanon \u2013 one of the chief architects of the Algerian struggle for independence \u2013 stated in no uncertain terms that a nation freeing itself from the shackles of occupation must do so by means of a socialist revolution. No other brand of revolution or ideology would, or could succeed. His classic text, The Wretched of the Earth, served the Algerian struggle so well it has been borrowed, appropriated and rewritten by revolutionary groups the world over. This is no manifesto full of fiery slogans and empty promises. Its author, a trained psychiatrist, analyzes with brutal clarity the character of both oppressor and oppressed and clinically maps out the ways in which a people\u2019s struggle can and must make their occupation unprofitable to the colonizing forces. Only then, when the proceeds of imperialism and dominance become a source of social and political deficit, will the occupying forces choose to withdraw\u2019 and leave the natives \u2013 the savages who are savage simply because they are native \u2013 to their own devices. This tactic has been replayed the world over and with varying degrees of success: Palestine, Lebanon, El Salvador, Chechnya, Afghanistan and Vietnam to name just a few.\nNor does Mr. Fanon stop there. In the second half of the book he charts the necessary steps an emerging nation must follow in order to assure its continued independence and sovereignty as a nation state. With relentless logic and real and practical examples, he assures us that the first form of rule in the developing country must be socialist. In order to appease all sectors of society, in order to promote the proper egalitarian treatment of all classes, bul most importantly, to deny the will to power based purely on ethnicity or moneyed interests a foothold; the revolution must be socialist. Other forms of government are examined and cast aside as unworkable. Nationalism will always be to some degree exclusive, and democracy in the Western sense of the word is seen for what it is : a sacred cow of feigned equality promoted by a someare-more-equal-than-others wealthy elite. True socialism, according to Fanon, is truly democratic and therefore the only possible starting point in a post-colonial state.\nHeady stuff for a downtrodden and exploited people. Unfortunately it is also a mode of thinking that is anathema to the world\u2019s only surviving superpower. The U.S. and its ever changing list of allies has spent nearly a century in trying to stamp out anything that hints of Marxism and over two decades trying to ferret out and decapitate any movement rooted in Islam; whether socialist tinged or not But they are promising \u2018democracy\u2019 to Iraq. It begs the questionto borrow a phrase from Milton: So when is all hell going to break loosed\nAnd everywhere you look in Baghdad, it seems there\u2019s another office of the Iraqi Communist Party opening up. Sure; there are dozens of new NGO\u2019s and Human Rights organizations opening up. From Kurdistan to the Shia\u2019 south there are committees and parties and democratic fronts hanging out their plaques. But few of these are what the U.S. has in mind when it reverently intones \u2018democracy\u2019. That word is reserved only for secular, pro-globalization, U.S.-friendly camps.\nMore and more Iraqis every day have another word for such \u2018democratic\u2019 puppets: collaborators. There is a growing list of casualties in Iraq these days. People are being killed as collaborators, or for merely being suspected of collaboration with Coalition forces. High on the hit list are translators and others whose work brings them in contact with Westerners and in particular with the U.S. military or corporate reps trying to be first on their block to land the Iraqi account\nFrom my hotel window I can look directly into a newly opened and usually empty Party HQ. Six months ago there were little or no signs of organized revolutionary activity. Seems America\u2019s democratic chicken is coming home to roost\nTHESUNNITRIANGLE\nIf you travel within the confines of a triangle roughly formed by Tikrit in the North, Kamadi and Falluja in the West and Ba\u2019quba to the East you\u2019ll encounter enough military checkpoints, convoys of serious military hardware, and\u2019helicopter traffic to remind you that, almost a year after the end of heavy fighting, there\u2019s a war going on. It is here that opposition to Coalition forces is the fiercest and organized resistance is most lethal. If you hear news reports of heavy fighting in Iraq against US troops, you can be almost certain of it occurring in what is called the Sunni Triangle. Cut out of the center of Iraq, with Baghdad just off dead center, it is the area with the highest percentage of Sunni Muslims and since Saddam hails originally from Awjaan oppressively grey and dusty village east of Tikrit \u2013 it is where you can expect to find most of the old Baathist hardliners as well. Assuming of course that such creatures exist Given the volatile nature of the region, it is hard to assess actual loyalties and leanings, whether tribal or political. Neither the military nor the local residents are particularly fond of outsiders showing up for a glimpse into Iraq\u2019s own little heart of darkness.\nTwo things though, are apparent. It is not a homogenous region comprised of Wahabbibacked fundamentalists and Saddam cronies. Most of the population is looking towards a future Iraq minus Saddam but not all that different in other regards. The modern secular Iraq was fine if you overlooked the psychopathic head of state. The other glaring truth is \u2013 in spite of constant news reports to the contrary \u2013 I have yet to meet anyone claiming loyalty to Saddam\u2019s Baathist ideals. I\u2019ve met socialists and communists, Muslim and Christian spokesmen of every persuasion, Kurds, Assyrians, and Yezidis, proponents of armed struggle and peaceniks. Democratic reformers and pan-Arabists, Iraqis, Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians and Iranians. But not one self-proclaimed Saddamite Baathist in the bunch.\nNot one. Makes you wonder where the Beltway and Downing Street hawks are getting their information from. Assuming that factual information has a role in deciding whether or not to wage wars.\nThe next morning it would be on to Falluja. I had no way of knowing that a mere few weeks after the journey, locals in that little corner of the Iraqi dustbowl would be dubbing their village a \u201cgraveyard for Americans\u201d.\nFalluja\nSaturday, February 28\nMorning\nBelieve no one. Last night as I prepared to head off for Falluja in the am,, I asked AU at the front desk whether it would be difficult to get into Falluja. Whether there was a checkpoint or not. \u201cOf course there\u2019s a checkpoint,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut it\u2019s nothing to worry about. You\u2019re American.\u201d I stared at him blankly. \u201cYou\u2019re a journalist \u2026\u201dhe went on, \u201cJust show them your press pass.\u201d\nI explained not only did I not have a recognized press pass; I didn\u2019t have a \u201cCoalition Approved Press Pass.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d he said.\nWith this news in mind I spent a few hours debating whether to go at all. Lots of scenarios ran through my head: I go and don\u2019t get in. I go, get stopped at a checkpoint and am detained and questioned and shipped off to Guantanamo Bay. I go and slip through coalition security only to be picked up, tortured and eventually pummeled to death by angry Fallujians who are certain I am an agent of the Imperialists. I don\u2019t go. I stay in Baghdad and sleep in.\nKnowing I would be forever kicking myself if I didn\u2019t try to cover Iraq\u2019s most notorious flashpoint I resolved to go. What wasn\u2019t so easy was silencing the part of my brain which kept muttering: its decisions like this that make people wake up dead. Nobody\u2019s forcing you. You could go to a museum! Visit the pretty ruins of Babylon and Ur. But nooooooooooo \u2026 you have to go to the front lines! Did I ever mention that common sense was not your strongest suit?\nEventually the voice got bored and I was able to sleep.\nThere is no checkpoint to Fallufa. Having found my way to Alawi station and jumped on a minibus, I was now entering the city limits of Fallufa. The other passengers spent most of the hour long trip debating the future of Iraq and the realities behind the headlines. \u201cIt\u2019s a war of the West versus islam\u201d was a popular one. \u201cAmerica wants to spark a civil war between the Sunnis and the Shi\u2019a \u2026 divide, then conquer\u201d was another:\nI\u2019m fust really glad no one asked me where I was from. Might have dampened the conversation a bit. They did find it odd that whenever we slowed down or approached what might be a checkpoint, I slid the camera under the seat, but they were too polite to comment.\nIt was a short walk from the bus station to the town center. A short walk in what would prove to be a very short visit.\nAppearances are deceptive. The place had a reputation. I would find out later that the reason we had to stop in the middle of the desert on the way in was because we were nearing the Ramadi/Falluja area. The combination of nightlime curfew and a heavy Ali Baba presence made the zone a suicidal night drive.\nThe main strip had little to offer in the way of things to do. Auto repair shops, numerous roasted chicken outlets, some clothing stores and street vendors selling everything from produce to plastic sandals to second hand clothes\nI had the camera out of sight under my jacket which was hanging over my shoulder. It may be February to the rest of the world but in Iraq, it\u2019s late spring. Since I didn\u2019t know the terrain except through rumor and dated news I thought it best to remain unnoticed at least till I got my bearings. It was too early for dhuhr prayer so loitering in a mosque in the midst of the \u201crebel held\u201d Sunni Triangle was not an option. The few mosques I did see were of that concrete prefab style that looked more at home somewhere in the deserts outside of Vegas. The only thing missing was lumbleweed.\nWhich is probably why I was surprised to look up and see a building with the sign in English and Arabic: Iraq Telecommunications and Internet Center. Not many of those in Baghdad. While I was pondering whether to go inside and see if I could e-mail the magazine to tell them I was still alive, I was nabbed by the mukhabarat. A guy materializes out of nowhere-mid twenties, plainclothes, a shadow of a beard . . .\n\u201cWhat are you loo king for?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cA coffee shop.\u201d was my first response. I wanted to sit down somewhere and think over what to do next rather than continue walking like I knew where I was going when I hadn\u2019t a clue. Some dark corner of a coffee shop would give me a second to figure out how exactly I was going to \u2018cover\u2019 Fallufa. I could also feed the cqffeine monkey on my back.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThat was an easy one.\n\u201cTo drink some coffee \u2026\u201d I answered. His face remained impassive. If anything he seemed slightly annoyed.\n\u201cOr . . . tea \u2026\u201d\nI was holding up my end of the conversation. He meanwhile, pulled off a move I\u2019d only seen previously in action movies. When I first started talking with him I had seen no sign of a weapon. Then, with a slight shrug of the shoulder, therewas an AK-47 comfortably nestled in the crook of his right elbow.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nAll right, I thought, enough small talk. \u201cI\u2019m a journalist,\u201d as I slowly reached for my passport and business card that I used in lieu of bona fide press credentials. He glanced at them and motioned to two of his colleagues, who, like the rifle, materialized out of nowhere. They made it clear I was going with them. At that moment, my biggest fear was that somewhere at the end of this little walk I would end up face to face with some American officer named Sergeant Buck who would be really, really annoyed by the presence of a \u201cunilateral\u201d journalist in occupied Iraq. My fear would prove unjustified. The American military stays clear of downtown Falluja Their base is a couple miles down the highway and surrounded by miles of concrete walls.\nShowing up at the mukhabarat HQ caused quite a stir. By the time we entered the senior officer\u2019s office, we had about eight curious policemen in tow. A translator was sent for but unfortunately was\u201dalong the lines of: \u201cYou . . . Here . . . What?\u201d said very loudly. So I stuck to Arabic The senior officer said little while he absently thumbed through my ID. What made everyone there suspicious, it turned out, was that I seemed to be interested in the telecommunications center. I had stopped in front of it. Didn\u2019t I know that Falluja was dangerous? I was asked What exactly did I want here?\nI explained that even as nearby as Baghdad, the reputation of Falluja as a flashpoint of resistance was well established In the past year, the town had definitely earned its place on the map.\nBack in Amman, the reports start to come in. A carload of foreigners was stopped in Falluja. The passengers were killed, their bodies mutilated and hung from a bridge. What isn\u2019t clear at the moment of writing is who the passengers were. Some reports say civilian, others U.S. military. Does it matter? Of course. The who helps answer the why and sets the stage for what next. As I view the images of dismembered bodies and a crowd reveling in the purest of Dionysian frenzies, I find another equally disturbing series of questions. What is a carload of \u201ccivilians\u201d doing in Falluja? Why is there an American media blackout on the more graphic images?\nWithin a day of so, a clearer picture emerges. The \u201ccivilians\u201d worked for Blackwater Security, an elite mercenary training outfit in North Carolina. Blackwater protects Bremer among others. Increasing numbers of mercenary units under the banner nf security advisors have entered the Iraqi maelstrom. Knowing that the victims were former Navy Seals working as hired guns makes me less sympathetic to their fate. Is that wrong?\nTrying to piece a story together, the constant news updates coming out of this small dusty town have turned any impressions I had on their head. The U.S. military presence in Falluja is now, in mid- April, a militant one as insurgents begin an all out bid to regain territory from the occupying coalition. A month after my visit and news commentators are already making comparisons, however lame, to the Tet offensive in Vietnam. Were Iraqi security forces serious when they asked what I was looking for in Falluja?\nAfter ten minutes or so, I was free to leave \u2013 or so I thought. As I gathered my things the translator earnestly pantomimed and sputtered in broken English: You have money? Your money? Then I realized what he meant. He wanted to make sure no one had pocketed the small stash of money in my camera bag or demanded any baksheesh I assured him that no one had in any way done anything untoward or venal and that I wasn\u2019t upset. Strange when you realize these guys are in a no-win situation. They would never be fully trusted by the Coalition because they were first and foremost Iraqi and they spoke the wrong language; and secondly because any dissident or paramilitary groups in the area would see them as stooges and collaborators to the hated coalition. And they were worried that I might get a bad impression?\nI was now free \u2026 to go to the police station. I got in the back seat of a jeep. I stared at the barrel of another Kalashnikov propped up in the front seat with its barrel aimed at my snout. I prayed we didn\u2019t hit any bumps. The driver moved it to a safer place and it was off to the Falluja Police Station.\nIt would be easy to portray these Iraqi security measures in a Keystone Kops fight but that simply wasn\u2019t the case. Given the undoubted rarity of suspicious lone foreigners wandering around, there was definite curiosity. But what surprised me most was the warnings and worried looks of those I spoke with. One of the police stopped me before leaving the mukhabarat and said bluntly: \u201cThis is nota good place to be. We\u2019re afraid something will happen to you. The people here don\u2019t like foreigners.\u201d He was apologetic. I was relieved that I wouldn\u2019t be spending the next few days in lockup surviving on cockroach soup till they got to the bottom of this lone \u2018journalist\u2019 scoping out the Telecom Center issue. Given the situation they could have been much less polite and much more thorough, and if anything went amiss they could plead \u201cC\u2019est la guerre.\u201d\nI was handed over to Lieutenant Khalid at the police station for a lower key version of the same interrogation. Lt Khalid was one of those physically demonstrative Arabs. In his mid thirties with a receding hairline and a mustache straight out of an old Egyptian tarbush opera, he led me by the hand to his superior officer. Throughout the questioning he held my hand. It was both disconcerting and amusing to be questioned while holding hands. I felt as if we were being gently chastised by someone\u2019s Dad because we\u2019d be caught kissing on the front porch. After this perfunctory round of questions I was taken outside by Lt. Rhalid; past another respectfully curious squad of uniforms. Outside he said simply: Now we go to my house. For lunch.\nThere goes the blood and guts front-line war story angle.\nSince there is a sundown curfew in the area, Khalid suggested I stay overnight and head back to Baghdad in the morning. Back at his house, his older brother \u2013 whom I never saw \u2013 vetoed the idea. No strangers in our house overnight Even South Lebanon during the Israeli occupation wasn\u2019t so closed, hostile, and suspicious toward the outside world. I wouldn\u2019t be there long enough though, to make sense of how bad the situation was. Khalid did inform me that the Sunday previous had seen a lot of firefights and rockets and general mayhem. Like most war zones, it\u2019s the waiting which drives people round the bend \u2026 the intervals between incidents and the silences that scrape nerves raw like a razor blade on dry bone.\nAfter one of the best home cooked meals I\u2019ve had in years, Khalid offered to take me to the bus station. As a gesture of thanks i offered him a night on the town in Baghdad. What surprised me is that he accepted. When we arrived at his house, he had quickly changed into the warmup suit favored by most shabdb for lounging around the house. Now he asked me to wait and came back with something more suitable to the bright lights, big city world of Baghdad: pressed trousers, shined shoes, a dress shirt and casual jacket. I couldn\u2019t help feeling that this excuse to go \u2018into the city\u2019 was a welcome relief and a bit of a novelty. Especially with a foreigner. It\u2019s only an hour away but I got the feeling that Khalid was a small town boy at heart His enthusiasm over a Baghdad outing was so genuine and endearing, it made me glad I had offered.\nDid I mention I could really love this place?\nASK ME NO QUESTIONS, I\u2019LL TELL YOU NO LIES\nA recurrent question which soon becomes tiresome to expats is: How do I get to America? Firstly, because WE DON\u2019T KNOW. All we have to do is show up at the border with passport in hand and they have to take us in. Or at least it used to be that way; I haven\u2019t been back in a while. Secondly, the fact that an expat is someone who usually chooses to Uve abroad means they\u2019re usually not up to selling you a bill of goods on how great things are in the old country.\nIn Iraq in particular, it\u2019s a question you have to field at least a dozen times a day if not more. I usually tell them to go to Canada. It\u2019s just like America without all the disposable culture, plastic, and drive-by shootings. You also fork over less tax dollars to fund other people\u2019s wars.\nIn Lt. Khalid\u2019s case, it was somewhat understandable. He had seen Bush\u2019s storm troopers come in and make mincemeat out of Saddam\u2019s stranglehold on a nation. He had been trained by the U.S. effort to make Iraq capable of policing itself. He had seen the brawny, tattooed GIs in the latest Jedi Knight fashions. He came from Falluja which didn\u2019t have a single hotel, or cinema. Even the Arab mainstay of a coffee shop was noticeably absent Just looking for one could get you arrested.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how many times you try to explain that the America that is beamed into their homes via satellite and internet is a manufactured one. That even the window shoppers and homeless beggars in the latest Hollywood blockbuster are paid extras; and the \u201creal\u201d cars, window shoppers and homeless beggars have been relegated to watching the dream makers from behind barricades. That the myths broadcast over the Voice of America are just that: myth. And a very intentional and selective mythos at that When you start to explain that many Americans are worried about employment, housing and health care and if there\u2019s time left over they can turn a worried glance towards the swift and Draconian curtailing of civil liberties once taken for granted; many aspiring immigrants turn a deaf ear. Why? Because they want their chance, if nothing else. They want the chance to try and to fail miserably if need be. Kegaled by the heroic exploits of a select few compatriots who made it; who got over, who worked the system \u2013 often by any means necessary \u2013 they are impatient when someone tries to mangle their dreams of a better place. For some, it may be all they have to make the here and now tolerable. You realize that to tamper with the fabric of such necessary illusions serves little purpose and that the information overload that the average \u201cWesterner\u201d carries around as baggage, is just one more chance they haven\u2019t had. You learn to nod politely, offer the occasional encouraging comment and choke back that lump of postmodern irony you\u2019ve had the chance to acquire. Sometimes, you just have to listen.\nWhen U.S. aid is translated into anti-litter accessories and the Bush/Blair care packages for \u201cthe starving, the wretched, the dispossessed, the ignorant, those living in want and squalor from the deserts of Northern Africa to the slums of Gaza to the mountain ranges of Afghanistan\u201d come in the form of cluster bombs, sanctions and belligerent militar}\u2019 occupation, it\u2019s hard not to be a bit cynical.\nTo your average Iraqi, such attitudes matter very little. Whether because of a thirty-year news blackout called \u201cSaddam\u201d or a worldview so prevalent in developing countries that says in effect \u2013 someone must give a damn, the rest of the world can\u2019t possible be so blindly unfeeling; the question asked most often by the dispossessed is an anguished \u201cWHY?!\u201d\nAnother question expats hate to be asked.\nYou listen politely as people rattle off UN resolutions; review a modern history that is ethically unconscionable save to those who shaped it, and detail the Kafkaesque contortions that passes itself off as \u201cliving\u201d. Then it comes. The \u201cWhy?\u201d and the \u201cWhat are we supposed to do now?\u2019 which leaves you mumbling into your tea and humbly accepting seconds of Arabic sweets spiked with guilt.\nAli has less than a leg and a half, thanks to the war, and is a self-proclaimed beggar. He buys me tea, and then with extremely agile crutches, walks me to my hotel in the evening.\nAbu Ahmed warns me not to take the train north. \u201cTrains are sitting ducks,\u201d he says in English, \u201cAli Baba comes into the train, locks all the exits and robs and kills, while the conductors arid drivers run away.\u201d He himself wras robbed of over 30,000 dinar coming back to Baghdad from his village. Ali Baba set up a roadblock, and clad in balaclava masks, made off with millions of dinar from Abu Ahmed and his fellow taxi passengers. In broad daylight. He shrugs, smiles, and goes back to teaching me how to improve my chess openings.\nA boy of seven, with his shoeshine box, restores my muck encrusted boots to a squeaky clean, polished, shiny black and tells me the price: 250 dinar . . . twenty cents. The correct going price for locals. He\u2019s overjoyed when I give him a thousand and I feel like I got away with something. I rationalize realistically that if I gave freely to everyone who needed or asked for it I\u2019d last a day and a half.\nThese are some of Mr. Blair\u2019s \u201cwretched, dispossessed\u201d ignorants that sanctions of starvation and brute military force were supposed to free. Unfortunately, even the best laid plans of mice and corporate spread sheets can go terribly, terribly wrong.\nCovering these events from a point of involuntary anonymity conveys a much different story than the one uncovered by pulling up in a CNN van with camera crew and microphone in hand. The lack of translators and private transport puts you at the mercy of situations Iraqis face every day. Having to travel third class and alone, and watching other journos and their local translators scuttle between the Meridian and the next press conference in a private car, I have no qualms or illusions about which side of the street I\u2019m working. But the supposed cardinal virtue of objectivity tends to take a good thrashing.\nI learned early on, during the first intifada in Palestine, that there are two kinds of journalists. The first is the fact gathering journalist whose goal is objectivity. If he got too involved he could no longer either A) feed the information mills with the cold facts needed by his paymasters to sway electorates or produce clinical reports for next year\u2019s budget proposals; or B) expose corruption, scandal and wrongdoings which conflicted with subjective loyalties. One of the main arguments for an objective press is to allow John Q. Public the ability to sift through facts without being told what they mean.\nThe second kind is what Edward Said called \u2018the journalism of solidarity\u201d and what my first mentor \u2013 a journalist from El Salvador who\u2019d been at the front lines in Salvador, Beirut and Jerusalem \u2013 called with typical candor: activism.\nRemember that lulling first impression upon returning to Baghdad? As U.S. forces plan an assault on Falluja to wrest it from the militias, the Madhi\u2019s Army \u2013 a fringe rejectionist Shi\u2019a party under the guidance of Sayid Muqtada Sadr \u2013 remains holed up in the Kufa mosque complex, and an increasing number of attacks on the US military from Shi\u2019a militias in Baghdad fill the headlines, you find the questions replaced by grim certitude \u2013 that leaden feeling that things are going to get much worse before it gets any better. In the meantime, most names on casualty lists are Iraqi.\nNorthern Iraq is haunted ground.\nExcept for the 10th of Muharram, the weather in the Baghdad vicinity for almost ten days had been sunny and warm. The sun that rose on Ashura had to fight through gray clouds and smog, appearing as little more than a flat white disc hung over the city; the heavens themselves conspiring to wear sackcloth and ash in mute protest over violences past and present\nNow, heading towards Mosul in a shared taxi, I watched the skies fade to a brooding metallic hue and expected rain which never came. The journey had already been unduly prolonged by having to drive at tortoise speed behind first one convoy, then another. We spent two hours being stared at from APCs and tanks by weapon toting GIs who occasionally swiveled their gun sights in our direction if we approached tailgate mode. The line of cars behind us got longer. Wanting to take a picture, I was quickly dissuaded by my fellow passengers. \u201cThey might shoot at the car\u201d they warned. I thought bitterly of how over twenty years of Saddam had given way to an occupation force intent on keeping the blinders on.\nAs we left the outskirts of Tikrit the traffic loosened up, the checkpoints became more infrequent and the signs of war receded from view. The terrain became more rolling while the skies darkened. Somewhere around Kirkuk I saw a huge mountain of smoke billowing into the air and immediately thought of a massive aerial bombardment The weather wasn\u2019t cloudy, it was smoke. No one else seemed to notice so I waited till we were close enough to see.\nOilfields. An occasional oil well belching flame. I thought simultaneously of New Jersey and the furnaces of Nebuchadnezzar.\nWe eventually passed out of the oil belt, or at least its more noxious aspect and the sky began to lighten. It was a sunny day after all. The strong feeling of a shift in spiritual geography persisted though as the rolling hills became mountainous and I began to flash on all the history this land had seen.\nGo due north for an hour or so and take a left and you could picnic at lhe base of the ancient, leering colossus of Pazzuzu; demon of pestilence and the south wind. Ancient imperialists had taken the Babylonian god and made it a demon. Located in Hatra, its legacy survived mainly through a brief appearance in Freidkin\u2019s film The Exorcist.\nIt seems the demon which frightened a generation of moviegoers thirty years ago by doing extremely nasty things to a twelve year old Linda Blair in Georgetown wasn\u2019t quite finished with Washington DC just yet.\nFurther north were the ruins of Nimrod, then Mosul and what was left of Nineveh. The prevalence of signs and adverts in Turkish reminded you that the Northern Highway was Turcoman territory. North and East of Mosul was autonomous Kurdistan.\nAside from the obvious historical and journalistic interest in the region, I had pointedly vowed to myself before leaving Jordan that I would visit the maqam of the Prophet Jonah. Something about trying to flee from the responsibilities God has laid upon us spoke to me with an uncomfortable resonance.\nWatching the landscape roll by, recalling the amount of travel required just to reach Baghdad and the vast amount of territory south of Najaf on the way to Basra and the Gulf, I keep thinking: Jonah had some major reservations about calling his people to God. Even in this day and age, the trip from Nineveh to the sea involves some serious fleeing.\nYou\u2019d think the fear struck into the heart of a prophet about doing God\u2019s work, at the command of God himself, would give some of today\u2019s pulpit pushers a second thought.\nFortunately we arrived at the city limits of Mosul before I got too deeply involved in further speculation \u2026\nIn many ways, Mosul is similar to any large Arab city that doesn\u2019t have to live up to the reputation and responsibility of being the capital. Tripoli in Lebanon or Syria\u2019s Aleppo come to mind. Particularly Aleppo, since they both broach the Turkish border and have a large Kurdish population. These provincial centers are often more laid back and intimate than their cosmopolitan cousins.\nIn Mosul, you could forget you were in Iraq. Electricity was generally available and generators were primed for the occasional brief lapses which seldom lasted more than twenty minutes. Men, and women surprisingly, were out on the street \u2013 often as late as ten p.m. There were no warnings about being out after dusk.\nOnly the sporadic palrol of low flying copters or the occasional pop of distant gunfire would nudge the word Iraq to mind. All things, like I said, being relative. Like Aleppo in Syria, there was a grey, dingy quality about the city center. The string of cheap hotels and numerous taxi stands and bus stations that characterized the wasit-al-balad section of Mosul said little about the rest of the city. It was only when wandering the suqs and thoroughfares that 1 noticed most main streets served to camouflage the back alleys and twisted by-ways of residential neighborhoods. Hidden behind the store fronts and traffic jams were a multitude of tiny, ancient streets full of old Arabic houses and courtyards which had remained unchanged for hundreds of years.\nI asked the hotel proprietor for directions and planned to set out in the morning for the mosques of Prophet Seth and Prophet Yunus and the remains of Nineveh. The city also boasted mosques housing the remains of Prophet Girgis (St. George) and Khidr but so did a lot of cities in the Middle East. The fact that no one really could explain who \u201cSt. George\u201d was and that the Khidr of Islamic tradition never died made the idea even more questionable. Then there were the accounts \u2013 mostly in Orientalist and Grail seeking circles \u2013 stipulating that Khidr was St George.\nIt would be enough, I thought to visit ground hallowed by the maqam of Prophet Seth, son of the Prophet Adam. Prophet Jonah was across the river square in the middle of what used to be Nineveh; the \u2018exceeding great city of three days journey.\u201d\nIn the still hours before dawn, Mosul groaned with the weight of history.\nNow the word of the Lord came unto\nJonah, the son of Ammital\nSaying: Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great\ncity and cry against it;\nFor their great wickedness has come up\nbefore me \u2026\nTHERE\u2019S virtually nothing left of Nineveh. I began my search from the citadel \u2013 like maqam of Prophet Yunus, or Jonah, and found myself being led by a gang of kids through a village of mud brick houses crowned by graveyard hills in the shadow of the mosque. The ruins? This way! they promised. We finally topped a small rise at the base of the maqam complex and they pointed: Athar! Buins.\nIt was a large brick. A Volkswagen sized brick. Getting closer, I saw the winged lions so prominent in Assyrian ruins covering the side. There was a small cave like opening and a timber scaffolding nearby that said someone had been excavating but hadn\u2019t gotten too far. Given the sanctity of the maqam site looming over us, there was little chance of the spot becoming an archeological dig. I asked one of the older kids again. Nineveh? Nargus Gate? He understood and we went off to hail a taxi.\nDirectly in front of the two massive gates to the ancient city that still survive was a barbed wire and sandbag checkpoint. I thought it prudent to ask the guard in military casuals and an AK-47 whether I could take pictures. He pointed to the building behind him and I noticed the sign: The Assyrian Association for a Democratic Iraq. A militia was guarding the site. A very nice militia but a militia nonetheless. He gave me a brief digest of the last six thousand years of Assyrian history and advised me to walk up the paths to the gates rather than climb the grassy hill. \u201cThe police station back there,\u201d he pointed, \u2018might see someone climbing around the site and shoot.\u201d\nGiven the heterogeneous mix in Mosul of religion and ethnicity, I decided not to ask if they were guarding the site from anyone in particular.\nModern day Assyrians are Christian, and in light of the current situation I thought there might be more than one variation of a turf war in the works. Most people in this region had at least a dual identity; whether it was Arab Christian, Kurdish Muslim, Christian Assyrian, Arab Yazidi or \u2026 you get the picture.\nSome photographs at sunset then back to the hotel for an early night Tomorrow morning was time to leave for Kurdistan.\nFEAR AND LOATHING IN KURDISTAN\nI don\u2019t know why I expected Kurdistan to be such a wonderful place. Perhaps it was the fact that since 1992 the Kurds have enjoyed a hitherto undreamed of degree of autonomy. Scattered throughout Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria; the Kurds comprise the largest ethnic group to be officially stateless. Then, in Saddam\u2019s Iraq of all places, a new era of history began. Iraq was practically the only nation with a sizeable Kurdish population that did not ban the use of the Kurdish language. What is more, the concept of a Kurdistan was actually concretized by the granting of autonomy to a large region in the north of Iraq. The dream was brought to life in the wake of the first Gulf War by the establishment of a safe haven and the implementation of no-fly zones by the victorious Allies. A capital was established in Arbil and the two largest political factions \u2013 the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) \u2013 now had a place to govern. Never mind the that when the two parties weren\u2019t fending Saddam, they were busy fighting amongst selves for control of the burgeoning state. Or that neither side was particularly choosy in looking for allies to help rout their rivals. Barzani\u2019s KI)P and Talabani\u2019s PUK bounced between Iran, the U.S., and Turkey among others in order to oust the competition. Certainly a low point in the internecine wars was reached when Masud Barzani enlisted Saddam\u2019s aid against the rival PUK; which led to KDP dominance in the western of Kurdistan.\nThe fact that \u2013 at last \u2013 there was a chunk land, larger than anything seen by Palestinians since biblical times, for the Kurds to call their own led me to believe; albeit foolishly, that Kurdistan would be a nice place to visit.\nLive and learn.\nI was fully aware of the atrocities and humiliations heaped on the Kurds by the twentieth century. The brutal decimation of the civilians Halabja by chemical weapons in 1988 was not a first Saddam may have gotten the idea from the British who had gassed the Kurdish population in the twenties during the Iraqi Revolution against British rule.\nThe U.S. had helped inspire more than one Kurdish rebellion against Saddam, only to bail out when Saddam retaliated, leaving the Kurds to face the wrath of Baghdad alone.\nStories like the following, which took place in the U.S.-inspired rebellions of Shi\u2019a and Kurd forces in 1991 are legion:\nThe Republican Guard divisions \u2026 moved northwards to Kurdistan, where they joined other guard divisions \u2026 Hundreds of thousands of Kurds walked over the mountains in the freezing temperatures . . . There was no food on the way. Most felt they had been utterly betrayed by the Americans and British who had done so much for a million Kuwaitis and so little for five million Kurds.\nIn some places Turkish soldiers opened fire on the refugees \u2026 At the Iski veren camp near Uludeere \u2026 the Turkish soldiers played a game with the Kurds: if the aid packages dropped by allied planes landed near the refugees, they could keep them. And if they landed near the soldiers, the soldiers could keep them. The Wars Against Saddamby John Simpson).\nOn February ist ten days before I arrived in Iraq, the relative calm of Kurdistan was rocked by another of the random terror attacks plaguing the rest of Iraq. Like the bombings in Kerbala and Baghdad, the terror struck on a religious holiday: Eid al-Adha.\nTwin suicide bomb attacks in Arbil claimed the lives of a hundred and left more than two hundred and forty injured. The entire region underwent three days of official mourning. Among the victims was Deputy Minister Sami Abd al-Kahman.\nAnother religious festival, this time The Feast of the Sacrifice, was cloaked in the blackest irony.\nIn spite of Kurdistan\u2019s bloody history and countless attempts from its neighbors at ethnic cleansing, I looked forward to the visit Till I got to the border.\nKurdistan\nMarch 7, 2004\nIf you\u2019re expecting a land of happy, laughing people . . .forget it. Welcome to KDP country, welcome to Stalin\u2019s secret banana republic.\nThere\u2019s a border. A bridge checkpoint where the nightmare begins. My passport is taken, and I\u2019m frisked \u2026 repeatedly. With no introductions and even less explanation, a Kurdish GomerPyle and his mukhabarat sidekick get in the car.\nArriving in Arbil, the driver makes a quick getaway and I\u2019m taken to the Ministry of the Interior. The plainclothes is fairly civilized and seems embarrassed by the whole thing, but GomerPyle in his uniform that resembled pajamas \u2013 or vice versa \u2013 is insisting I give him 4000 Iraqi dinar to return to his border post. I tell him no one asked for his company in the first place. Try walking.\nOne grubby office after another. Bureaucrats literally shuffle papers. Lined A4 notebook paper they call documents. At one point my latest interrogator has trouble finding his phone which is ringing under all the \u201cdocuments\u201d. Then he attaches a \u201cdocument\u201d to my passport.\nGiven their behavior I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ve shown up on Interpol. And for what? Finally a translator is brought in. I mention that his black shirts are trying to get baksheesh \u201cYo u didn \u2018t give them anything , did you?!\u201d was his response. I\u2019m not sure if he was relieved when I said no.\nHe explained the reason for all the security. The suicide bombings. I was reminded that travel in Iraq was dangerous. I reminded him I was in Kurdistan.\nAfter a friendly talk with more security people I was directed to a hotel, and accompanied by another soldier.\nThe hotel manager was adamant. No. No foreigners without permission from the Mukhabarat.\nBack to the Ministry of the Interior where Sami, the translator, made a few calls. Seems I have to go to the Security headquarters for a visa, I guess the Ministry of the Interior doesn\u2019t have as much clout as they used to.\nOff in another taxi to the other side of Arbil. I get to sit on a box outside the barbed wire, sandbags and large metal gate that protects the national security force from foreigners. Someone comes back out and explains I can come back tomorrow to get my passport. They give me a yellow paper and tell me to bring three photos. \u201cFor what?\u201d I ask. For permission to travel in Kurdistan.\n\u201cAnd what if I\u2019m stopped and asked for my passport before tomorrow?\u201d\nThey don\u2019t have any answer save: \u201cthat\u2019s the way it\u2019s done here. You must get an iqama, a travel permit.\u201d\nThe yellow paper is supposed to get me into a hotel.\nWelcome to Kurdistan, he says.\nMore like Stalin \u2018s Russia, I reply.\nAnother taxi, back to the hotel. My bags are getting heavy and I\u2019m dripping with sweat under the jacket that \u2013 when I left \u2013 was easier to wear rather than jam into an already overpacked travel bag. The sun is cutting through the haze and the temperature is rising.\nBack at the hotel, the manager is all smiles. Makes me wonder who the scowling and refusals were aimed at the first time. The strong feeling that all this \u2018security\u2019 wasn\u2019t good for business, or worse, that he felt he was being set up. A classic case of entrapment. If he let me in without a yellow paper, which the soldier accompanying me tried to convince him to do, the \u201csecurity\u201d folks would come down hard. Had I just wandered into a police state where even the locals were at the whim of military juntas?\nI was shown into a dingy pit of a room with a broken bathroom, no window and dimly fiickeringfiuorescent lights.\nArbil, I had been told, was KDP territory. The PUK has just gotten another supporter by default.\nI soon realized that Kurdistan was a land of \u201cspecial prices\u201d; of the petty rip-off. There are places where every door opened with a smile, every taxi ride, every single interaction is potentially laced with greed and revenge on the \u201chaves\u201d by the \u201chave nots.\u201d It usually strikes in heavily touristed but poverty struck countries. Logically, if you come from outside, you are richer than the residents \u2026 or so the thinking goes. You can expect it in impoverished countries with spectacular ruins from Mexico to India. I expected it in Iraq, where not only wasn\u2019t there much of an economy, there wasn\u2019t much of an infrastructure. I was pleasantly surprised when the occasional attempts in Baghdad were so easily dismissed, and the importunate demand quickly turned to a sheepish, oh-well-I-tried shrug. In Kurdistan it was often, and in earnest\nHow bout a room with a window and a working bathroom? 2000 more a day.\nGive me 4000 dinar so I can go back to my post and harass someone else.\nForeign? Give me money.\nIn heavily touristed areas it\u2019s a symbiotic thing. Tourists, totally out of touch with local economy, throw money around like it was Monopoly money. The locals become accustomed to easy marks, and the smooth talking bargaining games. In heavily touristed areas.\nBut this is Iraqi Kurdistan.\nArbil\nThe next day\nMore of the same. My visa wasn\u2019t an \u201carrive, pick it up and leave\u201d affair. For two hours I went back and forth between three different offices that looked like someone\u2019s garage at least twice. Maybe three times, iforget.\nQuestions like: Are you a member of any terrorist organization such as Al-Qaida or Ansar al-Islam filled much of the time. I found myself starting to wonder. Maybe I was and I just didn\u2019t know it. I was brought back to reality by uniformed hayseed grunts asking for money: You are foreign? American? Gefme mooney!\nI finally got a three day visa to visit Kurdistan. This was day two.\nAnd if I have to stay longer? If I\u2019m in Sulaymaniyafor more than a day?\nYou have to come back and get a visa extension.\nEven when the sun is shining, Arbil is grey and oppressive. The occasional resident that would stop to talk at any length usually painted such a bleak picture of unemployment, poverty and statelessness that I had to wonder where all the money from those Kurdish oil reserves was going. Or what good autonomy was doing for those not on KDP or PUK payrolls.\nI don\u2019t know about Sulaymaniya but in Arbil, the stench of nationalism and tribal warlords decked out as national heroes made it difficult to breathe. The KDP was on its third generation of Barzanis and things were not getting better. Often described as opportunist and corrupt by the media, Masud Barzani, in the form of framed portraits is everywhere.\nI hope things are better in the east, where Talabani\u2019s PUK rules the roost.\nBut I\u2019m not holding my breath. The air is already too thin.\nI HAVE never seen nationalism for its own sake put to any constructive ends. On the contrary, whether it be in the form of Zionism, Aryanism, Balkan or Bwandan ethnic cleansing or the American \u201cwar on terror\u201d; it remains a short term, myopic goal that produces long term tragedy. How can the ground we were whelped on be \u2013 in and of itself \u2013 a cause for pride and an assertion of moral dominance?\nLike most ultra-nationalist movements, the dread word Greater can be heard in Kurdistan. A Greater Kurdistan with a border running from Sinjar in the west, all the way through Mosul, veering south to include Kirkuk and then to Sulaymaniya and Halabja along the Iranian border. On my exit from Kurdistan, I saw flags flying as far south as Tuz on the Kirkuk/ Baghdad highway.\nDid anyone ask the Yezidis in Sinjar, or the Arabs or Turkomen or Assyrians in Mosul and Kiruk how they felt about being absorbed into a \u201cGreater Kurdistan\u201d?\nAm I oversimplifying when I see nationalism as a \u2018some people are never satisfied\u2019 construct?\nStaring out the car window on the way to Sulaymaniya at the increasingly mountainous and rugged terrain, I see occasional fortress-like structures stranded in the landscape. They seem to be abandoned prisons or medieval castles. I get the uneasy feeling they might still be in use.\nPostcards from the Land of Mordor.\nWHEN, or should I say \u201cif, Kurdistan gets onto the beaten track of places to see, then Sulaymaniya will be the showpiece and the resort center. Surrounded by mountain peaks it is a small city full of narrow, tree lined streets and little traffic circles adorned with metal sculptures. The overall impression is muted; it is neither ultramodern nor distinctly ancient. I found myself comparing it to a small Tyrolean town at the base of the Alps, or odder still; Woodstock NY. Like the New York town, it shows its best face to the world in a way that is self-consciously quaint and pleasing to the eye.\nWhen it came to finding a hotel, though, it seems there was no room at the inn. Asking around for the nearest place to stay, you are unfailingly steered to the Sulaymaniya Palace. Set dead center in the town it\u2019s easily the tallest and most conspicuous building. But there\u2019s no sign.\nAsking the security guards out front meant surrendering to another frisking.\nOnce inside, I was told there were no rooms. I began to wonder what might be going on that would cause a media circus, or international conference to descend on this idyllic backwater.\nI was steered toward two hotels nearby and when they weren\u2019t booked solid, they were still in the 40-50 dollar a day range. Looking around the lobbies, I noticed how crowded and busy these places were.\nIf you have to stay in Kurdistan, you might as well go in style. I cursed the lack of funds so near the end of the trip, and the magazine that had me humping my way like a refugee through such bourgeois comforts in the latest \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d scenario. I trudged on till I found an affordable dive.\nAn hour later, taking a picture of two old Kurdish men in traditional turbans and sashes sitting on a traffic circle bench, I thought of staying an extra day. Focusing the lens, trying to make the most of the setting sun on this pastoral scene, I was interrupted by the police.\nI showed them my passport. My visa.\nI was ordered in no uncertain terms into the back of a police truck with half a dozen other convict types. They drove at speed to the police headquarters, no doubt praying I wouldn\u2019t blow myself up en-route.\nThe commanding officer took one look at my papers, barked something suitably vicious at the arresting officers who didn\u2019t know a visa when they saw one, and shook my hand. There is no problem. Sorry. Welcome.\nThen I had to convince the guards at the gate that I was free to leave. They asked where I was from. They asked what I thought of Kurdistan.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any difference between your idea of security, and Saddam\u2019s.\u201d\nI expected a response. They had none, I decided to leave in the morning.\nMost, if not all of us, have a strange sympathy for the underdog. The ones who refuse to lie down on history\u2019s rubbish pile. The fact that the Kurds are a sore spot on many a national conscience and their history has been a series of humiliations, exiles and double-crosses, predisposes one to empathize with their cause and to overlook faults you would condemn in a more developed nation. Yet-even taking into account the occasional kind gesture; from the taxi driver who refused to take any money to the young photographer who spent an hour helping you find an affordable hotel \u2013 you walk away from Kurdistan with a bitter taste of xenophobia. The collective fear of outsiders produces an equal and opposite reaction. At a time in Iraq\u2019s history when many are seeking someone to blame; ethnocentricism is not advisable.\nFor tangible proof of this bullish, nationalistic fervor one need go no farther than the TV. In the hotel in Sulaymaniya, the TV was turned to KurdSat After a half hour discussion featuring a single talking head in front of a map outlin|ing the plans for a Greater Kurdistan, the news came on. Top story? Local delegates discussing the future of Kurdistan and emphasizing how democratic that future would be. Two seats in the National Assembly to represent the Christian residents who do not fall under the Kurd banner. Out of a hundred seats. Two.\nI\u2019m sure the Christians, Assyrians, Turcoman and other non-Kurds are overjoyed.\nThis was followed by story number two. Three school children in traditional costumes singing an ode to Kurdistan. Someone grab these kids before North Korean PR men whisk them away to do endless promos for Kim Jong II.\nDespite claims that the song of the future is democracy, human rights and a healthy respect for pluralism; the song ringing loudest in my ears was: \u201cI Hear You Knocking, But You Can\u2019t Come In.\u201d\nAFTER living in the Middle East for twelve years, the impossible has finally happened. You gel used to being suspected of spying if you carry an American passport What else would you possibly be doing in the blighted region? You eventually take it in stride and realize that most people in this part of the world would rather be safe, than sorry.\nSuddenly, a shift in the cosmic and temporal order of things has turned the \u201cforeigner\u2019 \u2013 particularly the Muslim foreigner \u2013 into a terrorist From the Mediterranean to as far as the subcontinent if not further, the face of terror is the face of the outsider. A Muslim outsider? All the more suspect. The\u2019 suddenness of this ironic turn of affairs had me reeling and reminded me of the cynical adage:\nIf you think you know what\u2019s going on in the Middle East \u2026 you haven\u2019t been properly briefed.\nTHE DOWNWARD SPIRAL\nWhen most people hear you just returned from Iraq, they usually ask: So how is it? Most of them, you realize, want a sound byte answer they can replay at a later date. Something succinct and tangible from \u2018someone who was there\u2019 to bolster any one of a multitude of saving-the-world schemes or conspiracy theories.\nComing back to Amman, there were questions from friends, an interview or two and some writing to get done.\nSo how is it? What\u2019s it like now?\nIn the beginning you answer but quickly realize the word answer is not appropriate. What adjective aptly covers the next Lebanon; the latest Vietnam? You want to say: It\u2019s simple, get a taxi, go there. See for yourself. The people are very nice. They won\u2019t kill you for being a Westerner but they may arrest you a lot. You might get blown up but it\u2019s nothing personal. At the end of the day in a country of 26,000,000 \u2026 there are still about 25,999, 984 survivors.\nYou might even say just that. Once or twice. Then you get quiet. Wonder when the latest visit will sift itself down into usable memory and you can go back and catch the next installment. The world is seldom shook in a mere ten days. For Iraq, this is still only the beginning.\nA week or two after leaving and Falluja is under siege from the Coalition forces. The stop and go nature of such conflicts has once again shifted into high gear. It probably shifted while I was there, beginning with the Ashura bombings but when you\u2019re in the midst of the chaos it seems more routine. It will no doubt, fade after a bit from the front page for a few weeks of exhausted, forced calm. The worst part of war is the waiting. Ask anyone who\u2019s been to one.\nAT HOME, the pile of newspapers and internet printouts grows but sheds little light. Turning on the radio to catch the BBC news, 1 am surprised to hear what sounds like the \u201cspecial English\u2019 of VOA; that over-enunciated and slowr English supposed to help non-native speakers. I realize it\u2019s George Bush Jr. And what he has to say is no surprise. Gone is the 100-day countdown to Iraqi self-determination. It looks like the U.S. is in for a longer haul.\nThe rest of the press conference would be comic if the fate of 26,000,000 didn\u2019t depend on it. Promises of peace for Christians and Jews and \u201cMuslims who want peace\u201d. A peace he compares to the peace and freedom \u201cwe\u201d brought to Kosovo and Afghanistan. Someone give the man a newspaper.\nBremer, when asked who exactly would take over when sovereignty was returned to the Iraqi people, answered: \u201cThat\u2019s a good question \u2026\u201d\nIraqi police forces are seen on international television fleeing from the fighting which only seems to be spreading. Caught between the heavy handed cowboy tactics of the Americans and their equally intractable fundamentalist foes; do they have any choice?\nOne thing is certain. Too many politicians and commentators alike are trying desperately to present us with variations of a mythological good versus evil saga. Hoping no doubt that \u201cgood\u201d will triumph as it must in all epic fantasies. Such monochromatic absolutes not only degrade the situations they seek to describe, but also negate the possibility of reality-based solutions. It also leaves out a color that is spilling out all over Iraq. Red.\nAt this point in time, Iraq is so far from such black-and-whites that any attempts at analysis or policy making which insists on such reductionism will be akin to trying to douse a fire with gasoline. Before we even try to find villains, shouldn\u2019t wc at least find out who\u2019s in the game? At last count, there were no less than seven. Without counting factional differences and internecine warfare you have:\nThe Coalition, Le the Americans, the Brits, and their allies. Whatever their motivation for entering Iraq, they are now stuck. The good news is that all those weapons of mass destruction never existed so they won\u2019t be attacked with those. The bad news is that no one likes a military occupation to begin with and this one has been going on, in its way, since 1991. Resentment is fierce and many Iraqis are no longer content to sit around and mope as this phase of occupation drags on and on. Most ground troops have little or no knowledge of Arabic, Islam or Arab culture. Who needs Berlitz when you have superior firepower?\nThe Shi\u2019a. The country\u2019s majority. The problem is they were denied much of a voice in Iraqi self-determination under lhe iron fist of Saddam. Massacred, oppressed, displaced and relegated to the shadowy fringes of the old Baathist regime; they feel their time has come. Democracy? Majority rule? Sounds good. Thanks to the past attempts by the U.S. to foment antiSaddam rebellions and then abandoning their local agitators to face the consequences; they are understandably cold towards any American plans for a new Iraq. And America\u2019s worst nightmarc scenario is an Islamic Republic of Iraq. It\u2019s already had enough trouble with Iraq\u2019s neighbor: Iran. Oneofthe biggest mistakes anyone can make al present is to view the Shi\u2019a population as a homogenous entity. The factions are too numerous to count and they range from Coalition supportive clerics to outright rejectionists. The news of the day is happy to center on Coalition-tolerant Sistani and his large following as the \u201cgood guy\u2019 and the young upstart Sadr with his fervent anti-imperialist pro-jihad rhetoric as the bad guy. Fortunately, the bad guy has a smaller following. Then why are the troops having so much trouble catching him? It is his rhetoric helping to inflame young militias in Baghdad to strike at U.S. troops.\nThe reality of the situation is that most Shi\u2019a I met were decidedly secular in their views on Iraqi politics. A name that came up repeatedly was Ibrahim Jaffri as a political hopeful. One Shi\u2019a politician, among many, trying to make a go of things by working within lhe political process. Does this make for titillating headlines? Of course not Stick to the mullahs and madbombers if you wanl to sell papers. The highest concentrations of Shi\u2019a are in the South. Current headlines point to the possibility that American bungling may turn Najaf into the next Fallu ja.\nThe Sunnis. The minority by a handful of percentage points. For decades they enjoyed the backing of Saddam. In theory. Saddam himself comes from Sunni dominated Tikrit, but had as much to do with religion as cows do with siding. Such favor afforded the Sunni population with most of the choice government positions and the chief role in policy making. Should any Sunni individual or group become too Islamic such favor would dry up. Sunni and Shi\u2019a under Saddam became ethnicity. The so-called Sunni Triangle may be comprised of mostly Sunni\u2019s and the cities that lie in its area may be a bit more provincial and backward than say Baghdad, or Mosul; but the attempts Io portray lhe region as a hotbed of fundamentalism is a convenient oversimplification. To obtain a reliable analysis of the current power struggle would have to take into account questions of tri bal loyalty, decades of political infighting and lhe role that religion has played in the area before the ousting of Saddam. One question noi being asked enough is \u201cwhy are Iraqis so suspicious of foreigners these days if they arc brewing a homemade revolution. Why are foreigners traveling alone suspected of terrorism?\u201d\nIt might have something to do with the fact that when terrorism hits, it is often carrying a \u201cforeign\u201d passport. Zarqawi \u2013 a Jordanian \u2013 is still apparently the prime suspect in the Ashura bombings. Iraqis wouldn\u2019t have the name of Osama bin Laden on the tip of their tongues if lhey were indeed sponsoring their own liberation struggle.\nThe Kurds. A sizeable majority in parts of Northern Iraq. In the recent past, they took breaks from warring with Baghdad so they could carry on factional and tribal warfare among themselves. An old Kurdish saying says that the mountains are the Kurd\u2019s only friends. They have however made some fairly friendly deals with any number of outside forces ranging from Turkey to Iran, Baghdad to Washington if they thought it would provide an upper hand over rival factions. Within Autonomous Kurdistan it is a fairly homogenous demographic but talk of a Greater Kurdistan has many in Mosul, Kirkuk and even Baghdad nervous. The refusal of Shia representatives to sign onto a provisional Iraqi constitution (and the bombings which followed the refusal) claimed Kurdish demands as prime cause for the breakdown in negotiations.\nThe Turcoman. A small popula tion of Turkic ethnicity hailing originally from Turkmenistan., the Iraqi Turcoman live mostly along the MosulBaghdad highway. Not appearing overly threatening to anyone, their sympathies with Turkey and use of the Turkish language probably does not endear them to the Kurds \u2013 whose history in Turkey is long and bloodstained. Any conflicts centering on the Turcoman population is usually related to either tribal warfare or Kurdish nationalism.\nAssyrian and Arab Christians. Another minority. Centering mostly around Mosul; the decades under Saddam created a melting pot effect where people were often Iraqi first, denominational second \u2013 if at all. Like most Christian populations in the Middle East there is a constant low grade fear that lhey will be subjected to becoming second class citizens in the wake of an Islamic revolution. Either that or they will become unwilling scapegoats in the aftermath of a Western Neo-con Crusade. Never mind the fact that many Christians are just as leery of an American occupation as everyone else. As is the case with members of other religious persuasions, the vast majority of Christians are not pushing for a theocratic state.\nOther minorities. Whether they are Iraqi Yezidis \u2013 a small and secretive religious faction some consider to be descendents of the Qur\u2019anic Sabeans, while others ascribe to them, rallier unfairly, the epithel of Devil Worshippers \u2013 or Muslims from other countries ranging from Egypt to Iran, or foreign workers of all persuasions; you\u2019re bound to run into a large number of expats in Iraq. Those from Europe, America and Asia are being told to get out. Now. Foreigners are becoming prey to hostage laking for use as human shields in the face of increasing military aggression. WTien not fearing being kidnapped, they are often being frisked for explosives by overwhelmed Iraqi and Kurdish security forces.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that-while I was in Baghdad-three Filipino \u201cjournalists\u201d were stopped outside the Meridian Hotel with bags full of explosives.\nIt\u2019s easy to blame foreigners but the Iraqis are having their suspicions juslified on a daily basis. Whether it\u2019s explosive journalists from the Philippines or the steady influx of Saudi Wahhabis and Mujahidin or Iranian militants; Iraq is taking more shrapnel wounds now that Saddam is gone than they ever did before.\nA story told to me by a Yezidi in Mosul may illustrate part of a larger picture. His brother, among many others, was approached and offered money to become Muslim. When the money, or the theological proselytizing, or a combination of the two convinced him to follow Islam; he was trained in the basic tenets of the faith which turned out to be distinctly Wahhabi / Salali based tenets. In other words, heavy on the tokfir or heresy hunting aspect. When the man saw where it was leading and wanted to back out, he was killed. It is notan isolated report.\nIn Falluja, the police informed me that although they didn\u2019t have concrete proofs \u2013 they knew that a large number of agent provocateurs were lending a hand to the rising tide of mayhem.\nMany months ago, the first reports out of Iraq were that the Ansar al-Islam were Iranian backed. Very shortly after it changed to Saudibacked and unless the present world is warped beyond any reasonable logic whatsoever, the notion of Saudi-backed is synonymous with the Wahabbi/Takfiri agenda.\nIf Iran is involved, and no doubt she is, I imagine they would be going about such subversive activities with a bit more caution and sense. One of the last major blows that Iran aimed at the U.S. was to flood the international market with counterfeit dollars. Very subtle and very destabilizing. The last time the Salafi mind-set grabbed world headlines, they flew passenger jets into downtown Manhattan and Washington DC.\nSo how is Iraq now? you ask. How much time you have?\nIf you\u2019re looking for a simple answer you\u2019re wasting your time. Yes, there are hidden Western agendas full of greed, mercenaries and geopolitical ambitions. There are also hardcore reactionaries ranging from Salafi jihadis to hard line communists to nationalist warlords. The Iraqi dream is a splintered mirror of every- thing from a dictatorship of the proletariat to the emergence of the twelfth imam to a theo- cratic Sunni rival to Shi\u2019a Iran. Maybe because dreaming is about all they have left. Given the miserable state of affairs we have to realize that it\u2019s too late to unwind the woven threads and pick out a culprit; one culprit. In times of extra- ordinary events, reality takes the place of imagi- nation, and for the Iraqi people the fabric bet- ween dreaming and waking has been torn. Awake or asleep, the constant heart pounding, irrational helplessness of nightmares is a dish served daily. America has fried this game once too often to think that, this time, they will win. The Iraqis are beginning to realize it as well. The recent targeting of foreigners is no more than a natural instinct to rid oneself of what causes pain.\nIt\u2019s sad to hear so many people in Iraq already reminiscing about how much better things were under Saddam. Or the sybaritic thrill the death of an American can produce in the most kindhearted Iraqi who lost too many friends and family members to Operation Iraqi Freedom.\nWhat\u2019s even sadder are those who look forward, at the end of the day, to winning. When a wretched mix of imperial arrogance, sycophantic opportunism and blind fanaticism collides head on with the greatest sin of all \u2013 despair we\u2019ve all lost far too much already. ?"

            "Poland to tighten border controls amid growing tension over irregular crossings. Poland will introduce temporary border controls with Germany and Lithuania from Monday amid growing tensions over irregular migration, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, has said.\nThe decision, made after a government meeting with the Polish border guard on Tuesday, comes in response to growing domestic political pressure and far-right backed protests at Poland\u2019s border crossings with Germany over the weekend.\nIn remarks at the beginning of the weekly cabinet meeting, Tusk blamed Germany for the move, accusing it of a policy shift resulting in \u201ceffectively refusing entry \u2026 to migrants who are heading to Germany to apply for asylum or other forms of status\u201d.\n\u201cThe way operations are conducted at the Polish-German border has clearly changed over the past month,\u201d he said.\nThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, made a more hardline migration policy a pillar of his election campaign earlier this year. After he took office in May, Germany stationed more police at the border and said some people trying to enter the country would be turned away.\nEven before that, Merz\u2019s predecessor in February extended by six months the temporary border checks Germany had imposed on its frontiers last autumn, as it attempted to cut the number of people arriving in the country.\nTusk argued that the recent policy shift had placed undue pressure on Poland to accept individuals denied entry at the German border.\n\u201cWith no border checks on the Polish side, it becomes difficult to determine whether those being returned or redirected to Poland should be sent there,\u201d he said.\nTusk added that he had spoken \u201cseveral times\u201d with Merz, warning him that Poland\u2019s \u201cpatient stance \u2026 was wearing thin\u201d.\n\u201cWe have been defenders of the Schengen area [the EU\u2019s visa-free travel zone] and remain advocates of a Europe with open borders and unrestricted movement. However, such a system requires the same, symmetrical commitment from all neighbouring countries,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTherefore, the temporary reinstatement of border controls on the Polish-German border is necessary to reduce, to the minimum, the uncontrolled flow of migrants crossing \u2026 the border.\u201d\nAccording to the EU, member states are allowed to temporarily reintroduce border controls in cases of a serious threat, such as internal security. It says border controls should be applied as a last resort in exceptional situations, and must be limited in time.\nIn a pointed warning to Merz, Tusk on Tuesday said that if the German government extended one-sided border controls in September, Poland would retaliate with a similar move. \u201cThe time when Poland would not respond appropriately to such actions has definitively come to an end,\u201d he added.\nDebate over migration in Poland has turned increasingly heated in recent weeks, with far-right activists starting to organise patrols along the border with Germany.\nThe move to introduce temporary border controls with Lithuania was understood to be linked to the German policy change.\nTusk said that with the heavily militarised Polish-Belarusian border closed to irregular migration, other neighbouring countries were now being used to explore alternative routes into the Schengen area through the Baltics.\nAs a result, he said, \u201cthe stream of illegal migration, orchestrated by Russia and Belarus, continues to flow through Belarus, Latvia, and Lithuania \u2013 and Poland, after all, has an open border with Lithuania\u201d.\nMerz was asked about Poland\u2019s growing criticism during a joint press conference with the prime minister of Luxembourg.\nSpeaking minutes before Tusk announced Poland\u2019s decision, Merz said he was aware of Polish concerns and had repeatedly spoken with the Polish prime minister in recent days.\nBut he insisted that there were \u201cno returns from Germany to Poland of asylum seekers who had already arrived in Germany\u201d.\nMerz said the two countries \u201chave a common problem that we want to solve together\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cWe naturally want to preserve the Schengen area, but freedom of movement in the Schengen area will only work in the long term if it is not abused by those who promote irregular migration, in particular by smuggling migrants.\u201d\nAssociated Press and Reuters contributed to this report",
            "Poland begins controls on borders with Germany and Lithuania. Poland has reintroduced temporary border controls with Germany and Lithuania in response to public concerns over irregular migration.\nThe measures came into force at midnight on Sunday and will last until 5 August, in the latest example of EU governments imposing measures that are straining the fabric of the bloc\u2019s passport-free Schengen zone.\nThere have been far-right protests in Poland and anti-immigration campaigners have claimed that Germany is sending people to Poland despite them not having originally entered Germany via Poland, in contravention of EU rules. German authorities have denied this.\nPoland\u2019s controls are being carried out by hundreds of extra police officers and soldiers on 52 border crossings with Germany and 13 with Lithuania.\nGermany introduced similar random checks on the Polish border in 2023. In May, shortly after the new government of Friedrich Merz took office, the German interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, ordered more intensive controls which meant that asylum seekers could be turned back at the border, sparking controversy and triggering court challenges.\nDobrindt has called a summit on 18 July at which regional politicians are to discuss the challenges that are putting considerable strain on the Schengen zone. Under EU regulations, temporary border controls are allowed in order to address serious threats, but they can only be kept in place for a limited time.\nOn Monday, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said his government was made up of \u201csupporters of \u2026 Europe without borders\u201d but that they were operating in the interests of the entire EU.\n\u201cWe are doing this for you, for the Germans, the Dutch, the French, because it\u2019s the border of the European Union,\u201d he said.\nThe interior minister, Tomasz Siemoniak, said the measures were necessary to prevent irregular migration through Poland. While the controls are only meant to last for 30 days, Siemoniak added: \u201cIf the Germans don\u2019t remove their controls, we will continue with ours too.\u201d\nHe said the problem had been exacerbated by the tightening of controls at the Poland-Belarus border, leading to rising numbers elsewhere. \u201cWe are seeing a significant increase in illegal migrants crossing the border into Lithuania, Latvia and then travelling to Poland,\u201d he said.\nFor some time Poland has been warning against what it says is a Russian-Belarusian campaign to destabilise the EU and stoke the far right by incentivising irregular migration through the bloc\u2019s eastern borders with Belarus.\nSiemoniak said that just before the controls began at midnight, Polish border guards stopped an Estonian man attempting to smuggle four people, thought to be Afghan citizens, over the border. \u201cThis is exactly the proof we need as to how necessary these controls are,\u201d he said.\nTusk said the same four people had been previously registered as attempting the illegal crossing from Belarus.\nTusk repeated his thinly veiled criticism of Germany, saying the new controls would allow the Polish authorities to scrutinise every case of a person being turned away by the German border force and pushed back into Poland.\n\u201cIt will no longer be the case that anyone who has crossed the border illegally and whose documentation is incomplete or unclear will be sent to Poland from anywhere \u2013 whether from Germany or any other country,\u201d Tusk said.\nIn Berlin, Merz\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cThe protection of borders against irregular migration is an interest that Germany has, that Poland has, that our European neighbours share with us. We do not want permanent border controls.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s government commissioner for Poland, Knut Abraham, described the border controls as a \u201cheavy burden\u201d for the border region. \u201cThis is not a good day for German-Polish relations,\u201d he said. \u201cIntensifying controls at the German-Polish border will not be the solution to the migration problem.\u201d",
            "The Paris Commune and the idea of the state - Mikhail Bakunin. Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin on the Paris Commune and the idea of government and the state.\nThis work, like all my published work, of which there has not been a great deal, is an outgrowth of events. It is the natural continuation of my Letters to a Frenchman (September 1870), wherein I had the easy but painful distinction of foreseeing and foretelling the dire calamities which now beset France and the whole civilized world, the only cure for which is the Social Revolution.\nMy purpose now is to prove the need for such a revolution. I shall review the historical development of society and what is now taking place in Europe, right before our eyes. Thus all those who sincerely thirst for truth can accept it and proclaim openly and unequivocally the philosophical principles and practical aims which are at the very core of what we call the Social Revolution.\nI know my self-imposed task is not a simple one. I might be called presumptuous had I any personal motives in undertaking it. Let me assure my reader, I have none. I am not a scholar or a philosopher, not even a professional writer. I have not done much writing in my life and have never written except, so to speak, in self-defense, and only when a passionate conviction forced me to overcome my instinctive dislike for any public exhibition of myself.\nWell, then, who am I, and what is it that prompts me to publish this work at this time? I am an impassioned seeker of the truth, and as bitter an enemy of the vicious fictions used by the established order - an order which has profited from all the religious, metaphysical, political, juridical, economic, and social infamies of all times - to brutalize and enslave the world. I am a fanatical lover of liberty. I consider it the only environment in which human intelligence, dignity, and happiness can thrive and develop. I do not mean that formal liberty which is dispensed, measured out, and regulated by the State; for this is a perennial lie and represents nothing but the privilege of a few, based upon the servitude of the remainder. Nor do I mean that individualist, egoist, base, and fraudulent liberty extolled by the school of Jean Jacques Rousseau and every other school of bourgeois liberalism, which considers the rights of all, represented by the State, as a limit for the rights of each; it always, necessarily, ends up by reducing the rights of individuals to zero. No, I mean the only liberty worthy of the name, the liberty which implies the full development of all the material, intellectual, and moral capacities latent in every one of us; the liberty which knows no other restrictions but those set by the laws of our own nature. Consequently there are, properly speaking, no restrictions, since these laws are not imposed upon us by any legislator from outside, alongside, or above ourselves. These laws are subjective, inherent in ourselves; they constitute the very basis of our being. Instead of seeking to curtail them, we should see in them the real condition and the effective cause of our liberty - that liberty of each man which does not find another manpis freedom a boundary but a confirmation and vast extension of his own; liberty through solidarity, in equality. I mean liberty triumphant over brute force and, what has always been the real expression of such force, the principle of authority. I mean liberty which will shatter all the idols in heaven and on earth and will then build a new world of mankind in solidarity, upon the ruins of all the churches and all the states.\nI am a convinced advocate of economic and social equality because I know that, without it, liberty, justice, human dignity, morality, and the well-being of individuals, as well as the prosperity of nations, will never amount to more than a pack of lies. But since I stand for liberty as the primary condition of mankind, I believe that equality must be established in the world by the spontaneous organization of labor and the collective ownership of property by freely organized producerspi associations, and by the equally spontaneous federation of communes, to replace the domineering paternalistic State.\nIt is at this point that a fundamental division arises between the socialists and revolutionary collectivists on the one hand and the authoritarian communists who support the absolute power of the State on the other. Their ultimate aim is identical. Both equally desire to create a new social order based first on the organization of collective labor, inevitably imposed upon each and all by the natural force of events, under conditions equal for all, and second, upon the collective ownership of the tools of production.\nThe difference is only that the communists imagine they can attain their goal by the development and organization of the political power of the working classes, and chiefly of the proletariat of the cities, aided by bourgeois radicalism. The revolutionary socialists, on the other hand, believe they can succeed only through the development and organization of the nonpolitical or antipolitical social power of the working classes in city and country, including all men of goodwill from the upper classes who break with their past and wish openly to join them and accept their revolutionary program in full.\nThis divergence leads to a difference in tactics. The communists believe it necessary to organize the workers' forces in order to seize the political power of the State. The revolutionary socialists organize for the purpose of destroying - or, to put it more politely - liquidating the State. The communists advocate the principle and the practices of authority; the revolutionary socialists put all their faith in liberty. Both equally favor science, which is to eliminate superstition and take the place of religious faith. The former would like to impose science by force; the latter would try to propagate it so that human groups, once convinced, would organize and federalize spontaneously, freely, from the bottom up, of their own accord and true t their own interests, never following a prearranged plan imposed upon \"ignorant\"; masses by a few \"superior\" minds.\nThe revolutionary socialists hold that there is a great deal more practical good sense and wisdom in the instinctive aspirations and real needs of the masses than in the profound intelligence of all the doctors and guides of humanity who, after so many failures, still keep on trying to make men happy. The revolutionary socialists, further more, believe that mankind has for too long submitted to being governed; that the cause of its troubles does not lie in any particular form of government but in the fundamental principles and the very existence of government, whatever form it may take.\nFinally, there is the well-known contradiction between communism as developed scientifically by the German school and accepted in part by the Americans and the English, and Proudhonism, greatly developed and taken to its ultimate conclusion by the proletariat of the Latin countries. Revolutionary socialism has just attempted its first striking and practical demonstration in the Paris Commune.\nI am a supporter of the Paris Commune, which for all the bloodletting it suffered at the hands of monarchical and clerical reaction, has nonetheless grown more enduring and more powerful in the hearts and minds of Europe's proletariat. I am its supporter, above all, because it was a bold, clearly formulated negation of the State.\nIt is immensely significant that this rebellion against the State has taken place in France, which had been hitherto the land of political centralization par excellence, and that it was precisely Paris, the leader and the fountainhead of the great French civilization, which took the initiative in the Commune. Paris, casting aside her crown and enthusiastically proclaiming her own defeat in order to give life and liberty to France, to Europe, to the entire world; Paris reaffirming her historic power of leadership, showing to all the enslaved peoples (and are there any masses that are not slaves?) the only road to emancipation and health; Paris inflicting a mortal blow upon the political traditions of bourgeois radicalism and giving a real basis to revolutionary socialism against the reactionaries of France and Europe! Paris shrouded in her own ruins, to give the solemn lie to triumphant reaction; saving, by her own disaster, the honor and the future of France, and proving to mankind that if life, intelligence, and moral strength have departed from the upper classes, they have been preserved in their power and promises in the proletariat! Paris inaugurating the new era of the definitive and complete emancipation of the masses and their real solidarity across state frontiers; Paris destroying nationalism and erecting th religion of humanity upon its ruins; Paris proclaiming herself humanitarian and atheist, and replacing divine fictions with the great realities of social life and faith in science, replacing the lies and inequities of the old morality with the principles of liberty, justice, equality, and fraternity, those eternal bases of all human morality! Paris heroic, rational and confident, confirming her strong faith in the destinies of mankind by her own glorious downfall, her death; passing down her faith, in all its power, to the generations to come! Paris, drenched in the blood of her noblest children - this is humanity itself, crucified by the united international reaction of Europe, under the direct inspiration of all the Christian churches and that high priest of iniquity, the Pope. But the coming international revolution, expressing the solidarity of the peoples, shall be the resurrection of Paris.\nThis is the true meaning, and these are the immense, beneficent results of two months which encompassed the life and death of the ever memorable Paris Commune.\nThe Paris Commune lasted too short a time, and its internal development was too hampered by the mortal struggle it had to engage in against the Versailles reaction to allow it at least to formulate, if not apply, its socialist program theoretically. We must realize, too, that the majority of the members of the Commune were not socialists, properly speaking. If they appeared to be, it was because they were drawn in this direction by the irresistible course of events, the nature of the situation, the necessities of their position, rather than through personal conviction. The socialists were a tiny minority - there were, at most, fourteen or fifteen of them; the rest were Jacobins. But, let us make it clear, there are Jacobins and Jacobins. There are Jacobin lawyers and doctrinaires, like Mr. Gambetta; their positivist...presumptuous, despotic, and legalistic republicanism had repudiated the old revolutionary faith, leaving nothing of Jacobinism but its cult of unity and authority, and delivered the people of France over to the Prussians, and later still to native-born reactionaries. And there are Jacobins who are frankly revolutionaries, the heroes, the last sincere representatives of the democratic faith of 1793; able to sacrifice both their well-armed unity and authority rather than submit their conscience to the insolence of the reaction. These magnanimous Jacobins led naturally by Delescluze, a great soul and a great character, desire the triumph of the Revolution above everything else; and since there is no revolution without the masses, and since the masses nowadays reveal an instinct for socialism and can only make an economic and social revolution, the Jacobins of good faith, letting themselves be impelled increasingly by the logic of the revolutionary movement, will end up becoming socialists in spite of themselves.\nThis precisely was the situation in which the Jacobins who participated in the Paris Commune found themselves. Delescluze, and many others with him, signed programs and proclamations whose general import and promise were of a positively socialist nature. However, in spite of their good faith and all their goodwill, they were merely socialists impelled by outward circumstances rather than by an inward conviction; they lacked the time and even the capacity to overcome and subdue many of their own bourgeois prejudices which were contrary to their newly acquired socialism. One can understand that, trapped in this internal struggle, they could never go beyond generalities or take any of those decisive measures that would end their solidarity and all their contacts with the bourgeois world forever.\nThis was a great misfortune for the Commune and these men. They were paralyzed, and they paralyzed the Commune. Yet we cannot blame them. Men are not transformed overnight; they do not change their natures or their habits at will. They proved their sincerity by letting themselves be killed for the Commune. Who would dare ask more of them?\nThey are no more to be blamed than the people of Paris, under whose influence they thought and acted. The people were socialists more by instinct than by reflection. All their aspirations are in the highest degree socialist but their ideas, or rather their traditional expressions, are not. The proletariat of the great cities of France, and even of Paris, still cling to many Jacobin prejudices, and to many dictatorial and governmental concepts. The cult of authority - the fatal result of religious education, that historic source of all evils, depravations, and servitude - has not yet been completely eradicated in them. This is so true that even the most intelligent children of the people, the most convinced socialists, have not freed themselves completely of these ideas. If you rummage around a bit in their minds, you will find the Jacobin, the advocate of government, cowering in a dark corner, humble but not quite dead.\nAnd, too, the small group of convinced socialists who participated in the Commune were in a very difficult position. While they felt the lack of support from the great masses of the people of Paris, and while the organization of the International Association, itself imperfect, compromised hardly a few thousand persons, they had to keep up a daily struggle against the Jacobin majority. In the midst of the conflict, they had to feed and provide work for several thousand workers, organize and arm them, and keep a sharp lookout for the doings of the reactionaries. All this in an immense city like Paris, besieged, facing the threat of starvation, and a prey to all the shady intrigues of the reaction, which managed to establish itself in Versailles with the permission and by the grace of the Prussians. They had to set up a revolutionary government and army against the government and army of Versailles; in order to fight the monarchist and clerical reaction they were compelled to organize themselves in a Jacobin manner, forgetting or sacrificing the first conditions of revolutionary socialism.\nIn this confusing situation, it was natural that the Jacobins, the strongest section, constituting the majority of the Commune, who also possessed a highly developed political instinct, the tradition and practice of governmental organization, should have had the upper hand over the socialists. It is a matter of surprise that they did not press their advantage more than they did; that they did not give a fully Jacobin character to the Paris insurrection; that, on the contrary, they let themselves be carried along into a social revolution.\nI know that many socialists, very logical in their theory, blame our Paris friends for not having acted sufficiently as socialists in their revolutionary practice. The yelping pack of the bourgeois press, on the other hand, accuse them of having followed their program too faithfully. Let us forget, for a moment, the ignoble denunciations of that press. I want to call the attention of the strictest theoreticians of proletarian emancipation to the fact that they are unjust to our Paris brothers, for between the most correct theories and their practical application lies an enormous distance which cannot be bridged in a few days. Whoever had the pleasure of knowing Varlin, for instance (to name just one man whose death is certain), knows that he and his friends were guided by profound, passionate, and well-considered socialist convictions. These were men whose ardent zeal, devotion, and good faith had never been questioned by those who had known them. Yet, precisely because they were men of good faith, they were filled with self-distrust in the face of the immense task to which they had devoted their minds and their lives; they thought too little of themselves! And they were convinced that in the Social Revolution, diametrically opposite to a political revolution in this as in other ways, individual action was to be almost nil, while the spontaneous action of the masses had to be everything. All that individuals can do is formulate, clarify, and propagate ideas expressing the instinctive desires of the people, and contribute their constant efforts to the revolutionary organization of the natural powers of the masses. This and nothing more; all the rest can be accomplished only by the people themselves. Otherwise we would end up with a political dictatorship - the reconstitution of the State, with all its privileges, inequalities, and oppressions; by taking a devious but inevitable path we would come to reestablish the political, social, and economic slavery of the masses.\nVarlin and all his friends, like all sincere socialists, and generally like all workers born and bred among the people, shared this perfectly legitimate feeling of caution toward the continuous activity of one and the same group of individuals and against the domination exerted by superior personalities. And since they were just and fair-minded men above all else, they turned this foresight, this mistrust, against themselves as much as against other persons.\nContrary to the belief of authoritarian communists - which I deem completely wrong - that a social revolution must be decreed and organized either by a dictatorship or by a constituent assembly emerging from a political revolution, our friends, the Paris socialists, believed that revolution could neither be made nor brought to its full development except by the spontaneous and continued action of the masses, the groups and the associations of the people.\nOur Paris friends were right a thousand times over. In fact, where is the mind, brilliant as it may be, or - if we speak of a collective dictatorship, even if it were formed of several hundred individuals endowed with superior mentalities - where are the intellects powerful enough to embrace the infinite multiplicity and diversity of real interests, aspirations, wishes and needs which sum up the collective will of the people? And to invent a social organization that will not be a Procrustean bed upon which the violence of the State will more or less overtly force unhappy society to stretch out? It has always been thus, and it is exactly this old system of organization by force that the Social Revolution should end by granting full liberty to the masses, the groups, the communes, the associations and to the individuals as well; by destroying once and for all the historic cause of all violence, which is the power and indeed the mere existence of the State. Its fall will bring down with it all the inequities of the law and all the lies of the various religions, since both law and religion have never been anything but the compulsory consecration, ideal and real, of all violence represented, guaranteed, and protected by the State.\nIt is obvious that liberty will never be given to humanity, and that the real interests of society, of all groups, local associations, and individuals who make up society will never be satisfied until there are no longer any states. It is obvious that all the so-called general interests of society, which the State is supposed to represent and which are in reality just a general and constant negation of the true interests of regions, communes, associations, and individuals subject to the State, are a mere abstraction, a fiction, a lie. The State is like a vast slaughterhouse or an enormous cemetery, where all the real aspirations, all the living forces of a country enter generously and happily, in the shadow of that abstraction, to let themselves be slain and buried. And just as no abstraction exists for and by itself, having no legs to sand on, no arms to create with, no stomach to digest the mass of victims delivered to it, it is likewise clear that the celestial or religious abstraction, God, actually represents the very real interests of a class, the clergy, while its terrestrial complement, that political abstraction, the State, represents the no less real interests of the exploiting class which tends to absorb all the others - the bourgeoisie. As the clergy has always been divisive, and nowadays tends to separate men even further into a very powerful and wealthy minority and a sad and rather wretched majority, so likewise the bourgeoisie, with its various social and political organizations in industry, agriculture, banking, and commerce, as well as in all administrative, financial, judiciary, education, police, and military functions of the State tend increasingly to weld all of these into a really dominant oligarchy on the one hand, and on the other hand into an enormous mass of more or less hopeless creatures, defrauded creatures who live in a perpetual illusion, steadily and inevitably pushed down into the proletariat by the irresistible force of the present economic development, and reduced to serving as blind tools of this all-powerful oligarchy.\nThe abolition of the Church and the State should be the first and indispensable condition for the real enfranchisement of society which can and should reorganize itself not from the top down according to an ideal plan dressed up by wise men or scholars nor by decrees promulgated by some dictatorial power or even by a national assembly elected through universal suffrage. Such a system, as I have already said, would inevitably lead to the creation of a new state and, consequently, to the formation of a ruling aristocracy, that is, an entire class of persons who have nothing in common with the masses. And, of course, this class would exploit and subject the masses, under the pretext of serving the common welfare or saving the State.\nThe future social organization should be carried out from the bottom up, by the free association or federation of workers, starting with the associations, then going on to the communes, the regions, the nations, and, finally, culminating in a great international and universal federation. It is only then that the true, life-giving social order of liberty and general welfare will come into being, a social order which, far from restricting, will affirm and reconcile the interests of individuals and of society.\nIt is said that the harmony and universal solidarity of individuals with society can never be attained in practice because their interests, being antagonistic, can never be reconciled. To this objection I reply that if these interest have never as yet come to mutual accord, it was because the State has sacrificed the interests of the majority for the benefit of a privileged minority. That is why this famous incompatibility, this conflict of personal interests with those of society, is nothing but a fraud, a political lie, born of the theological lie which invented the doctrine of original sin in order to dishonor man and destroy his self-respect. The same false idea concerning irreconcilable interests was also fostered by the dreams of metaphysics which, as we know, is close kin to theology. Metaphysics, failing to recognize the social character of human nature, looked upon society as a mechanical and purely artificial aggregate of individuals, suddenly brought together in the name of some formal or secret compact concluded freely or under the influence of a superior power. Before uniting in society, these individuals, endowed with some sort of immortal soul, enjoyed complete liberty, according to the metaphysicians. We are convinced that all the wealth of man's intellectual, moral, and material development, as well as his apparent independence, is the product of his life in society. Outside society, not only would he not be a free man, he would not even become genuinely human, a being conscious of himself, the only being who thinks and speaks. Only the combination of intelligence and collective labor was able to force man out of that savage and brutish state which constituted his original nature, or rather the starting point for his further development. We are profoundly convinced that the entire life of men - their interests, tendencies, needs, illusions, even stupidities, as well as very bit of violence, injustice, and seemingly voluntary activity - merely represent the result of inevitable societal forces. People cannot reject the idea of mutual independence, nor can they deny the reciprocal influence and uniformity exhibiting the manifestations of external nature.\nIn nature herself, this marvelous correlation and interdependence of phenomena certainly is not produced without struggle. On the contrary, the harmony of the forces of nature appears only as the result of a continual struggle, which is the real condition of life and of movement. In nature, as in society, order without struggle is death.\nIf order is natural and possible in the universe, it is only because the universe is not governed according to some pre imagined system imposed by a supreme will. The theological hypothesis of divine legislation leads to an obvious absurdity, to the negation not only of all order but of nature herself. Natural laws are real only in that they are inherent in nature; that is, they are not established by any authority. These laws are but simple manifestations, or rather continuous variations, of the uniformities constituting what we call 'nature.' Human intelligence and its science have observed them, have checked them experimentally, assembled them into a system and called them laws. But nature as such knows no laws. She acts unconsciously; she represents in herself the infinite variety of phenomena which appear and repeat themselves inevitably. This inevitability of action is the reason the universal order can and does exist.\nSuch an order is also apparent in human society, which seems to have evolved in an allegedly anti natural way but actually is determined by the natural animal's needs and his capacity for thinking that have contributed a special element to his development - a completely natural element, by the way, in the sense that men, like everything that exists, represent the material product of the union and action of natural forces. This special element is reason, the captivity for generalization and abstraction, thanks to which man is able to project himself in his thought, examining and observing himself like a strange, eternal object. By lifting himself in thought above himself, and above the world around him, he reaches the representation of perfect abstraction the absolute void. And this absolute is nothing less than his capacity for abstraction, which disdains all that exists and finds its repose in attaining complete negation. This is the ultimate limit of the highest abstraction of the mind; this absolute nothingness is God.\nThis is the meaning and the historical foundation of every theological doctrine. As they did not understand the nature and the material causes of their own thinking, and did not even grasp the conditions or natural laws underlying such thinking, these early men and early societies had not the slightest suspicion that their absolute notions were simply the result of their own capacity for formulating abstract ideas. Hence they viewed these ideas, drawn from nature, as real objects, next to which nature herself ceased to amount to anything. They began to worship their fictions, their improbably notions of the absolute, and to honor them. But since they felt the need of giving some concrete form to the abstract idea of nothingness or of God, they created the concept of divinity and, furthermore, endowed it with all the qualities and powers, good and evil, which they found only in nature and in society. Such was the origin and historical development of all religions, from fetishism on down to Christianity.\nWe do not intend to undertake a study of the history of religious, theological, and metaphysical absurdities or to discuss the procession of all the divine incarnations and visions created by centuries of barbarism. We all know that superstition brought disaster and caused rivers of blood and tears to flow. All these revolting aberrations of poor mankind were historical, inevitable stages in the normal growth and evolution of social organizations. Such aberrations engendered the fatal idea, which dominated men's imagination, that the universe was governed by a supernatural power and will. Centuries came and went, and societies grew accustomed to this idea to such an extent that they finally destroyed any urge toward or capacity to achieve further progress which arose in their midst.\nThe lust for power of a few individuals originally, and of several social classes later, established slavery and conquest as the dominant principle, and implanted this terrible idea of divinity in the heart of society. Thereafter no society was viewed as feasible without these two institutions, the Church and the State, at its base. These two social scourges are defended by all their doctrinaire apologists.\nNo sooner did these institutions appear in the world than two ruling classes - the priests and the aristocrats - promptly organized themselves and lost no time in indoctrinating the enslaved people with the idea of the utility, indispensability, and sacredness of the Church and of the State.\nFirst Published in 1871 Alfred A. Knopf, New York, NY\nComments\nHere's a PDF version\nHere's a PDF version\nFirst Published in 1871\u2026\nJust to say, this is a mistake; the publisher Alfred A. Knopf wasn't established until 1915. The edited collection Bakunin on Anarchy, which contains Bakunin's Paris Commune text, was first published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1972, but Bakunin's work itself was never self-published. Bakunin actually wrote his Commune text in 1871 as part of his unfinished manuscript The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution. Ida Pilat Isca, who translated this particular text in Dolgoff's Bakunin on Anarchy, relied on the fourth volume of the collected works Bakunin: Oeuvres as her source. It's also worth mentioning that Bakunin never called the text \"The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State\"; it seems that \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus was the one who gave it that title when he published parts of it in 1878 (i.e. after Bakunin passed away) in the magazine Le Travailleur. The original source material (as Dolgoff also mentions) just describes it as the preamble to the second part of The Knouto-Germanic Empire.\n(Incidentally, I also bought an original 1972 version of the Bakunin on Anarchy book, but then stupidly threw it away when I was going through my \"let's just use ebooks\" phase...)\nThe International Center for\u2026\nThe International Center for Research into Anarchism also has a more complete translation of the preamble here (https://archive.org/details/sparrowsnest-7287/mode/1up), along with some helpful info regarding the origin of the text:\nWe can probably replace Isca's translation from the Bakunin on Anarchy anthology with Charlton's more complete translation, along with possibly adding CIRA's overview of the background of the text.

            "Nacc architect calls for robodebt investigation update, saying corruption watchdog has been \u2018too secretive\u2019. A key architect of the National Anti-Corruption Commission has called for a public update on the investigation into the illegal robodebt scheme, warning community confidence in the watchdog and its commissioner, Paul Brereton, is on the line.\nThe independent MP Helen Haines, who helped craft legislation to establish the Nacc and has sat as a member of a parliamentary oversight committee, said it had been \u201ctoo secretive\u201d in the first two years of operations, including over its investigation into the Coalition\u2019s welfare payment recovery scheme.\nAs many as 440,000 Centrelink recipients were hounded over alleged incorrect payments, based on faulty income averaging algorithms.\nHaines, the MP for the Victorian seat of Indi, said it was disappointing the commission had not provided transparency over its U-turn on a decision to investigate six individuals referred by the robodebt royal commission, after an independent review into its initial refusal.\nIn February, the Nacc said five public servants and one public official would be investigated to determine whether or not they \u201cengaged in corrupt conduct\u201d.\n\u201cIt took 11 months for the Nacc to decide it wouldn\u2019t take an investigation in the first place,\u201d Haines said.\n\u201cThen we really saw a damning report from the Nacc inspector that brought us to this situation where this is being reviewed. It took months to decide really whether that decision would be reconsidered by an independent delegate, and we\u2019re now five months since that all happened and we haven\u2019t heard any more. So again, that\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\nThe Nacc\u2019s original decision not to investigate was heavily criticised, with its own watchdog, inspector Gail Furness, revealing she had received more than 1,000 complaints.\nFurness released a report in October 2024 finding that Brereton was \u201caffected by apprehended bias\u201d and should have \u201cremoved himself from related decision-making processes and limited his exposure to the relevant factual information\u201d.\nThe report found Brereton had appointed a deputy commissioner as a delegate to decide on the robodebt referrals due to a perceived conflict of interest with one of the individuals who was \u201cwell known to him\u201d, which he declared. The Nacc noted the report contained \u201cno finding of intentional wrongdoing or other impropriety\u201d.\nBrereton rejected calls to step down, suggesting \u201can error of judgment\u201d did not justify that move.\nHaines said a public update on the investigation was appropriate, but she stopped short of calling for Brereton to step down.\n\u201cWe\u2019re two years in and I think that the question of robodebt and the transparency around where the commission is at will, I think, determine just how much confidence the public ultimately has in the National Anti-Corruption Commission and in the stewardship of Commissioner Brereton.\u201d\nHaines made the comments in an interview for Guardian Australia\u2019s Australian Politics podcast, released on Friday.\nA spokesperson for the Nacc said it \u201cworks hard to balance the need for confidentiality in its operational activity and the call for transparency in the public interest\u201d.\nThey said an update was published on 1 July, confirming the investigation of robodebt royal commission referrals, led by deputy commissioner Kylie Kilgour, with former high court justice Geoffrey Nettle acting as chief adviser.\n\u201cThe commissioner and other deputy commissioners who were involved in the original decision not to investigate the referrals are not participating in the investigation,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThey added the commission does not comment on ongoing investigations, as doing so \u201cmay compromise operational activities or unfairly impact reputations\u201d.\nLast month the Nacc released a report revealing a senior home affairs department official had abused public office and misused internal information to get her future brother-in-law a job, including hiding their relationship and sharing interview questions with her sister. The woman was given a pseudonym and has not publicly commented on the case.",
            "ACC recovers Billions of Leones as investigations into Auditor General Report continue. Patrick Sandi: Sierra Leone Telegraph: 21 September 2020:\nThe Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in this third report, wishes to update the general public of the actions and steps it has taken to address critical issues raised in the Audit Reports of Sierra Leone 2015 \u2013 2018.\nThese interventions focused on aspects of possible, or alleged corruption, and conducts inconsistent with the provision(s) in the Anti-Corruption Act of 2008.\nAfter a thorough review, and analysis of the aforementioned Reports, a total of twenty-one issues attracted the attention of the Commission; with a view to investigating, prosecuting, or recovering public funds, public revenue, public property, as the case maybe, in accordance with Sections 7, and 48 of the Anti-Corruption Act of 2008 respectively.\nBelow are the third set of issues, and areas of ACC interventions, and the outcomes of same:\nThe ACC has charged two (2) matters to Court. Furthermore, there are thirteen (13) ongoing active investigations. Two (2) matters have been accordingly closed for lack of evidence. In terms of monies returned to the State, the Commission has recovered a total sum of Two Billion, Seven Hundred And Forty-Two Million, One Hundred And Eighty-Five Thousand, Three Hundred and Four Leones, Sixty-One Cents (Le 2, 742, 185, 304, 61).\nSIERRA LEONE ROAD SAFETY AUTHORITY (SLRSA)\nThe Audit Report alleged that the Former Executive Director of the SLRSA, Dr. Sarah F. Bendu, and others, misappropriated public funds amounting to Three Billion Leones (Le:3,000,000,000) purported to have been used for the shipment and payment of customs duty for Toe Vehicles.\nThe matter was charged to court, and the trial is in progress. However, one of the accused persons, Madam Kipiatu Alghali, had pleaded guilty and was convicted and fined Three Hundred Million Leones (Le 300, 000, 000.00), and ordered to repay a restitution of Two Hundred and Twenty-Seven Million Leones (Le 227, 000, 000.00).\nThe convicted person has paid a total amount of Five Hundred and Twenty-Seven Million Leones (Le 527, 000, 000.00).\nMINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS (MIC)\nThe Audit Report alleged that the former Permanent Secretary in the MIC; the Executive Director of SALCAB; and the Board Chairman SALCAB, jointly Misappropriated Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (USD$300, 000) meant for the construction of Cubicles for the Fiber Optic Project.\nThree persons were charged to court; and two among them were found guilty, and ordered to pay a fine of One Hundred and Twenty Million Leones (Le 120,000,000), and Sixty Million Leones (Le 60, 000, 000) respectively. They have paid their respective fines.\nBANK OF SIERRA LEONE (BSL)\nThe Audit Report discovered that the procurement of software (Oracle) for the Bank of Sierra Leone, worth over Five Million United States Dollars (USD$5m), was undertaken without following procurement procedures. ACC investigations established that proper procurement procedures were not followed through, with many causes for concern including retroactive approvals and failure to follow laid down guidelines on approvals. The software has been procured, installed, but not put in use yet due to challenges arising from contractual relationship and COVID-19 interruption.\nHowever, there are various issues of official misconduct and abuse of office or position that are now under review by the Prosecutions Department of the ACC to determine if the said conducts of the former Governors, the Board of Directors and various staff of the Bank of Sierra Leone meet prosecutorial threshold for prosecution. The Public will be updated further on this in due course.\nMINISTRY OF BASIC AND SENIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION (MBSSE)\nThe Audit Report alleged that withdrawals amounting to Three Billion Leones (Le 3,000,000,000) were made from the MBSSE\u2019s Account. Nonetheless, there were no supporting documents for the alleged use of One Billion, Eight Hundred Million Leones (Le 1,800,000,000).\nThe ACC has analyzed same and obtained statements from the Senior Finance Officers that undertook several projects, but failed to report. Investigation into this matter is still in progress.\nNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (NATCOM)\nThe Special Technical Audit Report 2018 underscored that NATCOM made series of individual donations. ACC investigations confirmed that donations were indeed made to public institutions, groups, and individuals, upon request to undertake development projects. Some undertook the projects. Others did not.\nIn this regard, the Commission has recovered a total of One Hundred and Fifteen Million Leones (Le 115,000,000) from the groups that failed to undertake the said projects. Additionally, two individuals have refunded the amount of monies donated to them. Meanwhile, investigation into this matter is still in progress.\nMINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT (MLGRD)\nThe Report alleged that the MLGRD could not account for withdrawals made from the Imprest Account, and other Accounts, amounting to the sum of Four Hundred and Seventy Nine Million Leones (Le479.000 .000.00), and Three Hundred and Fifty One Million Leones (Le 351,000,000) respectively.\nThe Audit Report also highlighted that two desktop computers, amounting to Two Million Leones (Le2, 000,000), and sixteen (16) yards of carpet, amounting to Eleven Million Leones (Le 11,000,000), were not seen during the Audit Team verification.\nThe ACC has issued Notices as part of the ongoing investigations process. Investigations are ongoing in that regard and the public will be updated upon conclusion.\nThe Commission shall continue to promptly update the public through releases on interventions made with regard the Auditor-General\u2019s Audit Reports of Sierra Leone. Release No. 4 on the Audit Reports will be out in the following weeks.\nMeanwhile, the ACC wishes to reassure the general public of its determination and commitment to protecting public property and revenue across the country at all times.\nAbout the author\nPatrick Sandi is the Director of Public Education and Outreach at the Anti-Corruption Commission of Sierra Leone.\nDon\u2019t forget that Young4na is inherently and blatantly a party die-hard! He will always go after anyone who goes after his people!!!\nYoung4na, you need to educate yourself in civics before stating vague statements. Most of Bio\u2019s appointees have been in their positions less than two years. This brief period of tenure is not sufficient to measure their engagement to defraud Sierra Leone. Most of the ministers in the previous administration were cleaning every nickel and dime from all government accounts here and abroad. They even took the broom to the banks and cleaned what they could from those institutions. Ernest Koroma was head of the group. You people have no shame to even try to defend such acts of thievery? What did they own before they came to power? Being an insurance salesman in a poor country does not make one a millionaire. Please stop fooling the people of Sierra Leone. Advise your brothers and sisters or whatever they are to you to be wise to give up the loot to avoid prison time. This time the government of Maada Bio is serious about curbing or eliminating this criminal act.\nThanks to the ACC for recovering some of these stolen monies from thieves, which can be used for the Free quality education and new diagnostic health centre for the citizens. I hope he will continue his success in the fight against corruption even with the current government because that is the only recipe for the development of our nation. May the Almighty continue to bless and protect you from any distractions.\nThese are good steps which have never happened before but I am pleading to please create ways to investigate the transport sector (drivers and conductors who ply the city of Freetown). These people are too corrupt by always calling half way especially us from the Western Rural Urban. The police just make loud noise in the media but are doing nothing in terms of half ways saga.\nSalone na contri ya, they go into politics to enrich themselves \u2013 not the masses or the nation as a whole. Whosoever mismanages of country\u2019s resources for his or her shellfish interest, God Almighty will punish their entire generation here and thereafter.\nThe ACC under the present leadership will never say something to me that will fly. It is all a mockery of there one-sided fight against corruption. The ACC boss should resign to save his awkward fight against selective corruption. A complete buffoon of themselves. Did they hear what the smart and wise Young4na said? I hope they do. God bless Young4na and the victims of selective justice. To hell with selective justice.\nPublic officials are notorious for using loopholes in the procurement regulations to divert funds for their private use. One of the ways in which corruption could be significantly minimised is the overhaul of the procurement system, which honestly has become a joke. I cannot understand how a large procurement spend can go ahead with funds released despite not following procurement procedures, which shows that those in charge do not know what they are doing. Not following procurement regulations for certain spending categories should be an offence.\nThose found guilty should not only be fined but imprisoned to send a strong message. What procurement software for the Bank of Sierra Leone alone, that can cost 5 million dollars, and which right thinking Governor would approve that? This is daylight robbery. There are far more larger organisations with better e-procurement systems that will cost no way near that amount. Withdrawals are made, purchases are made but not accounted for in most of these institutions. It is a disgrace that public officials would engage in such activities, which explains why the public sector is badly managed. May God help Sierra Leone!\nWell done to the ACC and the efforts they\u2019ve made to recover some of the misappropriated missing billions of Leones that were meant for our country\u2019s development. Somehow, ended up in the hands of corrupt, unpatriotic do nothing public officials. I believe these middle ranking officials that have been dipping their glued hands in our country\u2019s wealth, should not only be asked to repay the stolen wealth, as a future deterrent for anyone harbouring the same thoughts. In all fairness, they should be sent to jail. IF YOU DO THE CTIME, YOU SHOULD DO THE TIME. Now we are left wondering how much of our country\u2019s wealth is stolen by their bosses \u2013 the ministers that are supposedly meant to act as supervisors for this thieving public officials.\nIf Ben is serious about tackling this cancer of corruption, he should state the part on his mission statement, that he will follow the NORTH STAR and go where the evidence of wrong doing takes him. Not to go after the usual suspects. He should go after president Bio\u2019s untouchables. Not long ago some of his ministers can\u2019t afford a fence, now since they\u2019ve been in power, they are buying, or in extreme cases like Hon Sandy, apart from covid19, the worst thing that happened to our country, is engaged in land grab policy as minister for lands. And building mansions in stolen lands, especially in the Freetown area.\nYou really can\u2019t make this stuff up. Ben should stick with his mission statement without fear or favours. He should follow the NORTH STAR not as it seemed at the moment anyone who happens to be a NORTHERNER. Don\u2019t mistake the North Star for the North. There is South, East and west. Just in case you never pay attention to your geography teacher. It will not wash with the Sierra Leonean public. They are smart enough to see through your actions and deeds. May God bless Sierra-Leone.\nThe ACC continue to show its prowess when dealing with corruption cases pertaining to previous regime civil servant or government appointees. What we have yet to see is the same determination and prowess being display to corruption cases tied to current regime officials.",
            "Sierra Leone\u2019s anti-corruption avant-garde. Abayomi Tejan: Sierra Leone Telegraph: 5 September 2019:\nPresident Julius Maada Bio has dared his government and public servants; there will be no more safe haven for those who steal government money. And fortune seems to be in his favour.\nThis is Sierra Leone\u2019s first and last opportunity to do the right thing \u2013 to take poverty away from the people. Without president Bio\u2019s resolve to give a freehand to three strategically placed public servants \u2013 the Anti-Corruption Commissioner, Francis Ben Kelfala; the Chief Executive of the National Public Procurement, Authority, Ibrahim Brima Swarray ; and the country\u2019s Auditor General, Lara Taylor Pearce , the fight against corruption would have been lost before it had begun.\nThe Anti-Corruption Commissioner, Francis Ben Kelfala; the Chief Executive of the National Public Procurement Authority, Ibrahim Brima Swarray ; and the Auditor General, Lara Taylor Pearce are key public servants, who are ensuring that President Bio\u2019s fight against corruption succeeds.\nThus far, these three have demonstrated absolute fortitude and unflinching commitment to do the right thing for once, and end the travesty of corruption and ill-deserved poverty in Sierra Leone.\nThe procurement of goods and services by government ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) has been a main source for embezzlement and all manner of dishonesty the human mind could contrive. But this is about to change under the stewardship of Mr Swarray \u2013 the NPPA boss, who has restored sanity to an institution that had been rendered irrelevant by the former government.\nEncouraged by president Bio\u2019s resolve to be the bastion of circumspection for all public servants, Mr Swarray has demonstrated that he is prepared to do his job exactly as prescribed by the laws governing public procurement. He has made significant savings on government expenditure, running into billions of Leones. (Photo: President Bio).\nThat being the case, the stage is set for foreign direct investments, increased donor confidence, lesser domestic borrowing and the stabilization of the economy.\nEven the country\u2019s Local Content Policy would gain traction, encouraging more local companies and entrepreneurs to compete for contracts without fear of manipulation by heads of MDAs.\nThe Auditor General, Lara Taylor Pearce, is beyond question an astute professional that is above politics, when it comes to the execution of her mandate. Her reports so far speak volumes of the invidious squandering of government funds by heads of MDAs over the last decade.\nShe has manifested profound independence of partisan politics, and that is certainly not going to change under President Bio\u2019s New Direction agenda. Her next report would capture any misappropriation of funds since 2018.\nThe ACC Commissioner, Francis Ben Kelfala, is the man in the middle of it all. Heads of MDAs, and indeed all public sector enterprises would be running a grave risk trying to beat the system. (Photo: Lara Taylor-Pearce).\nAs corruption has permeated the entire fabric of the country, the general public, too, must play its own part by resisting corruption when faced with a situation. It is they who bear the brunt of the hardship that has been thrust on the nation by corruption.\nThere is no corrupt act too petty or trivial; petty crime offenders languish in prison for stealing a phone or Le 50, 000. Surely, the ACC Commissioner needs the cooperation of the entire citizenry, whose indulgence in politics during elections is quite visible.\nIf only citizens would be as much involved and enthusiastic in the fight against corruption, the instrument of their poverty, Sierra Leone would become the envy of other African countries and a haven for business.\nAlready, president Bio has earned himself a lot of respect in the international arena. An avalanche of goodwill and support for Sierra Leone is on it\u2019s way. Soon, the economic storm would calm, and the citizens would realize the virtue in honest and disciplined leadership.\nSierra Leone, the country, is rich; but the people are poor and hungry. The vast majority, that is. There has always been a handful, a tiny minority apart from genuine business people who, by virtue of their position in society, be it political or civil, enriching themselves through corruption at a viral scale. And they have been getting away with it, making mockery of a criminal justice system concentrating only on the common man whose poverty and need for basic daily sustenance leave them no option but to steal for a living.\nAs the saying goes, they will \u2018share their poverty with the rich who won\u2019t share their riches with them.\u2019 Corruption festers violence and crime. If corruption is seen to be crushed with no discrimination, there would be law and order as a necessary end. Poverty will be reduced.\nThere are rich men, poor men, beggars and thieves in all societies. But woe unto a nation whose leader is a thief; that nation shall never prosper or be at peace.\nI want to thank those who are at the front in the fight against corruption. The fight against corruption is a national fight. It will be won.\nI hope all works well with those entrusted with authority and power. Brava to you guys.\nAlusine Fallay Hahahah, hahahaaah; wow, wow, you made my day bro. Hahahaah. I must say you do have a sense of humor after all. All along, I thought praise singing the SLPP leadership despite their corrupt practices was the only thing you are good at. Alas, you have just added another medal under your belt \u2014 a comedian.\nNow, on a serious note, I am not surprised at the level of naivety being displayed by fanatic supporters like you. One of my best friend is a die-hard SLPP supporter like you. Prior to the elections, he spent a huge amount of his money to support Bio, including traveling to Salone just to witness the elections. He told me he eventually held several meetings with Bio. Six months ago, while I was in town, he wanted me to meet a few of the ministers whom he said they are his childhood friends, IIhumbly decline.\nLike you, he thinks Bio is a God, hence he should be worship by all. In fact, he thinks the only party worthy of ruling Sierra Leone is SLPP. Not a given day past Without receiving messages i considered propagandist from him. I can see a lot of similarities in you. Time and again, you have presented false narrative in this platform to suit your praise singing job.\nFew days ago, you falsely declare that, SLPP has always humbly accepted election defeat. On the contrary, that has never been the case. While Solomon B humbly accepted the 2007 elections, the rest of the SLPP hierarchy never did. As for 2012 elections, none of SLPP leadership accepted the result, a law suit was filed, only to be thrown out by the high court. But none of these facts matters to praise singers like you, all that matters to you is to suit your masters.\nNow, in regards to corruption, again, only a naive/die-hard regime supporter will believe that there is absolutely no corruption taking place. The notion that a magic wand has been waved resulting to a complete eradication of corruption cannot be anywhere close to being absurd. By all indications, even the president, whom you consider a deity, is very much aware of corrupt elements within his inner circle. Like many politicians, the only time he will take action is when information leaks in the public. Lastly, may I remind you that the president himself is mot a saint when it comes to corruption? Most of us are aware of the passport sale, gunboat deal, and other schemes engineered by the president during NPRC to dupe the poor citizen of our nation.\nOh what a well balanced article! The author made me laugh my sides out with the following comment: \u201cBut woe unto a nation whose leader is a thief\u201d. Ernest Bai Koroma, did you hear this?\nPresident Julius Maada Bio, Francis Ben Kelfala, Ibrahim Brima Swarray and Lara Taylor-Pearse may be in the front row of fighting corruption in our country. But much credit should also be given to Mr. Abdul Rashid Thomas, the proprietor and editor of the Sierra Leone Telegraph. While other journalists were receiving brown envelopes to turn a blind eye on corruption, especially between 2007 and 2018, Thomas was quick to expose the powerful in Sierra Leone who thought that they would rule with impunity while taking the country to the cleaners. Thomas continues fighting relentlessly for his country to this day.\nIt is impossible to totally eradicate corruption in any society. However, corruption can be drastically minimized anywhere with goodwill and determination. Sierra Leone is a better country today than it was just sixteen months ago. I urge president Julius Bio, Francis Ben Kelfala, Ibrahim Brima Swarray, Lara Taylor-Pearse, Abdul Rashid Thomas and all patriotic Sierra Leoneans to not abandon their fight against corruption.\nIn my personal opinion, this is the \u201cDREAM TEAM\u201c that will eventually change Sierra Leone forever, by the end of the first term of His Excellency President Maada Bio. I like the balance of the team \u2013 2 men and a woman, although I should have preferred the other way round.\nWith your permission again Young4na, this time around I will like to reveal your real name JOHN FORNAH to the ACC as a person of interest and ACCOMPLICE, which in summary means: A PERSON WHO HELPS ANOTHER COMMIT A CRIME. If you are a US citizen I hope the New Direction government will ask the USA government to first use the preferred interrogative method used by former president George Bush which is Waterboarding on suspected terrorists on you, in order to reveal the name of your corrupt friend that confided in you; and hopefully, you will be extradited along with the former APC transport minister \u2013 Balogun Koroma.\nJust for clarity, I\u2019m not accusing you of being an APC member because I have read your book on this forum \u2013 \u201cHow to prove that you\u2019re not APC\u201c. Finally, the ACC will appreciate your patriotic cooperation because they and His Excellency President Maada Bio believe that Corruption is a National Security Threat which in my opinion is equal to terrorism.\n\u201cCorruption festers violence and crime. If corruption is seen to be crushed with no discrimination, there would be law and order as a necessary end.\u201d\nIndeed, the fight against corruption can be easily won when there are no sacred cows and the rule of law is applicable, devoid of political affiliations or tribe. It\u2019s an open secret that corruption permeates itself within the fabric of our society. In fact, the practice has become a culture; if you are in a lucrative job and appears to desist from corrupt practices, you are deemed as an outcast.\nAs we speak, countless of the officials in the new regime are busy amassing wealth in the form of building mansions overnight, while sending their wives and kids on expensive foreign trips. I have a friend of mine who coalesce with many of the key officials in the current regime. He confides in me with many of the happenings. In fact, he himself won a contract from the new regime and he is almost completing a massive mansion within 8 months. For now, the fight against corruption is focused on the former regime; time will tell if the Bio regime will indeed go after those within his inner circle.\nIn my view, anyone who sincerely thinks they can make a difference in the fight against corruption must be encouraged and be given the opportunity to do so. Only time will tell if many of these people are honest and trustworthy. Partisan politics must be put aside when fighting corruption. That\u2019s the only way things will work for the benefit of all.\nThe fight against corruption is gaining an unbelievable momentum. Corruption is our greatest enemy and the greatest challenge to our country\u2019s development. If we win the fight against corruption we have arrived. The fight against corruption must be swift, collective, indiscriminate and goal driven.\nThere must only be one goal for fighting corruption \u2013 NATIONAL INTEREST. At IPAM we have started seeing some positive results already. The introduction of the CCTV camera in examination halls and finger print system have completely removed examination malpractice. This was clearly reflected in this year\u2019s first semester results with over 70% failure \u2013 the highest ever in the history of IPAM. Corruption must be eradicated everywhere."

            "Trump Media Furthers Push Into Crypto With Third ETF Filing. Cryptocurrencies\nTrump Media Furthers Push Into Crypto With Third ETF Filing\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp. is plowing deeper into the cryptocurrencies space with a new filing for an exchange-traded fund that would hold a number of digital assets including Bitcoin, Ether, Solana and others.\nA Tuesday filing showed the social-media firm owned by President Donald Trump seeking to launch the \u201cCrypto Blue Chip\u201d fund, with the paperwork marking its third ETF filing. The fund, should it launch, would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP directly, though nearly three-quarters of it would be comprised of Bitcoin, the largest token in the market. Though ETFs holding Bitcoin and Ether already trade in the US, no such funds hold Cronos or XRP directly.",
            "Trump Media files for 'Crypto Blue Chip ETF' with SEC. Trump Media files for 'Crypto Blue Chip ETF' with SEC\nPresident Donald Trump plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund, or ETF, through his media company\nPresident Donald Trump continues to expand his crypto-related offerings, this time with a planned exchange-traded fund tied to the prices of five popular cryptocurrencies.\nTrump Media & Technology Group, a Florida company that operates the Truth Social media platform, announced Tuesday it had filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval to launch the \u201cCrypto Blue Chip ETF\u201d later this year.\nThe proposed ETF would have 70% of its holdings in bitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, 15% in ethereum, the second-most popular, and 8% in solana, a cryptocurrency popular in the meme coin community. The fund would hold 5% in the cryptocurrency developed by the company Ripple and 2% in the crypto created by the exchange Crypto.com, which will act as the ETF\u2019s digital custodian.\nTrump Media previously announced plans for a crypto ETF with just bitcoin and ethereum. It\u2019s unclear if the company plans to move forward with that ETF offering. Trump Media did not immediately return a request for comment.\nCryptocurrency-based ETFs make it easier for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without having to buy them directly. These funds have exploded in popularity since bitcoin ETFs began trading in U.S. markets last year.\nThe SEC released new guidelines last week for crypto ETF issuers as part of the Trump administration\u2019s push to create a more welcoming regulatory environment for crypto-related companies. The agency has also dropped or paused several enforcement actions against crypto companies since Trump took office.\nTrump was once a bitcoin skeptic who has since warmly embraced the cryptocurrency industry, which has showered him with campaign and other types of contributions. Ripple, for example, was one of the biggest donors to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee.\nWhile the Trump administration has pushed for crypto-friendly regulations and laws, the Trump family has aggressively sought to expand its crypto-related businesses. That dynamic has led to allegations of corruption from Democrats and concern among some crypto enthusiasts that the president may be undermining their efforts to establish credibility and stability for the industry.\nAt a news conference last month, Trump dismissed any notion that his family\u2019s investments were improper and touted his administration\u2019s efforts to make the U.S. the world capital for crypto.\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have it, China would,\u201d Trump said.\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",
            "From Bitcoin to XRP: Key cryptocurrency terms and what they mean. From Bitcoin to XRP: Key cryptocurrency terms and what they mean\nBitcoin's price reaching a new high of $120,000 (\u00a389,000) - buoyed by US President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance - has kept the buzzy world of cryptocurrencies in the spotlight.\nBut it also contains confusing terms such as ETFs, blockchains and cold wallets, that can make the topic somewhat tricky to navigate.\nWorry not.\nIf you're hearing these for the first time, or simply need a refresher, here are a few key terms and what they mean.\nBitcoin\nWhile many may struggle with the finer points of crypto, pretty much everyone has heard of its most famous product: Bitcoin. But what actually is it?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is to say a type of digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by centralised financial institutions.\nThis makes it popular for people who think decentralisation can bring financial freedom, but it also makes it extremely volatile with it rising and falling in value at the whim of Bitcoin buyers and sellers.\nDonald Trump has pledged to make the US the \"crypto capital of the world\" - backtracking on his previous claim that Bitcoin was a \"scam\".\nIts price topped a much-awaited threshold of $100,000 in December 2024.\nIn mid-July 2025, the price rose to $120,000 as US politicians prepared to begin debating bills that would regulate digital assets.\nBut its price has been known to plummet just as quickly as it spikes.\nBlockchain\nBlockchain is the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many related products like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In essence, it is a virtual spreadsheet on which all the buying and selling of crypto is recorded. They are arranged in blocks linked together in a giant chain - hence the name.\nEvery cryptocurrency transaction is individually recorded onto the blockchain by a huge network of volunteers verifying its authenticity by using computer programmes.\nThe incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain.\nBitcoin 'halving'\nThe blockchain is sustained by rewarding so-called \"miners\" - whose job it is to validate transactions - by paying them with the cryptocurrency.\nHowever, unlike some other digital currencies, there is not an infinite supply of Bitcoins. The amount that can be mined is capped at 21 million, and most are already in circulation.\nSo roughly every four years - or when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain size - the number of bitcoins rewarded to those who successfully validate transactions is cut in half. The most recent Bitcoin \"halving\" (or \"halvening\") event took place on 20 April 2024, reducing the reward for miners from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125.\nThis ensures Bitcoin's supply is drawn out for longer while demand, in theory, goes up over time. But with fewer rewards for miners, it can also lead some to consider whether it is financially worthwhile for them to continue the costly operation of running their powerful computers.\nCrypto Exchange\nA crypto exchange is the digital platform where investors can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies.\nSimilar to traditional investing, a crypto exchange acts as a brokerage where people can transfer traditional money, like pounds or dollars, in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most transactions are accompanied by fees.\nCrypto Wallet\nA crypto wallet is a place where investors hold their cryptocurrency. There are two types, a hot wallet and a cold wallet.\nHot wallets are connected to the internet, and thus more accessible for quick transfers and easy access.\nCold wallets are physical devices like specially designed USB sticks that store crypto offline typically for safer and longer term storage.\nEthereum\nEthereum is used to describe both the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, represented by the Ether token, and the blockchain underpinning it. This supports an array of different applications and digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens.\nIt functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy.\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs)\nETFs are portfolios that let investors bet on multiple assets without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. They can comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mix of shares in both technology and insurance companies.\nA spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, \"on the spot\", at its current price, throughout the day.\nWhile some ETFs already contained Bitcoin indirectly, the US approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This allowed new investors, such as investment management firms like Blackrock and Fidelity, to enter the speculative world of Bitcoin without having to worry about digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges.\nMeme coins\nMeme coins are a form of cryptocurrency used for fun and speculation.\nThey are typically created to capitalise on social media trends or viral memes - such as for internet-famous pygmy hippo Moo Deng.\nBut meme coins are heavily criticised for their speculative nature and the risk involved for investors, as they often have little prospect of accumulating value over time.\nThey can also be susceptible to \"rug pulls\" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers to raise the price of their coin, only to stop trading activity and make off with the money raised from sales.\nSome celebrities have faced backlash after launching meme coins.\nStablecoins\n\"Stable\" is the key word here - this cryptocurrency differs from others as it is intends to be less volatile in value.\nThis typically works by the price being linked to an existing asset, for instance currencies like the US dollar or pound sterling, which in theory should make them more stable in price than cryptocurrencies that are not backed by assets.\nStablecoins themselves are usually controlled by companies that provide them, with transactions recorded on digital ledgers. While held up by some as the future of finance, high profile price collapses of stablecoins have alerted regulators to risks for investors and prompted scrutiny over their supposed stability.\nXRP\nXRP is a cryptocurrency used by a platform called the XRP Ledger. It was created by the co-founders of financial services company Ripple Labs in 2012 as a cheaper, faster alternative to Bitcoin.\nThe cryptocurrency has a fixed supply of 100 billion coins, which were created when it launched. Much of it is held by Ripple and periodically released into circulation.\nUnlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, transactions made using XRP are verified through consensus - whereby the majority of validators on its peer-to-peer network must agree whether or not a transaction is valid before it is added to its blockchain.\nThis has been credited with allowing many transactions to take place simultaneously, at high speed and low cost - making it appealing to financial institutions or for processes like cross-border payments. But as with other cryptocurrencies, XRP has received regulatory scrutiny and seen sudden, sharp declines in value.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

            "Nvidia's CEO says it has US approval to sell its H20 AI computer chips in China. Nvidia's CEO says it has US approval to sell its H20 AI computer chips in China\nNvidia's CEO Jensen Huang says the technology giant has won approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips used for artificial intelligence to China\nBANGKOK -- Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang says the technology giant has won approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence to China.\nThe news came in a company blog post late Monday and Huang also spoke about the coup on China\u2019s state-run CGTN television network in remarks shown on X.\n\u201cThe U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon,\u201d the post said.\n\u201cToday, I'm announcing that the U.S. government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,\u201d Huang told reporters in Beijing. He noted that half of the world's AI researchers are in China.\n\u201cIt's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here in China,\u201d he said.\nHuang recently met with Trump and other U.S. policymakers and this week is in Beijing to attend a supply chain conference and speak with Chinese officials.\nThe broadcast showed Huang meeting with Ren Hongbin, the head of the China Council for Promotion of International Trade, host of the China International Supply Chain Expo, which Huang was attending. Nvidia is an exhibitor.\nNvidia has profited enormously from rapid adoption of AI, becoming the first company to have its market value surpass $4 trillion last week. However, the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the industry.\nWashington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. The emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January renewed concerns over how China might use the advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.\nIn January, before Trump began his second term in office, the administration of President Joe Biden launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries.\nThe White House announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.\nNvidia had said the tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion, and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying President Donald Trump to reverse the restrictions. They argue that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a leading edge sector in one of the world\u2019s largest markets for technology.\nThey've also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.\n___\nAP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed.\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

            "Company's carbon credits raise questions about unproven ocean technology to fight global warming. Company's carbon credits raise questions about unproven ocean technology to fight global warming\nA startup called Gigablue claims to have reached a milestone by selling 200,000 carbon credits for its ocean-based carbon capture technology\nThe startup Gigablue announced with fanfare this year that it reached a historic milestone: selling 200,000 carbon credits to fund what it describes as a groundbreaking technology in the fight against climate change.\nFormed three years ago by a group of entrepreneurs in Israel, the company says it has designed particles that when released in the ocean will trap carbon at the bottom of the sea. By \u201charnessing the power of nature,\u201d Gigablue says, its work will do nothing less than save the planet.\nBut outside scientists frustrated by the lack of information released by the company say serious questions remain about whether Gigablue\u2019s technology works as the company describes. Their questions showcase tensions in an industry built on little regulation and big promises \u2014 and a tantalizing chance to profit.\nJimmy Pallas, an event organizer based in Italy, struck a deal with Gigablue last year. He said he trusts the company does what it has promised him \u2014 ensuring the transportation, meals, and electricity of a recent 1,000-person event will be offset by particles in the ocean.\nGigablue\u2019s service is like \u201can extra trash can\u201d where Pallas can discard his unwanted emissions, he said.\n\u201cSame way I use my trash can \u2014 I don\u2019t follow where the truck that comes and picks up my trash brings it to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take their word for it.\u201d\nGigablue has a grand vision for the future of carbon removal. It was originally named \u201cGigaton\u201d after the one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide most scientists say will be necessary to remove from the atmosphere each year to slow global warming.\nThe company began trials in the South Pacific Ocean last year, and says it will work with country authorities to create a \u201csequestration field\u201d \u2014 a dedicated part of the ocean where \u201cpulses\u201d of particles will be released on a seasonal basis.\nGigablue says its solution is affordable, too \u2014 priced to attract investors.\n\u201cEvery time we go to the ocean, we generate hundreds of thousands of carbon credits, and this is what we\u2019re going to do continuously over the upcoming years and towards the future, in greater and greater quantities,\u201d co-founder Ori Shaashua said.\nCarbon credits, which have grown in popularity over the last decade, are tokens that symbolize the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On paper, companies that buy credits achieve a smaller carbon footprint without needing to reduce their own emissions \u2014 for instance, by paying another vendor to plant trees or capture carbon dioxide from the air.\nOnly a few countries have required local industries to purchase carbon credits. Most companies that buy them, including Microsoft and Google, do so voluntarily.\nThe credits have helped fund a band of startups like Gigablue that are eager to tackle the climate crisis, but they are also unevenly regulated, scientifically complex, and have in some cases been linked to fraud.\nGigablue\u2019s 200,000 credits are pledged to SkiesFifty, a newly formed company investing in greener practices for the aviation industry. It\u2019s the largest sale to date for a climate startup operating in the ocean, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi, making up more than half of all ocean-based carbon credits sold last year.\nAnd it could beckon a rapid acceleration of the company\u2019s work. Gigablue hopes to reach a goal this year of capturing 10 metric tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of particles it deploys, Shaashua said. At that rate, Gigablue would disperse at least 20,000 tons of particles in the ocean.\nGigablue wouldn\u2019t reveal what it earned in the sale, and SkiesFifty\u2019s team declined to be interviewed for this story. Most credits are sold for a few hundred dollars each \u2014 but a chart on Gigablue\u2019s website suggests its prices are lower than almost any other form of carbon capture on the market.\nThe startup is the brainchild of four entrepreneurs hailing from the tech industry. According to their LinkedIn profiles, Gigablue\u2019s CEO previously worked for an online grocery startup, while its COO was vice president of SeeTree, a company that raised $60 million to provide farmers with information on their trees.\nShaashua, who often serves as the face of Gigablue, said he specializes in using artificial intelligence to pursue positive outcomes in the world. He co-founded a data mining company that tracked exposure risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and led an auto startup that brokered data on car mileage and traffic patterns.\n\u201cThree years ago, I decided to take the same formula, so to say, to climate,\u201d Shaashua said.\nUnder his guidance, he said, Gigablue created an AI-driven \u201cdigital twin\u201d of the ocean based on dozens of metrics to determine where to release the particles.\nChief technology officer Sapir Markus-Alford earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in earth and environmental sciences from Israel\u2019s Ben-Gurion University in 2021, shortly before founding Gigablue.\nMarkus-Alford said she began her studies and eventual path to Gigablue after seeing bleached coral reefs and other impacts of warming waters on a series of diving trips around the world.\n\u201cI understood that the best thing we could do for the ocean is to be able to remove CO2,\u201d Markus-Alford said.\nA spokesperson for Gigablue did not answer whether the other co-founders have graduate degrees in oceanography or environmental science, but said the company\u2019s broader team holds a total of 46 Ph.D.s with expertise in biology, chemistry, oceanography, and environmental science. Markus-Alford said that figure includes outside experts and academics and \u201ceveryone that supports us.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s staffing has expanded from Israel to hubs in New York and New Zealand, Shaashua said.\nIn social media posts advertising open jobs, Gigablue employees encouraged applicants to \u201cJoin Our Mission to Save the World!\u201d\nThe particles Gigablue has patented are meant to capture carbon in the ocean by floating for a number of days and growing algae, before sinking rapidly to the ocean floor.\n\u201cWe are an elevator for carbon,\u201d Shaashua said. \u201cWe are exporting the carbon from the top to the bottom.\u201d\nAlgae \u2014 sometimes referred to as phytoplankton \u2014 has long been attractive to climate scientists because it absorbs carbon dioxide from the surrounding water as it grows. If the algae sinks to the deep sea or ocean floor, Gigablue expects the carbon to be trapped there for hundreds to thousands of years.\nThe ultimate goal is to lower carbon dioxide levels so drastically that the ocean rebalances with the atmosphere by soaking up more CO2 from the air. It\u2019s a feat that would help slow climate change, but one that is still under active study by climate scientists.\nGigablue\u2019s founders have said the company\u2019s work is inspired by nature and \u201cvery, very environmentally safe.\u201d The company\u2019s particles and sinking methods simply recreate what nature has been doing \u201csince forever,\u201d Shaashua said.\nGigablue ran its first trial sinking particles in the Mediterranean in March last year.\nLater, on two voyages to the South Pacific, the company released 60 cubic meters \u2014 about two shipping containers \u2014 of particles off the coast of New Zealand.\nWhile Gigablue has made several commercial deals, it has not yet revealed what its particles are made of. Partly this is because the company says it will build different particles tailored to different seasons and areas of the ocean.\n\u201cIt\u2019s proprietary,\u201d Markus-Alford said.\nDocuments provide a window into the possible ingredients. According to information on the permit, Gigablue\u2019s first New Zealand trial last year involved releasing particles of pure vermiculite, a porous clay often used in potting soil.\nIn the second New Zealand trial, the company released particles made of vermiculite, ground rock, a plant-based wax, as well as manganese and iron.\nA patent published last year hints the particles could also be made of scores of other materials, including cotton, rice husks or jute, as well as synthetic ingredients like polyester fibers or lint. The particles contain a range of possible binding agents, and up to 18 different chemicals and metals, from iron to nickel to vanadium.\nWithout specifying future designs, Markus-Alford said Gigablue\u2019s particles meet certain requirements: \u201cAll the materials we use are materials that are natural, nontoxic, nonhazardous, and can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said. She wouldn\u2019t comment on the possible use of cotton or rice, but said the particles won\u2019t include any kind of plastic.\nWhen asked about vermiculite, which is typically mined on land and heated to expand, Markus-Alford said rivers and erosion transport most materials including vermiculite to the ocean. \u201cAlmost everything, basically, that exists on land can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said.\nThe company said it had commissioned an environmental institute to verify that the particles are safe for thousands of organisms, including mussels and oysters. Any materials in future particles, Gigablue said, will be approved by local authorities.\nShaashua has said the particles are so benign that they have zero impact on the ocean.\n\u201cWe are not changing the water chemistry or the water biology,\u201d Shaashua said.\nKen Buesseler, a senior scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has spent decades studying the biological carbon cycle of the ocean, says that while he\u2019s intrigued by Gigablue\u2019s proposal, the idea that the particles don\u2019t alter the ocean is \u201calmost inconceivable.\u201d\n\u201cThere has to be a relationship between what they\u2019re putting in the ocean and the carbon dioxide that\u2019s dissolved in seawater for this to, quote, work,\u201d Buesseler said.\nBuesseler co-leads a nonprofit group of scientists hoping to tap the power of algae in the ocean to capture carbon. The group organizes regular forums on the subject, and Gigablue presented in April.\n\u201cI left with more questions than answers,\u201d Buesseler said.\nSeveral scientists not affiliated with Gigablue interviewed by The Associated Press said they were interested in how a company with so little public information about its technology could secure a deal for 200,000 carbon credits.\nThe success of the company\u2019s method, they said, will depend on how much algae grows on the particles, and the amount that sinks to the deep ocean. So far, Gigablue has not released any studies demonstrating those rates.\nThomas Ki\u00f8rboe, a professor of ocean ecology at the Technical University of Denmark, and Philip Boyd, an oceanographer at the University of Tasmania who studies the role of algae in the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle, said they were doubtful algae would get enough sunlight to grow inside the particles.\nIt\u2019s more likely the particles would attract hungry bacteria, Ki\u00f8rboe said.\n\u201cTypical phytoplankton do not grow on surfaces, and they do not colonize particles,\u201d Ki\u00f8rboe said. \u201cTo most phytoplankton ecologists, this would just be, I think, absurd.\u201d\nThe rates at which Gigablue says its particles sink \u2014 up to a hundred meters (yards) per hour \u2014 might shear off algae from the particles in the quick descent, Boyd said.\nIt\u2019s likely that some particles would also be eaten by fish \u2014 limiting the carbon capture, and raising the question of how the particles could impact marine life.\nBoyd is eager to see field results showing algae growth, and wants to see proof that Gigablue\u2019s particles cause the ocean to absorb more CO2 from the air.\n\u201cThese are incredibly challenging issues that I don\u2019t think, certainly for the biological part, I don\u2019t think anyone on the planet has got solutions for them,\u201d he said.\nJames Kerry, a senior marine and climate scientist for the conservation group OceanCare and senior research fellow at Australia's James Cook University, has closely followed Gigablue\u2019s work.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is a situation of a company, a startup, upfront selling large quantities of credits for a technology that is unproven,\u201d he said.\nIn a statement, Gigablue said that bacteria does consume the particles but the effect is minimal, and its measurements will account for any loss of algae or particles as they sink.\nThe company noted that a major science institute in New Zealand has given Gigablue its stamp of approval. Gigablue hired the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, a government-owned company, to review several drafts of its methodology.\nIn a recent letter posted to Gigablue\u2019s website, the institute\u2019s chief ocean scientist said his staff had confidence the company\u2019s work is \u201cscientifically sound\u201d and the proposed measurements for carbon sequestration were robust.\nWhether Gigablue\u2019s methods are deemed successful, for now, will be determined not by regulators \u2014 but by another private company.\nPuro.earth is one of several companies known as registries that serve the carbon credit market.\nAmid the lack of regulation and the potential for climate startups to overstate their impact, registries aim to verify how much carbon was really removed.\nThe Finnish Puro.earth has verified more than a million carbon credits since its founding seven years ago. But most of those credits originated in land-based climate projects. Only recently has it aimed to set standards for the ocean.\nIn part, that\u2019s because marine carbon credits are some of the newest to be traded. Dozens of ocean startups have entered the industry, with credit sales catapulting from 2,000 in 2021 to more than 340,000, including Gigablue\u2019s deal, last year.\nBut the ocean remains a hostile and expensive place in which to operate a business or monitor research. Some ocean startups have sold credits only to fold before they could complete their work. Running Tide, a Maine-based startup aimed at removing carbon from the atmosphere by sinking wood chips and seaweed, abruptly shuttered last year despite the backing of $50 million from investors, leaving sales of about 7,000 carbon credits unfulfilled.\nIn June, Puro.earth published a draft methodology that will be used to verify Gigablue\u2019s work, which it designed in consultation with Gigablue. Once finalized, Gigablue will pay the registry for each metric ton of carbon dioxide that it claims to remove.\nMarianne Tikkanen, head of standards at Puro.earth, said that although this methodology was designed with Gigablue, her team expects other startups to adopt the same approach.\n\u201cWe hope that there will be many who can do it and that it stimulates the market,\u201d she said.\nIt remains to be seen whether New Zealand officials will grant permission for the expanded \u201csequestration field\u201d that Gigablue has proposed creating, or if the company will look to other countries.\nNew Zealand\u2019s environmental authority has so far treated Gigablue\u2019s work as research \u2014 a designation that requires no formal review process or consultations with the public. The agency said in a statement that it could not comment on how it would handle a future commercial application from Gigablue.\nBut like many climate startups, Gigablue was involved in selling carbon credits during its research expeditions \u2014 not only inking a major deal, but smaller agreements, too.\nPallas, the Italian businessman, said he ordered 22 carbon credits from Gigablue last year to offset the emissions associated with his event in November. He said Gigablue gave them to him for free \u2014 but says he will pay for more in the future.\nPallas sought out carbon credits because he sees the signs of climate change all around him, he says, and expects more requirements in Italy for businesses to decarbonize in coming years. He chose Gigablue because they are one of the largest suppliers: \u201cThey\u2019ve got quantity,\u201d he said.\nHow authorities view Gigablue\u2019s growing commercial activity could matter in the context of an international treaty that has banned certain climate operations in the ocean.\nMore than a decade ago, dozens of countries including New Zealand agreed they should not allow any commercial climate endeavor that involves releasing iron in the ocean, a technique known as \u201ciron fertilization.\u201d Only research, they said, with no prospect of economic gain should be allowed.\nIron is considered a key ingredient for spurring algae growth and was embedded in the particles that Gigablue dispersed in October in the Pacific Ocean. Several scientific papers have raised concerns that spurring iron-fueled algae blooms on a large scale would deplete important nutrients in the ocean and harm fisheries.\nThe startup denies any link to iron dumping on the basis that its particles don\u2019t release iron directly into the water and don\u2019t create an uncontrolled algae bloom.\n\u201cWe are not fertilizing the ocean,\u201d Markus-Alford said.\n\u201cIn fact, we looked at iron fertilization as an inspiration of something to avoid,\u201d Shaashua said.\nBut the draft methodology that Puro.earth will use to verify Gigablue\u2019s work notes many of the same concerns that have been raised about iron fertilization, including disruptions to the marine food web.\nOther scientists who spoke with AP see a clear link between Gigablue\u2019s work and the controversial practice. \u201cIf they\u2019re using iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth,\u201d said Kerry, the OceanCare scientist, \u201cthen it is iron fertilization.\u201d\nFor now, scientific concerns don\u2019t seem to have troubled Gigablue\u2019s buyers. The company has already planned its next research expedition in New Zealand and hopes to release more particles this fall.\n\u201cThey mean well, and so do I,\u201d said Pallas, of his support for Gigablue. \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll catch a plane, go to New Zealand, and grab a boat to see what they\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\u2014\nThis story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

            "US at plastics treaty talks is rare international participation under Trump. What's the goal?. US at plastics treaty talks is rare international participation under Trump. What's the goal?\nUnder President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership, the United States has withdrawn from international negotiations and commitments, particularly around climate\nUnder President Donald Trump's leadership, the United States has withdrawn from international negotiations and commitments, particularly around climate. But the U.S. is very much involved in treaty talks for a global accord to end plastic pollution.\nNations kicked off a meeting Tuesday in Geneva to try to complete a landmark treaty over 10 days to end the spiraling plastic pollution crisis. The biggest issue is whether the treaty should impose caps on producing new plastic, or focus instead on things like better design, recycling and reuse. About 3,700 people are taking part in the talks, representing 184 countries and more than 600 organizations.\nHere is a look the U.S. position:\nHours after he was sworn in to a second term, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris agreement to combat global warming. The United States didn't participate in a vote in April at the International Maritime Organization that created a fee for greenhouse gases emitted by ships, or send anyone to the U.N. Ocean Conference in June.\nSome wondered whether the United States would even go to Geneva.\nThe State Department told The Associated Press that engaging in the negotiations is critical to protect U.S. interests and businesses, and an agreement could advance U.S. security by protecting natural resources from plastic pollution, promote prosperity and enhance safety.\nThe industry contributes more than $500 billion to the economy annually and employs about 1 million people in the U.S., according to the Plastics Industry Association.\n\u201cThis is an historic opportunity to set a global approach for reducing plastic pollution through cost-effective and common-sense solutions and fostering innovation from the private sector, not unilaterally stopping the use of plastic,\u201d the department said in an email.\nThe State Department supports provisions to improve waste collection and management, improve product design and drive recycling, reuse and other efforts to cut the plastic dumped into the environment.\nThe international Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that 22 million tons of plastic waste will leak into the environment this year. That could increase to 30 million tons annually by 2040 if nothing changes.\nThe OECD said if the treaty focuses only on improving waste management and does nothing on production and demand, an estimated 13.5 million tons of plastic waste would still leak into the environment each year.\nThe United States and other powerful oil and gas nations oppose cutting plastic production.\nMost plastic is made from fossil fuels. Even if production grows only slightly, greenhouse gas emissions emitted from the process would more than double by 2050, according to research from the federal Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\nThe U.S. does not support global production caps since plastics play a critical role throughout every sector of every economy, nor does it support bans on certain plastic products or chemical additives to them because there is not a universal approach to reducing plastic pollution, the State Department said.\nThat\u2019s similar to the views of the plastics industry, which says that a production cap could have unintended consequences, such as raising the cost of plastics, and that chemicals are best regulated elsewhere.\nOn the first day of the negotiations, the United States proposed striking language in the objective of the agreement about addressing the full life cycle of plastics. That idea was part of the original mandate for a treaty. Getting rid of it could effectively end any effort to control plastic supply or production.\nUnder former President Joe Biden's administration, the U.S. supported the treaty addressing supply and production.\nIndustry leaders praised it and environmentalists panned it.\nChris Jahn, president and CEO of the American Chemistry Council, said the Trump administration is trying to get an agreement that protects each nation's rights while advancing effective and practical solutions to end plastic waste in the environment. He said his group supports that approach.\nGraham Forbes, head of the Greenpeace delegation in Geneva, said the United States wants a weak agreement and is undermining the idea that the world needs strong international regulations to address a global problem.\nThe United States aims to finalize text for a global agreement on plastic pollution that all countries, including major producers of plastics and plastic products, and consumers, will support, the State Department said in its statement.\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "Countries gather to thrash out deal on 'plastic crisis'. Countries gather to thrash out deal on 'plastic crisis'\nPlastic production has exploded in the last century - to some it has been a miracle product while to others it is a pollution nightmare.\nScientists have estimated that there are nearly 200 trillion pieces floating in the world's oceans, and this could triple if no action is taken.\nIn 2022, countries agreed to develop a legally binding global treaty to cut the waste and the harmful chemicals some plastics contain - but after two years no agreement has been reached.\nOn Tuesday, the world's nations meet again at a UN conference in Geneva - could they finally agree how to curb the plastic excesses?\nWhy is plastic such a valuable product?\nHuman societies have used plastics that occur naturally in the environment for hundreds of years, in the form of rubber, horn and shellac.\nBut the 20th Century brought the explosion of synthetic plastics, made from processing fossil fuels.\nThe material's versatility, strength and heat-resistant properties has lent itself to thousands of uses, from sewage pipes to life-saving medical equipment, to clothing.\nIt has become ubiquitous in a short time without understanding its full impact, explains Dr Alice Horton, research scientist at the National Oceanography Centre.\n\"Proportional to life on earth, plastics have been around for no time at all, there are people alive that weren't using plastics as children. I think that's what makes this quite a concerning material,\" said Dr Horton.\n\"It has exploded in such a way that we are using it in every application in our lives and yet we are suddenly realising there may be problems with it.\"\nHow are plastics impacting our planet?\nLevels of plastic production have grown exponentially over the last few decades. In 1950 two million tonnes was produced, by 2022 that had risen to 475 million tonnes.\nAlthough plastic can be reused, the cost and availability of recycling infrastructure means very little is. About 60% of all plastics are single use and just 10% are estimated to be recycled, according to analysis in Nature.\nPlastic has been shown to accumulate in the marine environment where it poses particular problems for wildlife who can ingest it.\n\"They can confuse it as food, which then harms their internal organs and also can lead to fatalities, because of digestion difficulties,\" said Zaynab Sadan, global plastics policy lead at WWF.\nShe said they could also become entangled in discarded fishing gear or plastic packaging that has entered the ocean from sewage systems.\nWhen it enters the environment, most plastic breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces - known as microplastics. They have been found across all geographical ranges, from the deep sea to mountain tops, and across all living systems ever tested.\nResearch is continuing to understand the full impact, with different species faring better than others. But Dr Horton from the National Oceanography Centre warns there is a threshold where animals will start to be harmed.\n\"When we [get] accumulation of plastic in tissues we start seeing inflammation, cell damage, hormonal changes. Things that are not outright going to kill an organism but likely to have this accumulative, long-term effect whereby they get weaker and weaker, and sicker and sicker, and either become diseased or die,\" she explained.\nAre plastics harmful for us?\nPlastics are a \"grave, growing and under-recognised danger\" for human health, according to a new expert report.\nThe Lancet Countdown estimated that health-related disease and death from the \"plastic crisis\" is responsible for at least $1.5tn (\u00a31.1tn) a year in health-related damages.\nThese impacts can range from air pollution from the production of plastic, through to elevated risk of cancer, respiratory illnesses and miscarriages from plastic contamination in our bodies.\nPlastics contain more than 16,000 chemicals such as dyes and flame retardants, some of which are toxic and cancer-causing.\nDespite the growing body of evidence of the hazards of plastic, the Lancet report highlights that there is a lack of transparency as to what is in most products. Just a quarter of plastic chemicals have data on their impact, but of those tested 75% were found to be \"highly hazardous\".\nWhat are countries trying to agree?\nIn 2022, countries agreed a global treaty was needed in two years to tackle the issue.\nThat deadline passed in December 2024, after five rounds of negotiations, with no treaty having been signed.\nOn Tuesday, more than 170 nations will meet again to try to get a deal over the line.\nThe main issues they are trying to get agreement on include:\nTargets on cutting the production levels of single-use plastics\n-\nBans on some of the most harmful chemicals in plastic\n-\nUniversal guidance on the design of plastic products\n-\nFinancing of this effort\n-\nProducts that have to meet consistent design standards can help to improve recycling, save costs and reduce the demand for virgin plastics, Rob Opsomer, executive lead of plastics and finance at the Ellen McArthur Foundation, which co-convenes the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, told the BBC.\n\"So, to give you one example, a drinks bottle, if it is coloured, the value of what you can get from it if you sell the recycled material is half the value of a clear, uncoloured bottle,\" he explained.\nNearly 100 countries, including the UK, are calling for an \"ambitious\" treaty which would include a commitment to limit production levels. But there has been strong opposition from a group of oil-producing nations including Russia and Saudi Arabia who want the talks to focus not on producing less, but recycling more.\nDemand for oil in global energy and transport systems is expected to peak in the next few years as countries move to greener technologies. This could leave plastic as one of the few growth markets for the oil industry. Any efforts to limit production could pose short term economic damage to the petrostates.\nBut for those users of plastics not having clear, global regulations is costing them.\n\"It is a fundamental risk. Businesses don't want packaging with their brand name on it to be littering the streets and our oceans,\" said Mr Opsomer.\nHe said there was also the cost for businesses of having to comply with hundreds of new standards globally every year on plastics.\nThe Business Coalition, which includes some of the biggest global users of plastic such as Nestle and Unilever, is calling for governments to introduce coordinated taxes on their businesses to help pay for the cost of recycling and cleaning up plastic waste.\nWhat can you do to reduce plastic waste?\nSingle-use plastic is the biggest contributor to plastic waste in the environment, and most of our daily consumption of this comes from food packaging.\nYou can take a reusable container or cup if you are getting a takeaway, and when food shopping consider taking a reusable sealed bag to weigh your fruit and vegetables.\nIt is estimated that more than a quarter of microplastics in the environment come from car tyres. For those that are able, walking and cycling to the local shops or sharing car journeys with friends or neighbours can help.\nAnd avoid plastics that break down to microplastics more easily - such as chewing gum and glitter. There are many non-plastic alternatives still available which means you can keep having fun at festivals.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

            "Australia rejects US call to declare Taiwan war role. Australia has rebuffed calls to declare what role the nation would play in a potential war with China over Taiwan, with a minister saying it won't automatically follow the US into a future conflict.\nWashington is reportedly pushing both Japan and Australia to clarify their positions for a hypothetical conflict over the democratically-government island, which Beijing considers part of its territory.\nActing Defence Minister Pat Conroy on Sunday reiterated the nation's long established stance on whether it would choose to join the US in war.\n\"The decision to commit Australian troops to a conflict will be made by the government of the day, not in advance,\" he told ABC's Insiders program.\n\"Sovereignty will always be prioritised.\"\nElbridge Colby, a key Pentagon strategist, has been pressing defence officials from both countries to declare their positions in meetings over the issue, according to a report in the Financial Times.\nHe is also leading a US review of its nuclear submarine deal with Australia under the three-nation AUKUS partnership following concerns the plan to supply the vessels would harm the American navy.\nThe US will be among 19 countries participating in Exercise Talisman Sabre, which begins on Sunday and will involve 30,000 defence force personnel.\nThe event was the nation's most important joint military exercise with the US, Mr Conroy said, and it was expected to be closely monitored by China after the Asian superpower observed the last four such operations.\n\"We will obviously observe their activities and monitor their presence around Australia, but we'll also adjust how we conduct those exercises,\" he said.\n\"People observe these exercises to collect intelligence around procedures, around the electronic spectrum and the use of communications.\"\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese landed in Shanghai late Saturday, kicking off a six-day tour which will focus on economic and security issues.\nDefence analysts have flagged Mr Albanese will likely raise live-fire drills conducted by the Chinese military off Australia's coast earlier in the year after Beijing failed to notify authorities ahead of time.\nThe Chinese flotilla also circumnavigated the country in a projection of power.\nBut Mr Conroy would not be drawn on whether Mr Albanese will directly raise those concerns with Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two leaders sit down during his second visit as prime minister.\nAustralian Associated Press",
            "Pentagon presses Japan, Australia on role in possible Taiwan conflict. The Pentagon is reportedly pressuring Indo-Pacific allies Japan and Australia to clarify what roles they would play in the event of a war with China over Taiwan.\nElbridge Colby, the Pentagon\u2019s policy chief, raised the question during recent meetings with Japanese and Australian defense officials, the Financial Times first reported.\nWhile the United States has long urged Indo-Pacific allies to increase defense spending as China escalates its military activity around Taiwan, this push for specific wartime commitments is a new development \u2014 and reportedly caught foreign officials off guard.\nAustralia responded by stressing it would not commit troops in advance of any conflict.\nTAIWAN ENVOY URGES CONGRESSIONAL ACTION, WARNS OF RISING CHINA THREAT AFTER MEETING LAWMAKERS\n\"The decision to commit Australian troops to a conflict will be made by the government of the day, not in advance,\" Defense Minister Pat Conroy told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"We won\u2019t discuss hypotheticals.\"\nAustralia and the U.S. are currently leading a major joint exercise in Sydney involving 30,000 troops from 19 countries.\nPentagon officials have cited NATO\u2019s efforts to boost European defense spending as a model for what Asian allies should consider. At the same time, Colby has advised European allies to prioritize threats closer to home rather than focus on the Indo-Pacific, sources told Fox News Digital.\n\"Some among our allies might not welcome frank conversations,\" Colby posted on X in response to the report.\n\"But as the department has made abundantly and consistently clear, we at DOD are focused on implementing the president\u2019s America First, common-sense agenda of restoring deterrence and achieving peace through strength. That includes urging allies to step up their defense spending and other efforts related to our collective defense.\"\nCOLBY\u2019S CHINA-FOCUSED PENTAGON PLAYBOOK SPARKS UKRAINE ARMS FREEZE\nThe question of allied commitments is further complicated by the U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity, under which Washington does not explicitly state whether it would defend Taiwan if China invades.\n\"As Secretary Hegseth said, the Department of Defense is focused on preventing war, with a strong shield of deterrence,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell wrote on X in defense of Colby\u2019s approach. \"That requires strength \u2014 but it is a simple fact that our allies must also do their part. We do not seek war. What we are doing is ensuring the United States and its allies have the military strength to underwrite diplomacy and guarantee peace.\"\nFormer President Joe Biden had repeatedly said the U.S. would defend Taiwan, only for White House staff to later walk back those comments and insist that U.S. policy has not changed.\nPresident Donald Trump has maintained the tradition of ambiguity, refusing to publicly declare how he would respond. However, new audio obtained by CNN revealed that Trump told donors last year he threatened both Russia and China with military force.\n\"With Putin I said, \u2018If you go into Ukraine, I\u2019m going to bomb the [expletive] out of Moscow,\u2019\" Trump said. \"\u2018I\u2019m telling you. I have no choice.\u2019 And then [Putin] goes, like, \u2018I don\u2019t believe you.\u2019 But he believed me 10%.\"\n\"I said the same thing to [Xi],\" Trump added. \"I said, \u2018If you go into Taiwan, I\u2019m going to bomb the [expletive] out of Beijing.' I said, 'I have no choice. I\u2019ve got to bomb you.\u2019\"\nAt other times, Trump has criticized the cost of defending Taiwan and argued the island should dedicate 10% of its budget to defense.\nWargaming simulations suggest Japan would be the most crucial ally to the U.S. and Taiwan, as South Korea has not authorized American forces to launch combat operations from its territory. Australia does not permit permanent foreign military bases, but the U.S. is expanding its rotational presence at Australian facilities.\n\"Japan is always critical, and when I say critical, like we can't win the war without them,\" Mark Cancian, defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who regularly briefs lawmakers on China wargames, told Fox News Digital.\n\"Their forces are important, but our ability to use our bases in Japan is critical,\" he said, adding that other U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific like Guam were too far away to serve as a hub.\nTAIWAN CONDUCTS LIVE-FIRE DRILLS WITH US-MADE TANKS AS PRESIDENT LOOKS ON\nWhether Japan allows the U.S. to center its wartime operations on its territory would be a critical question certain to come up in preparations for a wartime contingency.\nThe U.S. and Japan have practiced moving forces down the Japanese Ryukyu island chain, the closest of which is only 80 miles off the coast of Taiwan.\nColby\u2019s push for defined allied roles comes on the heels of his initiation of a review of the AUKUS security pact, which aims to supply Australia with U.S.-built nuclear-powered submarines.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Pentagon recently defended Colby after reports emerged that he had temporarily halted military aid to Ukraine \u2014 an order quickly reversed by Trump.\nUnder the AUKUS agreement, Australia would purchase several Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s, while a new class of submarines would be jointly developed by the U.S., U.K., and Australia. Production in Australia is expected to begin in the 2040s. However, the U.S. is already struggling to produce enough submarines for its own Navy.",
            "Australia won\u2019t commit in advance to joining hypothetical US-China conflict, Pat Conroy says. Australia will refuse any US request to join a \u201chypothetical\u201d conflict with China over Taiwan and won\u2019t make any advance commitment, the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, has said, amid reports Washington is seeking such promises in discussions over the Aukus submarines.\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, also pushed back on such a request, alluding to America\u2019s own position of so-called \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d on whether the US would militarily respond in a conflict over Taiwan. He said Australia wanted to see \u201cpeace and security\u201d in the region.\nFollowing multiple reports this week that the Pentagon was seeking guarantees from Australia and other allies about how they would respond in the event of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific, Conroy said any commitment to war would be the decision of the Australian government of the day.\nThe Financial Times reported on Saturday that Elbridge Colby \u2013 the US under-secretary of defence for policy, who is also undertaking a review of the Aukus pact which would see America share nuclear-powered submarines with Australia \u2013 was asking Japan and Australia to reveal how they would act in a potential US-China war over Taiwan.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald separately quoted a senior US defence official, who reportedly said Washington was seeking \u201ca clear sense of what we can expect from Australia\u201d.\nContacted for comment, a Pentagon spokesperson referred Guardian Australia to a post on X from Colby on Sunday (AEST) which referenced the FT article. In his post, Colby wrote that the US policy position included \u201curging allies to step up their defense spending and other efforts related to our collective defense\u201d.\n\u201cThis has been a hallmark of President Trump\u2019s strategy \u2013 in Asia as in Europe where it has already been tremendously successful.\n\u201cOf course, some among our allies might not welcome frank conversations. But many, now led by NATO after the historic Hague Summit, are seeing the urgent need to step up and are doing so.\u201d\nAlbanese arrived in China on Saturday night for a six-day visit, which includes meetings with president Xi Jinping and premier Li Qiang, with the government saying the trip was about advancing Australia\u2019s security and economic interests.\nIn a press conference, he repeatedly rebuffed questions on the reports and any US demands, noting Australia had increased defence spending, and repeating his assertion that Aukus was of benefit to all three nations.\n\u201cWe support the status quo when it comes to Taiwan. We don\u2019t support any unilateral action there \u2026 We want peace and security in our region,\u201d Albanese said.\nAsked by a journalist whether it would be reasonable for the US to demand an assurance on a Taiwan conflict, when America itself maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity, Albanese responded: \u201cYou\u2019ve just answered the question yourself.\u201d\nPressed to elaborate on that answer, he replied: \u201cI think you can get it.\u201d\nConroy, a cabinet minister whose portfolio deals heavily with preparing to build the Aukus submarines, also rebuked the idea Australia would commit in advance to any conflict.\n\u201cThe sole power to commit Australia to war, or to allow our territory to be used for a conflict, is the elected government of the day. That is our position. Sovereignty will always be prioritised and that will continue to be our position,\u201d Conroy told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program.\nConroy said he would not comment on the nature of confidential discussions with the US over Aukus, but said the government would not \u201cdiscuss hypotheticals\u201d around what Australia could do in a potential future military engagement.\n\u201cThe decision to commit Australian troops to a conflict will be made by the government of the day, not in advance but by the government of the day,\u201d he stressed.\nOn Sky News on Sunday, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, described the Australia-China relationship as \u201cfull of opportunity but not short of complexity either\u201d.\nIt is unclear when the US may give any further public clarity on Colby\u2019s review of Aukus, which was initially described as a 30-day process. The start date of the review is unclear, but it is now 30 days since it was publicly announced. On Insiders, Conroy also declined to respond to reports that Trump may seek further costs from Canberra to fulfil the Aukus submarine deal, which would see the US sell several older boats to Canberra before new assets are constructed onshore in Australia.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what the review finds. I\u2019m confident it will support Aukus, just as our review of Aukus found, just as the UK review of Aukus found that. It\u2019s in the national interest of all three countries. It will contribute to deterrence as well as grow 20,000 jobs in Australia. Let\u2019s see what the US review comes forward with, then we\u2019ll react accordingly,\u201d he said.\nGuardian Australia reported this week that Labor sources don\u2019t expect the review to be completed for months, while a Pentagon spokesperson said last week there was no public timeline for the work. Conroy said he didn\u2019t believe the report had been completed.\nThe foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, met her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at the Asean summit in Malaysia on Friday. Government sources said she raised a number of Australian concerns with Beijing, including the circumnavigation of Australia by a Chinese naval taskforce and live-fire exercises, as well as unsafe actions in the South China Sea. Wong also raised concerns about the detention of Dr Yang Hengjun, Australia\u2019s opposition to the death penalty, and human rights in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong."

How Amanda Anisimova and Iga \u015awi\u0105tek advanced to the women's final on day 11 at Wimbledon 2025\nWimbledon 2025 \u2014 Day 11 latest\nAmanda Anisimova has lit up women\u2019s singles semifinals day at Wimbledon by stunning top seed Aryna Sabalenka to reach Saturday\u2019s final. She'll face Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, who cruised past Belinda Bencic in the other semifinal.\nAnisimova, the U.S. star and 13th seed, beat the world No. 1 Sabalenka after three compelling sets on Centre Court (6-4, 4-6, 6-4). \u015awi\u0105tek (8) then demolished the unseeded Bencic (6-2, 6-0) to secure her spot alongside Anisimova in the final.\nAnd for the opening salvo of championship weekend, Verbeek/Siniakov\u00e1 took down Salisbury/Stefani in identical 7-6(3), 7-6(3) tiebreaker sets to win the 2025 Wimbledon mixed doubles title.\nGO FURTHER\nAmanda Anisimova stuns Wimbledon favorite Aryna Sabalenka to reach first Grand Slam final\nA golden men's semifinal slate tomorrow\nAfter today's incredible women's semifinal action at Wimbledon, we have an absolutely scintillating pair of matchups for you on the men's side tomorrow.\nFirst, American Taylor Fritz makes his Wimbledon semifinal debut against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Then, seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic looks to make his 11th final and seventh in a row \u2014 but he'll have to go through world No. 1 Jannik Sinner to do so.\nFritz. Alcaraz. Djokovic. Sinner. Just seeing those names together makes the heart beat a tick faster, doesn't it?\nI can't wait for tomorrow and I'm sure you feel the same. Of course, we'll have both matches covered in-depth right here at The Athletic.\nAdvertisement\nSwiatek continues to acsend\nFollowing her semifinal win over Belinda Bencic, Iga \u015awi\u0105tek now has the 10th highest winning percentage in Women\u2019s Singles Grand Slam events during the Open Era.\nShe surpassed Evonne Goolagong to enter the top 10 and is now two spots behind Billie Jean King, who sits in eighth place (84.1 percent).\nWATCH: Big ovation for Belinda Bencic\nHer 2025 Wimbledon run did not end how she would have hoped but Belinda Bencic still has a lot to be proud of.\nGame, set, match: Verbeek/Siniakova win 2025 Wimbledon mixed doubles final!\nVerbeek/Siniakova 7-6(3), 7-6(3) Salisbury/Stefani\nThat'll do it! Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1 slams a volley past Luisa Stefani, Sem Verbeek drops to the ground in ecstasy, and Verbeek/Siniakov\u00e1 has won the 2025 Wimbledon Mixed Doubles championship thanks to two dominant tiebreak showings at Centre Court today!\nVerbeek, playing in his first major final, can't contain his joy. He picks up his partner and swings her around, then after shaking hands with the opposing duo, rubs his face in disbelief.\nSecond set to a tiebreak in mixed doubles final\nVerbeek/Siniakova 7-6(3), 6-6(*4-2) Salisbury/Stefani\nWe're heading to our second tiebreak in as many sets in our first major final of the weekend at Centre Court!\nOnce again, it's Verbeek and Siniakov\u00e1 leading the way, up 4-2 after a stellar overhand shot near the net from the latter for the point.\nThey could be closing in on the championship as the match time approaches two hours...\nSwiatek puts on tennis masterclass to reach Wimbledon final\nIga \u015awi\u0105tek is not messing around as she moves into her first Wimbledon final.\nShe dominated Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0 Thursday to set up a meeting with Amanda Anisimova of the U.S., with the controlled, clinical aggression on both serve and return that has defined her tennis the past fortnight.\nNeither \u015awi\u0105tek nor Anisimova has reached this stage before, but the Pole is the vastly more experienced player. She is a five-time Grand Slam champion who has spent 125 weeks as the world No. 1, even if by her own extremely high standards, she has fallen on harder times of late. The win makes Swiatek the only active WTA Tour player to reach a Grand Slam final on all three surfaces and a victory on Saturday would be \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s first title anywhere since winning a fourth Roland Garros title in June 2024, in what will be only her second final in that time.\nGO FURTHER\nIga Swiatek puts on tennis masterclass against Belinda Bencic to reach Wimbledon final\nAdvertisement\nMedical timeout in mixed doubles final\nVerbeek/Siniakova 7-6(3), *3-2 Salisbury/Stefani\nMoments ago there a medical stoppage in play as Luisa Stefani was checked out by the trainers for a back issue. After a couple minutes of assessments and stretching, she was able to get back on the court, not showing any ill effects.\nThat said, her and Salisbury still have a lot of work to do.\nNo souvenirs for catching a ball\nBefore I came to Wimbledon I assumed that if a tennis ball went into the crowd they would be allowed to keep it.\nBut after spending time on the courts this fortnight it seems you have to hand them back to go back into circulation on court.\nIt's a shame, especially for those looking to take home a little souvenir...\nVerbeek/Siniakova take first set of mixed doubles final\nVerbeek/Siniakova 7-6(3), *0-1 Salisbury/Stefani\nThe duo of Sem Verbeek and Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1 just took the first set of the mixed doubles final on Centre Court in a tiebreak.\nNeither partnership could find real separation until then as Verbeek/Siniakova jumped out to a rapid 5-1 lead before eventually closing it out. An errant shot by Stefani on the volley was the deciding point in the tiebreak.\nVerbeek specifically seems to be having a blast out there, hitting great shots and following them up with massive smiles. That said, intensity levels remain high.\nAnisimova's historic turnaround\nA year ago, Amanda Anisimova lost in the qualifiers and did not even participate in the main tournament at Wimbledon. Now, she's headed to the final after a stunning victory over world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.\nAnisimova is only the second player in the Open Era to go from losing in qualifiers to the final round of a Grand Slam in the span of a year. She joins Bianca Andreescu, who won the 2019 U.S. Open after falling short in qualifiers for that event in 2018.\nIt was a hot one in SW19\nAnd the warm weather looks set to continue tomorrow as the UK heatwave continues.\nAdvertisement\nSwiatek completes the trifecta\nWith her win today, Iga \u015awi\u0105tek has now reached a Women's Singles Grand Slam final on grass (2025 Wimbledon finalist), clay (four-time French Open champion) and hard (2022 U.S. Open champion) surfaces.\nShe's the only active women's player to do so and needed just 26 main draw appearances to accomplish the feat. Since 2000, only the Williams sisters and Justine Henin did so in fewer main draw appearances. \u015awi\u0105tek, at 24 years old, is also the youngest women's player to complete the trifecta since Henin in 2003, per Opta.\nA photo that sums things up...\nThat was a painful semifinal defeat for Belinda Bencic but she'll reflect on her Wimbledon performance with pride.\nShe only returned to the tour this year following the birth of her daughter, Bella, last April.\nSwiatek's historically dominant semifinal\nHow good was Iga \u015awi\u0105tek's performance in her semifinal win? In the Open era of Wimbledon semifinals, only two others have only dropped fewer games in a match than the two that \u015awi\u0105tek did today.\nThose two? Billie Jean King in 1969 and Venus Williams in 2009.\nPretty decent company.\nSwiatek's pump-up playlist\nHave you ever listened to \"Thunderstruck\" or \"Welcome to the Jungle\" before playing a big game or completing a hard workout?\nThen you have that in common with a woman who just authored one of the most dominant performances you will ever see in a Wimbledon semifinal.\nWhy Wimbledon\u2019s fiercest competition is not tennis\nThere is no room for error. Winning margins are fine and the path to victory gets more intense with each passing year. On a beautifully manicured surface, competitors express themselves through their strokes all over Wimbledon.\n\u201cEvery year people really push because they know it\u2019s happening. There\u2019s a community edge to it but then there are people who are really competitive,\u201d Kimberley Salmassian said during an interview in south-west London. \u201cThe ones who are competitive are very conscious of who they feel they\u2019ve got to beat from last year.\u201d\nWhile 256 of the best tennis players in the world face off in pursuit of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s singles titles, 60 businesses in SW19 (the famous postcode for the Championships) take part in the annual Wimbledon Village Tennis Windows Competition, set up by Salmassian in 2013.\nShops, restaurants, pubs, cafes and other local businesses produce ornate window displays not just to delight the thousands of tennis tourists who wander up and down Church Road, but to win.\nGO FURTHER\nWhy Wimbledon\u2019s fiercest competition is not tennis: \u2018I wish they would credit artists more\u2019\nAdvertisement\nBoth Wimbledon women\u2019s semifinals halted due to unwell supporters\nBoth of Thursday\u2019s Wimbledon women\u2019s semifinals were halted by stoppages in their first sets, due to spectators being taken ill in the stands.\nWorld No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka had saved two break points to force deuce against Amanda Anisimova, the No 13 seed, with the scoreline at 2-3 in the first set when play first came to a halt on Centre Court.\nA spectator was seen to be in need of assistance, and Sabalenka responded by bringing a bottle of water and an ice pack to the section of the crowd in the East Stand, where the spectator was sitting, while stewards rushed to provide umbrellas for the member of the crowd. Centre Court applauded the No 1 seed for her quick reaction.\nUmpire Damien Dumusois instructed both players to take a seat courtside while the unwell spectator was tended to before the players took back to the court following a six-minute stoppage.\nA similar incident occurred during Iga \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s semifinal against Belinda Bencic, with the five-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 1 leading 3-0. Play was again paused for several minutes, with the players alternating between shadow swings in the sun and standing in the shade to stay ready for action.\nGO FURTHER\nBoth Wimbledon women\u2019s semifinals halted due to unwell supporters on Centre Court\nWATCH: Anisimova amazes herself\nHer reaction after the match said it all...\nWhat a special moment for Amanda Anisimova, advancing to the Final at Wimbledon.\nHow Anisimova stunned Wimbledon favorite Sabalenka\nAmanda Anisimova has arrived.\nThe former teen sensation, who spent several years in the tennis wilderness following the sudden death of her father and coach when she was 17, upset the world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 under a broiling sun on Centre Court Thursday to make her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon. She also becomes the first American finalist at Wimbledon since Serena Williams.\nIn a duel of power, periods of inconsistency and tight games at important times, Anisimova kept her nerve when the match was on the line to keep Sabalenka from making the only major final she has never played.\nGO FURTHER\nAmanda Anisimova stuns Wimbledon favorite Aryna Sabalenka to reach first Grand Slam final",
            "Wimbledon 2025: Swiatek wins title after crushing Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 \u2013 as it happened. Right, that\u2019s it from us for today \u2013 and from me for this Wimbledon. Many thanks for your company this fortnight, it\u2019s been a blast as always. Do join Daniel tomorrow for coverage of Jannik Sinner v Carlos Alcaraz \u2013 after their nearly neverending French Open final last month, we can be sure it won\u2019t be as rapid as today\u2019s Wimbledon whitewash. Bye!\nWimbledon 2025: Swiatek wins title after crushing Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 \u2013 as it happened\nIga Swiatek took only 57 minutes to win her first Wimbledon title and sixth grand slam after delivering a brutal masterclass\nLive feed\nHere\u2019s Tumaini\u2019s match report:\nAmanda Anisimova arrived in her first grand slam final in some of the best form of her career, but she fell apart under pressure in front of one of the greatest big-match players the sport has ever seen as Iga Swiatek inflicted a historic 6-0, 6-0 victory in 57 minutes to claim her long-awaited first Wimbledon title.\nThis is the first time in the open era that the Wimbledon title has been won with a double bagel. The last 6-0, 6-0 result came in 1911, when the sport barely resembled its current modern form, with Dorothea Lambert Chambers\u2019s dominant win over Dora Boothby in the challenge match era, when the defending champion played just once.\nTwo days after playing an incredible match to topple the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, holding her nerve in so many of the tightest moments, Anisimova simply could not handle the pressure. She had the even greater misfortune of coming up against the one opponent who would never allow her a path back in after her early difficulties in the match.\nSwiatek has now won each of her first six grand slam finals, a reflection of her remarkable mental toughness and her readiness to produce her best tennis in the biggest moments. Only Margaret Court and Monica Seles have achieved this feat before her in the Open era.\nFor so long, grass courts were considered Swiatek\u2019s one weakness. The ball\u2019s low bounce, many believed, was too disruptive to her heavy topspin forehand, her movement was too uncertain and there would always be an opponent capable of blasting her off the court. Sometimes she believed this, too.\nAt the end of a tremendous fortnight on her least successful surface, Swiatek has proven that a player with her rare talent, discipline and sheer force of will has no limitations to her potential.\nThe victory marks Swiatek\u2019s sixth grand slam title, which breaks her tie with Martina Hingis and Maria Sharapova. The last female player to reach this milestone was Venus Williams in 2007. Alongside her four French Open triumphs and her victory at the US Open in 2022, Swiatek has now won major titles on all three playing surfaces. Only the Australian Open stands between her and a career grand slam.\nYou can read the rest here.\nSwiatek has left the court, having probably stuffed every one of her towels into her bag as a mementos. She poses for photos, holding the trophy in front of the list of champions past and now present, before chatting to the Princess of Wales and stepping out on the balcony to show off her trophy. She\u2019s jumping up and down, stirring up the crowd; what a release of emotion. She\u2019s played with such freedom and joy this fortnight and her celebrations are no different; it\u2019s been lovely to see her personality come out. But now she has to hand over the trophy, at least until tomorrow\u2019s Wimbledon ball. I wonder if they\u2019ll have strawberries and pasta on the menu in tribute to the new champion.\nSwiatek\u2019s name has already been inscribed on to the board of champions: that\u2019s Wimbledon efficiency for you. And for the ninth successive championships, we have a different women\u2019s winner. With her sixth grand slam title, she\u2019s now won majors on all three surfaces, the youngest woman to do so since Serena Williams. And she\u2019s finally figured out the riddle of grass. There\u2019s a parallel with Andre Agassi; he never thought grass was for him until he cracked it in 1992. And perhaps even with Rafa Nadal, who of course took a while to get going at Wimbledon despite being a multiple French Open champion.\nCredit to Anisimova, who showed some guts there to speak to the crowd. It had echoes of Jana Novotna, when she cried on the Duchess of Kent\u2019s shoulders after being beaten by Steffi Graff in the 1993 final. And let\u2019s not forget Novotna came back to win Wimbledon five years later. Hopefully this is the start for Anisimova too.\nShe did so well to stun Sabalenka in the semi-finals; perhaps she just didn\u2019t have anything left to take it to Swiatek today. Having dreamed of reaching a grand slam final for most of her life, it was all over in less than an hour. She\u2019ll probably be having nightmares tonight \u2013 if she manages to get any sleep, that is \u2013 but hopefully over time she\u2019ll be able to remember the rest of the fortnight and not just this record destruction.\nAnd having reached the final only a year after her mental health break from tennis, she offers us all an important reminder that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. She\u2019s got a good team around her who\u2019ll help her get over this too.\nNow it\u2019s Swiatek\u2019s turn to speak, the first Polish winner of a Wimbledon singles title. She starts by addressing Anisimova: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happened today, you should be proud of what you\u2019ve done.\u201d Asked what it means to win Wimbledon, she says she never expected to win this title and it hasn\u2019t really sunk in yet. \u201cI\u2019d never won this title, I was anxious about that [in previous years], but this year I really really enjoyed it and felt so comfortable. It\u2019s amazing and I\u2019m going to enjoy this moment and hopefully you\u2019re going to enjoy the men\u2019s final too.\u201d\nAnisimova takes a few seconds to compose herself before speaking to Annabel Croft: \u201cCongratulations Iga. Thank you to everyone who\u2019s supported me. It\u2019s been an incredible fortnight for me and even though I ran out of gas today and I wish I could have put in a better performance for you today, you guys still lifted me up, so thank you so much.\u201d She then thanks her mum who flew in for the match this morning; and then the tears flood out. \u201cShe\u2019s put in more work than I have, honestly,\u201d Anisimova says through her tears, before joking that the reason she lost was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d because her mum turned up for the occasion.\nTrophy time. Anisimova trudges up to collect her runners-up plate and just about manages to hold it together. And here comes our new champion, as Swiatek is presented with the Venus Rosewater Dish for the first time by the Princess of Wales. Wonderful scenes for Swiatek; but, jeez, this is so hard for Anisimova.\n\u201cA real shame for Anisimova, and in another way the fans in Centre Court and at home too,\u201d emails Simon McMahon. \u201cHope it doesn\u2019t affect her long term. She\u2019s in the Wimbledon final for goodness sake, which is more than 99.9999% of tennis players will ever even come close to achieving. Godspeed.\u201d\nSwiatek is up in the player\u2019s box, hugging her father and sister. She seems to be the only one in the house not in an absolute state of shock. Anisimova has hurried off court, but soon returns to a standing ovation. She\u2019s crying. I\u2019m crying for her too. Man, sport can be so cruel sometimes.\nSwiatek wins 6-0, 6-0\nThis scoreline is all the more staggering given that only 48 hours ago, Anisimova was staring down the world No 1 in the semi-finals on this very court. But this has been one of the all-time final beatdowns. Given Swiatek\u2019s dominance this afternoon, it\u2019s easy to forget she hasn\u2019t won a title since the French Open last year. This has been a supreme display from a player who\u2019d never previously been comfortable on grass. And Swiatek brings up two championship points at 40-15. Can Anisimova at least stretch this match to an hour? Swiatek blinks on the first championship point, a rare long rally plays out on the second, and Swiatek strikes a winner that lands bang on the line! Swiatek is a Wimbledon champion for the first time, turning her crisis of the past year into one of her crowning moments! Swiatek has salvation after her annus horribilis; for a shell-shocked Anisimova this is as horrible as it gets.\nSwiatek breaks: Anisimova 0-6, 0-5 Swiatek* (*denotes next server)\nFlicking through the history books, there\u2019s been only one 6-0, 6-0 women\u2019s singles final scoreline at Wimbledon, when Dorothea Lambert Chambers thumped Dora Boothby in 1911. Anisimova will be desperate to avoid taking such a dubious place in history, but it\u2019s a similar story on her serve as she falls 0-30 behind. Her mother has got her face in her hands. Swiatek, meanwhile, is prowling on the baseline ready to receive and go in for the kill. At 15-40, Swiatek flicks a backhand pass beyond a stranded Anisimova and Swiatek will serve for a Wimbledon final whitewash. This has been the most uncomfortable of watches; a crushed Anisimova is trying to hold back the tears at the changeover. But as brutal as it\u2019s been for her, it\u2019s been absolutely brilliant from Swiatek.\nSecond set: Anisimova* 0-6, 0-4 Swiatek (*denotes next server)\n\u201cWith Anisimova being the player listed first, the \u201c0 0\u201d on her part of the scoreboard looks like a visual depiction of the eyes of a rabbit being caught in the headlights. Which feels all too appropriate,\u201d sighs David Howell. Meanwhile BJK and the Princess of Wales are having a little chat in the Royal Box; perhaps they\u2019re trying to come up with a gameplan for Anisimova. They should send it down swiftly, though, because Swiatek is a point away from her 10th consecutive game at 40-30. This time Anisimova has Swiatek reeling with a punchy return \u2026 and then Anisimova swats a winner to the open court! Deuce. But it\u2019s another American horror story from there as Swiatek holds.\nSwiatek breaks: Anisimova 0-6, 0-3 Swiatek* (*denotes next server)\nThe Centre Court crowd are in raptures when Anisimova claws herself back to 30-all on serve. If she can get a first game on the board, perhaps it\u2019ll sow a little seed of doubt in Swiatek\u2019s mind. But it\u2019s a very small perhaps. Anisimova is swiping her racket in the air when she gives away a break point from deuce; Swiatek is striding to the other side of the court ready to receive. Just like Graf, she\u2019s hurrying around as if there\u2019s no tomorrow. Swiatek doesn\u2019t secure the first break point but soon, predictably, has a second, and Anisimova bashes a backhand into the net. Her best shot, which is usually such a brutal weapon, just hasn\u2019t got going today. Much like the rest of her game.\nSecond set: Anisimova* 0-6, 0-2 Swiatek (*denotes next server)\nSwiatek stirs memories of Rafa with her vicious spin, Roger with her footwork and Steffi in her efficiency, as she glides 30-0 ahead. She briefly errs with a first double fault, but that doesn\u2019t distract her, as from 30-all she holds, after smartly changing up her serve. She\u2019s thinking so clearly out there; while Anisimova\u2019s mind is totally scrambled. And speaking of Steffi, the fastest victory in a grand slam final was sealed by Graf at the 1988 French Open, when she double-bageled Natasha Zvereva in just 34 minutes. We\u2019ve been going 37 minutes here, so that\u2019s one record Swiatek can\u2019t claim. I wonder how many slam finals have actually ended 6-0, 6-0 though?\nSwiatek breaks: Anisimova 0-6, 0-1 Swiatek* (*denotes next server)\nThe second set starts in a similar vein, as Anisimova slumps 0-30 down on serve. But she wins just her tenth and 11th points of the match to scramble back to 30-all. \u201cChris Evert lost the first set 6-0 in a Wimbledon final to Billie Jean King,\u201d Sam Smith offers up on the BBC commentary, in a way that suggests there\u2019s some hope for Anisimova. But no, Smith then recalls that BJK went on to win in straight sets. And you know what happens here, right? Anisimova, with her first-serve percentage down at 35%, concedes yet another break. She still hasn\u2019t got a game on the board.\n\u201cBefore the match I felt nearly neutral about whom I wanted to win, but now I realize that all I want is a close match, no matter who emerges victorious,\u201d emails Cynthia Meredith. \u201cFor the sake of Amanda and the Wimbledon crowd, I dearly hope that Iga cools off.\u201d\nAnd this from Tomasz Rykala: \u201cAnisimova\u2019s demeanour resembles Djokovic\u2019s yesterday. It\u2019s like she\u2019s thrown in the towel already. Shame for her but, as a Pole myself, I have to be happy for Swiatek.\u201d\nAnd David Howell: \u201cI don\u2019t see how Swiatek loses games, let alone sets, given how settled her opponent isn\u2019t. This could be over very, very quickly indeed.\u201d\nSwiatek wins the first set 6-0\nSwiatek is serving for the first set after 22 minutes. It feels as if it\u2019s been about five. 15-0, 30-0. Then 40-0, after the point of the match: the pair engage in some tete-a-tete at the net, Anisimova hits it right at Swiatek (that\u2019s one way to stop her), but Swiatek still finds a way to win the point. And the next. Swiatek\u2019s bagel bakery is open on Centre Court. This may be grass, but the Pole\u2019s playing like peak Swiatek on clay. And just how does Anisimova recover?\nSwiatek breaks: Anisimova 0-5 Swiatek* (*denotes next server)\nA third double fault from Anisimova on the opening point. Followed by another errant shot. And another. 0-40, three more break points. This is uncomfortable viewing. She just can\u2019t shake the stage fright off. She needs the crowd to help her get into it, but they\u2019re as subdued and shocked as she is. Even more so when Anisimova concedes the break to love. Anisimova has been known in the past for sometimes being fragile mentally on court, but had held her nerve so well in this tournament, especially when seeing off Sabalenka in the semi-finals. But she just can\u2019t get going here.\nFirst set: Anisimova* 0-4 Swiatek (*denotes next server)\n\u201cThe first thing Anisimova needs to do is accept this situation is overwhelming,\u201d McEnroe says. \u201cPlay safer. Go to the middle of the court. Give some positive energy. It\u2019s a harsh start but there\u2019s time to get this going.\u201d Anisimova perhaps hears her fellow American\u2019s pep talk as she swings freely for one of the first times this afternoon to put away a backhand winner. Swiatek shanks a forehand \u2013 which sometimes happens, because of her extreme grip \u2013 and it\u2019s 15-30. A glimmer for Anisimova. But Swiatek\u2019s shot clips the sideline, the bounce is unkind, and Anisimova nets. 30-all. And that\u2019s very soon game.\nSwiatek breaks: Anisimova 0-3 Swiatek* (*denotes next server)\nAnisimova does get ahead for the first time, at 15-0, but then serves up a double fault. 15-all turns into 40-15. Cue a big exhale from Anisimova. She sorely needs this hold. Swiatek comes back at her with an inside-out backhand for 40-30, and a netted forehand from Anisimova makes it deuce. Anisimova\u2019s Russian-born mum Olga, who coached her until the age of seven, winces in the stands. Swiatek\u2019s father, Tomasz, who was an Olympic rower, is also in the stands today. Apparently he used to make her practise her tennis shots while balancing on a board in the water, which goes some way to explaining her supreme balance and co-ordination. Swiatek is left stumbling into the grass, though, as Anisimova brings up advantage. But the American can\u2019t seal the game and soon Swiatek is eyeing up another break. And Anisimova double faults. Ach.\nFirst set: Anisimova* 0-2 Swiatek (*denotes next server)\nSwiatek is such a ferocious frontrunner, Anisimova can\u2019t afford to let Swiatek run away with this first set. But after two quick points Swiatek is at 30-0. Anisimova then biffs a backhand long and it\u2019s 40-0. \u201cShe\u2019s as tight as a drum,\u201d observes John McEnroe. Swiatek concedes only her second point of the final with a netted attempted cross-court forehand, but holds to 15 when Anisimova\u2019s return whistles beyond the baseline. Swiatek has made her intentions clear from the off.\nSwiatek breaks: Anisimova 0-1 Swiatek* (*denotes next server)\nAnisimova has the honour of getting the 131st Wimbledon women\u2019s final under way. But it\u2019s an inauspicious start for the 13th seed in her first grand slam final, as she drops 0-30 down. And then 0-40, with a meek forehand into the net. That looked very nervy. Anisimova steadies herself a little by getting into a longer rally, setting it up on her favoured backhand side, before drilling away a forehand winner. That\u2019ll shake off some tension. But a wild forehand on the second break point and Swiatek, in her sixth grand slam final having won the previous five, strikes early with the break!\nBritain\u2019s Oliver Bonding and his American partner Jagger Leach, the son of former champ Lindsay Davenport, have lost in the boys\u2019 doubles final, 5-7, 7-6 (6), 10-5, to Oskari Paldanius and Alan Wazny.\nThere\u2019s so much excited chatter on Centre Court I can\u2019t even hear who won the coin toss, though I can tell you that Swiatek, a bundle of energy with her jumping on the spot and practice swings, looks very up for this. The players start warming up. \u201cIs strawberry jam any stranger than apple sauce, orange sauce, plum sauce on roast meat?\u201d muses Marlon Andre Seton.\nThey arrive on court just after the clock strikes 4pm, a sentence I\u2019ve never written before on women\u2019s final day. It\u2019s boiling, about 29C. Another sentence I\u2019ve never typed before on women\u2019s final day. But some traditions don\u2019t change, as a youngster is invited on to court to perform the coin toss. Today the honour goes to 12-year-old Sophie Kneen, who\u2019s representing AFC Wimbledon Foundation and its efforts to increase female participation in sport.\nHere they come, the players weaving and winding their way through the corridors of the All England Club, walking past pictures of former great champions, but Swiatek, headphones on as always, has got her head down. Anisimova pauses for a second to take in her surroundings. What a moment for both of them in their first Wimbledon final.\nMeanwhile, Swiatek\u2019s love of strawberry pasta has got me thinking about the strangest meals athletes eat (or any of us for that matter). If you\u2019d like to serve up anything, you can get in touch here. My offering: my mother-in-law putting strawberry jam on her roast dinners.\n\u201cHi Katy,\u201d emails Carrie Ilbrey. \u201cNot the final I wanted, but nonetheless I\u2019m looking forward to a cracker. I reckon this is Iga\u2019s big chance. Jazda Iga!\u201d\nA huge cheer as the Princess of Wales arrives in the Royal Box \u2013 she\u2019ll also be presenting the Venus Rosewater Dish to the winner. The box is also jam packed with Wimbledon champions, including Conchita Martinez, Navratilova and BJK \u2013 who\u2019ve both hot-footed it up there after their turn on the BBC.\nWe\u2019ve still got five minutes until the players appear, so let\u2019s talk tactics. Swiatek is all about her spin and vicious forehand \u2013 Anisimova is all about her destructive power and huge backhand. Anisimova, with her big, flat, early ball-striking, will know she\u2019s the kind of player that Swiatek can sometimes struggle against on the faster surfaces, and getting the first strike in and taking time away from Swiatek will be key for the American, even when she\u2019s feeling the nerves in her first slam final. Swiatek tends to produce her best tennis when it matters the most: she\u2019s 5-0 in grand slam finals (with only one of those going to three sets) and won\u2019t mind the pressure of being the favourite.\nThe BBC is screening emotional montages about Anisimova\u2019s career-saving break from tennis to protect her mental health and about how Swiatek never thought she\u2019d be able to conquer the grass of Wimbledon. Jeez, I\u2019ve already got a tear in my eye and they haven\u2019t even got going yet. Johnny Mac then appears to say he picked Anisimova about 10 days ago to win Wimbledon and is sticking by his prediction. \u201cShe\u2019s got the bigger game,\u201d he says.\nThe head-to-head. I mentioned they\u2019ve not played each other before in the senior ranks (Swiatek and Anisimova that is, definitely not Chrissy, Martina and BJK), despite being born only three months apart, but they did meet as 15-year-old whippersnappers in the 2016 Junior Fed Cup, when Swiatek won in straight sets.\nThe BBC has brought out the big guns for the final. Chrissy Evert is going for Swiatek to win. Martina Navratilova seems to agree. And Billie Jean King talks about how much it would mean to Swiatek to win grand slam titles on all three surfaces; it certainly was hugely self-affirming to her when she did it in the 1970s, she says.\n\u201cPoland has gone completely Wimbledon (and strawberry pasta) mad, with one news channel showing a live cooking class on how to prepare a perfect makaron z truskawkami (with a Michelin-starred chef, no less) to get ready and cheer Swiatek on during the final today,\u201d reports our Europe blogger Jakub Krupa, who\u2019s also helped to serve up this delight on Swiatek\u2019s favourite dish and much more:\nSwiatek says:\nI never dreamed it would be possible to play in this final \u2026 I\u2019m super proud of myself. Tennis keeps surprising me. Every slam final has been totally different. It\u2019s hard to compare these journeys. For now I am enjoying this new feeling of being more comfortable on grass.\nAnisimova says:\nWhen I took my break, a lot of people told me that you would never make it to the top again if you take so much time away from the game. That was a little hard to digest because I did want to come back and still achieve a lot and win a grand slam one day. I think it goes to show that it is possible. Just me being able to prove that you can get back to the top if you prioritise yourself has been incredibly special to me.\nIga is such an unbelievable player, but she\u2019s also been an inspiration to me. Hopefully I can bring some high quality tennis and make it a battle out there. I\u2019m going to go out and enjoy every moment and try to not think about what\u2019s on the line.\nRoad to the final. When Anisimova whitewashed Yulia Putintseva 6-0, 6-0 in the first round, perhaps we should have known she was going to do something special this fortnight. She dealt well with the pressure of being the favourite in every round until the semi-finals, where she dealt even better with the world No 1 Sabalenka. Swiatek, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t dropped a set since the second round, gaining confidence and momentum as the rounds have gone by on a surface that had previously befuddled her.\nAnisimova\nFirst round def Yulia Putintseva 6-0, 6-0\nSecond round def Renata Zarazua 6-4, 6-3\nThird round def Dalma Galfi 6-3, 5-7, 6-3\nFourth round def Linda Noskova 6-2, 5-7, 6-4\nQuarter-final def Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-1, 7-6\nSemi-final def Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4\nSwiatek\nFirst round def Polina Kudermetova 7-5, 6-1\nSecond round def Caty McNally 5-7, 6-2, 6-1\nThird round def Danielle Collins 6-2, 6-3\nFourth round def Clara Tauson 6-4, 6-1\nQuarter-final def Liudmila Samsonova 6-2, 7-5\nSemi-final def Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0\nTale of the tape\nSwiatek - Anisimova\n24 Age 23\n4 Seeding 13\n4 World ranking 12\n5 Grand slam titles 0\n5 Grand slam finals (before today) 0\n22 Singles titles 3\n0 Wimbledon finals 0\n0 Head-to-head 0\nAnd here\u2019s our match report on the history makers Cash and Glasspool:\nHere\u2019s our tennis correspondent Tumaini\u2019s preview of the women\u2019s final:\nAnd his superb interview with Anisimova on her tennis timeout:\nThere was defeat earlier, however, for Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid in the men\u2019s wheelchair doubles final. The six-times champions were beaten 7-6, 7-5 by Spain\u2019s Martin de la Puente and the Netherlands\u2019 Ruben Spaargaren. Another Brit, Gregory Slade, lost in straight sets in the quad wheelchair doubles final, while the 18-year-old Oliver Bonding is partnering Jagger Leach, the son of the 1999 women\u2019s champion Lindsay Davenport, in the boys\u2019 doubles final. They\u2019re a set up, 7-5, against Finland\u2019s Oskari Paldanius and Poland\u2019s Alan Wazny.\nThe moment of victory.\nAnd here come the champions. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure on our shoulders going into this event, the fact we could do it was so surreal,\u201d says Cash. \u201cWe had two goals this year \u2013 one was to make it [to the season-ending event in] Turin, another was to win a slam. A lot of people probably wouldn\u2019t have believed us. Our team backed us the whole way. To do it here \u2013 it couldn\u2019t mean more. Playing doubles you\u2019re not always on the biggest court, so to play on the biggest and most special court in the world, to do it here? Incredible.\u201d\nAs for Glasspool, he says: \u201cWe\u2019ve given you one British champion [Henry Patten won the Wimbledon men\u2019s doubles title last year with Finland\u2019s Harri Heliovaara], but now we\u2019ve given you two.\u201d\nThe runners-up speak. \u201cIt was our first time speaking on the first day of the tournament,\u201d says Pel. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing actually.\u201d Hijikata adds: \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy ride. It\u2019s been so much fun playing with David. It\u2019s a dream come true to be playing out here on Centre Court.\u201d\nGB's Cash and Glasspool win men's doubles title\nCurrently on Centre Court: wonderful scenes as Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool celebrate adding their names to the annals of Wimbledon, becoming the first British pair to win the men\u2019s doubles title in 89 years. So it\u2019s been an even longer wait than from Fred Perry in 1936 to Andy Murray in 2013 in the men\u2019s singles. Glasspool and Cash defeated David Pel and Rinky Hijikata, 6-2, 7-6 (3), the Dutch-Australian pairing who hadn\u2019t even met each other before this year\u2019s tournament. What a way for finals weekend to begin.\nPreamble\nWhat a difference five weeks can make. Last month Iga Swiatek, overwhelmed by her own doubts, relinquished the French Open crown she\u2019d held since 2022. Her aura of invincibility was shot to pieces. She\u2019d already lost her world No 1 ranking to Aryna Sabalenka towards the end of last season after testing positive for a substance she\u2019d inadvertently taken in a contaminated medicine; while she was banned for only one month, the mental toll had lasted for much longer. And as she left Paris, having failed to reach a final in 12 months, let alone win a title, it\u2019s fair to say she was at a career low.\nSome questioned (me included) if the Pole would ever win another slam; parallels were even drawn with Bjorn Borg\u2019s sudden demise after his period of Wimbledon domination ended in 1981. He retired 18 months later aged 26, burnt out and disillusioned, having lost his relentless will to win. Was Swiatek, at the age of 24, in danger of going the same way? Certainly in the short-term no one expected her to do much at Wimbledon, given that the former Queen of Clay had always been among the mere ranks on grass, having never been beyond the quarter-finals, despite her status as a junior champion in 2018.\nBut thanks to a grass-court training camp in Mallorca and a confidence-building run to the Bad Homburg final, and fuelled by a Wimbledon diet of strawberries and cream pasta, she has grabbed every opportunity (and towel) that has come her way this fortnight as the players in her half of the draw \u2013 most notably Coco Gauff and the former champ Elena Rybakina \u2013 departed. At last, Swiatek says, the balls are listening to her on the grass. She looks happy and relaxed. She\u2019s shown more of her personality in the on-court interviews. And she goes into this final as the favourite.\nBut Amanda Anisimova is enjoying an empowering revival of her own. Having come within a few games of reaching the French Open final as a 17-year-old prodigy in 2019, the American took an eight-month break from the game in 2023 because of burnout. She didn\u2019t even get through Wimbledon qualifying last year. But she held her nerve brilliantly against Aryna Sabalenka in Friday\u2019s semi-final, displaying courage every bit as big as her shots.\nShe wants this just as much as Swiatek does; victory would be so self-affirming for either. I wish they could split it, but I\u2019m not sure the All England Club would countenance the beautiful Venus Rosewater Dish being cut in half. Add into the mix they\u2019ve never played each other before on tour, and that makes this unexpected final even more intriguing.\nPlay begins: in a departure from tradition at 4pm BST. And remember you can get in touch in the usual way. It would be great to hear from you."

            "Trump plans to hike tariffs on Canadian goods to 35%. Trump plans to hike tariffs on Canadian goods to 35%\nPresident Donald Trump says he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said in a Thursday letter that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance.\nThe letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March after months of threats. Trump's tariffs were allegedly in an effort to get Canada to crack down on fentanyl smuggling despite the relatively modest trafficking in the drug from that country. Trump has also expressed frustration with a trade deficit with Canada that largely reflects oil purchases by America.\n\u201cI must mention that the flow of Fentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Canada, which has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter.\nThe higher rates would go into effect Aug. 1, creating a tense series of weeks ahead for the global economy as recent gains in the S&P 500 stock index suggest many investors think Trump will ultimately back down on the increases.\nWhile multiple countries have received tariff letters this week, Canada \u2014 America's second largest trading partner after Mexico \u2014 has become something of a foil to Trump. It has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and pushed back on the president's taunts of making Canada the 51st state. Mexico has also faced 25% tariffs because of fentanyl, yet it has not faced the same public pressure from Trump.\nCarney was elected prime minister in April on the argument that Canadians should keep their \u201celbows up.\u201d He has responded by distancing Canada from its intertwined relationship with the U.S., seeking to strengthen its links with the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nHours before Trump's letter, Carney posted on X a picture of himself with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying, \u201cIn the face of global trade challenges, the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada.\u201d Implied in his statement was that the U.S. has become unreliable because of Trump's haphazard tariff regime, which has gone through aggressive threats and reversals.\nWhen Carney went to the White House in May, the public portion of their meeting was cordial. But Trump said there was nothing the Canadian leader could tell him to remove the tariffs.\n\u201cJust the way it is,\u201d Trump said at the time.\nCarney indicated he would be willing to be patient in pursuing talks on trade.\n\u201cThere are much bigger forces involved,\u201d the Canadian leader said. \u201cAnd this will take some time and some discussions.\u201d\nTrump has sent a series of tariff letters to 23 countries so far. Those form letters became increasingly personal with Canada as well as a Wednesday note that put a 50% tariff on Brazil for the ongoing trial of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for trying to stay in office after his 2022 election loss. Trump was similarly indicted for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.\nThe letters reflect the inability of Trump to finalize the dozens of trade frameworks that he claimed would be easy to negotiate. Shortly after unveiling his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, a financial market selloff caused Trump to announce a 90-day negotiating period during which a 10% baseline tariff would be charged on most imported goods.\nBut Trump has indicated that the 10% tariff rates are largely disappearing as he resets the rates with his letters.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it\u2019s 20% or 15%,\u201d Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News.\nSo far, Trump has announced trade frameworks with the U.K. and Vietnam, as well as a separate deal with China in order to enable continued trade talks. Trump jacked up import taxes on Chinese goods to as much as 145%, but after talks Trump has said China faces total tariffs of 55%.\nIn June, Trump said he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue its digital services tax, which would hit U.S. technology companies. A few days later, talks resumed when Carney rescinded the tax.\nUnder the current tariff structure, the 2020 United States Mexico Canada Agreement has protected eligible goods from Trump's tariffs.

            "Trump's latest tariff target: Canadian goods will be hit with 35% tax in August. WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said in a letter that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance.\nThe Thursday letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March after months of threats. Trump's tariffs were allegedly in an effort to get Canada to crack down on fentanyl smuggling despite the relatively modest trafficking in the drug from that country. Trump has also expressed frustration with a trade deficit with Canada that largely reflects oil purchases by America.\n\u201cI must mention that the flow of Fentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Canada, which has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter.\nThe higher rates would go into effect Aug. 1, creating a tense series of weeks ahead for the global economy as recent gains in the S&P 500 stock index suggest many investors think Trump will ultimately back down on the increases. But stock market futures were down early Friday in a sign that Trump's wave of tariff letters may be starting to generate concern among investors.\nIn a social media post, Carney said Canada would continue to work toward a new trade framework with the U.S. and has made \u201cvital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl.\u201d\n\u201cThrough the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and business,\u201d Carney said.\nWhile multiple countries have received tariff letters this week, Canada \u2014 America's second largest trading partner after Mexico \u2014 has become something of a foil to Trump. It has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and pushed back on the president's taunts of making Canada the 51st state. Mexico has also faced 25% tariffs because of fentanyl, yet it has not faced the same public pressure from the Republican U.S. president.\nCarney was elected prime minister in April on the argument that Canadians should keep their \u201celbows up.\u201d He has responded by distancing Canada from its intertwined relationship with the U.S., seeking to strengthen its links with the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nHours before Trump's letter, Carney posted on X a picture of himself with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying, \u201cIn the face of global trade challenges, the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada.\u201d Implied in his statement was that the U.S. has become unreliable because of Trump's haphazard tariff regime, which has gone through aggressive threats and reversals.\nWhen Carney went to the White House in May, the public portion of their meeting was cordial. But Trump said there was nothing the Canadian leader could tell him to remove the tariffs, saying, \u201cJust the way it is.\u201d\nDaniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Trump's latest move will make it more difficult for Canada and the U.S. to reach a trade deal, Beland said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean a new trade deal between Canada and the United States is impossible, but it shows how hard it is for the Canadian government to negotiate with a U.S. president who regularly utters threats and doesn\u2019t appear to be a reliable and truthful interlocutor,\u201d he said.\nTrump has sent a series of tariff letters to 23 countries. Those form letters became increasingly personal with Canada as well as a Wednesday note that put a 50% tariff on Brazil for the ongoing trial of its former President Jair Bolsonaro for trying to stay in office after his 2022 election loss.

            "Trump plans to hike tariffs on Canadian goods to 35%. WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said in a letter that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance.\nThe Thursday letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March after months of threats. Trump's tariffs were allegedly in an effort to get Canada to crack down on fentanyl smuggling despite the relatively modest trafficking in the drug from that country. Trump has also expressed frustration with a trade deficit with Canada that largely reflects oil purchases by America.\n\u201cI must mention that the flow of Fentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Canada, which has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter.\nThe higher rates would go into effect Aug. 1, creating a tense series of weeks ahead for the global economy as recent gains in the S&P 500 stock index suggest many investors think Trump will ultimately back down on the increases. But stock market futures were down early Friday in a sign that Trump's wave of tariff letters may be starting to generate concern among investors.\nIn a social media post, Carney said Canada would continue to work toward a new trade framework with the U.S. and has made \u201cvital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl.\u201d\n\u201cThrough the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and business,\u201d Carney said.\nWhile multiple countries have received tariff letters this week, Canada \u2014 America's second largest trading partner after Mexico \u2014 has become something of a foil to Trump. It has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and pushed back on the president's taunts of making Canada the 51st state. Mexico has also faced 25% tariffs because of fentanyl, yet it has not faced the same public pressure from the Republican U.S. president.\nCarney was elected prime minister in April on the argument that Canadians should keep their \u201celbows up.\u201d He has responded by distancing Canada from its intertwined relationship with the U.S., seeking to strengthen its links with the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nHours before Trump's letter, Carney posted on X a picture of himself with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying, \u201cIn the face of global trade challenges, the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada.\u201d Implied in his statement was that the U.S. has become unreliable because of Trump's haphazard tariff regime, which has gone through aggressive threats and reversals.\nWhen Carney went to the White House in May, the public portion of their meeting was cordial. But Trump said there was nothing the Canadian leader could tell him to remove the tariffs, saying, \u201cJust the way it is.\u201d\nDaniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Trump's latest move will make it more difficult for Canada and the U.S. to reach a trade deal, Beland said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean a new trade deal between Canada and the United States is impossible, but it shows how hard it is for the Canadian government to negotiate with a U.S. president who regularly utters threats and doesn\u2019t appear to be a reliable and truthful interlocutor,\u201d he said.\nTrump has sent a series of tariff letters to 23 countries. Those form letters became increasingly personal with Canada as well as a Wednesday note that put a 50% tariff on Brazil for the ongoing trial of its former President Jair Bolsonaro for trying to stay in office after his 2022 election loss. Trump was similarly indicted for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\nTrump administration officials have said that Trump was seeking to isolate its geopolitical rival China with the tariffs, but the latest tariffs have undermined that message. Brazil's largest trading partner is China, not the U.S., and Chinese government officials have framed his import taxes as a form of bullying.\n\u201cSovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are important principles of the U.N.

            "Price of gold eases after Trump rules out tariffs on imported bars. The price of gold has eased after Donald Trump announced tariffs would not be placed on gold bars.\nHis social media statement on Monday put an end to uncertainty, which had caused panic in global trade of the precious metal.\nInvestors sold off the metal as Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that \u201cGold will not be tariffed\u201d. The White House had earlier said it would clarify \u201cmisinformation\u201d about tariffs on gold bars, which are duty-free.\nOn Friday, the price of gold futures jumped to a record high after it was reported that the US would put tariffs on imports of 1kg bars.\nThat decision was seen as a big setback to Switzerland, which dominates the bullion market, with $36bn (\u00a327bn) of exports making up more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s trade surplus with the US in the first quarter, according to Swiss customs data.\nSwitzerland was hit with a blanket 39% tariff on all imports from the country, from gold to luxury watches, chocolate and cheese.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s statement on Monday allayed concerns about bullion exports, and US gold futures dropped 2.4% to $3,407 per ounce after his post on Monday, reducing a premium over spot gold, the global benchmark, which fell 1.2% to $3,357.\nOn Tuesday, gold prices edged up after data showed that US inflation remained unchanged at 2.7% in July, slightly lower than economists had expected.\nThe Swiss Association of Precious Metals Producers and Traders (ASFCMP) welcomed the statement by Trump but said it must be followed up with a \u201cformal\u201d decision.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s statement is an encouraging signal for trade stability,\u201d said Christoph Wild, the president of the ASFCMP. \u201cHowever, only a formal and binding decision will provide the certainty the gold sector and its partners require.\u201d\nA White House official told Reuters that the Trump administration was preparing an executive order \u201cclarifying misinformation\u201d about tariffs on gold bars and other products.\nThe gold market, considered a safe haven investment sector for customers ranging from individual investors to sovereign funds, was thrown into disarray last week when the US Customs and Border Protection said that 1kg and 100-ounce cast bars were not exempt from tariffs.\nThe authorities clarified their position in response to a letter from a law firm representing a metals financier after they were suddenly faced with tariffs.\nRoss Norman, the chief executive of Metals Daily in London, said most physical gold being flown to New York, where the gold futures market is based, would have been held back in bonded warehouses while representatives sought urgent clarification from the White House.\n\u201cI am delighted to hear the crisis has been averted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will come as an enormous relief to the bullion markets, as the potential for disruption was incalculable.\u201d\nNorman said gold bullion investment was a major market in the US, where customers could buy gold in their local supermarkets, including Costco.\nA kilo bar costs about \u00a389,000 and coins, weighing an ounce, can be bought for \u00a32,500. The metal is also used as a safe haven to hedge against inflation by commercial investors.\nBullion refers to gold and silver officially recognised as being at least 99.5% pure and is in the form of bars or ingots rather than coins.",
            "New gold tariffs are in effect. Will Costco gold bars be affected?. In This Article:\nBuying gold bars from Costco is just about the easiest way to get your hands on the precious metal \u2014 if you're lucky enough to find them in stock.\nGold (GC=F) has been surging all year, with gold futures reaching yet another high Friday. However, the surprising announcement of additional tariffs on gold bars by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has stymied would-be gold buyers.\nUS gold futures (GC=F) in New York fell on Monday falling 2% as traders awaited clarification from the White House over its tariff policy.\nHere's the latest.\nDeciphering the new 39% tariff on gold\nScott Travers, editor in chief of COINage magazine, said that the new tariff didn't appear to apply to consumer gold buyers \u2014 however, he added that published guidelines are \"ambiguous.\"\nHe noted that the 39% tariff ruling specifically targets 1-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars.\n\"It doesn't look like there is any tariff on 1-ounce gold bars. And they're the predominant investment vehicle and traded asset in gold globally \u2014 1-ounce gold bars,\" Travers told Yahoo Finance.\nInvest in Gold\nConfusion erupted Friday because gold traders and analysts had understood the bars would be exempt from reciprocal tariffs, including a 39% levy on Swiss goods imposed by President Trump. But when a gold refiner in Switzerland asked about it, CBP clarified that 1-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars are subject to the levies, Bloomberg reported.\n\"I'm doing research on this and, you know, a lot of it looks ambiguous. And when you have ambiguity, you have speculation,\" Travers added.\nWhat about Costco gold bars?\nCostco (COST) sells Swiss-made, 1-ounce gold bullion bars to members via its website.\n\"The 1-ounce gold bars, which are used in the retail and most small investment transactions, don't seem to be mentioned here in the US Customs and Border Protection ruling,\" Travers said.\nA spokesperson with Costco media relations told Yahoo Finance that they \"don't comment on news reports.\"\nRead more: What to know before buying gold at Costco\nWhat should gold investors do?\nGold prices soared on the tariff news, hitting an intraday high of $4,490 per ounce at one point Friday. So, what should prospective gold buyers do?\n\"Nothing,\" Travers said. \"They shouldn't be buying on this speculative trend, and they shouldn't be selling their gold holdings based on assuming that other people are ignorant and are buying their gold with the belief that the 1-ounce bars are subject to the tariff.\"\nFull disclosure: Travers admits he's not a fan of gold as an investment \u2014 he sees it more as a manner of \"insurance\" and a currency.",
            "Current price of gold: July 11, 2025. The price of gold stood at $3,353 per ounce as of 8:45 a.m. Eastern Time today. This marks a $32 increase compared to the same time yesterday and a $942 jump from a year prior.\nGold price per ounce | % Change |\n---|---|\nPrice of gold yesterday | $3,321 | -0.95% |\n---|---|---|\nPrice of gold 1 month ago | $3,333 | -0.60% |\n---|---|---|\nPrice of gold 1 year ago | $2,411 | -28.09% |\n---|---|---|\nPrice of gold yesterday |\n---|\nGold price per ounce | $3,321 |\n---|---|\n% Change | -0.95% |\n---|---|\nPrice of gold 1 month ago |\n---|\nGold price per ounce | $3,333 |\n---|---|\n% Change | -0.60% |\n---|---|\nPrice of gold 1 year ago |\n---|\nGold price per ounce | $2,411 |\n---|---|\n% Change | -28.09% |\n---|---|\nFor those seeking an investment that isn\u2019t directly linked to inflation fluctuations, gold could be a suitable option. Historically, gold tends to appreciate over time. A gold IRA is one of the most popular ways to buy and hold gold, providing portfolio stability during turbulent markets. It\u2019s also a practical solution for investors who prefer not to deal with the logistics of storing physical gold bullion.\nHistorical gold price chart\nGold isn\u2019t always a guaranteed winner. In robust economic periods, equities can outperform both in the short and long run. From 1971 through 2024, the stock market\u2019s average annual return was 10.7%, while gold\u2019s was 7.9% over the same span.\nStill, during periods of economic instability, gold is considered a safer, risk-averse asset. Many investors view it more as a store of value than as an investment like stocks or bonds.\nAugusta Precious Metals\nBetter Business Bureau (BBB) consumer rating: | 4.95/5 (A+) |\nBusiness Consumer Alliance (BCA) Rating: | AAA |\nTrustLink Rating: | 5/5 |\nWhat does \u201cspot gold\u201d mean?\nThe spot gold price refers to the immediate purchase or sale price of gold in an over-the-counter transaction. This metric helps investors gauge current demand and market trends. Put simply, a higher spot gold price signals stronger demand. Unlike futures contracts, the spot price is for instant delivery.\nIf the future price exceeds the spot price, this is known as contango, common in commodities with significant storage costs. If the futures price is below the spot price, the market is in backwardation.\nNumerous factors can influence the spot price, causing it to fluctuate frequently. Prospective gold investors should be comfortable with this level of price volatility.\nWhat is price spread in gold trading?\nA price spread is the gap between the price at which an asset can be purchased and the price at which it can be sold.\nIn gold trading, these are called the ask price (the cost to buy) and the bid price (the amount you\u2019d receive selling). The bid price is always less than the ask price.\nA narrower spread indicates a more liquid market. When the spread is tight, it suggests rising demand for gold.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\nHow to invest in gold\nIf your mind jumps to Scrooge McDuck diving into gold coins when you think of gold investment, that\u2019s only partly accurate. While buying physical gold bars, coins, or jewelry is possible, gold is frequently traded via exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nJames Taska, a fee-based financial advisor, notes, \u201cThere is a great debate as to whether paper gold is as useful as the physical. From a financial advisor\u2019s viewpoint, it is much easier to rebalance a client\u2019s allocation of gold if it is owned as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), and the spread when attempting to buy/sell gold can be quite variable and wide.\u201d\nCommon gold investment options include:\nGold bars: Known as bullion, these are sold by weight (gram or ounce), with purity, weight, and manufacturer details stamped on the bar. Gold rounds are another form you may find bullion in.\n-\nGold coins: Collectibles like the American Gold Eagle often carry a premium over bars of equivalent weight due to their rarity and collectible status.\n-\nGold jewelry: Jewelry\u2019s price usually exceeds its gold content value due to design and craftsmanship.\n-\nGold futures contracts: These allow investors to agree on a set price for gold at a future date, enabling speculation without physical delivery.\n-\nGold funds: Mutual funds or ETFs holding gold assets. Like other ETFs, their value fluctuates with the underlying holdings.\n-\nIs it a good time to invest in gold?\nDetermining whether now is the optimal time to invest in gold is somewhat subjective. However, gold can help diversify portfolios and cushion against market swings.\nCurrently, gold remains a stable asset amid high market volatility. Prices have reached record levels, climbing over 25% since early 2025, driven by persistent inflation and economic uncertainty. Many experts recommend adding gold to diversify holdings.\nCurrent precious metals prices as of 8:45 a.m. ET today\nPrecious Metal | Price per ounce |\n---|---|\nGold | $3,353 |\n---|---|\nSilver | $38 |\n---|---|\nPlatinum | $1,366 |\n---|---|\nPalladium | $1,166 |\n---|---|\nGold |\n---|\nPrice per ounce | $3,353 |\n---|---|\nSilver |\n---|\nPrice per ounce | $38 |\n---|---|\nPlatinum |\n---|\nPrice per ounce | $1,366 |\n---|---|\nPalladium |\n---|\nPrice per ounce | $1,166 |\n---|---|\nSilver, platinum, and palladium are also popular portfolio additions. Gold is generally less volatile than silver, which can swing widely even within a single day. Silver\u2019s industrial uses make it more sensitive to economic shifts.\nPlatinum and palladium behave similarly to silver. While these rare metals can add diversification, they tend to fluctuate more than gold.\nThe takeaway\nThe U.S. economy has experienced significant changes in recent years, with prolonged inflation taking a toll. Gold can act as an inflation hedge within a portfolio. Thanks to various acquisition methods, it\u2019s a relatively accessible asset for investors, regardless of experience. Whether you choose a gold IRA or a more active investment account, gold can help achieve both short- and long-term financial goals.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is the best way to own gold?\nMany investors prefer gold ETFs, which offer a managed selection of easily traded assets.\nIs gold a good investment?\nGold is often chosen by those seeking portfolio diversification and inflation protection. There are many accessible ways to invest in gold.\nShould I buy gold coins or gold bars?\nGold coins are considered collectibles and may have a higher value per ounce than bars. Their collectible and historical appeal can make them attractive to some investors. Additionally, U.S. minted coins can help safeguard buyers against counterfeit bars."

Lineage, Inc. (NASDAQ: LINE) reported that its annual Total Revenue declined from 2023 over $5.342 billion in 2023 to $5.34 billion in 2024 and that its Net Loss increased from $77.00 million in 2023 to $664.00 million in 2024.\nOn or around July 25, 2024, Lineage, Inc. conducted its initial public offering of 56,882,051 shares of common stock priced at $78.00 per share.\nThen, on April 30, 2025 Lineage, Inc., reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2025.

            "What to know about Trump\u2019s potential change in federal marijuana policy. By DAVID A. LIEB, Associated Press\nPresident Donald Trump is taking a new look at reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug in a move that could nudge the federal government closer to an approach already embraced in many states.\nTrump said Monday that he hopes to decide in the coming weeks about whether to support changes to the way marijuana is regulated. The renewed focus on marijuana comes more than a year after former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration formally proposed reclassifying marijuana. No decision was made before Biden left office.\nMeanwhile, many states have already gone further than the federal government by legalizing the recreational use of marijuana for adults or allowing it for medical purposes.\nWhat\u2019s the federal policy on marijuana?\nPossessing marijuana remains a federal crime punishable by fines and prison time. Selling or cultivating marijuana is a more serious offense, punishable by prison sentences of five years to life, depending on the quantity of the drug.\nThe Justice Department last year proposed to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin and LSD, to a less dangerous Schedule III substance, which includes such things as ketamine and some anabolic steroids. But that switch involved a lengthy bureaucratic process.\nNearly 43,000 public comments were submitted to the federal government about the proposed change. The Drug Enforcement Administration was still in the review process when Trump succeeded Biden in January, triggering a re-examination of policies across the federal government.\nWhat would reclassifying marijuana mean?\nReclassifying marijuana would not make it legal for recreational use by adults nationwide.

            "Six things Trump should know about Liberia after he praised leader's 'good English'. Six things Trump should know about Liberia after he praised leader's 'good English'\nUS President Donald Trump has praised Liberian President Joseph Boakai for speaking \"good English\" and asked him where he went to school.\nWhat Trump might have missed is that Liberia shares a unique and long-standing connection with the US.\nEnglish is the country's official language and many Liberians speak with an American accent because of those historical ties to the US.\nIt may have been this accent that Trump picked up on.\nHere are six things to know about the West African country:\n1: Founded by freed slaves\nLiberia was founded by freed African-American slaves in 1822 before declaring independence in 1847.\nThousands of black Americans and liberated Africans - rescued from transatlantic slave ships - settled in Liberia during the colonial era.\nFormer US President Abraham Lincoln officially declared Liberia's independence in 1862 but the country retained a lot of US heritage and it remained in the American \"sphere of influence\" during the colonial period.\nDue to this integration, Liberian culture, landmarks and institutions have a strong African-American influence.\nTen of Liberia's 26 presidents were born in the US.\nThe descendants of these freed slaves, known as Americo-Liberians, dominated the country for more than 100 years.\nThis was resented by some indigenous Liberians and the last president from that community, William Tolbert, was overthrown and killed in a coup in 1980.\nThey account for about a quarter of the population, according to the Britannica website, which says more than two dozen languages are spoken in the country.\nPresident Boakai is from the Kissi ethnic group and so would have spoken that as his mother tongue, before learning English at school.\n2: The capital is named after a former US president\nLiberia's capital, Monrovia, was named in honour of America's fifth President, James Monroe, who was a strong supporter of the American Colonization Society (ACS).\nThe ACS was the organisation responsible for resettling freed African-Americans in West Africa - which eventually led to the founding of Liberia.\nNot surprisingly the early architecture of the city was largely influenced by American-style buildings.\nMany streets in Monrovia are named after colonial American figures, reflecting the city's founding and historical ties to the US.\nThe city's main hospital is called the John F Kennedy Medical Center (JFKMC), named after the former US president.\n3: Nearly identical flags\nThe flag of Liberia closely resembles the American flag. It features 11 alternating red and white stripes and a blue square with a single white star.\nThe white star symbolises Liberia as the first independent republic in Africa.\nThe US flag, in comparison, has 13 stripes representing the original 13 colonies and 50 stars, one for each state.\nThe Liberian flag was designed by seven black women - all born in America.\n4: Ex-president's son plays for US football team\nTimothy Weah, the son of Liberia's former President George Weah, is an American professional football player who plays for Italian club Juventus as well as the US national team.\nThe 25-year-old forward was born in the US but began his professional career with Paris St-Germain in France, where he won the Ligue 1 title before moving on loan to the Scottish team, Celtic.\nHis father, George, is a Liberian football legend who won the Ballon d'Or in 1995 while playing for Juventus's Italian rivals AC Milan. He is the only African winner of this award - and went on to be elected president in 2018.\n5: Former president won the Nobel Peace Prize\nLiberia produced Africa's first elected female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\nShe was elected in 2005, two years after the nation's bloody civil war ended, and served as president until 2018.\nJohnson Sirleaf has a strong American background as she studied at Madison Business College and later went to Harvard University where she graduated as an economist.\nShe has received worldwide recognition and accolades for maintaining peace during her administration.\nHer story is pitted with remarkable feats of defiance and courage.\nIn 2011, along with Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkul Karm\u0101n, she won the Nobel Prize for Peace for her efforts to further women's rights.\nIn 2016, Forbes listed her among the most powerful women in the world.\n6: World's largest rubber plantation\nThe plantation, which measures 185 square miles, (479 sq km), is owned by Firestone Liberia, a subsidiary of the US tyre manufacturer.\nIt was founded in 1926 to give the US access to rubber at a time when the product was controlled by the UK.\nFirestone remains Liberia's largest private employer, with more than 4,000 workers.\nThe company has been accused of human rights abuses going back almost to the foundation of the rubber industry in Liberia. In 2006, a UN report into Liberia's rubber industry said: \"Plantation workers are exposed to hazardous working conditions without adequate training or safety equipment.\n\"Many workers\u2026 do not receive fair wages or equal remuneration, and do not have the right to strike. Child labour is frequently used on the plantations,\" it said.\nFirestone has always denied such allegations and, in 2011 it was cleared of using child labour by a US court.\nRubber remains one of Liberia's biggest exports and the US its largest market.\nWhat do Liberians make of Trump's comments?\nForeign Minister Sara Beysolow Nyanti denied it was an awkward moment, saying there was a \"lack of understanding\" around the world about the languages people speak in Africa, which she described as a \"multi-lingual continent\".\n\"Liberia happens to have the American-English intonation and I believe President Trump heard something familiar in the way President Boakai spoke, which is different from the way others speak on the continent,\" she told the BBC's Newsday programme.\n\"We were not offended at all,\" she said, adding that away from the TV cameras, there was a discussion of the two countries' shared history.\nBut there was a mixed reaction among other Liberians.\nAccountant Joe Manley, 40, told the BBC that Trump should have been properly briefed before meeting Liberia's leader.\n\"Liberia has always been an English-speaking country. Our president represents a country with a rich educational tradition.\"\nFor human resources professional Henrietta Peters Magbollah, the US president's surprise at Boakai's eloquence reflects a broader problem about global ignorance with regard to African nations and its peoples.\n\"From travel experiences and observations, most citizens of other nations outside Africa do not know a lot about African countries,\" she said. \"The few that know a little, their minds are clouded by narratives of war, poverty, and lack of education.\"\nHowever lawyer and politician Kanio Gbala agreed with the foreign minister that there was no insult meant.\n\"I believe President Trump's remark was a genuine compliment on President Boakai's command of English,\" he told the BBC. \"There is no evidence of sarcasm. Reading it as disrespectful may reflect political agendas.\"\nMore about Liberia from the BBC:\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",
            "Trump administration has floated deporting third-party nationals to Africa. Here's what we know. Trump administration has floated deporting third-party nationals to Africa. Here's what we know\nSouth Sudan has accepted eight third-country deportees from the U.S. and Rwanda says it\u2019s in talk with the administration of President Donald Trump on a similar deal\nDAKAR, Senegal -- South Sudan has accepted eight third-country deportees from the U.S. and Rwanda says it's in talk with the administration of President Donald Trump on a similar deal, while Nigeria says it's rejecting pressure to do the same.\nAlthough few details are known, these initiatives in Africa mark an expansion in U.S. efforts to deport people to countries other than their own. The United States has sent hundreds of Venezuelans and others to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama but has yet to announce any major deals with governments in Africa, Asia or Europe.\nWhile proponents see such programs as a way of deterring what they describe as unmanageable levels of migration, human rights advocates have raised concerns over sending migrants to countries where they have no ties or that may have a history of rights violations.\nLast year, U.K. Supreme Court ruled that a similar plan to deport rejected asylum-seekers to Rwanda was illegal.\nEarlier this week, Trump held a summit with five West African leaders in the White House, which highlighted the new transactional U.S. policy towards the continent.\nTrump discussed migration with the leaders of Liberia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon, including the need for countries to accept the return of their nationals who do not have the right to stay in the U.S., as well as the possibility of accepting deported nationals of third countries.\nU.S. border tsar Tom Homan told the media Friday that the Trump administration hopes to forge deals with \u201cmany countries\u201d to accept deported migrants.\n\u201cIf there is a significant public threat or national security threat \u2014 there\u2019s one thing for sure \u2014 they\u2019re not walking the streets of this country. We\u2019ll find a third, safe nation to send them to, and we\u2019re doing it,\" he said.\nLiberian President Joseph Boakai told media in Liberia on Friday that third-country nationals were discussed but that Trump had not directly asked Liberia to accept such deportees.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not forcing anybody, but they want us to know that this is the concern they have, and they are asking how can we contribute, how can we help?\u201d he said.\nPresident Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 of Guinea Bissau said Trump discussed the topic during the summit, but did not specifically ask for the African nations to agree to accept deportees. Other West African governments did not reply to a request for comment.\nNigeria\u2019s Foreign Minister Yussuf Tuggar, meanwhile, said such conversations were being held between U.S. representatives and several African countries, though he declined provide details.\nHe said late Thursday that Nigeria would not bow to what he described as pressure to accept third-country deportees, saying the country had enough problems of its own.\nExperts say some African countries may seek to facilitate U.S. deportation programs in order to earn good will in negotiations over tariffs, cuts in U.S. aid or visa restrictions that have hit several African countries in recent months.\nBeverly Ochieng, an analyst at the security consulting firm Control Risks, said countries may want to reach a migrant deal to avoid a situation \"where they lose access to the U.S. economy or economic initiatives and bilateral relations.'\nThose factors are especially important, \u201cin light of the withdrawal of developmental aid,\u201d Ochieng told The Associated Press.\nSo far, the only African country to accept third-country deportees from the U.S. has been South Sudan, which accepted eight deportees with criminal convictions, only one of whom was from South Sudan.\nIt is unclear what deal may have been struck between the two countries. The South Sudanese Foreign Ministry has declined to answer questions.\nAlan Boswell, the Horn of Africa program director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said the South Sudan would have \u201ca number of reasons to want to placate a Trump administration, be that avoiding visa bans, warding off more sanctions against its elite, or generally trying to curry favor.\u201d\nThe decision has drawn criticism from South Sudanese civil society and some members of government. \u201cSouth Sudan is not a dumping ground for criminals,\u201d said Edmund Yakani, a prominent civil society leader in the country.\nHoman, the U.S. border tsar, said Friday he was unsure of the situation of the eight men, saying they were no longer in U.S. custody.\nRwanda\u2019s foreign minister told the AP last month that talks were under way with the U.S. about a potential agreement to host deported migrants, without providing details. The U.S. State Department declined to comment on a potential deal. Rights groups have long criticized Rwanda for their human rights record, especially the deaths in Rwandan custody of some perceived government critics.\nThe U.K. struck a deal with Rwanda in 2022 to send migrants who arrive in the U.K. as stowaways or in boats to the East African country, where their asylum claims would be processed and, if successful, they would stay.

Monika Pronczuk, Associated Press\nMonika Pronczuk, Associated Press\nDarlene Superville, Associated Press\nDarlene Superville, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump promised West African leaders a pivot from aid to trade during a White House meeting Wednesday as the region reels from the impact of sweeping U.S. aid cuts.\nWatch Trump meet with West African leaders in the player above.\nTrump said he sees \u201cgreat economic potential in Africa\u201d as the leaders of Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau boasted of their countries\u2019 natural resources and heaped praise on the U.S. president, including their thanks for his help in settling a long-running conflict between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nWATCH: Trump meets with officials from Rwanda and DRC after signing of peace deal\nTrump described the nations represented at the meeting as \u201call very vibrant places with very valuable land, great minerals, and great oil deposits, and wonderful people\u201d \u2014 a definite shift from his first term, when he used a vulgar term to describe African nations.\nThe meeting comes amid a shift in U.S. global and domestic priorities under Trump\u2019s leadership. Earlier this month, U.S. authorities dissolved the U.S. Agency for International Development and said it was no longer following what they called \u201ca charity-based foreign aid model\u201d and instead would focus on partnerships with nations that show \u201cboth the ability and willingness to help themselves.\u201d\nThe five nations whose leaders were meeting Trump represent a small fraction of U.S.-Africa trade, but they possess untapped natural resources. Senegal and Mauritania are important transit and origin countries when it comes to migration and along with Guinea-Bissau are struggling to contain drug trafficking, both issues of concern for the Trump administration.\nPresident Donald Trump hosts a lunch for African leaders of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal in the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., July 9, 2025. Photo by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\nIn their speeches, each African leader adopted a flattering tone to commend Trump for what they described as his peace efforts across the world and tried to outshine one another by listing the untapped natural resources their nations possess.\n\u201cWe have a great deal of resources,\u201d said Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, president of Mauritania, listing rare earths, as well as manganese, uranium and possibly lithium. \u201cWe have a lot of opportunities to offer in terms of investment.\u201d\nLast month, the U.S. administration facilitated a peace deal between Rwanda and Congo to help end the decadeslong deadly fighting in eastern Congo, while enabling the U.S. to gain access to critical minerals in the region. But analysts said it won\u2019t end the fighting because the most prominent armed group said it does not apply to it.\nDuring the meeting, Trump described trade as a diplomatic tool. Trade \u201cseems to be a foundation\u201d for him to settle disputes between countries, he said.\n\u201cYou guys are going to fight, we\u2019re not going to trade,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we seem to be quite successful in doing that.\u201d\nHe added, addressing the African leaders: \u201cThere is a lot of anger on your continent.\u201d\nAs he spoke, the U.S. administration continued sending out notifications to developing countries about higher tariff rates effective from August 1. The five Western African nations were not among them.\nThe portion of the lunch meeting that was open to the press didn\u2019t touch much on the loss of aid, which critics say will result in millions of deaths.\n\u201cWe have closed the USAID group to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cAnd we\u2019re working tirelessly to forge new economic opportunities involving both the United States and many African nations.\u201d\nWATCH: Ghana struggles to fight disease and poverty without vital U.S. aid\nWest African countries are among the hardest hit by the dissolution of USAID.

            "Threats, delays and confusion: 10 key points to understand another week of Trump tariff turmoil. Donald Trump ramped up his trade rhetoric this week, firing off more than 20 letters to governments outlining new tariff rates if agreements aren\u2019t reached by 1 August.\nIn April, Trump announced a 10% base tariff rate and additional duties ranging up to 50% for many other countries, although he later delayed the effective date for all but 10% duties until 9 July after market panic.\nTrump officials initially suggested they would strike dozens of deals with key economies by the 9 July deadline, but as the 90-day pause ended this week, the president announced a range of new rates for various countries, but delayed their implementation until next month.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happened:\nTrump informed powerhouse suppliers Japan, South Korea and a number of other nations at the start of this week that they will face tariffs of at least 25% starting from August unless they can quickly negotiate deals.\n-\nOn Wednesday he announced more tariffs on countries like the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Algeria, as well as a 50% tariff on products from Brazil, tying the move to what he called the \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d trial against its former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump criticised the trial Bolsonaro is facing over trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, threatened to hit back with reciprocal 50% tariff on US goods.\n-\nOn Thursday, Trump announced the US would impose a 35% tariff on imports from Canada, despite ongoing negotiations and prime minister Mark Carney\u2019s decision last month to rescind a digital services tax that faced criticism from the US president. Carney said his government would continue to defend Canadian workers and businesses in their negotiations and work towards the 1 August deadline.\n-\nTrump also said on Thursday that a letter would be sent to the European Union, the US\u2019s biggest trading partner, \u201ctoday or tomorrow\u201d. Last week the EU and US were closing in on a high-level \u201cframework\u201d trade deal that would avert 50% tariffs on all exports from the bloc.\n-\nThe steep tariff rates announced throughout the week range from 25-50%, with some of the harshest levies imposed on developing nations in south-east Asia, including 32% for Indonesia, 36% for Cambodia and Thailand and 40% on Laos and Myanmar, a country riven by years of civil war.\n-\nOn his first official visit to Asia, US secretary of state Marco Rubio sought to reassure regional powers of Washington\u2019s commitment to them, saying countries there may get \u201cbetter\u201d trade deals than the rest of the world. Prior to Rubio\u2019s arrival in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian prime minister Anwar Ibrahim condemned the tariffs at the opening of an Asean foreign ministers\u2019 meeting.\n-\nTrump has also vowed to implement tariffs of up to 200% on foreign drugs and 50% on copper. Copper prices hit a record high in the US after the announcement.\n-\nUS treasury secretary Scott Bessent said he expected several trade announcements this week, but to date the US has secured just two deals with trading partners. The first with the UK, signed on 8 May, includes a 10% tariff on most UK goods, including cars, and zero tariffs for steel and aluminium. A second deal was reached with Vietnam last week that sets a 20% tariff for much of its exports, although the full details are unclear, with no text released.\n-\nOn Thursday, Trump said the tariffs had been \u201cvery well-received\u201d, adding that the stock market \u201chit a new high today\u201d.\n-\nGlobal stock markets have largely shrugged off the latest threats. Analysts say traders now expect a deal or another delay, while investors appear to be waiting until a deal is done or the tariffs kick in.\n-",
            "Pressure from Trump for trade deals before Wednesday deadline, but hints of more time for talks. Pressure from Trump for trade deals before Wednesday deadline, but hints of more time for talks\nThe United States is stepping up pressure on trading partners to quickly make new deals before a Wednesday deadline when a tariff pause by President Donald Trump expires\nWASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is stepping up pressure on trading partners to quickly make new deals before a Wednesday deadline, with plans for the United States to start sending letters Monday warning countries that higher tariffs could kick in Aug. 1.\nThat furthers the uncertainty for businesses, consumers and America's trading partners, and questions remain about which countries will be notified, whether anything will change in the days ahead and whether President Donald Trump will once more push off imposing the rates. Trump and his top trade advisers say he could extend the time for dealmaking but they insist the administration is applying maximum pressure on other nations.\nKevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that Trump would decide when it was time to give up on negotiations.\n\u201cThe United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything,\u201d Hassett said. \u201cThere are deadlines, and there are things that are close, so maybe things will push back past the deadline or maybe they won\u2019t. In the end the president is going to make that judgment.\u201d\nStephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, likewise said countries negotiating in good faith and making concessions could \u201csort of, get the date rolled.\u201d\nThe steeper tariffs that Trump announced April 2 threatened to overhaul the global economy and lead to broader trade wars. A week later, after the financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect. The negotiating window until July 9 has led to announced deals only with the United Kingdom and Vietnam.\nTrump imposed elevated tariff rates on dozens of nations that run meaningful trade surpluses with the U.S., and a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries in response to what he called an economic emergency. There are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum and a 25% tariff on autos.\nSince April, few foreign governments have set new trade terms with Washington as the Republican president demanded.\nTrump told reporters Friday that his administration might be sending out letters as early as Saturday to countries spelling out their tariff rates if they did not reach a deal, but that the U.S. would not start collecting those taxes until Aug. 1. On Sunday, he said he would send out letters starting Monday \u2014 \u201ccould be 12, could be 15\u201d \u2014 to foreign governments reflecting planned tariffs for each.\n\u201cWe've made deals also,\u201d Trump told reporters before heading back to the White House from his home in New Jersey. \u201cSo we'll get to have a combination of letters, and some deals have been made.\u201d\nHe and his advisers have declined to say which countries would receive the letters.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 was a new deadline and declined to say what might happen Wednesday.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\" Bessent said on CNN's State of the Union. \"I\u2019m not going to give away the playbook.\u201d\nHe said the U.S. was \u201cclose to several deals,\u201d and predicted several big announcements over the next few days. He gave no details.\n\"I think we\u2019re going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\u201d Bessent said.\nLater Sunday, Trump vowed to impose more tariffs against the BRICS bloc of developing nations, which had condemned tariffs increases at its summit in Brazil. Trump said in a post on his social media platform that any country aligning itself with what he termed \u201cthe Anti-American policies of BRICS\u201d would be levied an added 10% tariff.\nTrump has announced a deal with Vietnam that would allow U.S. goods to enter the country duty-free, while Vietnamese exports to the U.S. would face a 20% levy.\nThat was a decline from the 46% tax on Vietnamese imports he proposed in April \u2014 one of his so-called reciprocal tariffs targeting dozens of countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit.\nAsked if he expected to reach deals with the European Union or India, Trump said Friday that \u201cletters are better for us\u201d because there are so many countries involved.\n\u201cWe have India coming up and with Vietnam, we did it, but much easier to send a letter saying, \u2019Listen, we know we have a certain deficit, or in some cases a surplus, but not too many. And this is what you\u2019re going to have to pay if you want to do business in the United States.\u201d\nCanada, however, will not be one of the countries receiving letters, Trump's ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, said Friday after trade talks between the two countries recently resumed.\n\u201cCanada is one of our biggest trading partners,\u201d Hoekstra told CTV News in an interview in Ottawa. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a deal that\u2019s articulated.\"\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said he wants a new deal in place by July 21 or Canada will increase trade countermeasures.\nHoekstra would not commit to a date for a trade agreement and said even with a deal, Canada could still face some tariffs. But \u201cwe\u2019re not going to send Canada just a letter,\u201d he said.\n___\nPrice reported from Bridgewater, New Jersey.

            "Trump sends tariff letters to 7 more countries but avoids major trade partners. Josh Boak, Associated Press\nJosh Boak, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump sent out tariff letters to seven smaller U.S. trading partners on Wednesday with a pledge to announce import taxes on other countries later in the day.\nNone of the countries targeted in the first batch of letters \u2014 the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka \u2014 is a major industrial rival to the United States. It\u2019s a sign that a president who has openly expressed his love for the word \u201ctariff\u201d is still infatuated with the idea that taxing trade will create prosperity for America.\nMost economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth, but Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the U.S. on both rivals and allies. His administration is promising that the taxes on imports will lower trade imbalances, offset some of the cost of the tax cuts he signed into law on Friday and cause factory jobs to return to the United States.\nTrump, during a White House meeting with African leaders talked up trade as a diplomatic tool. Trade, he said, \u201cseems to be a foundation\u201d for him to settle disputes between India and Pakistan, as well as Kosovo and Serbia.\nREAD MORE: A look at the countries that received tariff letters from Trump\n\u201cYou guys are going to fight, we\u2019re not going to trade,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we seem to be quite successful in doing that.\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump placed a 35% tariff on Serbia, one of the countries he was using as an example of how fostering trade can lead to peace.\nTrump said the tariff rates in his letters were based on \u201ccommon sense\u201d and trade imbalances, adding that he would be sending a letter on Wednesday or Thursday to Brazil. Trump suggested he had not thought of penalizing the countries whose leaders were meeting with him in the Oval Office \u2014 Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau \u2014 as \u201cthese are friends of mine now.\u201d\nOfficials for the European Union, a major trade partner and source of Trump\u2019s ire on trade, said Tuesday that they are not expecting to receive a letter from Trump listing tariff rates. The Republican president started the process of announcing tariff rates on Monday by hitting two major U.S. trading partners, Japan and South Korea, with import taxes of 25%.\nAccording to Trump\u2019s letters, imports from Libya, Iraq, Algeria and Sri Lanka would be taxed at 30%, those from Moldova and Brunei at 25% and those from the Philippines at 20%. The tariffs would start Aug. 1.\nThe Census Bureau reported that last year U.S. ran a trade imbalance on goods of $1.4 billion with Algeria, $5.9 billion with Iraq, $900 million with Libya, $4.9 billion with the Philippines, $2.6 billion with Sri Lanka, $111 million with Brunei and $85 million with Moldova. The imbalance represents the difference between what the U.S. exported to those countries and what it imported.\nTaken together, the trade imbalances with those seven countries are essentially a rounding error in a U.S. economy with a gross domestic product of $30 trillion.\nThe letters were posted on Truth Social after the expiration of a 90-day negotiating period with a baseline levy of 10%. Trump is giving countries more time to negotiate with his Aug. 1 deadline, but he has insisted there will be no extensions for the countries that receive letters.\nMaros Sefcovic, the EU\u2019s chief trade negotiator, told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday that the EU had been spared the increased tariffs contained in the letters sent by Trump and that an extension of talks until Aug. 1 would provide \u201cadditional space to reach a satisfactory conclusion.\u201d\nTrump on April 2 proposed a 20% tariff for EU goods and then threatened to raise that to 50% after negotiations did not move as fast as he would have liked, only to return to the 10% baseline. The EU has 27 member states, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\nThe tariff letters are worded aggressively in Trump\u2019s style of writing. He frames the tariffs as an invitation to \u201cparticipate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States,\u201d adding that the trade imbalances are a \u201cmajor threat\u201d to America\u2019s economy and national security.\nThe president threatened additional tariffs on any country that attempts to retaliate. He said he chose to send the letters because it was too complicated for U.S. officials to negotiate with their counterparts in the countries with new tariffs. It can take years to broker trade accords.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba interpreted the Aug. 1 deadline as a delay to allow more time for negotiations, although he cautioned in remarks that the tariffs would hurt his nation\u2019s domestic industries and employment.\nMalaysia\u2019s trade minister, Zafrul Aziz, said Wednesday that his country would not meet all of the U.S. requests after a Trump letter placed a 25% tariff on its goods. Aziz said U.S. officials are seeking changes in government procurement, halal certification, medical standards and digital taxes. Aziz he indicated those were red lines.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is set to arrive Thursday in Malaysia\u2019s capital of Kuala Lumpur.\nAssociated Press writers David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany and Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this report.\nYour donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

            "Drew Hutton helped found the Australian Greens. So why has the troubled party booted him from its ranks?. Drew Hutton had assumed he would live out his life a card-carrying Green. The 78-year-old retiree turned up to local branch meetings, staked party corflutes into the lawn of his home on Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast and handed out how-to-vote cards long after stepping down from active duty in the party.\nGiven Hutton had been awarded life membership and his friend \u2013 and the Greens\u2019 first national leader \u2013 Bob Brown had lauded him a \u201ctowering figure in Australian environmental and social politics\u201d who, \u201cmore than anybody\u201d (including Brown himself) was \u201cresponsible for the formation of the Australian Greens\u201d, it must have seemed a safe bet.\nBut, on 20 July, Hutton will stand before the Queensland Greens state council and plead his case that they reverse a decision by its constitution and arbitration committee (CAC) to expel him.\nHutton will argue he has been purged from the party in a crackdown on free speech.\nThe former lecturer of politics and history will draw on symbolically powerful support. Both Brown and the party\u2019s second national leader, Christine Milne, oppose Hutton\u2019s expulsion and have written to advocate that his membership be restored.\nThe CAC, whose names are not publicly available, will argue it should not be, on the grounds Hutton used social media to provide a platform for transphobia.\nFor Hutton, the choice those assembled branch delegates make behind closed doors next Sunday will mark a turning point in the history of the Greens. Not because he still wields great influence within it \u2013 his time of having an upfront role in the party, Hutton says, has passed.\n\u201cThe important thing isn\u2019t me,\u201d Hutton tell Guardian Australia. \u201cThe important thing is the Greens.\n\u201cAre they going to be a dogmatic, authoritarian party that exerts all this top-down control over members? Or is it going to be the sort of party that people like Bob Brown and myself originally created with a historic mission to try to push the world to a more sustainable footing?\u201d\nThe CAC directed questions to the Queensland Greens\u2019 convenor, Gemmia Burden. In a statement, she wrote that details of all formal complaints were confidential but noted that party rules \u201capply to all members equally\u201d, most of whom \u201crespectfully contribute a diverse range of views without running afoul of the code of conduct\u201d.\n\u201cRespectful discussions of issues is the fundamental basis upon which members of the Queensland Greens make decisions,\u201d Burden said. \u201cHowever, commentary that targets people on the basis of their gender identity is harmful, not respectful.\n\u201cThe Queensland Greens believe that trans rights are non-negotiable, and we do not tolerate transphobia or transmisogyny in the party.\u201d\n\u2018Authoritarian and antidemocratic\u2019\nThe official story of the termination of Hutton\u2019s membership begins on 21 June 2022 at exactly 3:50pm. It was a month to the day after a federal election which would prove a high-water mark for the Greens in Queensland.\nThe party added to its one lower house seat with three newly elected MPs \u2013 all from Brisbane. Queensland Greens were euphoric, pundits agog. The talk was of a \u201cgreenslide\u201d; the state was, briefly, dubbed \u201cGreensland\u201d.\nHutton had been \u201cvery pleased\u201d to see how much the party had flourished since he planted its seed by founding the Brisbane Greens in 1984 beneath the gloom of authoritarian and conservative rule under Joh Bjelke-Petersen.\nBut, with a click of a mouse, he was about to be embroiled in internecine war raging south of the Tweed.\nThen Victorian parliamentary leader, Samantha Ratnam, had just removed Linda Gale from her recently elected position as state convenor because of an internal discussion paper Gale co-authored three years earlier. The paper aimed to prevent what it deemed was a move to \u201cshut down any debate\u201d on a \u201ccritical issue in feminism and women\u2019s rights today\u201d: the definition of a woman. Ratnam labelled the paper \u201ctransphobic\u201d.\nIn New South Wales, feminist lawyer Anna Kerr had her party membership terminated for disrupting Greens actions and discussion groups with what was deemed transphobic views, including being quoted in the media as being \u201cextremely disturbed\u201d by a NSW Greens push to amend legislation to use the term \u201cpregnant person\u201d instead of \u201cpregnant woman\u201d.\nOn his personal Facebook page, Hutton labelled these moves \u201cauthoritarian and antidemocratic\u201d.\n\u201cI believe in full human rights for trans people at the same time as supporting the right of women to be safe from patriarchal oppression,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI am also prepared to say these things publicly. Unfortunately, in the Greens at present that would seem to make me a \u2018transphobe\u2019 \u2026 .\u201d\nTwo days later, Hutton wrote what he said would be a \u201cfinal statement\u201d on the post before which he would close comments raging in the thread below, some of which he acknowledged had been \u201churtful and disrespectful\u201d.\nIn this lengthy statement, Hutton claimed his original post was not written because he wanted to \u201csay anything about the trans-gender issues themselves\u201d but because \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about party officials overturning the results of democratic elections and purging members for raising questions \u201cprogressives should not be afraid to address\u201d.\n\u201cI stand with all women, cis and trans in their struggle and recognise the many non-binary members of our party,\u201d he wrote, signing off with a plea for \u201cinclusive, safe and respectful\u201d policy and process discussions.\nThis would not prove Hutton\u2019s last word on the subject.\n\u2018Forced out\u2019\nA year later, after a complaint lodged against him, the CAC suspended Hutton\u2019s membership until such time as he deleted a post criticising the Greens and removed comments made by others which it deemed transphobic.\nThe committee rejected the allegation Hutton himself had demeaned trans women, but found he had provided a platform for others to do so.\nHutton refused to comply, citing free speech \u2013 an issue for which he had once chained himself to a tree in Queens Street Mall and for which he had been thrown into jail by Bjelke-Petersen\u2019s corrupt police force many times as part of a broader civil disobedience campaign which was, eventually, successful in the form of the landmark 1992 Peaceful Assembly Act.\nA near two-year standoff ensued in which Hutton abided by the CAC\u2019s directive he remain silent.\nBut the deadlock broke open on 15 March 2025 when the Saturday Paper ran the Hutton saga. He has not spoken to journalists about the matter before or since.\nBut in the months that followed he began increasingly sharing articles and opinions on Facebook which critiqued what he called \u201ctrans extremists\u201d. Then, in the weeks before and after the federal election, Hutton spoke at two small rallies organised by a group called Woman Up Queensland, which describes itself as pro-women\u2019s rights but whose opponents label it as a Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist \u2013 or Terf \u2013 group.\nHutton says his is not an isolated case, and claims he knows of more than 40 people who have been expelled or \u201cforced out\u201d of the Greens after voicing their position on gender.\n\u201cAlmost all of them are women,\u201d Hutton says. \u201cThey\u2019re second-wave feminists, for the most part. Some of them are lesbians. And they are outraged.\n\u201cSome of them are opposed to the medicalisation of kids for treatment for gender dysphoria. Others are just outraged that there is this move on to give rights to trans people, but take them away from women.\u201d\nMost of those women don\u2019t want to be identified, Hutton says, for fear of backlash. One who does though, and who fits all the aforementioned categories, is Cheryl Hercus.\nIn 2016, Hercus ran for the Greens in the federal seat of Goldstein in Melbourne. The retired feminist lecturer and author let her party membership lapse in 2019 after having to defend herself against a complaint that alleged she had \u201cproven intransigent\u201d and that her \u201cpromoting harmful transphobic views, articles and beliefs\u201d online reflected her \u201cdeeply held beliefs\u201d.\n\u201cI could probably add another half a dozen to that that Drew doesn\u2019t know about,\u201d Hercus says. \u201cWomen who were involved in the Greens a very long time who\u2019ve just resigned in disgust or disappeared.\u201d\nVery real impacts\nBy taking to the soapbox, Hutton succeeded in forcing the hand of CAC which \u201cterminated\u201d his membership \u201ceffective immediately\u201d on 24 June. This opened the door for Hutton\u2019s long-sought appeal, denied him while his membership languished indefinitely suspended.\nBut while Hutton may have found support in a cohort who had left or been forced out of the party, his standing with many inside it had now been utterly tarnished. High-profile environmental activist Ben Pennings was one with whom online exchanges had become personal and vitriolic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking that Drew Hutton has left the fight for our precious places and a safe climate to become obsessed with a singular issue,\u201d Pennings writes.\nAnd while the debate rages, Ty, a non-binary member of South Brisbane branch \u2013 Hutton\u2019s old stomping ground \u2013 who requested their surname not be published for privacy reasons, says they are the ones who live with the \u201cvery real impacts\u201d of Hutton\u2019s free speech.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really awful,\u201d Ty says of Hutton\u2019s posts and talks. \u201cTo go back into a world where our roles are determined by our genitals is bizarre and creepy and intrusive.\u201d\nA software developer in their 40s, Ty denies a generational rift between the Greens, saying instead the difference was between those \u201cwho actually know and interact with trans people and people who don\u2019t\u201d.\nNor does Ty believe the outcome of Hutton\u2019s appeal will prove much of a turning point.\n\u201cLook, members who don\u2019t line up with the party\u2019s values that they commit to when they join as a member, including the social justice pillar \u2026 members leave when they don\u2019t share those values any more,\u201d they say.\n\u201cSome are asked to leave because their values aren\u2019t compatible with having an inclusive party that actually focuses on actually doing the jobs the party was founded for\u201d.",
            "Change to be forced on 'violent, misogynist' CFMEU. The culture at the CFMEU must change after the union's members deliberately inflicted abuse against workers, women and children to promote fear and gain power, an administrator says.\nA damning report revealed the controversial building union's Queensland branch was ruthless in its pursuit of political, industrial and financial power, \"crushing\" anyone who opposed its aims.\nThe construction and general division of the CFMEU was placed into administration nationwide in August amid claims bikie and organised crime figures had infiltrated the organisation.\nBarrister Geoffrey Watson, a former counsel assisting for NSW's Independent Commission Against Corruption, was appointed to probe the reports of violence and intimidation.\nWhat he found only scratched the surface of serious allegations of \"thuggery\", detailing occasions of union members calling safety inspectors \"f***ing dogs\", intimidating women and children.\n\"The CFMEU is relentless,\" Mr Watson said after interviewing 55 union members, politicians, bystanders and victims.\nMr Irving vowed to fix the union's culture after the report into the Queensland division exposed \"violent, cruel, misogynist\" behaviour that betrayed the \"core values of unionism\".\nThe report has been provided to Queensland Police to probe potential criminal action, but the force has called on more people to come forward and report their experiences.\n\"Investigations need witnesses and evidence,\" Queensland Police Deputy Commissioner Cameron Harsley said.\nMr Irving said he would deal with the behaviour now rather than waiting years for authorities to act.\nThe report uncovered examples of violence and intimidation but the hostility to women was the \"single worst aspect\" of the CFMEU's campaign.\nA female work health and safety adviser was called a \"f***ing c*** dog\" while on another occasion a union member shouted \"come out here and I'll f*** you\" to a young woman during a protest.\nAn Australian Workers Union member was told \"we know you have two young sons\" as the CFMEU ramped up a campaign to drive the organisation out of southeast Queensland.\nA female AWU member and her 13-year-old son were confronted by a CFMEU member whose head was painted with the words \"Australia's Worst Union\".\nThe man asked the child, \"How does it feel to know that your mum is a f***in' grub who sells out workers?\"\nThe union also attacked politicians who would not give in to its demands, with members telling a public servant \"I am your boss now\" when expressing outrage the organisation was not involved in drafting industrial legislation.\nThe CFMEU wanted to have \"the reputation of an outlaw\" and unless it is stopped, the violence would only get worse, Mr Watson warned.\nQueensland Council of Unions' Jacqueline King said a small group of CFMEU members were thought to be responsible for the escalation in violence but it had been allowed to go on for too long.\nAdministrator Mr Irving vowed to dismiss further union members while replacing the culture with one that values \"accountability and decency\".\nThis will include new standards and procedures to deal with wrongdoing, he said.\nQueensland Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie said the coalition was reviewing the report to see if laws can be amended to stop a culture of bullying, fear and intimidation on construction sites.\n\"We need to turn the CFMEU upside down and shake it out,\" he said.\nHe slammed the former Labor government for \"enabling\" the union by continuing to meet with officials despite the claims of aggression levelled at ministers.\nOpposition Leader Steven Miles defended his government, pointing to legal changes it introduced to allow the Queensland union branch to be included in the national administration process.\n\"(Mr) Bleijie sees this through the lens of how to make it a political attack ... for me this is about how we ensure workers ... are protected from this kind of thuggery,\" he said.\nAustralian Associated Press",
            "Report on Queensland CFMEU referred to police after \u2018threats of violence, intimidation, misogyny\u2019 alleged. The findings of an investigation commissioned by the administrator of the Queensland branch of the CFMEU, which found the union \u201cembraced a culture which encouraged and celebrated the use of threats of violence, intimidation, misogyny and bullying\u201d, have been referred to the police.\nThe report, titled Violence in the Queensland CFMEU, was conducted by Centre for Public Integrity senior counsel Geoffrey Watson. It was released on Wednesday night.\nIt concluded that the union made a \u201cmockery of union values\u201d through an alleged culture of intimidation under the former leadership.\nAdministrator Mark Irving said the reviewer interviewed 55 witnesses, was provided with documentation and videos relating to alleged incidents and received the full support of the union.\n\u201cMuch of this was not done in private and the fact that it has taken so long to be called out is partly due to the fear of retribution by those targeted,\u201d Irving said.\nAlleged incidents detailed in the report included a fake bomb threat at a work site in Brisbane, the use of video to identify work site safety inspectors to expose them and their family to harassment, and intimidation of many people within and outside government, including ministers. Much of the alleged abuse detailed was gendered, including the routine use of the word \u201ccunt\u201d to women.\nThe report notes an alleged incident from about 2022 when a workplace health and safety inspector attended a site at Brendale north of Brisbane. An employee said to be holding a functioning angle grinder allegedly approached, yelling \u201cI want to take you outside and bash the shit out of you.\u201d\nIn another alleged incident a workplace health and safety inspector was attending the funeral of his friend\u2019s wife when he was allegedly approached by three unknown men. One allegedly said \u201cYou\u2019re that cunt from the video.\u201d Another is alleged to have added \u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a fucking dog.\u201d\nThe report notes that the CFMEU had recently posted what it describes as an inflammatory video about that inspector on its Facebook page.\nIt also used violence and threats against the Australian Workers\u2019 Union to further industrial aims, he alleged.\n\u201cI fear this investigation only scratched the surface of the violence in the Queensland CFMEU. There are many other potential witnesses and many other stories which could have been told,\u201d report says.\nWatson said the union was also regularly fined through the courts, but was able to \u201cdefeat the sting\u201d of personal payment orders against individual union leaders by having the union pay fines. The union was convicted of offences about 55 times more than the next-placed union, he said.\nCommitting offences was part of the union\u2019s business model with fines \u201cthe cost of doing business\u201d, he alleged.\n\u201cIt seems more likely that breaching the laws and suffering fines was an integral part of the CFMEU business model. Its reputation as an aggressive outlaw created a fear and reticence among those dealing with the CFMEU,\u201d he said.\nIrving said he would use his power to expel members involved in wrongdoing from the union, potentially banning them from future elections.\nHe said the culture that prevailed under the old leadership \u201cwas violent, cruel and misogynist and betrayed the core values of unionism. It will be replaced by a new culture based on union values of justice, equality and solidarity.\u201d\nThe deputy Queensland premier, Jarrod Bleijie, said the report had been immediately forwarded to the Queensland police service on Wednesday night.\nHe ruled out deregistering or dissolving the union at a press conference on Thursday.\n\u201cI can commit to Queenslanders, and I\u2019ve spoken directly with premier David Crisafulli this morning,\u201d Bleijie said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this. This says it scratches the surface. We will find out more. We\u2019ll investigate more, and we, if need be, [will] legislate to make sure workers are safe on construction sites\u201d.\nThe Queensland Council of Unions general secretary, Jacqueline King, and president, Kate Ruttiman, apologised for the actions of the former union leadership. The union had disaffiliated from the peak body in 2018.\nKing said the former CFMEU leadership had \u201cdeeply let down Queensland workers and members of our community. You have let down the Queensland trade union movement.\u201d\nThe Queensland Labor leader, Steven Miles, said he was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d at the allegations revealed in the report.\n\u201cI\u2019m a proud trade unionist, and there is no place in the trade union movement [for] this kind of the behaviour,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is not the trade union movement that I know and I am a member of.\u201d\nThe first report is partly redacted to obscure some names and personal details to \u201cprevent repercussions against those who have provided assistance\u201d, the report says. Watson also completed a second, confidential report, which has yet to be released to government. Bleijie said the government would be seeking a copy of this to further their own investigations."

            "Rare Crystal Shape Found to Increase the Strength of 3D-Printed Metal. Andrew Iams saw something strange while looking through his electron microscope. He was examining a sliver of a new aluminum alloy at the atomic scale, searching for the key to its strength, when he noticed that the atoms were arranged in an extremely unusual pattern. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started to get excited,\u201d said Iams, a materials research engineer, \u201cbecause I thought I might be looking at a quasicrystal.\u201d\nNot only did he find quasicrystals in this aluminum alloy, but he and his colleagues at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found that these quasicrystals also make it stronger. They published their findings in the Journal of Alloys and Compounds.\nThe alloy formed under the extreme conditions of metal 3D printing, a new way to make metal parts. Understanding this aluminum on the atomic scale will enable a whole new category of 3D-printed parts such as airplane components, heat exchangers and car chassis. It will also open the door to research on new aluminum alloys that use quasicrystals for strength.\nQuasicrystals are like ordinary crystals but with a few key differences.\nA traditional crystal is any solid made of atoms or molecules in repeating patterns. Table salt is a common crystal, for example. Salt\u2019s atoms connect to make cubes, and those microscopic cubes connect to form bigger cubes that are large enough to see with the naked eye.\nThere are only 230 possible ways for atoms to form repeating crystal patterns. Quasicrystals don\u2019t fit into any of them. Their unique shape lets them form a pattern that fills the space, but never repeats.\nDan Shechtman, a materials scientist at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, discovered quasicrystals while on sabbatical at NIST in the 1980s. Many scientists at the time thought his research was flawed because the new crystal shapes he found weren\u2019t possible under the normal rules for crystals. But through careful research, Shechtman proved beyond a doubt that this new type of crystal existed, revolutionizing the science of crystallography and winning the chemistry Nobel Prize in 2011.\nWorking in the same building as Shechtman decades later, Andrew Iams found his own quasicrystals in 3D-printed aluminum.\nThere are a few different ways to 3D-print metals, but the most common is called \u201cpowder bed fusion.\u201d It works like this: Metal powder is spread evenly in a thin layer. Then a powerful laser moves over the powder, melting it together. After the first layer is finished, a new layer of powder is spread on top and the process repeats. One layer at a time, the laser melts the powder into a solid shape.\n3D printing creates shapes that would be impossible with any other method. For example, in 2015 GE designed fuel nozzles for airplane engines that could only be made with metal 3D printing. The new nozzle was a huge improvement. Its complex shape came out of the printer as a single lightweight part. In contrast, the previous version had to be assembled from 20 separate pieces and was 25% heavier. To date, GE has printed tens of thousands of these fuel nozzles, showing that metal 3D printing can be commercially successful.\nOne of the limitations of metal 3D printing is that it only works with a handful of metals. \u201cHigh-strength aluminum alloys are almost impossible to print,\u201d says NIST physicist Fan Zhang, a co-author on the paper. \u201cThey tend to develop cracks, which make them unusable.\u201d\nNormal aluminum melts at temperatures of around 700 degrees C. The lasers in a 3D printer must raise the temperature much, much higher: past the metal\u2019s boiling point, 2,470 degrees C. This changes a lot of the properties of the metal, particularly since aluminum heats up and cools down faster than other metals.\nIn 2017, a team at HRL Laboratories, based in California, and UC Santa Barbara discovered a high-strength aluminum alloy that could be 3D printed. They found that adding zirconium to the aluminum powder prevented the 3D-printed parts from cracking, resulting in a strong alloy.\nThe NIST researchers set out to understand this new, commercially available 3D-printed aluminum-zirconium alloy on the atomic scale. \u201cIn order to trust this new metal enough to use in critical components such as military aircraft parts, we need a deep understanding of how the atoms fit together,\u201d said Zhang.\nThe NIST team wanted to know what made this metal so strong. Part of the answer, it turned out, was quasicrystals.\nIn metals, perfect crystals are weak. The regular patterns of perfect crystals make it easier for the atoms to slip past each other. When that happens, the metal bends, stretches or breaks. Quasicrystals break up the regular pattern of the aluminum crystals, causing defects that make the metal stronger.\nWhen Iams looked at the crystals from just the right angle, he saw that they had fivefold rotational symmetry. That means there are five ways to rotate the crystal around an axis so that it looks the same.\n\u201cFivefold symmetry is very rare. That was the telltale sign that we might have a quasicrystal,\u201d said Iams. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t completely convince ourselves until we got the measurements right.\u201d To confirm they had a quasicrystal, Iams had to carefully rotate the crystal under the microscope and show that it also had threefold symmetry and twofold symmetry from two different angles.\n\u201cNow that we have this finding, I think it will open up a new approach to alloy design,\u201d says Zhang. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that quasicrystals can make aluminum stronger. Now people might try to create them intentionally in future alloys.\u201d\nPaper: A.D. Iams, J.S. Weaver, B.M. Lane, L.A. Giannuzzi, F. Yi, D.L. LaPlant, J.H. Martin and F. Zhang.

            "Stratasys Buys Nexa3D Assets as Market Shifts From Startups to Giants - 3DPrint.com | The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing. Stratasys has acquired a collection of assets from Nexa3D, a startup that aimed to make high-speed resin 3D printing more practical for production use. While the announcement was relatively quiet, the deal speaks to the ongoing reshaping of the additive manufacturing (AM) landscape.\nWith this deal, Stratasys strengthens its position as a dominant force in polymer AM, reinforcing what it calls \u201cthe largest and most robust offering of AM polymer solutions in the industry.\u201d\nWhat Did Stratasys Acquire?\nStratasys didn\u2019t acquire Nexa3D as a whole, but instead picked up select assets, including intellectual property (IP), inventory, and equipment, but not the company\u2019s personnel or its full operations. That means Nexa3D as a brand and entity is effectively over, but its technologies will live on through Stratasys.\nThe announcement said that Nexa3D customers will now receive \u201cbest-effort\u201d support through iSQUARED AG, a wholly owned Stratasys subsidiary, with the option to transition into the broader Stratasys ecosystem over time.\nNexa3D\u2019s website now directs users to Stratasys-branded services and materials, pointing to continuity of support through spare parts, software licenses, and technical help to \u201ckeep printers running smoothly without interruption.\u201d\nNexa3D was founded in 2016 by Avi Reichental, a former CEO of 3D Systems and a well-known expert in the industry. The company gained attention for its ultrafast resin printing systems, such as the XiP and XiP Pro. In just a few years, Nexa3D expanded its reach into powder-based and extrusion systems by acquiring AddiFab and introducing industrial SLS machines.\nNexa3D tried to make a name for itself as a faster, more flexible alternative to bigger companies. And for a while, it gained traction. The company raised roughly $55 million from investors like OurCrowd and Aramco Ventures. But by late 2024, there were signs of trouble everywhere.\nNexa3D\u2019s Financial Decline\nThe company suddenly canceled its booth at Formnext 2024, the world\u2019s largest AM event. In a direct public update that November, Nexa3D cited \u201csignificant funding challenges\u201d and said it could no longer \u201cguarantee customer support or material supply.\u201d\nBehind the scenes, the company had already gone through some layoffs. By early 2025, some sources said fewer than 20 to 30 employees were still there. Reichental told the media they were \u201ccutting back operations\u201d and not planning to file for bankruptcy, but it raised serious questions about how much longer they could continue.\nLegal and financial analysts speculated about Chapter 11 filings or a full liquidation. Nexa3D denied the reports, but industry insiders suggested the company had quietly put its patents, machines, and leftover inventory on the market as it searched for a transition.\nFor Stratasys, the move is part of a larger trend: acquiring assets in distress to stay competitive as the market continues to consolidate. Earlier this year, the company also acquired the AM business of Forward AM, which was formerly part of the chemical giant BASF. And over the past few years, it has also absorbed Origin (DLP), RPS (stereolithography), and Covestro\u2018s AM materials division.\nThe Nexa3D acquisition allows Stratasys to integrate ultra-fast resin printing IP and machines into its already sprawling product ecosystem, which includes FDM, PolyJet, SAF, SLA, and DLP technologies. The XiP Pro and its modular design may prove useful in production environments that Stratasys is targeting, such as dental labs, aerospace prototyping and end-use parts.\nThe Big Picture: Is Consolidation Here to Stay?\nThis is more than just another deal. It\u2019s a snapshot of how fast the industry is changing.\nVenture-backed startups, such as Nexa3D, have struggled to maintain momentum following the post-COVID boom. Meanwhile, publicly traded giants with stronger cash flows, such as Stratasys, are acquiring valuable technology at reduced prices.\nThe industry is moving from quick startup innovation to big companies taking over. The question is whether those bigger players can keep the same pace and creativity. The acquisition also supports a trend covered in a recent 3DPrint.com PRO article about how 2025 is turning out to be a big year for consolidation in AM, as company takeovers are changing how the industry is structured and how businesses compete.\nSnapshot: Nexa3D\u2019s Final Chapter\nFounded in 2016 by Avi Reichental\n-\nRaised roughly $55 million from investors like OurCrowd, Saudi Aramco Ventures\n-\nFlagship Products: XiP, XiP Pro (resin printers), QLS 820 (SLS)\n-\nPeak Momentum: 2021\u20132023, with global expansion and AddiFab acquisition\n-\nDecline: Layoffs and retreat from Formnext in late 2024; \u201csignificant funding challenges\u201d publicly admitted\n-\nFinal Moves: IP, inventory, and equipment sold to Stratasys in July 2025\n-\nRemaining support: iSQUARED AG offering transitional support\n-\nSubscribe to Our Email Newsletter\nStay up-to-date on all the latest news from the 3D printing industry and receive information and offers from third party vendors.\nPrint Services\nUpload your 3D Models and get them printed quickly and efficiently.\nYou May Also Like\n3D Printing News Briefs, June 28, 2025: Defense Accelerator, Surgical Models, & More\nIn this weekend\u2019s 3D Printing News Briefs, 3YOURMIND was selected to join an EU Defense Accelerator, and PTC has announced model-based definition (MBD) capabilities within Onshape.

            "Mexico ready to retaliate by hurting US farmers. Mexico is ready to hit the U.S. where it hurts: Corn.\nMexico is one of the top buyers of American corn in the world today. And Mexican senator Armando Rios Piter, who leads a congressional committee on foreign relations, says he will introduce a bill this week where Mexico will buy corn from Brazil and Argentina instead of the United States.\nIt's one of the first signs of potential concrete action from Mexico in response to President Trump's threats against the country.\n\"I'm going to send a bill for the corn that we are buying in the Midwest and...change to Brazil or Argentina,\" Rios Piter, 43, told told CNN's Leyla Santiago on Sunday at an anti-Trump protest in Mexico City.\nHe added: It's a \"good way to tell them that this hostile relationship has consequences, hope that it changes.\"\nAmerican corn goes into a lot of the country's food. In Mexico City, from fine dining restaurants to taco stands on the street, corn-based favorites like tacos can be found everywhere.\nRelated: Mexican farmer's daughter: NAFTA destroyed us\nAmerica is also the world's largest producer and exporter of corn. American corn shipments to Mexico have catapulted since NAFTA, a free trade deal signed between Mexico, America and Canada.\nAmerican farmers sent $2.4 billion of corn to Mexico in 2015, the most recent year of available data. In 1995, the year after NAFTA became law, corn exports to Mexico were a mere $391 million.\nExperts say such a bill would be very costly to U.S. farmers.\n\"If we do indeed see a trade war where Mexico starts buying from Brazil...we're going to see it affect the corn market and ripple out to the rest of the ag economy,\" says Darin Newsom, senior analyst at DTN, an agricultural management firm.\nRios Piter's bill is another sign of Mexico's willingness to respond to Trump's threats. Trump wants to make Mexico pay for a wall on the border, and he's threatened taxes on Mexican imports ranging from 20% to 35%.\nTrump also wants to renegotiate NAFTA. He blames it for a flood of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. A nonpartisan congressional research report found that not to be true.\nRelated: Mexico doubles down on Trump 'contingency plan'\nStill, Trump says he wants a better trade deal for the American worker -- though he hasn't said what a better deal looks like.\nAll sides signaled two weeks ago that negotiations would begin in May after a 90-day consultation period.\nBut Trump says if negotiations don't bear the deal he wants, he threatens to withdraw from NAFTA.\nSuch tough talk isn't received well by Mexican leaders like Rios Piter. He's not alone. Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said in January Mexico would respond \"immediately\" to any tariffs from Trump.\n\"It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature,\" Guajardo said Jan. 13 on a Mexican news show.\n--Shasta Darlington contributed reporting to this story",
            "EU and Mexico criticise Trump's proposed 30% tariff. EU and Mexico criticise Trump's proposed 30% tariff\nThe European Union (EU) and Mexico have expressed disappointment at US President Donald Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on their imports from 1 August.\nMexico criticised what it called Trump's \"unfair deal\" and insisted its sovereignty is non-negotiable, while the EU's chief, Ursula von der Leyen threatened to take \"proportionate countermeasures\", if needed. Both said they want to keep negotiating with the US.\nTrump has warned he would impose even higher import taxes if either of the US trading partners decided to retaliate.\nThis week Trump also announced new tariffs on goods from Japan, South Korea, Canada and Brazil from next month.\nIn the letter sent on Friday to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump wrote: \"We have had years to discuss our trading relationship with the European Union, and have concluded that we must move away from these long-term-large, and persistent, trade deficits, engendered by your tariff, and non-tariff, policies and trade barriers.\"\n\"Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from reciprocal,\" the letter added.\nIn his letters to the EU and Mexico, Trump warned that if either trade partner retaliated with import duties of their own against the US, he would hit back by raising tariffs by a similar percentage over and above the 30%.\nIn a pre-recorded interview with Fox News which aired on Saturday night, President Trump said some countries were \"very upset now\" but he insisted the tariffs meant \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" were \"pouring in\".\nThe EU has been a frequent target of Trump's criticism. On 2 April, he proposed a 20% tariff for goods from the bloc, as well as dozens of other trade partners. He then threatened to raise the EU import taxes to 50% as trade talks stalled.\nWashington and Brussels had hoped to reach an agreement before a deadline of 9 July, but there have been no announcements on progress.\nIn 2024, the US trade deficit with the bloc was $235.6bn (\u20ac202bn; \u00a3174bn), according to the office of the US trade representative.\nVon der Leyen said the EU remained ready \"to continue working towards an agreement by Aug 1\".\n\"We will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,\" von der Leyen said.\n\"Few economies in the world match the European Union's level of openness and adherence to fair trading practices,\" her statement added.\nThe 27-member EU said earlier this week it hoped to agree a deal with Washington before 1 August.\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron said he was in \"very strong disapproval\" of Trump's announcement.\nIf no agreement is reached, the French leader suggested the EU plan \"speeding up the preparation of credible countermeasures\".\nBernd Lange, the head of the European Parliament's trade committee, described Trump's move as \"a slap in the face for the negotiations\".\nHe said that it was \"no way to deal with a key trading partner,\" adding said Brussels should enact countermeasures as soon as Monday.\nSome EU leaders called for as deal with Trump. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said in a statement she trusted \"a fair agreement\" could be reached, adding: \"It would make no sense to trigger a trade war between the two sides of the Atlantic.\"\nDutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said on social media that the EU \"must remain united and resolute\" in its aim to reach a \"mutually beneficial\" deal with the US.\nGermany's Association of the Automotive Industry warned about the prospect of rising costs for German carmakers and suppliers, and said it was \"regrettable that there is a threat of a further escalation of the trade conflict\".\nIn his letter to Mexico's leader, Trump said the country had not done enough to stop North America becoming a \"Narco-Trafficking Playground\".\n\"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,\" Trump added.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed confidence that a deal could be reached.\n\"We believe, based on what our colleagues discussed yesterday, that we will reach an agreement with the USA and that we will, of course, achieve better conditions,\" Sheinbaum said on Saturday.\n\"We are clear on what we can work with the USA and we are clear on what we cannot,\" she added. \"And there is something that is never negotiated, ever, and that is the sovereignty of our country\".\nEarlier on Saturday, the Mexican economy and foreign ministries called Trump's tariffs an \"unfair deal\" in a joint statement.\nTrump's letter did not say if Mexico goods traded within the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement would be exempt from the proposed 1 August tariff hikes, as the White House said would be the case with Canada.\nEarlier this week, the White House sent a letter to Canada threatening a 35% tariff.\nAs of Saturday, the Trump administration has now proposed tariff conditions on 24 countries and the EU.\nOn 12 April, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro set a goal to secure \"90 deals in 90 days\".\nSo far, the president has announced the outlines of two such pacts with the United Kingdom and Vietnam amid ongoing negotiations.",
            "Trump announces 30% tariffs against Mexico and European Union beginning Aug. 1. Aamer Madhani, Associated Press\nAamer Madhani, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nBRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Saturday announced he\u2019s levying tariffs of 30% against the European Union and Mexico starting August 1, a move that could cause massive upheaval between the United States and two of its biggest trade partners.\nTrump detailed the planned tariffs in letters posted to his social media account. They are part of an announcement blitz by Trump of new tariffs with allies and foes alike, a bedrock of his 2024 campaign that he said would set the foundation for reviving a U.S. economy that he claims has been ripped off by other nations for decades.\nREAD MORE: Trump\u2019s tariff blitz produces few trade deals but lots of uncertainty\nIn his letter to Mexico\u2019s leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump acknowledged that the country has been helpful in stemming the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl into the United States. But he said the country has not done enough to stop North America from turning into a \u201cNarco-Trafficking Playground.\u201d\n\u201cMexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,\u201d Trump added.\nTrump in his letter to the European Union said that the U.S. trade deficit was a national security threat.\n\u201cWe have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and we have concluded we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent, Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies, and Trade Barriers,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter to the EU. \u201cOur relationship has been, unfortunately, far from Reciprocal.\u201d\nEuropean Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded by noting the bloc\u2019s \u201ccommitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership.\u201d\n\u201cAt the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,\u201d von der Leyen said in a statement.\nVon de Leyen added that the EU remains committed to continuing negotiations with the U.S. and coming to an agreement before Aug. 1. Trade ministers from EU countries are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss trade relations with the U.S., as well as with China.\nThe Mexican government said it was informed on Friday during high-level talks with U.S. State Department officials that the Trump letter was coming.\nThe delegation told Trump officials at the meeting it disagreed with the decision and considered it \u201cunfair treatment,\u201d according to Mexican government statement\nTrump, as he has in previous letters, warned that his administration would further raise tariffs if the EU attempts to hike its own tariffs on the United States.\nWith the reciprocal tariffs, Trump is effectively blowing up the rules governing world trade. For decades, the United States and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay round. Countries could set their own tariffs \u2013 but under the \u201cmost favored nation\u2019\u2019 approach, they couldn\u2019t charge one country more than they charged another.\nThe Italian government said on Saturday it continues to \u201cclosely monitor\u201d the ongoing trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States, fully supporting the EU Commission\u2019s efforts.\n\u201cWe trust in the goodwill of all stakeholders to reach a fair agreement that can strengthen the West as a whole, given that\u2014particularly in the current scenario\u2014it would make no sense to trigger a trade war between the two sides of the Atlantic,\u201d Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s office said in a statement.\nThe Mexico tariff, if it goes into effect, could replace the 25% tariffs on Mexican goods that do not comply with the existing U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.\nTrump\u2019s letter did not address if USMCA-compliant goods would still be exempt from the Mexico tariffs after Aug. 1, as the White House said would be the case with Canada. Trump sent a letter to Canada earlier this week threatening a 35% tariff hike.\nWith Saturday\u2019s letters, Trump has now issued tariff conditions on 24 countries and the 27-member European Union.\nThe European Union\u2019s chief trade negotiator said earlier this week that a trade deal to avert higher tariffs on European goods imported to the U.S. could be reached \u201ceven in the coming days.\u201d Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France on Wednesday that the EU had been spared the increased tariffs contained in the letters Trump sent on Monday, and that an extension of talks would provide \u201cadditional space to reach a satisfactory conclusion.\u201d\nThe bloc collectively sells more to the U.S. than any other country. U.S. goods imports from the EU topped $553 billion in 2022, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\nTrump on April 2 proposed a 20% tariff for EU goods and then threatened to raise that to 50% after negotiations did not move as fast as he would have liked. Sefcovic did not mention any tariff figures.\nThe higher tariffs as well as any EU retaliation had been suspended as the two sides negotiate. However the base rate of 10% for most trade partners as well as higher rates of 25% on autos and 50% on steel and aluminum had gone into effect.\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and president of the center-right American Action Forum, said the letters were evidence that serious trade talks were not taking place over the past three months. He stressed that nations were instead talking amongst themselves about how to minimize their own exposure to the U.S. economy and Trump.\n\u201cThey\u2019re spending time talking to each other about what the future is going to look like, and we\u2019re left out,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said.\nHe added that Trump was using the letters to demand attention, but, \u201cIn the end, these are letters to other countries about taxes he\u2019s going to levy on his citizens.\u201d\nIf the tariffs do indeed take effect, the potential impact on Europe could be vast.\nThe value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat\nEurope\u2019s biggest exports to the U.S. were pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments and wine and spirits.\nLamberto Frescobaldi, president of the Union of Italian Wines trade association, said Trump\u2019s move could lead to \u201ca virtual embargo\u201d of his country\u2019s wine.\n\u201cA single letter was enough to write the darkest chapter in relations between two historic Western allies,\u201d Frescobaldi said. \u201cAt this point, our fate and that of hundreds of thousands of jobs are tied to the extra time, which will be crucial, because it is unthinkable to be able to sell these volumes of wine elsewhere in the short term.\u201d\nTrump has complained about the EU\u2019s 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more goods from European businesses than the other way around.\nHowever, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.\nThe U.S. services surplus took the nation\u2019s trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.\nBefore Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU\u2019s averaged 1.35% for American products.\nAP writers Josh Boak in Washington, Angela Charlton in Paris, Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, Dave McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, and Giada Zampano in Rome contributed reporting.\nNow is your chance to help us shape future coverage of the stories that matter most to you.\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

            "Officer Jumps Into The Water, Fights Off Career Criminal Trying To Flee | News Radio 1470. In a dramatic incident on August 5, a New York City police officer leapt into the East Rockaway Inlet to arrest a suspected car thief, Matthew Swafford, in Queens. The NYPD released footage showing the officer, part of the 101 Precinct, removing her gear and jumping into the water to apprehend Swafford, who had fled by jumping off a dock.\nThe officer jumped into the water, where she engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle with Swafford, described as a career criminal with a history of vehicle thefts. Despite the suspect's attempts to evade capture, the officer, with assistance from her male colleague, successfully brought Swafford to shore, where he was taken into custody.\nThe arrest followed a report from the Rockaway Nassau Safety Patrol about a stolen 2025 Honda sedan. Swafford, who has a lengthy criminal record, now faces multiple charges, including Grand Larceny Auto, Criminal Possession of Stolen Property, and Obstructing Governmental Administration. He was arraigned and held on $15,000 cash bail or a $45,000 bond.\nSwafford is due back in court on October 22 for this case, with another appearance scheduled for August 21 related to prior arrests. His criminal history includes charges of first-degree robbery and assault on a police officer.\nYou can watch the bodycam footage below:",

            "Swedish bodyguards' fitness app data reveals private locations of royal family. Sweden\u2019s national security service said it was investigating reports that data shared by bodyguards on a fitness app had exposed the private locations of some of the country\u2019s most powerful figures.\n\u201cThe Swedish Security Police take the information very seriously,\u201d a spokesperson for S\u00e4kerhetspolisen (S\u00c4PO) wrote in a statement shared Thursday. \u201cThis is a matter of data that could be used to gather information about the activities of our Service.\u201d\n\u201cWe are now in the process of investigating what effect this might have had,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nIt comes after the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported earlier this week that seven members of the security service were sharing details of their running and cycling routes on the fitness app Strava, inadvertently revealing the locations of the king and queen\u2019s personal vacations.\nThat included trips to a private island in the Seychelles, the mountain village of Storlien in northern Sweden and, most recently, to a luxury villa on the French Riviera in June.\nEarlier reports from the newspaper also found that the guards\u2019 workout data on the fitness app had revealed the private details of Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on at least 35 occasions, including his running routes, trips abroad and private address.\nOther information uploaded to Strava was also linked to former Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and the leader of the Sweden Democrats party, Jimmie \u00c5kesson.\n\u201cDignitaries that our Service is responsible for protecting are subject to several layers of protection, where their close protection by bodyguards is one layer,\u201d the S\u00c4PO spokesperson said in their statement, adding that the security agency was aware of the risks presented by the leaked information.\n\u201cOur Service is now taking the necessary steps to ensure that our procedures are followed closely, so that this does not happen again,\u201d the statement said.\nThe Swedish Royal Court declined to comment on the reports, citing official policy on security-related matters.\nThis is not the first time that publicly available data on Strava has breached official security protocols.\nIn 2017, a global heat map published by the app inadvertently revealed the location of U.S. military bases in Syria, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom. In 2022, the app\u2019s features enabled the identification and tracking of security personnel working at military bases in Israel.\nAn earlier investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde in October 2024 also found the app had revealed the movements and locations of other world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and then-President Joe Biden.\nA spokesperson for Strava, whose name means \u201cstrive\u201d in Swedish, told NBC News that there was no leak or breach of user data in the latest instance.\n\u201cUsers can also control the visibility of their activities, their routes, and whether each activity is public or private,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe expect Strava users working in sensitive professions to leverage the privacy settings available.\u201d",
            "Swedish PM\u2019s private address revealed by Strava data shared by bodyguards. Secret service bodyguards have been accused of jeopardising the Swedish prime minister\u2019s safety over several years by sharing details of their running and cycling routes on the fitness app Strava.\nUlf Kristersson\u2019s bodyguards appear to have inadvertently revealed his location, routes and movements \u2013 including details of hotels and his private addresses \u2013 by uploading their workouts to the app, making them publicly available.\nThe Dagens Nyheter newspaper tracked more than 1,400 training activities carried out by seven bodyguards who have protected people in government positions over the past year. Their findings covered locations across the world \u2013 including close to the Ukrainian border in Poland, the seafront in Tel Aviv, ski slopes in the Alps, Central Park in New York, military bases in Mali and an island in the Seychelles.\nAt least 35 times bodyguards shared information that directly linked to the prime minister and his regular locations including his private home, which is supposed to be kept secret.\nThe routes also reportedly revealed Kristersson\u2019s own running routes and locations of overnight trips abroad, including a private family trip to \u00c5land, an autonomous region of Finland, in October 2024.\nMovement patterns are understood to show how bodyguards move around the government offices in Stockholm and Harpsund, the prime minister\u2019s country retreat in S\u00f6rmland. The latest run from Harpsund was reportedly shared by a bodyguard just a few weeks ago.\nIn June 2024, when Kristersson visited Bod\u00f8 in Norway for a meeting with Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, the Norwegian prime minister, and Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president, one of the bodyguards reportedly posted a run on Strava. A few months later, Kristersson posted a picture on Instagram of the three leaders running together.\nThe sensitive information leaked on Strava was also found to involve other high-profile members of Swedish society, including the royal family, the leader of the Social Democrats and former prime minister Magdalena Andersson and the Sweden Democrats leader, Jimmie \u00c5kesson.\nIt is the latest in a string of security scandals faced by Kristersson\u2019s government after high-profile issues involving its attempts to hire a national security adviser.\nOpen profiles on Strava have been a problem for security forces across the world.\nIn 2023 a former Russian submarine commander was killed reportedly with the help of his open Strava profile and last year it was revealed bodyguards to several world leaders were sharing confidential information on the app.\nIn 2017, Strava was accused of giving away the location and staffing of military bases and spy outposts around the world by publishing a map that showed all of its users\u2019 activity.\nSweden\u2019s security service, S\u00e4po, said they were taking the findings \u201cvery seriously\u201d and were investigating.\nA S\u00e4po spokesperson said: \u201cThis is information that could be used to map the activities of the security service. In what way it could have had an impact we are now investigating.\n\u201cIn this context it is also important to know that protection of our protected people is comprised of several layers, of which bodyguard protection is one. In our work we assume that certain information can be known in advance and measure protection based on that.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cThe security service is taking measures to prevent this from happening again.\u201d\nThe prime minister\u2019s office and the government office declined to comment. A government office spokesperson said they \u201cdo not comment on security surrounding current or former prime ministers or cabinet ministers\u201d, referring all questions to S\u00e4po.\nStrava did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

If they get such an exemption before the new year, they can probably start schools in Oslo as early as autumn 2014. They have so far been hampered by the fact that the law only mentions religious schools , and not schools based on humanism belief.\n\u2013 We have a hope to start as early as next fall, and hope to be like a small village school in Oslo, says Rector Ole Martin Moen.\nAlso the major player Sonans Academy see a bright future for them in the new government\u2019s term. CEO Kjetil Eide says Trondheim and Troms\u00f8 are most appropriate for new schools in their plans. Today, Sonans academy have schools in six different cities .\n\u2013 We will open new schools, and wishes to be represented in more places than today, says Eide.\nNorwegian Science and Independent Schools National Association has previously estimated that Norway can get 250 new private schools in ten years under a new government. They are clear that they do not want schools that do not meet a \u201d social need \u201c.\nFacts About NORWAY\u2019S PRIVATE EDUCATION\nThere are many independent schools, free- schools and private schools in all the Nordic countries, but their proportion and distribution changes considerably from country to country\nIn the 1980s, the proportion of independent private schools for example was higher in Norway than in Sweden, but the reforms and legislative changes have carried Sweden in front of Norway. The number of Swedish free schools has tripled in the last 10-15 years, and they account for 15 percent of all schools. In the same period, the number of private schools was doubled.\nAlso in Norway there was a significant increase in the number of private schools until around 2005. In fact, the increase in the number of private schools from 2000 to 2005 was over 70 percent. However, there are currently only 159 private schools in Norway \u2013 and they make just 5 percent of all schools in the country. In Denmark, there has been a much higher proportion of independent private schools than it has traditionally been in Norway and Sweden. Today, about 25 percent of the Danish primary schools are these kinds of private institutions.\nRegulations about Private Schools\nTo be approved as a private school, there is also a requirement to have more than 15 pupils at the school. If a school has fewer than 15 students in three consecutive school years, approval is canceled. For schools in countryside, this limit is ten students.\nIt is also not allowed to make profit in operating a private school in Norway. Private law \u00a7 6-3 states that schools are still entitled to collect tuition, and it is the school board which determines amount of tuition. However, this right is limited by private Act \u00a7 6-2, which sets an upper limit on how much schools can charge. Eventhough some parties such as H\u00f8yre and KrF suggest freedom of establishment and full fiancial support of private schools, private schools today can receive 85 percent of the grant that public schools receive.\nWhat Is Universal Way To Purchase Cheap Remedies And Get To Know More About Real Impact of Fraudulent Medicines"

That makes them one of the most popular kinds of rewards cards because it\u2019s like getting an extra discount on every purchase.\nWhen looking for a cash back credit card you will want to keep in mind, however, that the biggest factors impacting any credit card are those that affect your interest rate and any standard fees and charges. If you get a card with too high of an interest rate or too expensive of an annual fee, it might undermine the whole point of trying to receive extra cash. The cash you get back with your cash back credit card should be viewed as an added perk. In other words, the best cashback credit card for you should allow you to enjoy that perk based on its fundamental ability to provide cash rewards in a relatively short amount of time.\nCheck our expert ratings, compare cards, and locate the top cash back credit cards which deliver the best all-around benefits \u2013 moderately low interest rate, universal cash back option and potentially one with no cap on the amount of cash back that can be earned. Most cash back credit cards will generally offer anywhere from 1% to 5% cash back \u2013 and will have guidelines regarding how much cash you can earn during a given timeframe. But if you pick your card wisely and then use it responsibly a cash back credit card is just like having an automatic savings plan or piggy bank tied to your purchase activity."

            "Quality of scientific papers questioned as academics \u2018overwhelmed\u2019 by the millions published. It was, at first glance, just another scientific paper, one of the millions published every year, and destined to receive little to no attention outside the arcane field of biological signalling in stem cells destined to become sperm.\nBut soon after the paper was published online, in the journal Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, it found a global audience. Not all of the readers came for the science.\nThe reason for its broader appeal? An eye-catching image, which depicted a rat sitting upright with an unfeasibly large penis and too many testicles. Its body parts were labelled with nonsense words such as \u201ctesttomcels\u201d and \u201cdck\u201d.\nRather than fading into academic obscurity, the paper soon became the subject of mainstream media mockery. \u201cScientific journal publishes AI-generated rat with gigantic penis\u201d, reported Vice News. \u201cIt might be considered an AI cock-up on a massive scale,\u201d intoned the Daily Telegraph.\nThe images had indeed been generated by artificial intelligence (AI), but that was permitted under the journal\u2019s rules. The problem was the authors had not verified the accuracy of the AI-generated material. Neither the journal\u2019s staff nor its expert reviewers caught the glaring errors. Three days after publication, the paper was retracted.\nWhat separates the anecdote from other stories of AI mishap is the glimpse it provides into wider problems at the heart of an important industry. Scientific publishing records, and plays gatekeeper to, information that shapes the world, and on which life and death decisions are made.\nThe first scientific journal was published by the Royal Society in 1665. The maiden issue of Philosophical Transactions told readers about a spot on Jupiter, a peculiar lead ore from Germany, and a \u201cmonstrous\u201d calf encountered by a butcher in Lymington.\nSince then, journals have been the chronicle of serious scientific thought. Newton, Einstein and Darwin all posited historic theories there; Marie Curie coined the term \u201cradioactivity\u201d in a journal.\nBut journals are more than historical records. Groundbreaking research in critical fields from genetics and AI to climate science and space exploration is routinely published in the growing number of journals, charting humanity\u2019s progress. Such studies steer drug development, shape medical practice, underpin government policies and inform geopolitical strategies, even estimates of fatalities in bloody military campaigns, such as Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza.\nThe consequential nature of journals, and potential threats to the quality and reliability of the work they publish, have prompted leading scientists to sound the alarm. Many argue that scientific publishing is broken, unsustainable and churning out too many papers that border on worthless.\nThe warning from Nobel laureates and other academics comes as the Royal Society prepares to release a major review of scientific publishing at the end of the summer. It will focus on the \u201cdisruptions\u201d the industry faces in the next 15 years.\nSir Mark Walport, the former government chief scientist and chair of the Royal Society\u2019s publishing board, said nearly every aspect of scientific publishing was being transformed by technology, while deeply ingrained incentives for researchers and publishers often favoured quantity over quality.\n\u201cVolume is a bad driver,\u201d Walport said. \u201cThe incentive should be quality, not quantity. It\u2019s about re-engineering the system in a way that encourages good research from beginning to end.\u201d\nToday, after the dramatic expansion of science and publishing practices pioneered by the press baron Robert Maxwell, tens of thousands of scientific journals put out millions of papers annually. Analysis for the Guardian by Gordon Rogers, the lead data scientist at Clarivate, an analytics company, shows that the number of research studies indexed on the firm\u2019s Web of Science database rose by 48%, from 1.71m to 2.53m, between 2015 and 2024. Tot up all the other kinds of scientific articles and the total reaches 3.26m.\nIn a landmark paper last year, Dr Mark Hanson at the University of Exeter described how scientists were \u201cincreasingly overwhelmed\u201d by the volume of articles being published. Keeping up with the truly original work is only one issue. The demands of peer review \u2013 where academics volunteer time to vet each other\u2019s work \u2013 are now so intense that journal editors can struggle to find willing experts.\nAccording to one recent study, in 2020 alone, academics globally spent more than 100 million hours peer reviewing papers for journals. For experts in the US, the time spent reviewing that year amounted to more than $1.5bn of free labour.\n\u201cEverybody agrees that the system is kind of broken and unsustainable,\u201d said Venki Ramakrishnan, a former president of the Royal Society and a Nobel laureate at the Medical Research Council\u2019s Laboratory of Molecular Biology. \u201cBut nobody really knows what to do about it.\u201d\nIn the \u201cpublish or perish\u201d world of academia, where and how often a researcher publishes, and how many citations their papers receive, are career-defining. The rationale is reasonable: the best scientists often publish in the best journals. But the system can lead researchers to chase metrics. They might run easier studies, hype up eye-catching results, or publish their findings over more papers than necessary. \u201cThey\u2019re incentivised by their institute or government funding agencies to put out papers with their names on them, even if they have nothing new or useful to say,\u201d said Hanson.\nScientific publishing has a unique business model. Scientists, who are typically funded by taxpayers or charities, perform the research, write it up and review each other\u2019s work to maintain quality standards. Journals manage the peer review and publish the articles. Many journals charge for access through subscriptions, but publishers are steadily embracing open access models, where authors can pay up to \u00a310,000 to have a single paper made freely available online.\nAccording to a recent analysis, between 2015 and 2018, researchers globally paid more than $1bn in open access fees to the big five academic publishers, Elsevier, Sage, Springer Nature, Taylor & Francis, and Wiley.\nOpen access helps disseminate research more broadly. Because it is not behind a paywall, the work can be read by anyone, anywhere. But the model incentivises commercial publishers to run more papers. Some launch new journals to attract more studies. Others solicit papers for vast numbers of special issues.\nFor one Swiss publisher, MDPI, special issues of journals are a major income stream. A single MDPI journal, the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is inviting submissions to more than 3,000 special issues. The publication fee, or article processing charge (APC), for one article is \u00a32,600. As of last year, the Swiss National Science Foundation refuses to pay publication fees for special issues amid concerns over quality. MDPI did not respond to an interview request.\nUnhelpful incentives around academic publishing are blamed for record levels of retractions, the rise in predatory journals, which publish anything for a fee, and the emergence of AI-written studies and paper mills, which sell fake papers to unscrupulous researchers to submit to journals. All contaminate the scientific literature and risk damaging trust in science. Earlier this month, Taylor & Francis paused submissions to its journal Bioengineered while editors investigated 1,000 papers that bore signs of being manipulated or coming from paper mills.\nWhile fraud and fakery are important problems, Hanson is more concerned about the glut of research papers that do little to progress scientific knowledge. \u201cThe far greater danger by volume and by total numbers is the stuff that\u2019s genuine but uninteresting and uninformative,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s now possible to publish a peer-reviewed article in a journal that has practically nothing new to contribute. These papers are a major drain on the system in terms of the money used to publish and pay for them, the time that\u2019s spent writing them and the time that\u2019s spent reviewing them.\u201d\nProf Andre Geim, a Nobel laureate at the University of Manchester, said: \u201cI do believe that researchers publish too many useless papers and, more importantly, we aren\u2019t flexible enough to abandon declining subjects where little new can be learned. Unfortunately, after reaching a critical mass, research communities become self-perpetuating due to the emotional and financial interests of those involved.\u201d\nHanson believes the problem is not open access and APCs per se, but for-profit publishers that seek to publish as many papers as possible. He believes the strain on academic publishing could be substantially alleviated if funding agencies stipulated that the work they support must be published in non-profit journals.\nHannah Hope, the open research lead at the Wellcome Trust, said in general, research that was good enough to fund should be published, and that greater investment in science, particularly beyond North America and Europe, had contributed to the rise in scientific papers. But she agreed that peer review might be used more selectively. \u201cI\u2019m sure peer review does lead to improvement in research. Is it always worth the time that goes into it? I think it\u2019s something that we should be questioning as a field, and whether peer review happens in the current format on everything,\u201d she said.\nRitu Dhand, the chief scientific officer at publisher Springer Nature, rejected the narrative of \u201cgreedy journal publishers\u201d making money by publishing poor-quality papers and pointed to the fact that the research landscape has gone through a \u201cradical transformation\u201d, quadrupling in size over the past 25 years. Long dominated by western countries, research is now far more global, and led by China rather than the US.\n\u201cIs the solution not to allow the rest of the world to publish?\u201d she said. \u201cWe live in a digital world. Surely, it doesn\u2019t matter how many papers are being published.\u201d She sees solutions in better filtering, search tools and alerts so researchers can find the work that really matters to them, and a global expansion of peer reviewers to absorb the demand.\nWhile technology poses fresh challenges for academic publishers, Ramakrishnan agreed that it may be the answer to some of the problems. \u201cEventually these papers will all be written by an AI agent and then another AI agent will actually read them, analyse them and produce a summary for humans. I actually think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
            "Opinion: Proposed cuts could have \u2018catastrophic effect,\u2019 110 biomedical, health sciences industry leaders tell Congress. As leaders of United States companies positioned in the biomedical/health sciences landscape, we are well aware that our companies are but one component of an expansive and interconnected scientific ecosystem requiring federal, industry, and academic partnership.\nGovernment funding of research and industry work in the life sciences plays a critical role in this ecosystem, creating a cycle of innovation and economic growth that improves the health and well-being of the nation\u2019s citizens and helps to ensure that the United States leads in critical areas such as therapeutic development, advanced biomanufacturing, AI-informed technologies, and more.\nGiven the currently proposed cuts to federal funding for scientific research, including extensive cuts to the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation in the fiscal year 2026 budget, we believe it is imperative \u2014 and urgent \u2014 to articulate that federal funding for scientific research is essential to the sustainability of the biomedical industry, maintaining the United States\u2019 technological edge, and crucial for this country\u2019s ability to protect and strengthen our economic and national security.\nDamaging reductions in research funding provided to academic and federal scientists will immediately hurt the biotechnology sector in six key ways:\n1. Elimination of many graduate student training programs and postdoctoral research positions will reduce the pipeline of highly trained scientists we rely on to perform the work within our companies.\n2. Cancellation of federal grants and contracts that directly support companies (e.g., small business grants, service contracts, technology development contracts) will reduce our ability to develop innovative products.\n3. Elimination of numerous subcontracts to our companies to perform services required for research (e.g., development of assays for understanding, diagnosing, and treating disease; supply of specialized research equipment; clinical trial support; etc.) will delay the introduction of transformative innovations to the American public.\n4. Delays in basic and clinical research advances that create a pipeline for research and development at our companies.\n5. Diminished resources for new spinoff/startup companies emerging directly from academic research.\n6. Reductions in purchase orders for research supplies, reagents, personal protective equipment, etc., required for conducting scientific research will decrease revenues and slow growth.\nWe together state that a reduction in federal research funding on the scale currently contemplated for fiscal year 2026 will have a catastrophic effect on the advancement of biomedical and biotechnology capabilities in the United States. Continued and robust federal funding of scientific research is required to preserve the health of the U.S. scientific ecosystem, allowing the U.S. to continue to lead the world in the advancement of scientific innovation, knowledge, and health.\nThe views expressed here are our own and not necessarily those of our companies.\nSincerely,\nCheri Ackerman, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, Concerto Biosciences\nSrini Akkaraju, Managing General Partner, Samsara BioCapital\nAnne Altmeyer, former Chief Executive Officer, TigaTx\nJodi Andrews, Chief Executive Officer, ProTrials Research, Inc.\nInger M.

A generation of scientific talent is at the brink of being lost to overseas competitors by the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the National Science Foundation (NSF), with unprecedented political interference at the agency jeopardizing the future of US industries and economic growth, according to a Guardian investigation.\nThe gold standard peer-reviewed process used by the NSF to support cutting-edge, high-impact science is being undermined by the chaotic cuts to staff, programs and grants, and by meddling by the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge), according to multiple current and former NSF employees who spoke with the Guardian.\nThe scientists warn that Trump\u2019s assault on diversity in science is already eroding the quality of fundamental research funded at the NSF, the premier federal investor in basic science and engineering, which threatens to derail advances in tackling existential threats to food, water and biodiversity in the US.\n\u201cBefore Trump, the review process was based on merit and impact. Now, it\u2019s like rolling the dice, because a Doge person has the final say,\u201d said one current program officer. \u201cThere has never in the history of NSF been anything like this. It\u2019s disgusting what we\u2019re being instructed to do.\u201d\nAnother program officer said: \u201cThe exact details of the extra step is opaque but I can say with high confidence that people from Doge or its proxies are scrutinizing applications with absolutely devastating consequences. The move amounts to the US willingly conceding global supremacy to competitors like China in biological, social and physical sciences. It is a mind-boggling own goal.\u201d\nThe NSF, founded in 1950, is the only federal agency that funds fundamental research across all fields of science and engineering, and which over the years has contributed to major breakthroughs in organ transplants, gene technology, AI, smartphones and the internet, extreme weather and other hazard warning systems, American sign language, cybersecurity and even the language app Duolingo.\nIn normal times, much of the NSF budget ($9bn in 2024-25) is allocated to research institutions after projects undergo a rigorous three-step review process \u2013 beginning with the program officer, an expert in the field, who ensures the proposed study fits in with the agency\u2019s priorities. The program officer convenes an expert panel to evaluate the proposal on two statutory criteria \u2013 intellectual merit and broader impacts on the nation and people \u2013 which under the NSF\u2019s legal mandate includes broadening participation of individuals, institutions, and geographic regions in Stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields.\nApplications from across the country which are greenlighted by the program officer are almost always funded, though may be subject to tweaks after revision by the division director before the grants directorate allocates the budget.\nThat was before Trump. Now, Doge personnel can veto any study \u2013 without explanation, the Guardian has confirmed.\n\u201cWe are under pressure to only fund proposals that fit the new narrow priorities even if they did not review as well as others,\u201d said one current program officer. \u201cThe NSF\u2019s gold standard review process has 100% been compromised.\u201d\nResearch aimed at addressing the unequal impact of the climate crisis and other environmental hazards is particularly vulnerable, according to several sources. New proposals are also being screened for any direct reference or indirect connection to diversity, equity or inclusion (DEI).\n\u201cNSF is being asked to make science racist again \u2013 which contradicts evidence that shows that diversity of ideas is good for science and good for innovation. We are missing things when only white males do science,\u201d said one program officer.\nIn addition to Doge interfering in new proposals, at least 1,653 active NSF research grants authorized on their merits have so far been abruptly cancelled \u2013 abandoned midway through the project, according to Grant Watch, a non-profit tracker of federal science and health research grants canceled under Trump.\nMultiple NSF scientists who oversee a diverse range of NSF programs described the grant cancellations as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, \u201carbitrary\u201d and a \u201ccolossal waste of taxpayer money\u201d.\nAlmost 60% of the projects abandoned are in states which voted for Joe Biden in 2024, Guardian analysis found. Meanwhile more than one in nine cancelled grants \u2013 12% of the total \u2013 were at Harvard University, which Trump has particularly targeted since coming to power in January.\nIn addition, studies deemed to be violating Trump\u2019s executive orders on DEI and environmental justice \u2013 regardless of their scientific merit, potential impact or urgency \u2013 are being abruptly terminated at particularly high rates.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for the NSF and other federal research agencies to shift focus to reflect a new administration\u2019s priorities. Amid mounting evidence on the crucial role of diversity in innovation and science, Biden priorities included increased effort to tackle inequalities across the Stem workforce \u2013 and a commitment to target underserved communities most affected by the climate crisis and environmental harms.\nTrump\u2019s priorities are AI, quantum information science, nuclear, biotech and translational research.\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal that a new administration will emphasize some areas, de-emphasize others, and we would gradually transition to new priorities. During the George W Bush administration there were shenanigans around climate change, but it was nothing like this kind of meddling in the scientific review process. You never just throw proposals in the garbage can,\u201d said one current NSF staffer.\n\u201cOur mandate is to advance science and innovation. And we just can\u2019t do that if we\u2019re not thinking about diversifying the Stem workforce. We don\u2019t have enough people or diversity of thought without broadening participation \u2013 which is part of the NSF mission mandate,\u201d said a former program officer from the Directorate for Computer and Information Science who recently accepted a buyout.\n\u201cIt has been soul-sucking to see projects that went through the review process being changed or terminated over and over again,\u201d they added.\nThe Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to 300% over the past 75 years, meaning US taxpayers have gotten back between $1.50 and $3 for every dollar invested.\nTrump\u2019s big, beautiful bill calls for a 56% cut to the current $9bn NSF budget, as well as a 73% reduction in staff and fellowships \u2013 with graduate students among the hardest hit.\nLast week, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud) announced that it will be moving into the NSF headquarters in Virginia over the course of the next two years. The shock announcement \u2013 which did not include any plans on relocating more than 1,800 NSF employees \u2013 has triggered speculation that the administration eventually plans to defund the agency entirely.\nFor now, program officers are also being instructed to return research proposals to scientists and institutions \u201cwithout review\u201d \u2013 regardless of merit and despite having been submitted in response to specific NSF solicitations to address gaps in scientific and engineering knowledge around some of the most pressing concerns in the US. This includes projects that have in fact undergone review, and others which can no longer be processed due to staff and program cuts, according to multiple NSF sources.\nIn one case, a 256-page proposal by scientists at four public universities to use ancient DNA records to better forecast biodiversity loss as the planet warms was apparently archived without consideration.\nIn an email seen by the Guardian, the NSF told Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist and principal investigator (lead scientist) based at the University of Maine, that all proposals submitted to the Biology Integration Institute program were returned without review. A second email said their specific proposal had been \u201cadministratively screened\u201d and the area of proposed study was \u201cinappropriate for NSF funding\u201d.\nAn estimated 40% of animals and 34% of plants across the US are currently at risk. The proposed study would have used an emerging technology to extract ancient DNA from lake sediments, ice cores and cave deposits to better understand which species fared better or worse when the planet naturally warmed thousands of years ago \u2013 in order to help model and protect biodiversity in the face of human-made climate change.\nGill told the Guardian the team took great care to avoid any reference to DEI or climate change. The grant would have created much-needed research capacity in the US, which is lagging behind Europe in this field.\n\u201cAncient DNA records allow you to reconstruct entire ecosystems at a very high level. This is a very new and emerging science, and grants like this help catalyze the research and reinvest in US infrastructure and workforce in ways that have huge returns on investments for their local economies. It\u2019s an absolute slap in the face that the proposal was returned without review,\u201d Gill said.\nIn another example, two academic institutions chosen to receive prestigious $15m grants for translational research \u2013 a Trump priority \u2013 after a 30-month cross-agency review process led by the engineering directorate and involving hundreds of people will not be honored.\nThe proposals selected for the award through merit review will be returned without review for being \u201cinappropriate for NSF funding\u201d, the Guardian understands.\n\u201cThis is complex, very high-impact translation science to achieve sustainability across cities and regions and industries \u2026 we\u2019re being instructed to put the principal investigators off, but nothing\u2019s going to get funded because there\u2019s DEI in this program,\u201d said an NSF employee with knowledge of the situation.\nMeanwhile scores of other proposals approved on merit by program officers are disappearing into a \u201cblack box\u201d \u2013 languishing for weeks or months without a decision or explanation, which was leading some to \u201cself-censor\u201d, according to NSF staff.\n\u201cIt\u2019s either NSF staff self-censoring to make sure they don\u2019t get into trouble, or it is censorship by somebody inserted in the scientific review process from Doge. Either way it\u2019s a political step, and therefore problematic,\u201d said Anne Marie Schmoltner, a program officer in the chemistry division who retired in February after 30 years in the agency.\nIn addition to distributing funds to seasoned researchers, the NSF supports students and up-and-coming scientists and engineers through fellowships, research opportunities and grants.\nThis next generation of talent is being hit particularly hard under Trump, who is attempting to impose sweeping restrictions on visas and travel bans on scores of countries. The proposed 2026 budget includes funding for only 21,400 under- and postgraduate students nationwide \u2013 a 75% fall on this year.\nLike many scientists across the country, Gill, the paleoecologist, is not accepting new graduate students this fall due to funding uncertainty. \u201cThat\u2019s a whole generation of young scientists who see no pathway into the field for them. I cannot stress enough how deeply upsetting and demoralizing these cuts are to a community of people who only ever wanted to solve problems and be of use.\u201d\nYet the NSF student pipeline provides experts for the oil and gas, mining, chemical, big tech and other industries which support Trump, in addition to academic and government-funded agencies.\n\u201cIndustry is working on optimizing what they\u2019re doing right now, whereas NSF is looking 10, 20 years down the road. The US wants a global, robust economy and for that you need innovation, and for innovation you need the fundamental research funded by the NSF,\u201d said Schmoltner.\nThe NSF declined to comment, referring instead to the agency website last updated in April which states: \u2018The principles of merit, competition, equal opportunity and excellence are the bedrock of the NSF mission. NSF continues to review all projects using Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts criteria.\u2019\nThe sweeping cuts to the NSF come on top of Trump\u2019s dismantling of other key scientific research departments within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and US Geological Service (USGS).\nThe USGS is the research arm of the Department of Interior. Its scientists help solve real-life problems about hazards, natural resources, water, energy, ecosystems, and the impacts of climate and land-use change for tribal governments, the Bureau of Land Management, fish and wildlife services, and the National Parks Service among other interior agencies.\nTrump\u2019s big, beautiful bill cuts the USGS budget by 39%. This includes slashing the entire budget for the agency\u2019s ecosystems mission area (EMA), which leads federal research on species & ecosystems and houses the climate adaptation science centers.\nEMA scientists figure out how to better protect at-risk species such as bees and wolverines, minimize harmful overgrazing on BLM lands, and prevent invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes \u2013 all vitally important to protect food security in the US as the climate changes.\nThe EMA has already lost 25 to 30% of employees through Doge-approved layoffs and buyouts, and is now facing termination. \u201cWe\u2019ve already lost a lot of institutional memory and new, up-and-coming leaders. [If Trump\u2019s budget is approved], all science in support of managing our public lands and natural resources would be cut,\u201d said one USGS program officer.\n\u201cOur economy is driven by natural resources including timber, minerals and food systems, and if we don\u2019t manage these in a sustainable way, we will be shooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d\nLike at the NSF, the USGC\u2019s gold standard peer-review system for research approval and oversight is now at the mercy of Doge \u2013 in this case Tyler Hasson, the former oil executive given sweeping authority by the interior secretary. According to USGS staff, Hasson\u2019s office accepts or rejects proposals based on two paragraphs of information program officers are permitted to submit \u2013 without any dialogue or feedback.\n\u201cThe gold standard scientific review is being interfered with. This is now a political process,\u201d said one USGS scientist.\nA spokesperson for the interior department said: \u201cThe claim that science is being \u2018politicized\u2019 is categorically false. We reject the narrative that responsible budget reform constitutes an \u2018assault on science\u2019. On the contrary, we are empowering American innovation by cutting red tape, reducing bureaucracy and ensuring that the next generation of scientists and engineers can focus on real-world solutions \u2013 not endless paperwork or politically motivated research agendas.\u201d\nThe USGS, office of management and budget and White House did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Guardian is interested in hearing from US scientists and students impacted by the changes at National Science Foundation and other agencies, including on the impact on innovation in the US.

            "The Double-Edged Sword of Chapter 93A, Section 11 in Massachusetts Business Litigation | JD Supra. Introduction\nOne of the most potent tools in Massachusetts commercial litigation is Chapter 93A, \u00a7 11 of the Massachusetts General Laws. Designed to deter \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cdeceptive\u201d conduct in \u201ctrade or commerce,\u201d Section 11 creates a statutory cause of action between businesses that allows for the recovery of treble damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and injunctive relief. Section 9, largely applicable to consumer plaintiffs, is similarly potent;[1] however, this article focuses largely on Section 11 business claims.\nFor plaintiffs, Chapter 93A amplifies recovery; for defendants, it is a substantial liability risk. While Chapter 93A claims are frequently threatened and litigated, they are often brought without a full command of the statutory and doctrinal nuances that can fundamentally alter the outcome. Below are just a few common issues that continue to surface and develop in recent jurisprudence.\n1. Bring the right type of claim or risk dismissal\nSection 11 is not Chapter 93A\u2019s only private right of action. While nuances exist, Section 9 provides a private right of action to individual consumers who have suffered a loss due to an unfair trade practice\u2014whereas Section 11 generally pertains to persons acting in a business context.[2] Bringing a claim under the wrong statutory provision risks early dismissal.\nPractice Tip: Where the facts are unclear or mixed as to which Section applies (e.g., both businesses and consumers are impacted by a potential regulation), the most prudent course is to plead both Sections in the alternative.\n2. Don\u2019t miss the opportunity to limit your damages at the outset\nA savvy defendant can limit its damages at the outset of the case. Section 11 contains a little-used but powerful tool for defendants to avoid multiple damages. By submitting a written offer of settlement for single damages \u201cwith [its] answer,\u201d a defendant caps its exposure if the offer is rejected but later deemed reasonable by the court relative to the actual injury suffered.[3] Courts have enforced this limitation\u2014even mid-litigation\u2014so long as the offer is specific, timely, and brought to the court\u2019s attention before judgment is entered. Failing to raise the issue before treble damages are awarded may result in waiver, regardless of the offer\u2019s reasonableness.\n3. Don\u2019t gloss over the geographic prerequisite; it has teeth\nOne of the unique\u2014and dispositive\u2014features of a Section 11 business claim is the requirement that the unfair or deceptive conduct occurred \u201cprimarily and substantially\u201d within Massachusetts. Take this defense seriously\u2014as it has been known to dismiss a case wholly outside the merits, even when a party is based in Massachusetts. Courts apply this standard by examining the \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d of the misconduct\u2014e.g., where decisions were made, negotiations occurred, harm was felt, and control was exercised. Recently, a court dismissed a 93A claim where, despite some business activity and incorporation in Massachusetts, the heart of the wrongdoing occurred elsewhere. [4] This defense can support early resolution and often serves as a strategic tool for out-of-state defendants. This test also takes on different import depending on the underlying nature of the claim. It is typically most effective at the summary judgment stage\u2014though some courts have dismissed claims on the pleadings where allegations are improperly framed. [5]\nConversely, a Chapter 93A claim brought by a consumer under Section 9 contains no such heightened geographic prerequisite. In fact, Section 9 even contains its own special language, construed as more \u201cconsumer friendly,\u201d in seeking class certification. [6] While courts have permitted nationwide classes under Chapter 93A (typically involving \u201csettlement classes\u201d), most courts have followed an \u201cunbroken string of opinions\u201d declining to extend Chapter 93A to multi-state classes. [7]\n4. Heed the scope of actionable misconduct\nOne of Chapter 93A\u2019s strengths is its malleability and real-world application; it captures the reality that, whether a business practice is truly \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cdeceptive\u201d requires consideration of the surrounding circumstances and context. Chapter 93A claims are evaluated \u201cholistically\u201d and \u201cbased on the circumstances of each case.\u201d [8] Whether a particular set of acts, in their factual setting, is unfair or deceptive is a question of fact, but whether that conduct rises to the level of 93A violation is a question of law. [9]\nIn that sense, courts have circumscribed the scope of an actionable claim. For example, while mere negligence or breach of contract, without more, does not suffice, a party knowingly violating its contractual obligations to secure an unwarranted benefit does. [10] Further, courts generally require a higher standard for offensive conduct when brought as business claims under Section 11 (versus Section 9). Last, be aware that some relationships are excluded entirely. Chapter 93A is intended to regulate market-based, arm\u2019s-length transactions. As such, courts have held that internal business disputes\u2014such as those between employer and employee, or between co-owners of a closely held business\u2014generally fall outside the scope of \u201ctrade or commerce.\u201d Similarly, regulated entities acting within the bounds of a statutory or regulatory scheme may be exempt under Section 3 of the statute.\nConclusion\nChapter 93A claims are powerful tools in Massachusetts commercial (and consumer) litigation. For clients and others engaged in business in Massachusetts, awareness of the nuances of this statute and its evolving jurisprudence is important.\n[1] Massachusetts courts and regulators continue to broaden the reach of Chapter 93A, making it an increasingly powerful tool for consumer plaintiffs. A recent example is the new regulation under 940 CMR 38.00, effective September 2, 2025, which targets hidden or misleading \u201cjunk fees.\u201d See https://www.mass.gov/doc/junk-fee-regulations-940-cmr-3800-0/download. The regulation requires businesses to disclose the total cost of a product or service\u2014including all mandatory fees\u2014clearly and conspicuously at the outset. Failure to do so will be per se \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cdeceptive\u201d under G.L. c. 93A, Section 2, which gives consumer plaintiffs a powerful new tool under Section 9.\nThis regulatory shift, combined with Section 9\u2019s plaintiff-friendly features\u2014such as mandatory treble damages for willful violations and attorneys\u2019 fees for prevailing plaintiffs\u2014may drive a wave of new class actions. Industries relying on drip pricing, auto-renewing subscriptions, or trial offers should be especially vigilant.\n[2] See In re: Moveit Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, No. 23-MD-3083-ADB-PGL, 2025 WL 2176590, at *17 (D.

            "Tort/Negligence \u2013 Woodson Exception \u2013 Intentional Tort | North Carolina Lawyers Weekly. North Carolina Court of Appeals\nNorth Carolina Court of Appeals\nPlaintiff\u2019s forecast of evidence failed to establish a Woodson claim, and therefore, the trial court erred in denying Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\nWe reversed the trial court\u2019s order denying Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and remanded the matter for entry of an order granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\nThis case concerned the Woodson exception to the exclusivity provision of the North Carolina Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Woodson v. Rowland, 329 N.C. 330, 340\u201341, 407 S.E.2d 222, 228 (1991). A Woodson claim presents \u201can exception to the Act\u2019s exclusivity provision . . . for civil actions brought as a result of conduct that is tantamount to an intentional tort.\u201d Plaintiff Karen Tyson, as administratrix of the estate of her deceased brother, Franklin Scott Tyson (Decedent), asserted a Woodson claim against Defendants ELG Utica Alloys, Inc., ELG Utica Alloys Holding Corp., ELG Utica Alloys (Hartford), Inc., and ELG Utica Alloys (Monroe) LLC, d/b/a ABS Alloys & Metals USA, LLC. Defendants appealed from the trial court\u2019s order denying their motion for summary judgment. We concluded that Plaintiff\u2019s forecast of evidence failed to establish a Woodson claim, and therefore, the trial court erred in denying Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\nDecedent was killed by an explosive fire while operating the zirconium crusher at Defendants\u2019 metal processing plant in Monroe, North Carolina. Defendants\u2019 Monroe facility recycled metal used in the aerospace industry, including zirconium. Defendants processed zirconium turnings, which are spiral shavings of the metal, using a crusher. Prior to the fatal explosion, there had been a few inconsequential, slow-burning zirconium fires at the Monroe facility\u2014including at least one that could not be put out by Class D fire extinguishers, which was resolved when Defendants\u2019 employees \u201cpulled the materials involved in [the] fire outside the building to let it burn out.\u201d Defendants had also previously received citations from federal and state authorities for various safety violations. Significantly, none of these citations specifically related to zirconium. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) cited Defendants\u2019 facility in Hartford, Connecticut, regarding its handling of combustible titanium dust. The Occupational Safety and Health Division of the North Carolina Department of Labor (NC OSHA) cited Defendants for multiple violations at the Monroe facility, including several related to the safe handling of hazardous materials. Following the fatal incident, NC OSHA issued several additional citations related to Defendants\u2019 handling of zirconium and the crusher.\nOn appeal, Defendants argued the trial court erred by denying their motion for summary judgment because \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s evidence in this case fails to meet the conduct tantamount to an intentional tort required by Woodson.\u201d We agreed. Specifically, Defendants contended that Plaintiff failed \u201cto show that there was evidence that . . . [Defendants] intended that [Decedent] would be injured from working on the crusher to process zirconium or that they were manifestly indifferent to the consequences of his doing so as required by the Woodson exception.\u201d This case illustrates the high bar established by our Supreme Court in Woodson. Plaintiff relied in part upon NC OSHA\u2019s subsequent investigation of the fatal fire and resulting citations for \u201cSerious\u201d and \u201cRepeat Serious\u201d violations arising from Defendants\u2019 alleged failure \u201cto protect [Decedent] from recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\u201d In addition, Plaintiff maintained that Defendants were \u201caware of, but repeatedly ignored, safety warnings associated with the grinding of zirconium.\u201d But the evidence shows that Defendants\u2019 employees \u201cthought that any fires resulting from the processing of zirconium would be slow burning and easily capable of extinguishment.\u201d The record evidence suggests that, while zirconium fires were not unprecedented, Defendants had no \u201cknowledge of a substantial certainty\u201d of a sudden conflagration with the sustained force and intensity of the one that tragically killed Decedent.\nPlaintiff also repeatedly asserted Defendants \u201cpurposefully placed [Decedent] in an unprotected location, without safety gear, directly above known sparks and fires emitting from an explosive metal being ground within a crusher.\u201d However, our Supreme Court in Pendergrass concluded that knowledge that \u201ccertain dangerous parts of [a] machine were unguarded when [the employer] instructed [the employee] to work at the machine\u201d did not support \u201can inference that [the employer] intended that [the employee] be injured or that they were manifestly indifferent to the consequences of his doing so.\u201d Although evidence might support a claim for negligence, it does not amount to misconduct \u201ctantamount to an intentional tort,\u201d as is required for a successful Woodson claim.\nWe concluded that \u201cPlaintiff has not forecast evidence of intentional misconduct by Defendants substantially certain to lead to Decedent\u2019s death so as to create a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to survive summary judgment on Plaintiff\u2019s claims arising under Woodson.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court erred by denying Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\nReversed and remanded.\nTyson v.

            "Eastern District Of Texas Denies Motion To Dismiss Coordinated Stewardship Complaint Against Asset Managers | JD Supra. On August 1, 2025, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas denied the motions to dismiss filed by three asset managers. The complaint, brought by thirteen plaintiff states (Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Louisiana, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wyoming) and supported by a joint DOJ/FTC statement of interest, alleges that defendants used ownership interests in major coal companies to limit coal production in furtherance of environmental stewardship and concern for the climate. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds, inter alia, that: (i) plaintiffs failed to allege \u201clessening of competition\u201d as required by Clayton Act \u00a77; (ii) defendants are \u201cpassive investors\u201d protected by the safe-harbor provision in Clayton Act \u00a77; and (iii) plaintiffs failed to allege concerted action as required by Sherman Act \u00a71. In what was the first significant test of the states\u2019 long-running theory that asset managers and banks\u2019 commitment to decarbonization initiatives violated antitrust laws, the district court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all antitrust claims.\nAccording to plaintiffs, defendants amassed significant minority stakes\u2014often 25% to 35% collectively\u2014in major publicly traded domestic coal producers. At the same time, the complaint alleges that defendants joined and committed to further the goals of high-profile \u201cclimate initiatives\u201d such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (\u201cNZAM\u201d) and Climate Action 100+ (\u201cCA100\u201d). Defendants allegedly leveraged their collective coal producer ownership interests to mount internal pressure campaigns for the purpose of curtailing coal production in the name of achieving \u201cnet-zero\u201d greenhouse-gas emissions. Plaintiffs allege that the resulting coal output reductions had driven up the price of South Powder River Basin (\u201cSPRB\u201d) coal and thermal coal, inflating electricity costs for consumers, on the one hand, while boosting defendants\u2019 asset-management fees and profits on the other.\nPlaintiffs asserted that defendants\u2019 actions violate Clayton Act \u00a77 (prohibits mergers and acquisitions that may substantially lessen competition) and Sherman Act \u00a71 (prohibits contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade), among other state antitrust and consumer protection laws. First, plaintiffs alleged a \u201chorizontal shareholding\u201d claim, whereby defendants unlawfully acquired and used stock in violation of Clayton Act \u00a77. Plaintiffs contend that defendants\u2019 aggregate minority ownership interests gave them sufficient leverage to influence coal-company behavior and artificially depress coal output. While no court has ever endorsed a novel \u201chorizontal shareholding\u201d claim, which occurs when a relatively small number of investors acquire large overlapping ownership interests in multiple companies, the district court indicated it was willing to consider the claim by reasoning that \u201cserious academic scholarship seems to agree\u201d to its viability under Clayton Act \u00a77.\nSecond, plaintiffs alleged that defendants, by collectively (i) committing to NZAM and CA100, (ii) demanding targets for lower emissions, and (iii) initiating proxy-voting against directors who resisted lower emissions targets, entered into an unlawful agreement to depress coal output and to require disclosure of competitively sensitive future-production data in violation of Sherman Act \u00a71. Plaintiffs bolstered these theories with alleged \u201cplus factors,\u201d noting that defendants\u2019 membership in the climate initiatives coincided with declines in coal output (18\u201319%) and increases in coal prices (21\u201325%) between 2019 and 2022.\nIn their motion to dismiss, defendants first asserted that a passive investor safe harbor shields minority stockholdings from antitrust claims under Clayton Act \u00a77. Defendants claimed that they neither sought control nor acted inconsistently with ordinary governance practices. Rather, defendants characterized NZAM and CA100 as mere \u201ctrade associations\u201d and label the complaint\u2019s reliance on parallel conduct as impermissible speculation under Twombly. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege competitive harm as required by Clayton Act \u00a77. Defendants contested the 2019\u20132022 timeframe as cherry-picked and not indicative of broader or more recent trends, when, according to defendants, output has steadily increased over the last several years. Lastly, relating to plaintiffs\u2019 Sherman Act \u00a71 claim, defendants maintain that any price or output shifts stem from long-term market trends\u2014COVID-19 disruption, declining coal demand, and increased natural-gas competition\u2014rather than concerted action.\nThe district court rejected defendants\u2019 arguments. First, the district court rejected the Clayton Act \u00a77 passive investor safe harbor because defendants actively used stock through proxy voting or engaging directly with coal companies, after joining climate initiatives, committing to goals that would reduce the output of coal, and making public statements supporting and furthering these goals. Next, the district court found that Plaintiffs plausibly alleged competitive harm in violation of Clayton Act \u00a77. The district court noted that, but for defendants\u2019 alleged anticompetitive conduct, public coal companies may have increased production to capitalize on rising prices, as privately held coal producers did. The district court emphasized that defendants\u2019 collective ownership stakes and coordinated stewardship activities plausibly influenced the coal companies\u2019 decisions to restrain output. Further, the district court noted that the proper timeframe for evaluating coal market trends is a factual dispute that cannot be decided at the motion to dismiss stage. Lastly, the district court found that plaintiffs plausibly alleged anticompetitive harm by showing both increased prices and decreased output in the relevant coal markets, which are classic indicators of competitive harm to competition in assessing Sherman Act \u00a71 claims. Moreover, the district court held Plaintiffs pleaded sufficient circumstantial evidence\u2014parallel initiative membership, synchronized statements, and coordinated proxy-voting\u2014to raise a reasonable inference of concerted action under Sherman Act \u00a71.\nThe district court denied the motion to dismiss for all federal and state antitrust claims, although it granted dismissal of three state consumer-protection claims.\nWhile the states bringing this action initiated several similar and highly-publicized investigations since at least 2022, this complaint was an unprecedented antitrust challenge to the stewardship of asset managers. The district court\u2019s decision has validated the states\u2019 theory, which, at its core, attempts to find anticompetitive conduct and antitrust harm from activist management by minority investors and participation in widespread climate initiatives, and the states may now rely on the decision to bring similar challenges against additional asset managers and banks.\n[View source.]"

            "Japanese Bonds Risk Liz Truss Moment as Election Jolts Market. Japanese Bonds Risk Liz Truss Moment as Election Jolts Market\nJapan\u2019s bond market is facing a potential Liz Truss moment as the risk of a ruling coalition defeat in Sunday\u2019s election fuels concerns over fiscal policy, according to SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.\nYields on bonds with maturities of 20 years and beyond have risen at least 20 basis points this month, part of a wave of selling in global bond markets as investors increasingly worry about government finances. That has put the spotlight on a weekend election for Japan\u2019s upper house, which local media think may end in disappointment for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner.",
            "Market Braces for Pivotal 20-Year Japan Bond Sale as Yields Rise. Bonds\nMarket Braces for Pivotal 20-Year Japan Bond Sale as Yields Rise\nAn auction of 20-year Japanese government bonds Thursday will beam the searchlight back on rising yields as a looming election heightens concerns about fiscal expansion.\nThe sale is just one of several in major debt markets this week as increasing yields on some longer maturities show how investors are worried about widening budget deficits. While yields on 10-, 20- and 30-year Japanese bonds moved lower during morning trade in Tokyo, they remained within reach of recent highs.",
            "Sunset Market Commentary - Action Forex. Markets\nJapanese yields for a second day straight surged around 10 bps at the very long end of the curve. The 30-year bond yield is now up 20 bps since the start of the new week and just 13 bps shy of the record-high (3.2%) seen mid-May. Investors are turning nervous ahead of the July 20 elections in the Japanese Upper House of parliament. PM Ishiba is already running a minority government after snap elections last year and his approval rates are low (which by the way also helps explain Japan\u2019s staunch stance in the US trade talks). Losing the Upper House elections could further strip the ruling coalition of its powers. To win voters over, markets fear another dose of stimulus at a time of already unsustainable public finances. The Japanese case serves as a reminder for the rest of the world, be it the UK, US or Europe and is already overshadowing the trade theme again. All three regions see the long end of the curve underperforming, the UK taking the lead. The fiscal situation in the country is getting a lot of market attention with the October budget being the next key event. Chancellor Reeves\u2019 faces a potential \u00a330bn hole that investors fear can only be found by changing (ie. loosen) the set of self-imposed fiscal rules. And as it happened, the UK\u2019s fiscal watchdog (Office for Budget Responsibility) today flagged the \u201cunsustainable\u201d outlook in its annual fiscal risk report. It warned for a rapidly rising debt burden amid an aging population pushing up health care and pension spending and mounting climate and geopolitical risks. Adding to the problem of supply is waning demand from pension schemes. The 30-yr gilt yield adds 7 bps today with the 1998 high seen in May now just 20 basis points away. US rates add between 1.4 and 4.5 bps in a bear steepener. The 30-yr, currently 4.96%, is suddenly aiming for 5% again. And in Germany, raters add 5+ bps with the 30-yr tenor being 10 bps shy of a 14-yr high. The rest of the curve also shifts a couple of basis points higher too though. This could be the result of the EU and US potentially closing in on a trade agreement. Politico reported yesterday of a US proposal for a universal 10% (ie the floor) tariff with some exceptions here and there. Such a deal would be on the better side of expectations. It also lowers (or even removes) the already questionable need for a last ECB rate cut markets are currently pricing in, hence the near-parallel curve shift today. In any case, the general extension of the tariff deadline from July 9 to August 1 (USTS Bessent last week referred to an even later date on Labour Day, Sep 1) raises chances of finding common ground one way or another. The chair of the council of economic advisors, Miran, said there could be more trade deals by the end of the week.\nThe Japanese yen underperforms major global peers on currency markets. Japan was slapped by a 25% tariff as president Trump raises the pressure on a country that dug in for electoral motives. USD/JPY marches higher towards 146.65. EUR/JPY moves beyond a final resistance at 171.56 ahead of the July 2024 record high (175.43). The Aussie dollar is on the other side of the FX spectrum. AUD/USD rebounds to 0.654. The RBA unexpectedly stood pat on rates this morning (3.85%) over the risk that some CPI components may be above-forecast. Governor Bullock did say it is a matter about timing, not direction. An August cut is almost fully priced in. In between we find some muted moves in EUR/USD (unchanged around 1.1715). Rising risk premia weigh on sterling, pushing EUR/GBP higher north of 0.86.\nNews & Views\nCPI consumer price inflation in Hungary in June rose 0.1% M/M and 4.6% Y/Y (was 0.2% and 4.4% in May). The outcome was close to expectations. The Hungarian central bank\u2019s (MNB) core inflation estimate fell from 4.8% Y/Y to 4.4%. The bank indicated that both headline and core inflation were in line with its June inflation forecast. The increase was primarily due fuel prices as they decreased to a lesser extent than in the previous month. The MNB also indicated that price and margin restriction measures from the government had a significant inflation-reducing effect. The greatest effect was due to the price margin cap on food prices but the effect on household goods, which came into effect in May, also fully appeared. In addition, voluntary price restrictions by banks and telecoms are also holding down inflation. Annual inflation of tradables slowed to 2.5% from 2.9%. Annual inflation of market services was 0.4% M/M but still rose at 6.7% Y/Y. With inflation still holding well above the 3.0% +/- 1.0% target range of the MNB, today\u2019s data justify the MNB indicating that policy will have to remain at the current restrictive level (6.5%) for some time to come. The forint trades little changed just below the EUR/HUF 400 level."

            "US supreme court clears way for Trump officials to resume mass government firings. The US supreme court has cleared the way for Donald Trump\u2019s administration to resume plans for mass firings of federal workers that critics warn could threaten critical government services.\nExtending a winning streak for the US president, the justices on Tuesday lifted a lower court order that had frozen sweeping federal layoffs known as \u201creductions in force\u201d while litigation in the case proceeds.\nThe decision could result in hundreds of thousands of job losses at the departments of agriculture, commerce, health and human services, state, treasury, veterans affairs and other agencies.\nDemocrats condemned the ruling. Antjuan Seawright, a party strategist, said: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed but I\u2019m not shocked or surprised. This rightwing activist court has proven ruling after ruling, time after time, that they are going to sing the songs and dance to the tune of Trumpism. A lot of this is just implementation of what we saw previewed in Project 2025.\u201d\nProject 2025, a plan drawn up by the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank, set out a blueprint for downsizing government. Trump has claimed that voters gave him a mandate for the effort and he tapped billionaire ally Elon Musk to lead the charge through the \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d, or Doge, though Musk has since departed.\nIn February, Trump announced \u201ca critical transformation of the federal bureaucracy\u201d in an executive order directing agencies to prepare for a government overhaul aimed at significantly reducing the workforce and gutting offices.\nIn its brief unsigned order on Tuesday, the supreme court said Trump\u2019s administration was \u201clikely to succeed on its argument that the executive order\u201d and a memorandum implementing his order were lawful. The court said it was not assessing the legality of any specific plans for layoffs at federal agencies.\nKetanji Brown Jackson, the liberal justice, was the sole member of the nine-person court to publicly dissent from the decision, which overturns San Francisco-based district Judge Susan Illston\u2019s 22 May ruling.\nJackson wrote that Illston\u2019s \u201ctemporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this court\u2019s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this president\u2019s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture\u201d.\nShe also described her colleagues as making the \u201cwrong decision at the wrong moment, especially given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground\u201d.\nIllston had argued in her ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority in ordering the downsizing, siding with a group of unions, non-profits and local governments that challenged the administration. \u201cAs history demonstrates, the president may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress,\u201d she wrote.\nThe judge blocked the agencies from carrying out mass layoffs and limited their ability to cut or overhaul federal programmes. Illston also ordered the reinstatement of workers who had lost their jobs, though she delayed implementing this portion of her ruling while the appeals process plays out.\nIllston\u2019s ruling was the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul pursued by Trump and Doge. Tens of thousands of federal workers have been fired, have left their jobs via deferred resignation programmes or have been placed on leave.\nThe administration had previously challenged Illston\u2019s order at the San Francisco-based ninth US circuit court of appeals but lost in a 2-1 ruling on 30 May. That prompted the justice department to make an emergency request to the supreme court, contending that controlling the personnel of federal agencies \u201clies at the heartland\u201d of the president\u2019s executive branch authority.\nThe plaintiffs had urged the supreme court to deny the justice department\u2019s request. Allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its \u201cbreakneck reorganization\u201d, they wrote, would mean that \u201cprograms, offices and functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs\u201d.\nThe supreme court\u2019s rejection of that argument on Tuesday was welcomed by Trump allies. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, posted on the X social media platform: \u201cToday, the Supreme Court stopped lawless lower courts from restricting President Trump\u2019s authority over federal personnel \u2013 another Supreme Court victory thanks to @thejusticedept attorneys. Now, federal agencies can become more efficient than ever before.\nThe state department wrote on X: \u201cToday\u2019s near unanimous decision from the Supreme Court further confirms that the law was on our side throughout this entire process. We will continue to move forward with our historic reorganization plan at the State Department, as announced earlier this year. This is yet another testament to President Trump\u2019s dedication to following through on an America First agenda.\u201d\nIn recent months the supreme court has sided with Trump in some major cases that were acted upon on an emergency basis since he returned to office in January.\nIt cleared the way for Trump\u2019s administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harms they could face. In two cases, it let the administration end temporary legal status previously granted on humanitarian grounds to hundreds of thousands of migrants.\nIt also allowed Trump to implement his ban on transgender people in the US military, blocked a judge\u2019s order for the administration to rehire thousands of fired employees and twice sided with Doge. In addition, the court curbed the power of federal judges to impose nationwide rulings impeding presidential policies.\nOn Tuesday the Democracy Forward coalition condemned the supreme court for intervening in what it called Trump\u2019s unlawful reorganisation of the federal government. It said in a statement: \u201cToday\u2019s decision has dealt a serious blow to our democracy and puts services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.\n\u201cThis decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution.\u201d",
            "Supreme Court Allows Trump To Lay Off Nearly 1,400 Education Department Employees. WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court is allowing President Donald Trump to put his plan to dismantle the Education Department back on track \u2014 and to go through with laying off nearly 1,400 employees.\nWith the three liberal justices in dissent, the court on Monday paused an order from U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston, who issued a preliminary injunction reversing the layoffs and calling into question the broader plan. The layoffs \u201cwill likely cripple the department,\u201d Joun wrote. A federal appeals court refused to put the order on hold while the administration appealed.\nThe high court action enables the administration to resume work on winding down the department, one of Trump\u2019s biggest campaign promises.\nThe court did not explain its decision in favor of Trump, as is customary in emergency appeals. But in dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor complained that her colleagues were enabling legally questionable action on the part of the administration.\n\u201cWhen the Executive publicly announces its intent to break the law, and then executes on that promise, it is the Judiciary\u2019s duty to check that lawlessness, not expedite it,\u201d Sotomayor wrote for herself and Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan.\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon said it\u2019s a \u201cshame\u201d it took the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention to let Trump\u2019s plan move ahead.\n\u201cToday, the Supreme Court again confirmed the obvious: the President of the United States, as the head of the Executive Branch, has the ultimate authority to make decisions about staffing levels, administrative organization, and day-to-day operations of federal agencies,\u201d McMahon said in a statement.\nThe Supreme Court has handed Trump one victory after another in his effort to remake the federal government, after lower courts have found the administration\u2019s actions probably violate federal law. Last week, the justices cleared the way for Trump\u2019s plan to significantly reduce the size of the federal workforce. On the education front, the high court has previously allowed cuts in teacher-training grants to go forward.\nSeparately on Monday, more than 20 states sued the administration over billions of dollars in frozen education funding for after-school care, summer programs and more.\nEducation Department employees who were targeted by the layoffs have been on paid leave since March, according to a union that represents some of the agency\u2019s staff.\nJoun\u2019s order had prevented the department from fully terminating them, though none had been allowed to return to work, according to the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252. Without Joun\u2019s order, the workers would have been terminated in early June.\nThe Education Department had said earlier in June that it was \u201cactively assessing how to reintegrate\u201d the employees. A department email asked them to share whether they had gained other employment, saying the request was meant to \u201csupport a smooth and informed return to duty.\u201d\nThe current case involves two consolidated lawsuits that said Trump\u2019s plan amounted to an illegal closure of the Education Department.\nAlready contributed? Log in to hide these messages.\nOne suit was filed by the Somerville and Easthampton school districts in Massachusetts along with the American Federation of Teachers and other education groups. The other legal action was filed by a coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general.\nThe suits argued that layoffs left the department unable to carry out responsibilities required by Congress, including duties to support special education, distribute financial aid and enforce civil rights laws.",

Fibrosis are noncancerous growths that develop in the uterus and can result in numerous symptoms including heavy and prolonged pelvic pains, bloating, constipation and back discomfort.\nMany women develop some form of fibrosis over time, however, most don't notice it because they don't suffer from severe symptoms. Davis, however, was diagnosed at the age of 13 and told by her doctor that her case was mild, but warned that pregnancy could be difficult.\nThe anchor gave birth to her son, Ayden, shared with husband Paul Roberts in 2014 and doctors monitored a fibroid growing alongside the baby, but assured her it would likely stop after the pregnancy progressed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI had my son and didn\u2019t have any concerns.\u201d\nDavis said she began experiencing extreme menstrual cycles lasting up to two weeks, which included intense bleeding and severe bloating, six weeks after giving birth. The anchor underwent a myomectomy, which removed six fibroids, leaving her symptom free until she noticed a knot protruding from her lower abdomen about 18 months ago.\nAn ultrasound revealed that Davis had 13 fibroids, which led to her opting to undergo a hysterectomy to prevent new fibroids from forming scheduled for Friday (August 15).\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to be able to live my life without having to schedule and plan and worry and be anxious that I\u2019m gonna have this heavy bleeding and excessive bloating and this uncomfortable menstrual cycle every month. I feel confident that my life will be better,\" she told PEOPLE.",

Our top pick from Safco is ergonomically designed and comfortable to sit on or exercise with.\nWhat to know before you buy a ball chair\nDiameter\nThe diameter for the ball chair should correspond to your height \u2014 a ball chair that\u2019s too small won\u2019t be supportive enough, while a larger one may not offer enough balance. Most ball chairs are available in sizes ranging from 45 to 75 centimeters and come with corresponding sizing charts for optimal usage.\nExercises\nWhile you may buy a ball chair to provide comfort and relief while sitting, there are a variety of exercises that can be done with it as well. It can be used in yoga and core activities, such as planks, pushups, or situps. Ball exercises can tone and strengthen all parts of your body while improving flexibility and balance.\nWeight limit\nNote the weight limit of your potential purchase so you know it can safely accommodate you. Some ball chairs may have a high weight capacity to allow for more exercises, but some may cater more to sitting and have a lower limit. Keep in mind that when you\u2019re bouncing or applying pressure to the ball, that force is increasing the weight on it.\nWhat to look for in a quality ball chair\nColor\nBall chairs are offered in a wide range of colors and designs to cater to your personality or home d\u00e9cor. You may choose different colors if several people in the household have one, or opt for a look that matches your desk or office d\u00e9cor.\nStability\nSome ball chairs come with a chair framework or stabilizing ring to prevent the ball from rolling easily. The framework features legs and a backrest for added comfort. The ball fits into this when used as a chair and can then be removed for exercising. A ring, meanwhile, sits on the floor, and the ball is contained within it. This is also useful for storage, so it doesn\u2019t roll away.\nPump\nBall chairs need to be inflated, and some may come with a handy pump. Pumps are relatively inexpensive, but it\u2019s certainly more convenient getting it with your purchase. Regardless, inflate your ball around three-quarters of the way full, then let it rest for 24 hours before filling it up the rest of the way.\nHow much you can expect to spend on a ball chair\nMost ball chairs run between $40-$80, and you have a choice of size and color. Generally, inexpensive ball chairs are less durable than more expensive ones, which come from trusted brand names.\nBALL CHAIRS FAQ\nQ. How long does a ball chair last?\nA. A ball chair is an investment that should be expected to last for many years. Store it in a cool, dry place when not in use and keep it out of the sun. Make sure to clean the ball chair after use, as it can accumulate dust or sweat. You will likely need to regularly inflate it over time.\nQ. Can I use the ball chair outside?\nA. If you decide to work or exercise outside, you can use the ball chair \u2014 with some caution. Avoid placing it on flat, hard surfaces, especially those that may heat up in the sun. Soft grass is best; just make sure it\u2019s free of branches or rocks that may puncture the ball. Be sure to wipe down the ball after use.\nWhat are the best ball chairs to buy?\nTop ball chair\nWhat you need to know: It\u2019s an ergonomically designed ball chair with stabilizing legs for maximum support.\nWhat you\u2019ll love: This comfortable, elegant-looking chair improves posture, balance and core strength.

            "8 activewear brands you should add to your workout wardrobe. The increasing popularity of stylish, trendy athletic wear has made \u00fcber-comfortable clothing something that\u2019s not just for the gym. It\u2019s infiltrated all corners of culture, from high fashion runways to the offices of Silicon Valley executives \u2014 and really, it\u2019s appropriate for any occasion when you just want to be comfortable.\nA key thing to keep in mind when searching for your next piece of activewear is the type of activity or exercise you prefer: Whether you\u2019re a runner, yogi, lifter, cyclist or anything else, there\u2019s a trendy athleisure brand out there for you. We were able to test some of these pieces hands-on so we could really see where each brand shines bright. So if you\u2019re ready to upgrade your closet and kill those workouts in style, check out these eight activewear brands that we absolutely love \u2014 from established ones to newer direct-to-consumer options.\nAlo Yoga\nAlo Yoga was created in 2007 as an activewear brand specifically for yoga lovers, but it has since evolved into one beloved by everyone from the barre-obsessed and Pilates loyalists to celebrities as a street style option. And there\u2019s a really good reason for that.\nThe brand\u2019s super-soft and comfortable activewear is probably the most luxurious-feeling gym clothing I\u2019ve ever worn. It may not be the best option for someone who runs marathons or works with heavy weights, but it provides a little luxury if you prefer lower-impact exercises like yoga or barre. When it comes to the leggings, both the 7/8 High-Waist Airbrush Legging ($78; aloyoga.com) and the High-Waist Airlift Legging ($118; aloyoga.com) are extremely soft, comfortable and flattering.\nThe High-Waist Airbrush Legging is probably Alo Yoga\u2019s most classic legging. There are no side seams, and it\u2019s made from the brand\u2019s signature Airbrush fabric that features moisture-wicking antimicrobial technology. It\u2019s the perfect option to take you from the gym to just about anywhere and has been spotted on celebrities like Gigi Hadid. The High-Waist Airlift Legging feels like a second skin; it\u2019s buttery and sleek while still supportive. They\u2019re super high-waisted, making them a great choice to pair with a whole range of crop tops or sports bras.\nWhile we didn\u2019t test any of Alo\u2019s current tops, we\u2019ve worn some of its older long-sleeve products, which felt warm and lightweight. The brand also has tons of other tops, including the bestselling Real Bra Tank ($72; aloyoga.com), that can keep you supported and stylish through all your workouts. This tank has a built-in shelf bra that provides light to medium support so you can go straight from yoga class to the caf\u00e9 around the corner without skipping a beat.\nWorking out in these pieces, and in Alo Yoga\u2019s products in general, definitely feels a little more special than wearing your typical workout clothes. And though they\u2019re probably not the most supportive workout options on the market and better suited for lower-impact activities, we can guarantee that they\u2019ll garner tons of compliments both outside and inside the studio.\nGirlfriend Collective\nGirlfriend Collective is a brand that prioritizes slow fashion \u2014 which means investing time and energy \u2014 to produce clothing that\u2019s more ethical and easier on the planet. Take the Compressive High-Rise Legging, for example, Girlfriend\u2019s signature legging that\u2019s made from 25 recycled water bottles. And though many synthetic fabrics (like nylon and polyester) are made from plastic, Girlfriend chooses materials \u201cthat would otherwise clog landfills and threaten wildlife.\u201d\nBut you\u2019re not sacrificing quality when you shop at Girlfriend. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite. The Compressive High-Rise Legging ($68; girlfriend.com) and Paloma Bra ($38; girlfriend.com) are some of the most inexpensive options on this list, which makes their super-high-quality feel that much more impressive.\nThe Compressive High-Rise Leggings really do some incredible work when it comes to lifting your backside. They\u2019re also extremely high-waisted, which is great if you don\u2019t want to worry about pulling up your leggings during a workout. Both the leggings and the Paloma Bra are sweat-resistant and comfortable in warmer environments, though they\u2019re not the most lightweight, which we actually prefer for everyday wear.\nThe Paloma Bra is fairly long as well, so if you\u2019re buying these two pieces together \u2014 which we highly recommend, because everyone will be asking where you got your adorable set \u2014 your whole stomach won\u2019t be exposed. Another interesting element is the lack of visible branding; there are no loud logos on the back of the leggings, which we found refreshing.\nThe best part is the customization that\u2019s available, both in terms of fit and style. The Paloma Bra is available in sizes XS through XXXL, and the Compressive High-Rise Legging runs from sizes XXS to 6XL, with the additional option of choosing from three inseam lengths. Yes for inclusivity! And when it comes to colors, there\u2019s absolutely something for everyone.\nOne of our favorite elements of Girlfriend\u2019s better-for-the-planet philosophy is exemplified in the ReGirlfriend program, which encourages customers to send in old Compressive bras, leggings and shorts for a $15 store credit. Girlfriend then recycles the old materials into new ones, which helps close the loop on creating more waste. So maybe there isn\u2019t too much harm in ordering a piece in every single color?\nLululemon\nIf you\u2019re looking for brand recognition, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a piece of activewear more ubiquitous than Lululemon leggings. Popular with yogis, runners and influencers alike, athletic wear from the popular brand is famed for its fashionable look and unbelievably soft materials.\nLululemon\u2019s Align Leggings ($98; lululemon.com) pretty much have their own cult following, thanks to buttery soft Nulu fabric and their flattering shape. If you haven\u2019t splurged on a pair of Lululemon leggings yet, the Align collection might just be the place to start. Not only does it include leggings, but it also features bike shorts, super-high-rise options, wide-leg pants and even tops perfect for all types of exercises.\nBut Lululemon offers so much more than the Align collection, with pieces for any sort of lifestyle, whether you\u2019re going on runs every day or just want some comfy clothes to lounge around in. Its series of sports bras are nearly as popular as its leggings, and its Energy Bra line is fit to handle any workout. Available in cup sizes B through D, these versatile sports bras come in high neck and long line options too.\nIf you\u2019re embracing the WFH life, Lululemon has tons of oversize, comfy options for you as well. From cozy hoodies and sweaters to luxurious joggers and pants, you can find anything you need to snuggle up indoors all day.\nLululemon is one of the most popular brands in the athleisure space, and for good reason. Its wide selection of stylish, comfortable and versatile apparel will carry you through nearly any workout.\nFP Movement\nFree People\u2019s activewear collection features a uniquely boho style that sets it apart from other brands. From the wide range of distinctive colors to stretchier, looser fabrics and cuts, the little details in the brand\u2019s pieces make them a fun step up from your typical athleisure basics.\nThe playful element of the brand\u2019s aesthetic is apparent in its Good Karma set, which includes the Square Neck Good Karma Bra ($48; freepeople.com) and High-Rise 7/8 Length Good Karma Leggings ($78; freepeople.com). Both pieces are available in a huge range of colors, from wardrobe-necessary neutrals to bolder, brighter options like neon yellow, tropical pink and a super-bright blue.\nThey\u2019re made from a combination of spandex and nylon, and as a result they\u2019re incredibly stretchy and body-hugging \u2014 which is important since the pieces are available in only two sizes. While they held up well during our workout classes, we found ourselves turning to them outside of exercising as well. These pieces easily double as everyday clothing, and the wider waistband on the leggings lends a slightly more dressed-up look.\nWhen it comes to special little touches, the High-Rise 7/8 Length You\u2019re a Peach Leggings ($98; freepeople.com) absolutely won our hearts. To start, they\u2019re the perfect leggings to work out in. They\u2019re thick enough to be completely squatproof \u2014 no need to worry about your underwear showing through \u2014 and they\u2019re made of the type of reliable material that you don\u2019t have to worry about ripping.\nThe 7/8 length is perfect even for those who are petite, and the ruched detail adds a fun touch. The leggings have a high waist that sits perfectly, and the real showstopper? The light-reflective accents that both keep you visible if you\u2019re working out at night and accentuate your curves.\nAnd finally, the Hit the Slopes Fleece Jacket ($148; freepeople.com) is a unique and stylish take on a typical fleece jacket. The button snaps are really high quality, and the multiple zippered pockets mean you never have to bring a bag or purse to the gym again.\nCarbon38\nCarbon38 both curates super-stylish activewear and creates its own line of products. And when it comes to head-turning, high fashion-inspired pieces that will have the trendy women in your life in awe of a cropped sweater, Carbon38 is absolutely your destination.\nThe signature High Rise 7/8 Takara Legging ($105; carbon38.com) is something we haven\u2019t really seen before. The material is sleek, with a glossy finish that isn\u2019t quite as dramatic as it looks in pictures on the site (so no worries if it looks a bit intimidating in the image \u2014 it\u2019s gorgeous but not totally liquidy). We paired it with the Cami Bra ($68; carbon38.com), which matches perfectly, for probably the most fashionable workout set we\u2019ve ever seen, let alone tried on.\nThe material is compressive, and the large waistband on the High Rise 7/8 Takara Legging is super comfortable. Again, this might not be the activewear you run a marathon in, but it\u2019s perfect for meeting friends for lunch. And that\u2019s what distinguishes Carbon38 to us as an activewear brand \u2014 it\u2019s really a fashion brand that uses activewear as a way to incorporate comfy but trendy pieces into your everyday life.\nThe Crop Tank ($39; carbon38.com) is, simply put, one of the softest tank tops we\u2019ve ever tried. It\u2019s the perfect cropped length to pair with high-waisted leggings, and just sheer enough to show off whatever cute sports bra you have on underneath.\nSpanx\nSpanx started out with shapewear, but since its beginnings, the brand has expanded and now makes stellar leggings and activewear as well.\nIts Faux Leather Leggings ($98; spanx.com) are immensely popular, and it\u2019s easy to see why. We tried them out for ourselves and adore how stretchy, breathable and stylish they are. They have a high-waisted design and contoured waistband, and they\u2019re center seam-free \u2014 so whether you\u2019re out running errands or doing some yoga at home, you\u2019ll be comfortable and chic.\nIf you\u2019re looking for more traditional activewear, Spanx has got you covered there too. The brand offers sports bras, bike shorts, more leggings and even an exercise skort. The Get Moving Skort ($72; spanx.com) is another one of Spanx\u2019s most popular items, equipped with a built-in liner that wicks away sweat and moisture. Plus, it even has pockets so you can keep your phone and keys nearby when you\u2019re out working up a sweat.\nThe brand also offers a wide range of sizes and inseams, including petite and tall fits, which is a huge bonus if you can never find a pair of leggings that fit just right. So if you want ultimate comfort and style during even your hardest workouts, look no further than Spanx\u2019s collection of leggings, tops and other essentials.\nSweaty Betty\nWhen it comes to sweatproof activewear for anyone who loves a good workout, Sweaty Betty is the winner in our book. The brand has been around for over 20 years now, and in that time it has absolutely nailed apparel that\u2019s both ideal for the studio or gym and perfect for everyday wear.\nWe wore the Power Mesh 7/8 Workout Leggings, which have since been replaced with a meshless pair called the Power 7/8 Workout Leggings ($100; sweatybetty.com). The pair we tried were made from a sleek fabric that feels like it\u2019s optimized for performance. They were extremely sweatproof, and the material almost gets more comfortable as you work out. The current Power Workout Leggings are made from the same material.\nSomething to note, however, is that the Power 7/8 Workout Leggings aren\u2019t high-waisted, which makes them a great option if you prefer to wear leggings with a longer tank top as opposed to a sports bra or crop top. We\u2019re a big fan of the back zip pocket, which (though it didn\u2019t fit our iPhone XR) is the perfect size for keys, a credit card and some cash.\nWe also tried the Athlete Seamless Workout Tank ($48; sweatybetty.com) and the Stamina Sports Bra ($40; sweatybetty.com), and the Athlete Seamless Workout Tank is exactly what it sounds like: a super-versatile tank ideal for just about any activity we can think of. It\u2019s sweat-wicking, flattering and works perfectly with any pair of leggings.\nWhile some gym clothes sort of hug your curves and accentuate them, we found that all the Sweaty Betty products were more compressing and really held everything in. For this reason, we imagine the leggings and tank top would be great for runners, boxers and those who prefer higher-impact workouts.\nThe Stamina Sports Bra is designed to offer medium support up to a C cup, and we found it ideal for lower-impact activity. That being said, it\u2019s a sports bra so comfortable you can wear it to the gym and keep it on all day long. It\u2019s not restrictive or bulky, and it paired perfectly with the Athlete Seamless Workout Tank. The pieces we tried performed so well during sweaty workouts and still felt clean and lightweight post-sweat sesh.\nOutdoor Voices\nOutdoor Voices is a brand that has completely embraced all things athleisure as a lifestyle. It stresses the idea of \u201cfreeing fitness from performance\u201d and believes activity can be a part of anyone\u2019s everyday life \u2014 and its activewear reflects that.\nOutdoor Voices carries a wide range of activewear for different types of activity. Our absolute favorite piece from the collection is the Exercise Dress ($100; outdoorvoices.com), which we\u2019ve written about in depth before. In many ways, it exemplifies everything that Outdoor Voices has nailed as an activewear brand: It\u2019s super versatile, great for activity that intertwines with your everyday life (like hiking, jogging, walking with friends or biking) and brings something playful, simple and unique to the activewear space.\nIn true Outdoor Voices fashion, it\u2019s not about performance \u2014 it\u2019s about comfortable, functional pieces that work with whatever your lifestyle is.\nIn terms of more traditional workout gear, we tested the Doing Things Bra ($58; outdoorvoices.com) and found it to be comfortable and supportive, though it wasn\u2019t completely sweatproof in our experience. During a barre class, we had some sweat gather in the middle of the sports bra and show through. So we would definitely recommend this for outdoor or more casual activity where you won\u2019t be sweating heavily."

            "Trump to nominate longtime skeptic to head Bureau of Labor Statistics. President Donald Trump announced Monday that he planned to nominate E.J. Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nTrump said in a Truth Social post that \"E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"\nAntoni\u2019s planned nomination comes after Trump fired former commissioner Erika McEntarfer hours after a weaker-than-expected jobs report on Aug. 1. Trump said, without evidence, that the jobs report for July was \u201cRIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.\u201d\nAntoni did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment Monday.\nSteve Bannon, a senior adviser to Trump in his first term, had been pushing hard for Antoni\u2019s nomination. Antoni, a contributor to the Project 2025 policy rubric, has been a longtime skeptic of BLS data. On Bannon\u2019s podcast last week, Antoni called for McEntarfer to be fired shortly before Trump pulled the trigger.\nAs chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, Antoni has written a number of pieces for the think tank that are highly complimentary of the Trump administration. One of his recent reports said that the June jobs report, before it was revised, was a \u201chome run\u201d for the president.\nMultiple former BLS commissioners said after McEntarfer's firing that the head of labor statistics does not have a role in compiling the jobs report and is only briefed on its figures shortly before it is released to the public.\nIn that report, the BLS reported that the U.S. economy added just 73,000 jobs in July. The agency also said it had revised the May and June numbers and that they turned out to be lower than previously announced, by more than 200,000 jobs.\nThe BLS routinely revises economic data such as the jobs report, gross domestic product figures and inflation data. Due to the scale of the U.S. economy and response rates to BLS surveys, there can often be lags in data collection. But that lag does not imply any wrongdoing or manipulation.\nThe data that the bureau produces is massively important to businesses, policy makers and government agencies because without it, the true condition of the U.S. economy might be harder to determine.\nThe accuracy of the data that BLS produces is \"built on a foundation of trust,\" JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist said last week. Economists widely warned that firing of McEntarfer could pose a risk to global markets, financial stability and the overall U.S. economy because so much rests on the integrity of the agency's data.\nThe BLS data and that of other U.S. statistics agencies have so far been considered the gold standard globally because historically those government entities have been allowed to operate with little to no political interference.\nJason Furman, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the White House under President Barack Obama, said Monday that \"E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant experience.\"\n\"He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats,\" Furman added in a post on X.\nRachel Bovard, vice president of programs at the Conservative Partnership Institute, called Antoni \u201cwhip smart, passionate, and committed to excellence \u2014 three qualities that will turn the BLS from an agency that\u2019s apparently still playing catch up with accurate data to one which is transparent, reliable, and correct.\u201d\nMany previous commissioners served across administrations, such as Trump's nominee to the agency during his first term. William Beach, nominated in 2019, served through March 2023. Keith Hall, nominated by President George W. Bush, took up the commissioner role in January 2008 and continued until January 2012 under President Barack Obama.\nPresident Joe Biden nominated McEntarfer in July 2023.

Trump nominates economist at the Heritage Foundation as the new BLS commissioner\nPresident Donald Trump announced he is nominating EJ Antoni, the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, as the next commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\u201cOur Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\nThe nomination comes after Trump fired the BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer earlier this month after the release of a weak jobs report.\nAntoni has previously voiced concerns about revisions to the jobs data at BLS.\n\u201cThere are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data \u2013 that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\u201d Antoni posted on X earlier this month.\nWe are wrapping up our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the day, but will be back at it on Tuesday. In the meantime, here are the latest developments:\nPresident Donald Trump has nominated conservative economist EJ Antoni to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that is responsible for collecting and publishing the country\u2019s employment and inflation figures. The nomination comes after Trump fired the BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, earlier this month following the release of a weak jobs report which he claimed had been \u201crigged\u201d.\nTrump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized control of the city\u2019s police force, describing a \u201clawless\u201d city in ways that are sharply at odds with official crime statistics. The US president\u2019s move was swiftly condemned as a \u201cdisgusting, dangerous and derogatory\u201d assault on the political independence of a racially diverse city. The federal takeover is expected to be in effect for 30 days.\nTrump has once again delayed implementing sweeping tariffs on China, announcing another 90-day pause just hours before the last agreement between the world\u2019s two largest economies was due to expire. On Monday, Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for higher tariffs on China until 10 November.\nA federal judge in San Francisco on Monday began hearing evidence and arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed national guard soldiers and US marines to Los Angeles after protests over immigration raids this summer. The Trump administration federalized California national guard members and sent them to the second-largest US city over the objections of the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and city leaders.\nTrump previewed his Friday meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, claiming he will know \u201cprobably in the first two minutes\u201d whether a peace deal can be made. Trump confirmed that while Volodymyr Zelenskyy wouldn\u2019t be a part of the summit, he would call him first as soon as he saw a \u201cfair deal\u201d for a ceasefire emerge. He also didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of a future trading relationship with Russia.\nA federal judge rejected on Monday a request from the justice department to unseal the grand jury transcripts relating to the criminal investigation of Ghislaine Maxwell \u2013 Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. The judge wrote that the transcripts could not be released publicly \u2013 \u201ccasually or promiscuously\u201d \u2013 as Trump\u2019s government had pushed for because it would risk \u201cunraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised\u201d.\nA federal judge has barred the Trump administration from withholding federal funding from the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit created by Congress to promote democracy worldwide, The New York Times reports.\nIn a 15-page ruling, judge Dabney L Friedrich of the US District Court for the District of Columbia found that the administration withheld the money \u201cfor impermissible policy reasons,\u201d causing the nonprofit irreparable harm, including layoffs of staff and the suspension of several democracy-promoting programs.\n\u201cThese harms to the endowment\u2019s global reputation and to the \u2018very existence of its programs\u2019 are irreparable,\u201d judge Friedrich wrote. She ordered the release of $95m in federal funds to the nonprofit, roughly 30 percent of its annual budget.\nMy colleague Lauren Gambino and I are looking over the latest details on the nomination of EJ Antoni as the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here\u2019s what to know:\nDonald Trump nominated Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, after the president fired Erika McEntarfer earlier this month following the release of a weak jobs report which he claimed, without evidence, had been \u201crigged\u201d.\nThe Senate will have to confirm his nomination to lead the BLS, an independent agency under the labor department. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that former White House adviser and rightwing provocateur Steve Bannon had advocated for Antoni\u2019s nomination.\nIn a statement on X, labor secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said Antoni would \u201cprovide the American people with fair and accurate economic data they can rely on\u201d.\nHouse Republicans on Monday backed Trump\u2019s moves to take control of the DC police force and deploy the national guard in the capital.\nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee chair James Comer said he will summon mayor Muriel Bowser, council chair Phil Mendelson, and attorney general Brian Schwalb to Capitol Hill next month for a hearing.\nThe public questioning would come as the 30-day expiration of Trump\u2019s takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department approaches, which would require congressional action to extend.\n\u201cFor years, the D.C. Council\u2019s radical, soft-on-crime agenda has emboldened criminals and put public safety at risk in our nation\u2019s capital,\u201d Comer said in a statement.\nAccording to a letter posted on X by the Republican-led Oversight Committee, the panel was notified of Trump\u2019s plans to use the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes.\nChinese officials said earlier on Monday that they hoped the United States would strive for \u201cpositive\u201d trade outcomes, as the 90-day detente reached between the two countries in May was due to expire.\nCurrently, US exports to China, one of the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, are subject to tariffs of about 30%. Imports from China are subject to a baseline tariff of 10% and a 20% extra tariff in response to fentanyl smuggling allegations against China. Some products are taxed at higher rates.\nTrump spreads false narratives about DC crime \u2013 just as he did with LA\nDonald Trump is deploying the national guard in Washington DC and seizing control of its police force, claiming that the nation\u2019s capital has become \u201clawless\u201d and is \u201cone of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world\u201d.\nThe president portrayed himself as DC\u2019s savior, vowing to rid it of \u201ccrime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse\u201d.\nTrump\u2019s portrayal of Washington DC, where he has been forced to reside as president, cutting short his time in his beloved Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, did not come as a surprise. He\u2019s presented DC as a \u201cnightmare of murder and crime\u201d before, and already in February was reported to be mulling a law-enforcement crackdown.\nNor is it the only major American city in his crosshairs. \u201cLos Angeles has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals. Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations,\u201d Trump said in June, while deploying the national guard to quell protests there.\nJust as Los Angeles in June wasn\u2019t overrun with insurrectionist mobs \u2013 the protests were largely confined to a few city blocks \u2013 Trump\u2019s portrayal of crime in Washington DC has little to do with facts, but instead, are rooted in false and misleading claims about crime and homelessness, experts say.\n\u2018Red meat to throw to his base\u2019: DC residents on Trump\u2019s police takeover\nAs Donald Trump convened reporters at the White House on Monday morning to announce his plans for sending the national guard on to Washington DC streets and taking over the police department, protesters gathered a block away to denounce what they saw as his plans to put the federal district under his thumb.\n\u201cNothing Trump is doing right now is about our safety,\u201d Keya Chatterjee, executive director of Free DC, a group advocating for the city\u2019s autonomy, told the 200 or so people gathered on a block of 16th Street Northwest that had once been called Black Lives Matter Plaza, before the city government ordered the name stripped shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration this year.\n\u201cWhat we know from history is that authoritarians always want to control the capital and the people in the capital city. It\u2019s because it\u2019s the fastest way to silence dissent and to accelerate their agenda. And I want to be clear, this is not about crime. This is about what Trump is trying to do to DC in order to take over DC and silence us.\u201d\nLamont Mitchell was not so sure. A lifelong Washingtonian who resides among the poorer and more crime-stricken neighborhoods east of the Anacostia river, he regarded Trump\u2019s plans for the homeless as \u201cinhumane\u201d, but was open to his ideas for making the city\u2019s streets safer. Mitchell described how he avoids certain areas on his drive home for fear of being struck by a stray bullet, no longer walks down certain blocks, had his RV stolen and plans to buy a gun.\n\u201cAs a senior in Washington, I need to feel safe,\u201d said 69-year-old Mitchell, who chairs the Anacostia Coordinating Council community organization. \u201cWe gotta take drastic action when drastic action is called for.\u201d\nRead the full story by The Guardian\u2019s Chris Stein here:\nTrump nominates economist at the Heritage Foundation as the new BLS commissioner\nPresident Donald Trump announced he is nominating EJ Antoni, the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, as the next commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\u201cOur Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\nThe nomination comes after Trump fired the BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer earlier this month after the release of a weak jobs report.\nAntoni has previously voiced concerns about revisions to the jobs data at BLS.\n\u201cThere are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data \u2013 that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\u201d Antoni posted on X earlier this month.\nThe CDC has tightened security following an attack on Friday on its Atlanta headquarters that left a police officer and the gunman dead, Reuters reports.\nMeasures include having most employees work from home this week and removing vehicle decals showing where they work.\nBoth local and federal law enforcement are \u201cconducting intensive monitoring of all potential threats to CDC and its staff,\u201d the agency\u2019s acting chief operating officer Christa Capozzola in an email to staff over the weekend.\nAn \u201call-staff\u201d meeting on Tuesday will become a virtual-only event, CDC director Susan Monarez said in a separate email, according to the news wire. She said teams were working to determine \u201cour workplace posture\u201d moving forward.\nA union representing CDC employees demanded that the federal government condemn vaccine misinformation after it was known that the shooter blamed the Covid-19 vaccination for making him depressed and suicidal.\nIn a statement, Mike Zamore, the ACLU\u2019s national director of policy and government affairs, called Donald Trump\u2019s actions to federalise the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington an \u201cassault on our fundamental freedoms\u201d.\n\u201cHe is using the word \u2018emergency\u2019 as a blank check for asserting federal control whenever it suits his agenda \u2013 abusing emergency powers while militarizing our communities and endangering the very people he is sworn to protect\u201d, said Zamore.\nMonica Hopkins, the executive director of the ACLU of DC, called the move \u201cpolitical theater and a blatantly phony justification for abuse of emergency powers.\u201d\nHopkins added: \u201cThe president foreshadowed that if these heavy-handed tactics take root here, they will be rolled out to other majority-Black and Brown cities, like Chicago, Oakland, and Baltimore, across the country. That should alarm everyone, not just Washingtonians\u201d.\nThe DC Council, the chief policy-making authority for the district, issued a statement calling Trump\u2019s move to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department \u201cunwarranted\u201d and \u201ca manufactured intrusion on local authority.\u201d\n\u201cViolent crime in the District is at the lowest rates we\u2019ve seen in 30 years,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cFederalizing the Metropolitan Police Department is unwarranted because there is no Federal emergency. Further, the National Guard has no public safety training or knowledge of local laws. The Guard\u2019s role does not include investigating or solving crimes in the District. Calling out the National Guard is an unnecessary deployment with no real mission,\u201d added the council.\nTrump plans to impose a 100% tariff on imported computer chips, a move experts warn could lead companies to pull back on production or raise prices, but could favor Intel as a US-based semiconductor firm.\nOver the weekend, more details emerged about the fatal attack on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that took place on Friday, killing a police officer. In case you missed it:\nWe reported that the shooter had blamed a Covid-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal. The suspect\u2019s father contacted police and said his son was upset about the death of his dog, and had also become fixated on the Covid-19 vaccine.\nA union representing CDC employees demanded that the federal government condemn vaccine misinformation after it was known that the shooter blamed the Covid-19 vaccine. The CDC workers\u2019 union said the deadly violence was not random and \u201ccompounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured\u201d. It said vaccine misinformation had put scientists at risk.\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation named Patrick Joseph White as the shooter. After firing shots at the CDC campus near Emory University on Friday, White was found dead on the second floor of the pharmacy building.\nAndriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has recently discussed diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine with secretary of state Marco Rubio.\nOn Monday, Yermak said in a post on X that Rubio was briefed \u201con active communications with our partners,\u201d including a meeting with US vice-president JD Vance.\n\u201cWe coordinated our positions ahead of important diplomatic steps planned for this week,\u201d Yermak said in the post. \u201cFor Ukraine, the priority is a just and lasting peace, which requires an unconditional ceasefire as a prerequisite for substantive negotiations, as well as increased pressure on Russia to take real steps in this direction.\u201d\nThe post comes after UK foreign secretary David Lammy and Vance held a meeting with Ukrainian and European partners in Britain over the weekend, where leaders discussed the drive for peace in Ukraine.\nDonald Trump and Vladimir Putin are slated to meet on Friday in Alaska to discuss ways forward to end the years-long war.\nGavin Newsom tried to play nice with Maga. But then in June, Donald Trump sent the national guard to LA, to quell immigration protests following Ice raids on the city, and the California governor went scorched-earth on the new administration.\nSince then Newsom\u2019s social media exchanges with Trump and his White House have taunted and trolled, factchecked and alarm-sounded.\nFollowing Trump\u2019s announcement on Monday that he\u2019s activating the National Guard in the nation\u2019s capital and taking over Washington\u2019s police department, Newsom\u2019s social media team set to work.\nNewsom warned in one post that other cities were next (and reminded followers that he had predicted this might happen back in June.)\nHis press office grabbed a screenshot of the Trump officials looking bewildered.\nThe team continued its full-frontal social assault, peppering Trump with tweets on the DC takeover, tariffs and his partisan redistricting plan. They deployed a Taco tariffs meme (Trump always chickens out) in response to the news that Trump and China extended their truce for another 90 days. They questioned how Attorney General Pam Bondi, who they said \u201ccouldn\u2019t find the Epstein files\u201d might fare as the head of the newly installed DC police department.\nThey even fired off a Trump-style all-caps missive warning that California would redistrict if he did not call on Texas to stand down.\nFollowing the DC mayor's press conference, here's a recap of the day so far\nDonald Trump is launching a federal takeover of DC Metropolitan police department (MPD), and deploying 800 national guardsmen to assist local law enforcement. He declared crime in the city a \u201cpublic safety emergency\u201d in a press conference earlier, invoking a section of the DC Home Rule Act which places MPD under federal control. It\u2019s expected to last 30 days, according to the White House.\nDC\u2019s mayor Muriel Bowser said today that her office plans to comply and cooperate with federal government, but noted there are questions about the \u201csubjectivity\u201d of the emergency declaration. DC has seen a notable drop in violent crime, and even saw a record 30-year low in 2024, according to the justice department.\nBeyond Washington, Trump also previewed his Friday meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, claiming he will know \u201cprobably in the first two minutes\u201d whether a peace deal can be made. Trump confirmed that while Volodymyr Zelenskyy wouldn\u2019t be a part of the summit, he would call him first as soon as he saw a \u201cfair deal\u201d for a ceasefire emerge. He also didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of a future trading relationship with Russia.\nAnd while the ongoing redistricting battle across the US wasn\u2019t the main story of the day, California governor Gavin Newsom said that he will be \u201cforced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states\u201d in a letter to Donald Trump. Newsom said he would be left with no choice if the president can\u2019t get governor Greg Abbott to drop his push to redraw Texas\u2019 congressional maps mid-decade.\nIn a statement, Democratic congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who serves as the House minority leader, said that the president\u2019s plan to federalise the DC police department and deploy the National Guard had \u201chas no basis in law and will put the safety of the people of our Nation\u2019s capital in danger\u201d.\nHe added:\nThe violent crime rate in Washington DC is at a 30-year low. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t care about public safety. On his first day in office, he pardoned hundreds of violent felons \u2013 many of whom brazenly assaulted law enforcement officers on January 6. We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.\nOn the president\u2019s statements earlier that he would be comfortable bringing the military into DC if he deems it necessary, Muriel Bowser says that \u201cwe don\u2019t believe it\u2019s legal to use the American military against American citizens on American soil\u201d.\nTrump did, however, bring in out-of-state, unfederalised national guard troops during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.\nBowser does note that she suspected that the national guard would be deployed, but had no prior knowledge of the federal takeover of the Metropolitan police department."

            "I spent 2 nights in a tiny home hotel in Germany. 7 things surprised me about the 2-story, 100-square-foot house.. I've stayed in small spaces around the world, from tiny homes to trailers and train sleeper cabins.\n-\nWith a surprising design and clever storage hacks, a tiny home in Germany impressed me most of all.\n-\nThe 100-square-foot space was a two-story, tube-shaped home that felt unexpectedly spacious.\n-\nThere's something extra satisfying about occupying a space that is so efficiently used. Seeing clever storage hacks and multipurpose furniture that make a tiny home feel larger is like visual ASMR to me.\nThat's why I stay in little accommodations around the world \u2014 from a lifeguard tower in Miami, to sleeper train cabins in the US and Europe, to an Airstream trailer in Austria.\nBut I don't think any of those past stays were as impressive as a tiny home hotel in Germany that I booked for two nights in 2022. The $70-a-night accommodation surprised me with its design, technology, and space-saving solutions.\nWhen searching for a place to stay outside Berlin, I was intrigued by a 100-square-foot home I found on Airbnb in Neustrelitz.\nThe accommodation was part of a tiny home hotel called Slube, which designs minimal, concrete \"Slubes\" for up to two people, according to the company's website.\nSlube has three locations around Germany. The location in Neustrelitz has 10 accommodations.\nThere are three types of Slubes: Basic, which is one story; Home, which is two stories; and Tower, which adds a rooftop terrace.\nI booked a Slube Home for two nights for $140. It was 16 feet tall with two floors totaling 106 square feet. It had a lounging area, a bathroom, and a loft bedroom.\nIt was smaller than any tiny home I'd booked in the US.\nThe concept of a tiny cylindrical home was completely new to me.\nI'd never stayed in a tiny home remotely resembling this tubular shape before. Even a livable barrel I booked in Switzerland wasn't quite as unique, given its one-story layout inside.\nI was surprised by the home's shape and excited by the prospect of sleeping in a tiny space fashioned like a standing cylinder.\nUpon arrival, I was surprised that the home had high-tech features I'd never seen before, from checking in with my phone to controlling the room temperature from bed.\nWhen I arrived at the tiny home by train from the airport in Berlin, there didn't seem to be any employees on the property.\nAn email from Slube informed me I'd be staying in room five and could check in by myself. This immediately surprised me because, in the past, a host has always either met me or provided directions on where to access a key on the property.\nInstead, I checked into my Slube with a code sent to my phone. It was a pleasant surprise that I didn't have to keep track of a key during my stay for the first time.\nOnce inside, I found that the Slube had additional smart features I hadn't seen before. I controlled the lights and temperature of each story of the home from my phone, which I accessed from my web browser. This made my stay feel a little more luxurious than expected since I didn't ever have to get out of bed to adjust either control.\nIt was my first time staying in a tiny home with a ladder.\nEach story was 53 square feet. The first level included the bathroom, a sitting area with a fold-out table and coffee nook, and a ladder to the second lofted floor, where I'd be sleeping.\nThis was my first time climbing a ladder in a tiny home to reach my bed (save for upper train bunks). I thought climbing was easy, but it could be challenging for some.\nThere was a latched gate at the top of the ladder, which I imagine was built to keep people safe from falling. This made me feel like a kid in a playhouse, which was fun.\nUpstairs, I wasn't expecting to have a nightstand in a 53-square-foot bedroom.\nAfter staying in tiny spaces so often, I no longer expect to have a nightstand to store my electronics and water bottle. And this bedroom was smaller than most I've slept in.\nSo I was surprised when I spotted a lower platform surrounding the bed that doubled as a nightstand. It had easily accessible outlets, a pocket for the TV remote, and more space for my belongings, including my water bottle.\nThis saved me from having to go down the ladder every time I was thirsty, which I appreciated.\nBack downstairs, the bathroom didn't feel as cramped as I thought it would.\nSince the home was tinier than others I've stayed in, I knew the bathroom would likely be smaller than most.\nI was initially concerned that I might feel as cramped as I did in Amtrak's sleeper train bedroom, where the shower head was above the same space as the toilet.\nTo my surprise, the bathroom felt spacious. It was designed unlike any I'd seen, with a shower curtain separating the shower head and sink from the toilet and storage space. I thought the shower was positioned far enough away from the toilet to make them feel like two separate rooms.\nOn the first floor, I was surprised I didn't have to sacrifice privacy to let natural light in through the windows.\nWhen I stay in tiny homes, I always appreciate letting in as much natural light as possible because it makes the space feel bigger.\nBut I often stay close to busy streets or other homes and prefer to shut the window curtains for privacy, leaving me in a tight, dark space.\nSince this was a hotel with other tiny homes close to mine, I expected a similar scenario. That's why I was surprised when all the windows on the first floor had a film covering most of the glass, allowing me to let light in without worrying that other guests could see inside.\nI had never seen this in a tiny home before, and I loved not having to sacrifice natural light for privacy. I thought it was a great tool that could be applied to any home in proximity to other people.\nAs I checked out, I thought that somehow, the tiniest home I'd ever experienced was also among the most comfortable, and that was the most surprising part.\nI thought these surprising attributes made this tiny home feel more comfortable than most while leaving no space unused. I fully recommend it to tiny space enthusiasts like me around the world.\nAxel Springer, Insider Inc.'s parent company, is an investor in Airbnb.",

So it stands to reason that interior design is a pretty important part of having a living space. This is considerably easier said than done, so it can always be helpful to explore other folks\u2019 ideas.\nWe\u2019ve gathered some of the most unique and interesting home decor ideas that people have shared online. So get ready to get inspired, make yourself comfortable, upvote your favorites and be sure to add your own thoughts and experiences in the comments below.\nThis post may include affiliate links.\nThis Is My Downstairs Powder Room\nSince it's only 3' x 5', I thought the remodeling job would be easy. Nope. Took me about 8 weeks to complete. My home is from the Victorian-Era (circa 1900). I know this isn't everyone's cup of tea but I like it.\nBefore And After Of Our Ugly Bathroom\nBefore And After: Kitty Room!\nTurning a house into a home need not cost an arm and a leg or require expert interior design skills, some basic, sound decisions can help one make a house a cozy, inviting, and comfortable home. With an understanding of some simple interior design principles, one can make their house a homelike space where people are inclined to be, unwind, and connect.\nLighting is perhaps the most powerful tool to make a room feel cozy. Good lighting sets the mood of the room and dictates how we feel within it. Instead of overhead lighting alone, work to layer light across your house. Combine ceiling lights with floor lamps, table lamps, wall sconces, and even string lights or candles. Choose warm-toned soft bulbs that produce a cozy warm light rather than harsh, white light. The atmosphere must be welcoming no matter the time of day.\nI Wallpapered My Built In Shelves And I\u2019m In Love\nPosted here for some advice on refreshing this room a few months ago and got some good advice that the shelves weren\u2019t working as a focal point in the room with all the clear glass items (swipe for before photo). I didn\u2019t want to get rid of the wineglasses etc since this a useful place for them so I added wallpaper to give it some pop and I love how it turned out.\nStill working on making some small changes to the room but I\u2019m thrilled with what a difference the wallpaper has made.\nUsually A Demo And Exterior Guy. Don't Crush My Pantry. Before And Afters\nNursery Makeover Before And After\nWe wanted a gender-neutral nursery with nature elements and a warm, sunny and cozy vibe. Missing a rug and a side table but it's pretty much ready \ud83d\udc9b\nWarm colors are also essential in warm interior design. Neutrals such as beige, taupe, pale gray, and creamy white form a relaxing base that's easy to work from. The addition of accent colors, like muted blues, forest greens, terracotta, or mustard yellow, provides depth and warmth without overwhelming the room. These colors work well in various cushions, rugs, curtains, artworks, or painted furniture. Choosing a unifying color scheme throughout the home can also foster flow and calm.\nMy Husband Built Floating Shelves With Grow Lights For Some Of My Plants, And I Painted A Mural Behind Them\nGave Our Small Bathroom A Budget Makeover - Thoughts? (After/Before Pics)\nI Saved And Reupholstered My Chairs. Results Are Better Than Expected\nI hate how people treat solid functional furniture as disposable. A good piece like these can last a couple generations easy with repairs and refreshes periodically.\nTexture is crucial in making coziness. A space is warmer when it is layered with different materials and surfaces. Think of a plush rug on a hardwood floor, a chunky knit afghan draped over a velvet armchair, linen drapes billowing in front of an open window, or wicker baskets overflowing with magazines and throw blankets. Nature-derived materials like wood, wool, leather, and cotton are grounding and textured. Swapping out throw pillows every season or adding a new table runner can even add warmth and personality.\nUnder Stairs Reading Nook\nMy husband and I built this reading nook and I couldn\u2019t be more in love! (Will be adding a cabinet door to that empty space under the little fireplace and eventually making the fireplace look built in but that can wait)\nThe Thing We Love The Most About Our Home: Having A Private Library\nI Would Be Chuffed Too\nDon\u2019t forget to think about how furniture is laid out. Arrange space so that it feels open and accessible, yet still encourages closeness and intimacy. Place furniture in groupings to encourage conversation, put sofas and chairs facing one another rather than all facing a TV. Include plenty of comfy seating with cushions and throws in close distance. If you have a large window or fireplace, consider featuring it as a focal point to extend the sense of warmth or feeling of being close to nature.\nJust Finished Our Front Room And We\u2019re In Love! Ceiling Tiles Are From Amazon\nOur First Room Renovation In Our First Home. How\u2019d We Do?\nBefore And After Office Remodel\nPersonal touches turn a house into a home. Having pictures of family members, artwork you love, books you've read, and vacation souvenirs gives the space the feeling of being lived-in and meaningful. Don't fret about mixing styles, warmth comes more from authenticity and charm than from coordinating furnishings. A vintage lamp, a handmade bowl, or a worn leather chair can each carry a story and give your home soul.\nEmerald Green Bathroom (Finally Finished)\nBathroom In 1931 Spanish Revival House In San Marino\nWas scared to scroll thought this was before being destroyed. I like it a lot.\nCloset Door Makeover!\nBringing plants into your home is a simple method of adding warmth and health. Houseplants bring color and freshness to the room and will purify the air. Even a single or twin plant, a potted fern, peace lily, or hanging ivy, will moderate a room and make it more lively. Should you lack a green thumb yourself, dried flowers or high-quality artificial plants will still provide visual warmth.\nKitchen Reno - Reused And Reconfigured Existing Cabinets\nBefore & After (Well, During)\nFinal Library Reveal!\nLastly, balance neatness with coziness. A cozy house is not immaculate, it\u2019s relaxed and lived-in. Instead of attempting to create a showplace, think about how the room works in your life. Create tiny spaces where people tend to gather or pause, a reading nook with a light and a chair, a breakfast table by the window, a soft rug where children play. These small, intentional gaps introduce character and coziness into a house.\nIt\u2019s Simple, But I\u2019m Happy With This Shelf I Built\nWe Love This Triangle Bookshelf\nWanted A Dark And Moody Office\nUltimately, coziness is more about sensation than appearance. By paying attention to light, color, texture, order, and individuality, you can create a space that's warm, functional, and full of personality. Irrespective of whether you have a small apartment or a large house, thoughtful design can turn any room into a sanctuary of comfort.\nStained Glass Nightstand Lamp Made By Me\nDaughter's Nursery\nI love that it is so colorful, very important for babies.\nGave My Front Door Some New Life Today!\nPantry Reno Before & After\nSlowly but surely turning this builder grade house into a home one project at a time! My goal was to have a neutral space with increased storage and functionality. We also took the opportunity to open up the wall to put in power outlets and run a water line to the wall where the stovetop is so we could drill through and install a pot filler.\nThe pantry was full to brim before the cabinets went up since the shelves were so narrow (they were also bowing from the lack of supports on the long side, why builder?!?) and now I have tons of empty space. A local company installed the cabinets and butcher block counter and then we did the tile backsplash. I\u2019m considering some more fun/unique cabinet hardware but the current hardware matches what is in the kitchen and mudroom so I\u2019m going to live with it a while and reconsider later\nMy Primary Closet Had Lots Of Wasted Space. I Designed/Created A Dedicated Office In There, Still Keeping Enough Room For A Closet.

Eventually we will hang a wine rack to the left and turn part of the butcher block to a coffee station as well.\nLean Into Your Pink Tiles\nWe bought our house in 2017. When we moved in, I hated our 1952 pink tiles. I almost painted them. But my dad said, \"wait a few years. They will be back in style\" now I'm so glad we didn't.\nI really leaned into the vintage vibes and added gold accents and stenciling to look like wallpaper. I'm so happy w how it turned out. These tiles were handmade in Italy and done so well. I wouldn't be able to replace them w anything of real quality and it would gut me to break them all up.\nSo embrace your old house and really lean into what makes it unique instead of fighting it.\nGuest Bathroom Glow-Up, From Shed To Sea\nWe Turned Our Tiny Box Room Into A Bedroom For Our Baby Daughter\nFront Porch Before And After\nHubby Thought The Tissue Paper Was Silly.

I originally planned on more geometric shapes (more bauhaus circles, less squiggly eggs), but quickly realized I wasn\u2019t going to be able to draw those lines with my human hand. I used a level to draw the square lines that the shapes butt up against, but everything else is freehand.\nI spent a lot of time looking at example/inspo photos of murals to figure out general layout and proportions. I used a pencil to draw the shapes, then hand painted without taping.\nI chose paint colors in the store based on the little paper color cards. It seemed like I was choosing very muted colors, but they look much stronger on the wall. The whole time I wasn\u2019t sure how it would turn out, but I told myself \u201cif i don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll just paint over it.\u201d I regret starting with red, as it was my least favorite color of the bunch. As the red paint went on, I just thought \u201cabstract geometric period stain!\u201d but I kept going. It looked better with each color added.

My grown up children were very close to their stepdad and hated seeing the room with the special care stuff in it. I decided it was time for a change as we need the room.

            "Trump announces another 90-day pause on China tariffs. Donald Trump has once again delayed implementing sweeping tariffs on China, announcing another 90-day pause just hours before the last agreement between the world\u2019s two largest economies was due to expire.\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for higher tariffs on China until 10 November, officials confirmed to Reuters.\nChinese officials said earlier in the day they hoped the United States would strive for \u201cpositive\u201d trade outcomes on Monday, as the 90-day detente reached between the two countries in May was due to expire.\nChina\u2019s commerce ministry, in a statement on early Tuesday, said it will suspend additional tariffs on US goods for 90 more days, after Trump signed an executive order extending the tariff truce.\nChina will maintain its tariffs on US goods at 10%, the statement said, and take action to address non-tariff barriers facing American products. China will also postpone for 90 days the addition of US firms it had targeted in April to trade and investment restriction lists.\n\u201cWe hope that the US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the phone call between the two heads of state \u2026 and strive for positive outcomes on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\u201d a foreign ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, said in an earlier statement Monday.\nChinese and US officials said they expected the pause to be extended after the most recent round of trade talks held last month in Stockholm. Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, said last week the US had \u201cthe makings\u201d of a trade deal with China and that he was optimistic about a path forward.\nFailure to reach a deal would have major consequences. Trump had threatened tariffs on China as high as 245%, with China threatening retaliatory tariffs of 125%, setting off a trade war between the world\u2019s largest economies.\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on TruthSocial that China should quadruple its purchases of soybeans from the US to help reduce the trade deficit between the US and China.\nCurrently, US exports to China are subject to tariffs of about 30%, with imports from China subject to a baseline tariff of 10% and a 20% extra tariff in response to fentanyl smuggling allegations against China. Some products are taxed at higher rates. US exports to China are subject to tariffs of about 30%\nThe Federal Reserve and many economists have argued that the tariffs will push up prices in the US. Goldman Sachs strategists calculate that US consumers have absorbed 22% of tariff costs through June 2025. That share is expected to rise to 67% if recent tariffs follow the same pattern as earlier ones.\nBefore the tariff deadline, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenue from advanced chips sold to China in exchange for export licenses to the market.\nStephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, told Bloomberg of the deal: \u201cWhat we are seeing is in effect the monetization of US trade policy in which US companies must pay the US government for permission to export. If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ve entered into a new and dangerous world.\u201d\nAssociated Press and Reuters contributed to this story",

US, China extend tariff truce by 90 days, staving off surge in duties\nThe new order prevents US tariffs on Chinese goods from shooting up to 145 per cent, while Chinese tariffs on US goods were set to hit 125 per cent - rates that would have resulted in a virtual trade embargo between the two countries. PHOTO: EPA\n-\n[WASHINGTON] The United States and China on Monday extended a tariff truce for another 90 days, staving off triple-digit duties on each other\u2019s goods as US retailers get ready to ramp up inventories ahead of the critical end-of-year holiday season.\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he had signed an executive order suspending the imposition of higher tariffs until 12.01 am EST (0501 GMT) on Nov 10, with all other elements of the truce to remain in place.\nChina\u2018s Commerce Ministry issued a parallel pause on extra tariffs early on Tuesday, also postponing for 90 days the addition of US firms it had targeted in April to trade and investment restriction lists.\n\u201cThe United States continues to have discussions with the PRC to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and our resulting national and economic security concerns,\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order stated, using the acronym for the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\u201cThrough these discussions, the PRC continues to take significant steps toward remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and addressing the concerns of the United States relating to economic and national security matters.\u201d\nThe tariff truce between Beijing and Washington had been due to expire on Tuesday at 12.01 am EDT (0401 GMT). The extension until early November buys crucial time for the seasonal autumn surge of imports for the Christmas season, including electronics, apparel and toys at lower tariff rates.\nBT in your inbox\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe new order prevents US tariffs on Chinese goods from shooting up to 145 per cent, while Chinese tariffs on US goods were set to hit 125 per cent - rates that would have resulted in a virtual trade embargo between the two countries. It locks in place - at least for now - a 30 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, with Chinese duties on US imports at 10 per cent.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump told a news conference earlier on Monday, highlighting what he called his good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nChina said the extension was \u201ca measure to further implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state during their June 5 call,\u201d and would provide stability to the global economy.\nTrump told CNBC last week that the US and China were getting very close to a trade agreement and he would meet with Xi before the end of the year if a deal was struck.\n\u201cIt\u2019s positive news,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a former senior US trade official who is now a vice-president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cCombined with some of the de-escalatory steps both the United States and China have taken in recent weeks, it demonstrated that both sides are trying to see if they can reach some kind of a deal that would lay the groundwork for a Xi-Trump meeting this fall.\u201d\nTrade \u2018detente\u2019 continued\nThe two sides in May announced a truce in their trade dispute after talks in Geneva, Switzerland, agreeing to a 90-day period to allow further talks. They met again in Stockholm, Sweden, in late July, and US negotiators returned to Washington with a recommendation that Trump extend the deadline.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the triple-digit import duties both sides slapped on each other\u2019s goods in the spring were untenable and had essentially imposed a trade embargo between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a Trump-style negotiation if it didn\u2019t go right down to the wire,\u201d said Kelly Ann Shaw, a senior White House trade official during Trump\u2019s first term and now with law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld.\nShe said Trump had likely pressed China for further concessions before agreeing to the extension. Trump pushed for additional concessions on Sunday, urging China to quadruple its soybean purchases, although analysts questioned the feasibility of any such deal. Trump did not repeat the demand on Monday.\n\u201cThe whole reason for the 90-day pause in the first place was to lay the groundwork for broader negotiations and there\u2019s been a lot of noise about everything from soybeans to export controls to excess capacity over the weekend,\u201d Shaw said.\nRyan Majerus, a former US trade official now with the King & Spalding law firm, said the news would give both sides more time to work through longstanding trade concerns.\n\u201cThis will undoubtedly lower anxiety on both sides as talks continue, and as the US and China work toward a framework deal in the fall,\u201d he said.\nImports from China early this year had surged to beat Trump\u2019s tariffs, but dropped steeply in June, Commerce Department data showed last week.\nThe US trade deficit with China tumbled by roughly a third in June to US$9.5 billion, its narrowest since February 2004. Over five consecutive months of declines, the US trade gap with China has narrowed by US$22.2 billion - a 70 per cent reduction from a year earlier.\nWashington has also been pressing Beijing to stop buying Russian oil to pressure Moscow over its war in Ukraine, with Trump threatening to impose secondary tariffs on China.

            "US and China extend trade truce deadline to avoid tariffs hike. US and China extend trade truce deadline to avoid tariffs hike\nThe US and China have extended their trade truce until 10 November, just hours before the world's two biggest economies were set to hike tariffs on each other.\nThe higher tariffs will be suspended for another 90 days, Beijing and Washington said in a joint statement.\nTalks last month ended with both sides calling the discussions \"constructive\". China's top negotiator said at the time that the two countries would push to preserve the truce, while US officials said they were waiting for final sign-off from President Donald Trump.\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order to extend the truce.\nUnder the agreement, the US will hold its tariffs on Chinese imports at 30%, while China will keep a 10% tariff on American goods.\nThe truce extension will give more time for negotiations about \"remedying trade imbalances\" and \"unfair trade practices\", the White House said.\nIt cited a trade deficit of nearly $300bn (\u00a3223bn) with China in 2024 - the largest among any of its trading partner.\nThe talks will also aim to increase access for US exporters to China and address national security and economic issues, the statement said.\nA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said: \"Win-win cooperation between China and the United States is the right path; suppression and containment will lead nowhere.\"\nIn the statement, China also called on the US to lift its \"unreasonable\" trade restrictions, work together to benefit companies on both sides and maintain the stability of global semiconductor production.\nA return of higher duties would have risked further trade turmoil and uncertainty amid worries about the effect of tariffs on prices and the economy.\nTrade tensions between the US and China reached fever pitch in April, after Trump unveiled sweeping new tariffs on goods from countries around the world, with China facing some of the highest levies.\nBeijing retaliated with tariffs of its own, sparking a tit-for-tat fight that saw tariffs soar into the triple digits and nearly shut down trade between the two countries.\nThe two sides had agreed to set aside some of those measures in May.\nThat agreement left Chinese goods entering the US facing an additional 30% tariff compared with the start of the year, with US goods facing a new 10% tariff in China.\nThe two sides remain in discussions about issues including access to China's rare earths, its purchases of Russian oil, and US curbs on sales of advanced technology, including chips to China.\nTrump recently relaxed some of those export restrictions, allowing firms such as AMD and Nvidia to resume sales of certain chips to firms in China in exchange for sharing 15% of their revenues with the US government.\nThe US is also pushing for the spin-off of TikTok from its Chinese owner ByteDance, a move that has been opposed by Beijing.\nEarlier on Monday in remarks to reporters, Trump did not commit to extending the truce but said dealings had been going \"nicely\". A day earlier he called on Beijing to increase its purchases of US soybeans.\nEven with the truce, trade flows between the countries have been hit this year, with US government figures showing US imports of Chinese goods in June cut nearly in half compared with June 2024.\nIn the first six months of the year, the US imported $165bn (\u00a3130bn) worth of goods from China, down by about 15% from the same time last year. American exports to China fell roughly 20% year-on-year for the same period.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

            "He pioneered the cellphone, changing how people connect \u2014 and disconnect \u2014 globally. He pioneered the cellphone, changing how people connect \u2014 and disconnect \u2014 globally\nMartin Cooper changed the world when he pioneered the portable phone\nDEL MAR, Calif. -- Dick Tracy got an atom-powered two-way wrist radio in 1946. Marty Cooper never forgot it.\nThe Chicago boy became a star engineer who ran Motorola\u2019s research and development arm when the hometown telecommunications titan was locked in a 1970s corporate battle to invent the portable phone. Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d\nFifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.\nThe tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.\nFrom his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.\nNow, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.\n\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c\nHuman behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.\nThe phone conversation has become the way to communicate the most intimate of social ties, says Claude Fischer, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of \u201cAmerica Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940.\u201d\nFor almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.\nAnd this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d\nChild education student Katheryn Ruiz, 19, concurs, saying \u201ctexting is used for just like nothing substantial, like nothing personal.\u201d\nSometimes the roles are reversed, though. Sixty-eight-year-old Diana Cunningham of Overbrook, Kansas, pop. 1005, uses a group text to stay in touch with her kids and grandkids. Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d\nWhen she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.\n\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d\nMany worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.\nWe increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.\nMost importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.\n\u201cAt the turn of the millennium, technology companies based on the West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products,\u201d New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for a year.\n\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.\nSeven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.\nThat doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d\nThat advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.\nThe first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.\nAdjusting to life in Russia when he moved there in 2023 was tough, he says, but one thing kept him going; WhatsApp calls with family. \u201cOne thing that kept me sane was calling home every time, and it made me feel closer to my people,\u201d the 31-year-old says.\nIn a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.\nFor many, phone calls blur the distance and offer comfort.\n\u201cNo matter how busy my schedule is, I must call my people every weekend, even if that\u2019s the only call I have to make,\u201d Agbo says.\nIn Africa, where only 37% of the population had internet access in 2023, according to the International Telecommunication Union, regular mobile calls are the only option many have. In northern Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state, Abdulmalik Saidu says the mobile connectivity rate is so low that \u201csometimes we stay for weeks without network.\u201d\nWhen 19-year-old Shamsu Deen-Cole flew from Sierra Leone to the United States to study international relations in 1971, making a call to his parents in Sierra Leone would take days, starting with telling his parents when to expect the call. Calls would cost around $150 for under 10 minutes. \u201cThere was no time for extra talks or complimentary because it would all add up in cost,\u201d recalls Deen-Cole, 73.\nTabane Ciss\u00e9, who moved from Senegal to Spain in 2023, makes phone calls about investing Spanish earnings at home. Otherwise, it\u2019s all texts, or voice notes, with one exception.\nHis mother doesn\u2019t read or write, but when he calls \u201cit\u2019s as if I was standing next to her,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 says. \u201cIt brings back memories \u2014 such pleasure.\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t do it without the cell phone. And half a world away, that suits Marty Cooper just fine.\n\u201cThere are more cell phones in the world today than there are people,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cYour life can be made infinitely more efficient just by virtue of being connected with everybody else in the world. But I have to tell you that this is only the beginning.\u201d\n___\nWeissenstein contributed from New York and Asadu from Lagos, Nigeria. Aroun R.

            "The Network Behind the Wheels: Communications Laws and the Future of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles | JD Supra. [co-author: Nikita Sivakumaran]\nAs connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies continue to advance, governments across Australia are beginning to reshape infrastructure policy to support CAV integration into broader transport systems. Many states have also recently conducted or are progressing CAV and intelligent transport system (ITS) trials, including in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia.\nDespite supportive policy positions, legal and regulatory complexities remain for CAV providers and distributors\u2014refer to our previous article (here) for an overview of the key considerations. In this note, we delve deeper into the telecommunications and radiocommunications facilities that enable CAVs and key areas ripe for legal reform.\nOverview of connected and autonomous features\nConnected vehicles and autonomous vehicles are two distinct, but increasingly integrated, technologies.\nConnected vehicles\nConnected vehicles share data through mobile network infrastructure or wireless communications for a range of purposes, including:\npublic communication with other vehicles, infrastructure and others through an interconnected \u2018Co-operative Intelligent Transport System\u2019 (C-ITS). Such communication enables features like collision avoidance and hazard warnings;\n-\nprivate telematics for fleet management, predictive maintenance, safety monitoring and various other purposes;\n-\nin-vehicle infotainment systems; and\n-\nemergency calling services.\n-\nThese communications rely on a mix of embedded mobile broadband connectivity, direct short-range communication or cellular vehicle-to-everything technologies.\nAutonomous vehicles\nAutonomous vehicles perform some or all driving functions without human input.\nAutonomous vehicles rely on onboard cameras, sensors and edge computing to interpret and navigate physical surroundings. Connectivity is essential for real-time data processing, situational awareness, traffic mapping and broader system efficiency.\nWe set out below a high-level summary of two key enablers of CAV connectivity: short-range communication technologies for C-ITS and access to mobile broadband networks.\nShort-range communication technologies (DSRC and V2X)\nShort-range communication is central to the operation of C-ITS, enabling direct, immediate and reliable communication between vehicles, infrastructure and other road users. There are two key competing technologies:\ndirect short-range communication (DSRC), which uses existing Wi-Fi technology to directly communicate between onboard vehicle units and roadside units; and\n-\ncellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X), which is a newer technology that supports both direct communication between onboard vehicle units and roadside units as well as longer-range communication using mobile broadband networks.\n-\nThe choice between DSRC and V2X is a foundational consideration for national C-ITS planning. As each technology offers distinct advantages and limitations, and they are not interoperable, it will be important to adopt a unified approach across states and territories.\nTo support this, Commonwealth, state and territory infrastructure and transport ministers have endorsed the \u2018Principles for a National Approach to Co-operative Intelligence Transport Systems (C-ITS) in Australia\u2019 (2024).1 These principles aim to promote a seamless experience for road users across Australia and confidence for industry investment.\nWhile V2X appears to be emerging as the preferred standard in several international markets (including in the US and China), Australia is yet to determine a national approach.\nSpectrum allocation\nBoth DSRC and V2X use the 5.9 GHz radiofrequency band in Australia for short-range communication, which is reserved exclusively for ITS communication. A dedicated frequency band helps to ensure network availability, reliability and low latency required for real-time ITS communications (particularly for safety purposes). The same frequency band is also used for ITS communication in the EU, US, China and other regions.\nUse of the radiofrequency spectrum in Australia is regulated and managed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). Under the ITS class licence issued by ACMA2, CAV providers are permitted to operate DSRC and V2X technologies without applying for individual licences or paying fees (provided that they comply with European C-ITS standards and ACMA\u2019s technical equipment standards).\nWhile ACMA has noted that the current ITS class licence is fit-for-purpose, it has flagged ITS spectrum management as an ongoing priority area and is actively monitoring developments in Europe.3\nAccess to mobile broadband networks\nMobile broadband networks underpin longer range vehicle-to-network and vehicle-to-cloud communication in CAVs. Emerging 5G technology (with ultra-low latency and higher bandwidth and throughput capacity) is anticipated to support higher densities of CAVs and advanced capabilities. However, the current availability and quality of 5G networks varies significantly across Australia, which is likely to impact the rollout and performance of CAV services nationwide.\nFrom a legal perspective, mobile broadband connection in CAVs raises key questions about the application of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) (Telecommunications Act) to CAV providers. We explore this below.\nCAVs and the Telecommunications Act \u2013 a regulatory mismatch?\nThe Telecommunications Act regulates several key participants in the telecommunications industry, including \u2018carriage service providers\u2019 (CSPs)\u2014ie entities that supply telecommunications services over regulated networks and infrastructure.\nWhile the Telecommunications Act was not designed with modern telecommunications in mind, the statutory definition of a CSP is broad and covers intermediary entities involved in arranging the supply of telecommunications services. As such, depending on the specific connectivity arrangements in place, CAV providers or distributors can sometimes be captured as CSPs\u2014thereby triggering significant obligations under the Telecommunications Act and various other legislation (many of which are unsuitable or incapable of being applied to the CAV context).\nIn late 2023, the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (the Department) consulted on the impact of telecommunications laws to vehicle manufacturers and after-market providers of connected vehicles.4 Several stakeholders, including distributors of connected vehicles and related products, have argued that they should not be subject to CSP obligations\u2014in particular, because they believe that they were not intended to be captured by the framework and lack the resources to comply. The Department\u2019s initial view is that connected vehicle technology does not meet traditional views of \u2018carriage services\u2019 under the Telecommunications Act. However, it considers that various network safeguards and consumer obligations should continue to apply to the sector (although it is an open question as to which entity in the overall CAV supply chain should bear responsibility for such obligations). Since the consultation, no further reforms have been announced or progressed.\nIn the absence of further regulatory guidance or reform activity, CAV providers and distributors remain potentially subject to regulatory requirements for CSPs in some circumstances, with limited clarity on how such requirements apply in practice. Managing this uncertainty requires a proactive and strategic approach to structuring connectivity and service arrangements. As the legal landscape continues to evolve, informed decision-making will be key to navigating compliance risks effectively.\nEndnotes\nhttps://www.infrastructure.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/principles-for-a-national-approach-to-cooperative-intelligent-transport-systems-cits-in-australia-february2024-pdf.pdf\n-\nRadiocommunications (Intelligent Transport Systems) Class Licence 2017.\n-\nhttps://www.acma.gov.au/five-year-spectrum-outlook.\n-\nhttps://www.infrastructure.gov.au/have-your-say/telecommunications-legislation-and-connected-vehicles.\n-\n[View source.]",
            "What Is Cellular Bonding?. What Is Cellular Bonding?\nWhile many of us are excited by the possibilities of 5G today, those possibilities are mostly unrealized at present. In terms of streaming, the higher data rates promised with 5G are not as important as the new bands/frequencies that enable a given tower to serve more active connections, as opposed to being completely blocked up with hundreds of other cellular users trying to push or pull data at the same time.\nIn the absence of widespread high-bandwidth 5G availability, one technology that has been with us for several years remains the most reliable solution for getting your streams to the cloud when Wi-Fi and wired connections are unavailable: cellular bonding.\nHow Bonding Works\nFor those unfamiliar, cellular bonding is a process whereby multiple connections to the internet\u2014e.g., multiple cellular carriers\u2014are all used, simultaneously, to send and receive data. This is very different than having multiple Wide Area Networks (WANs), or a Multi WAN router that can use multiple internet connections at the same time, and even switch between them and offer some failover. Sending office VoIP traffic over one WAN connection and customer internet browsing over a second WAN connection is not bonding. Having one primary connection and then having everything drop to a second connection if the first one fails is also not bonding.\nBonded video service is a process that involves two distinct halves of a whole. Most often, it is a paid service, and there is a key reason why true bonding has a price\u2014the \u201cde-bonding\u201d service, as I call it.\nRegardless of who manufactures or brands your bonding router, each of these devices is designed to connect to a server and service at the other end. Let me explain why.\nWhen your video come in to the device, it is compressed into data and that data is sliced into packets (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\u2026). Each of these packets is distributed, or should be distributed, like playing cards at the poker table\u2014a packet to each connected service. Each of those packets is numbered. Each of those packets flies through the air or a wire, or bounces around the city or the country, and gets to the receiving server. Whether it be Teradek Core, LiveU server, Kiloview Server, or Peplink\u2019s SpeedFusion, there\u2019s a very specific destination these packets go to. Because each route they take is different, they will never, ever, arrive in order.\nYou cannot \u201cbond\u201d your video directly to YouTube, or Facebook, or Vimeo, or to any delivery network.\nThese de-bonding servers exist to receive the packets, in whatever order\u2014e.g., 3, 1, 4, 2, 6, 5, 7, 8...\u2014as they arrive by postal carrier, UPS, carrier pigeon, tied to a rock, etc. The server \u201cde-bonds\u201d the packets and puts them back in order\u20141, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\u2014and then, with a single reliable fast connection to the internet, it then sends this single stream of data to your intended destination. This de-bonding service requires a computer to dedicate itself to processing your video, and renting someone else\u2019s computer for this task has a cost.\nSometimes, these servers also serve to transcode the stream. For instance, if the bonding device sends HEVC/H.265 to be very efficient with data, but not all Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) accept HEVC directly, so then the de-bonding server takes the received HEVC and transcodes it to MPEG-4/H.264 to send along to the destinations. This transcoding process takes server horsepower, and thus often adds cost to the service.\nAnother common feature of the de-bonding server is multicasting: You send one stream from your bonding device to the server, at which point the server splits it and casts it to multiple destinations. This again saves on data being sent because you\u2019re only sending one stream, but it can end up going to 2, 5, 10, or more different destinations. Again, this process of splitting, managing connections, and sending out all these streams is, in almost all cases, part of a paid service.\nSo if you have a bonding device, and you\u2019re not paying for any (de)bonding service, it may behoove you to look more closely into whether you are truly getting bonding service, or whether there\u2019s something else going on.\nReliability\nYou\u2019ll note a recurring theme: using as little data as possible to send the stream. Whether it be leveraging HEVC or cloud multicasting, there is a key reason why these tools strive for the lowest-bitrate data stream possible. That reason is reliability. Consider sending one 3 Mbps HEVC stream that is multicast to 10 destinations, versus directly sending ten individual outbound 6 Mbps H.264 streams. This would require 60 Mbps up just for the streams, and typically, with data fluctuations, you want double what the stream will be, so you\u2019d really need at least 120 Mbps upload bandwidth to handle that first mile reliably.\nFor businesses, or broadcast, there\u2019s often the money to make sure that big bandwidth is there, and probably a lot more to spare. For the vast majority of independent producers and freelancers, however, that big bandwidth is often not there. Plus, when using cellular connections\u2014especially when moving\u2014you are at the mercy of what the towers can provide to you (and everyone connected to the same towers) at that second. So, the lower you can keep your demand, the less you will need to push through, and the more likely it is that all your packets will make it through in a timely manner.\nConclusion\nWith more and more content being streamed every day, everyone from broadcast producers to individual users has a vast assortment of technologies available to them to ensure that their program can reliably reach viewers around the world. They key comes in understanding what bonding truly is, how it is implemented, and what advantages it offers. Then you can compare services more thoroughly and understand what it is you need, and how the services you are comparing satisfy your needs. You can also assess whether new technologies like SRT or buffering can provide the reliability you want, without the need for true bonding services.\nAny way you look at it, thanks to bonding and some of the other technologies discussed here, the days of sending glitchy, buffering video to viewers should be behind us. There are many options available, at a wide variety of price points, to ensure that streaming professionals can deliver the best video possible.\nRelated Articles\nIn this interview from NAB 2019, LiveU clears up some of the hype around 5G (it won't make an impact until next year and there's no special health risk) and talks about the testing it's already doing with 5G modems.\n24 Apr 2019\nLiveU's George Klippel describes the cellular bonding workflow for live production from capture to distribution using LiveU's technology in this clip from Streaming Media East 2018.\n05 Nov 2018\nReelSolver's Tim Siglin and BlueFrame's Chris Knowlton discuss the challenges of streaming via cellular bonding in congested cell-traffic areas, and strategies for boosting performance, in this panel discussion from Streaming Media West 2017.\n22 Jan 2018\nIf you take the steps and follow the guidelines provided within this article, you should be able to configure, acquire, and use a functional cellular bonding system that reliably gets your signal up to the cloud, and to multiple output points from there.\n05 Jul 2017\nCellmux technology is now an essential part of many video operations, but connections aren't always reliable.

            "Enterprise Financial Services (EFSC) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why. What Happened?\nShares of regional banking company Enterprise Financial Services (NASDAQ: EFSC) jumped 3.9% in the afternoon session after the broader market rallied on increased investor confidence in a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut following a favorable inflation report. The broader market rallied after the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came in largely in line with expectations, reinforcing investor hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. The data showed a headline CPI of +2.7% year-over-year, which helped increase the perceived odds of a Fed rate cut at its September meeting to 95%. This prospect of lower interest rates spurred a \"risk-on\" sentiment, lifting equities across all major sectors and pushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new all-time highs. Financial stocks, including regional banks like Enterprise Financial, often benefit from the expectation of a stronger economy that rate cuts can signal.\nThe shares closed the day at $56.95, up 4.1% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Enterprise Financial Services? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\nEnterprise Financial Services\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 11 days ago when the stock dropped 3.1% on the news that a surprisingly weak July jobs report and the announcement of sweeping new tariffs fueled fears of an economic slowdown and an impending interest rate cut. The U.S. economy added just 73,000 jobs in July, the weakest gain in over two years, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%. This dismal data significantly increased market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, with traders now pricing in an 80% probability of a cut in September. Lower interest rates typically harm bank profitability by compressing their net interest margins\u2014the difference between what they earn on loans and pay on deposits. Compounding these worries, the announcement of new tariffs on imports from 92 countries has sparked fears of a global trade war, which could further dampen economic growth and disrupt supply chains, creating a challenging environment for the banking industry.\nEnterprise Financial Services is up 2.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $56.97 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $61.95 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Enterprise Financial Services\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,744.\nDo you want to know what moves the business you care about?

            "Why Valley National Bank (VLY) Stock Is Up Today. What Happened?\nShares of regional banking company Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ: VLY) jumped 4.5% in the afternoon session after the broader market rallied as a favorable inflation report boosted optimism for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The positive market sentiment was triggered by the July Consumer Price Index report, which showed annual inflation holding steady at 2.7%, slightly better than economists had anticipated. This news fueled optimism for a potential interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, sending major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new all-time highs. Bank stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rate expectations, joined the broader market rally. While higher interest rates can sometimes increase bank profits, the prospect of a stable or declining rate environment can reduce fears of an economic slowdown, which is generally positive for financial institutions.\nThe shares closed the day at $9.75, up 4.6% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Valley National Bank?

            "ASX set to edge up, Wall Street gets inflation boost; CBA results ahead. Updated\n-\nBusiness\n-\nMarkets\n-\nWorld markets\n-\nASX set to edge up, Wall Street gets inflation boost; CBA results ahead\nBy Stan Choe\nThe US stock market rallied to records on Tuesday after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected.\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones climbed 483 points, or 1.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4 per cent to set its own record.\nThe Australian sharemarket is set to edge higher, with futures at 6.09am AEST pointing to a gain of 19 points, or 0.2 per cent, at the open. The ASX added 0.4 per cent on Tuesday as the RBA cut interest rates. The Commonwealth Bank\u2019s latest results is the highlight for reporting season on Wednesday. The Australian dollar was stronger at US65.28\u00a2 at 5.18am AEST.\nUS stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.\nLower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often insulting the Fed\u2019s chair personally while doing so.\nBut the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump\u2019s tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That\u2019s why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.\nTuesday\u2019s report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were overall 2.7 per cent higher in July than a year earlier. That\u2019s the same inflation rate as June\u2019s, and it was below the 2.8 per cent that economists expected.\nThe report pushed traders on Wall Street to increase bets that the Fed will cut interest rates for the first time this year in September. They\u2019re betting on a 94 per cent chance of that, up from nearly 86 per cent a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.\nThe Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the US job market, before its next meeting, which ends September 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.\nSome economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed\u2019s upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2 per cent while keeping the job market healthy. Helping one with interest rates, though, often means hurting the other.\nEven Tuesday\u2019s better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.\n\u201cEventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don\u2019t happen all at once,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \u201cThat will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come.\u201d\nOther central banks around the world have been lowering interest rates, and Australia\u2019s on Tuesday cut for the third time this year.\nOn Wall Street, Intel\u2019s stock rose 5.6 per cent after Trump said its CEO has an \u201camazing story,\u201d less than a week after he had demanded Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s resignation.\nCircle Internet Group, the company behind the popular USDC cryptocurrency that tracks the U.S. dollar, climbed 1.3 per cent despite reporting a larger loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said its total revenue and reserve income grew 53 per cent in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, which topped forecasts.\nOn the losing side of Wall Street was Celanese, which sank 13.1 per cent even though the chemical company delivered a better profit than expected. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that \u201cthe demand environment does not seem to be improving.\u201d\nCardinal Health dropped 7.2 per cent despite likewise reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts said the market\u2019s expectations were particularly high for the company after its stock had already soared 33.3 per cent for the year coming into the day.\nCritics say the broad U.S. stock market is looking expensive after its surge from a bottom in April. That\u2019s putting pressure on companies to deliver continued growth in profit.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 72.31 points to 6,445.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 483.52 to 44,458.61, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 296.50 to 21,681.90.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes edged up in China after Trump signed an executive order late Monday that delayed hefty tariffs on the world\u2019s second-largest economy by 90 days. The move was widely expected, and the hope is that it will clear the way for a possible deal to avert a dangerous trade war between the United States and China.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.1 per cent, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi fell 0.5 per cent for two of the world\u2019s bigger moves.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28 per cent from 4.27 per cent late Monday.\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.73 per cent from 3.76 per cent.\nAP\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day\u2019s trading.

            "Asian American, Pacific Islander comics are the main event in an LA comedy and cuisine festival. With the Belly Laughs Festival, an ambitious Asian American and Pacific Islander-centered comedy festival, the food is as important as the talent line-up. Every detail is intended to send a message of unabashed cultural pride.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we grew up kind of shying away and hiding our Asian-ness,\u201d said Viv Wang, a volunteer festival producer with Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment, or CAPE, who helped conceive the idea for the event. \u201cIt just made a lot of sense to have comedy and food \u2014 these two ways that people can connect and just celebrate being Asian and having a place to feel cool to be Asian.\u201d\nFor one weekend, Belly Laughs is mounting an unprecedented gathering of 30 AAPI stand-up comics \u2014 from headliners to newer scene-stealers \u2014 in downtown Los Angeles. There will also be 20 food and beverage vendors set up in the spirit of a Taiwanese night market. The L.A. Live entertainment complex will be a playground where ticketholders can watch marquee names like Kumail Nanjiani and Margaret Cho, while simultaneously enjoying anything from biriyani to boba.\nWith federal immigration crackdowns nationwide, the participating comedians \u2014 most hailing from immigrant families \u2014 are being thoughtful about striking the right balance of politics and humor.\nFestival to whet appetites for the funny and food\nOrganizers, including Nederlander Concerts and Gold House, are aiming to draw between 6,000 to 8,000 people over the two-day tentpole event. Tickets are still available. Comedians will be split between two stages. The entertainers lending their star power include several comics-turned-actors like Hasan Minhaj, Bobby Lee, Joel Kim Booster and Sherry Cola. A majority of the talent also identifies as LGBTQ+. It's an impressive statement in an industry that has historically tried to put Asian comedians in boxes and often relegated them to \u201cethnic nights\u201d like \u201cWonton Wednesdays\u201d or \u201cAsian Invasion.\"\nAsif Ali, one of the stars of the new Hulu series \u201cDeli Boys,\u201d has never taken part in any AAPI-focused event save an occasional comedy club night or as part of a mainstream festival. But Asian American comics were never the main event for an audience of thousands. So there was no hesitation on Ali's part to join in the festival.\n\u201cJust to be a part of something like this was so cool,\u201d said Ali, who performs Sunday. \u201cTo have it be of this scope and in LA and have it tied in with food \u2014 which I think is such a slam dunk \u2014 is great.\u201d\nComedian and writer Hari Kondabolu called it \u201cour Lollapalooza.\u201d\n\u201cLike I don\u2019t know if people understand ... I don\u2019t know if this will happen every year, if it will happen again. But like this is a pretty cool moment in time to be a part of something like this,\u201d Kondabolu said.\nMAMA, a community group dedicated to promoting immigrants and their cultures through night markets, is the curator of the event's food stalls. There will be no national restaurant chains. But an array of Asian cultures will be represented \u2014 Indonesian, Malaysian, Singaporean and Chinese among them.\n\u201cThey\u2019re completely different because they\u2019re very conscientious and focused on immigrant-owned businesses, first gen businesses,\u201d Wang said. \u201cAll of the food has a story.\u201d\nOrganizers vow festival will not be impacted by feds\nPutting on a new festival is never easy but the timing of current events has made it a \u201chelluva year\u201d to do it, said Wang. Los Angeles residents have been on edge since Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids erupted in and around downtown in June. Ensuing protests prompted curfews and event cancellations. On Monday federal officers and the National Guard descended on a mostly empty park in a largely immigrant neighborhood.\nFor those who might be worried about an ICE presence around the festival, organizers plan to \u201cmake sure that people will be kept safe,\u201d said CAPE executive director Michelle Sugihara, noting L.A. Live is private property.\nIt's a good bet that the political turmoil in Los Angeles and beyond will be fodder for the comedians. Ali, who took part in protests last month, doesn\u2019t plan to shy away from it. While the federal government's immigration policies are no laughing matter, he sees comedy as a way to keep attention on the issue.\n\u201cI think our job as comedians is to remind people that things that are happening are terrible,\u201d Ali said. \u201cYou\u2019re not laughing at something happening. You\u2019re laughing at sort of the insanity of it all.\u201d\nSome people may struggle with going out and eating and laughing at a time of conflict around Los Angeles. But festival organizers and comedians insist that having a good time doesn't mean forgetting about the issues.\n\u201cNow more than ever, being around people for whatever reason \u2014 whether it\u2019s to protest, whether it\u2019s to help, whether it\u2019s to laugh or grieve ... I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say it\u2019s always better to be in the company of like-minded people,\u201d Ali said. \u201cPeople need to feel that they\u2019re not alone.\u201d\nWhy having an AAPI-focused festival matters\nThere have been times when Ali felt like an Asian American comic who references his culture even briefly gets branded \u201cthat guy who just talks about being Asian.\u201d Something like Belly Laughs shows how reductive that thinking is, he said.\nIt's also comforting for comedians like him to see how many peers have found success.\n\u201cWhen you are in spaces where you aren\u2019t the majority or even a larger-sized minority, I think it\u2019s important for people to know that they are normal,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe effect of festivals like this is that it makes all those comics who feel like that, who feel that pressure \u2014 myself included \u2014 to look around and to see a whole lineup of people and to watch their sets and listen to their material.\"\nThe festival is a long overdue celebration of how today's AAPI comics are not dealing with the stereotyping and limits as their predecessors, Sugihara said. The Belly Laughs roster reflects that spectrum. Take Cho, 56, who Asian American comedians consider \u201cMother,\" alongside comedians in their 20s.\n\u201cFor us, it is about the whole lifecycle of an entertainment career,\u201d Sugihara said. \u201cThat\u2019s whether you\u2019re emerging or you\u2019re a veteran, and all of us can be a community together and help each other.\u201d\nThe hope is that there will be a demand to do this next year as a complement to the biennial Netflix Is A Joke Fest. Sugihara has already heard from people in other states such as Hawaii who want to duplicate Belly Laughs.\nTerry Tang, The Associated Press",
            "Alegria, Alegria!. What started as a novelty is quickly becoming tradition. The National Parang Association of Trinidad and Tobago (NPATT) returns with its now-anticipated midyear celebration, \u201cChristmas in July\u201d, and more nationals are leaning into the spirit with each passing year.\nFor Alicia Jaggasar, NPATT president and long-time advocate for parang beyond the festive season, the shift is exactly what she hoped for.\n\u201cOver the past four years, we have come to learn that our country has many citizens who love parang and do not mind hearing this music all year round,\u201d Jaggasar told the Kitcharee via WhatsApp Friday.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed the increase in the number of patrons each year\u201d, she said.\nThe 2025 edition marks the fourth year of partnership between NPATT and Estate 101, Saddle Road, Maraval, and the return of its signature event, \u201cParang Under the Stars\u201d. Slated for July 26, this year\u2019s presentation is themed the \u201cCocktail Edition\u201d, focused on an enhanced experience:\n\u201cEach year we give our patrons a different experience,\u201d Jaggasar said. \u201cWe have learned that if they are pleased, they will return and bring a friend or family member.\u201d\nA genre beyond a season\nThe expansion of Christmas in July is not about replacing tradition, but extending it. Jaggasar sees the event as both a platform for artistic experimentation and a call to the industry to evolve.\n\u201cThis event has set a stage for parranderos to perform different styles of music,\u201d she said. \u201cWe encourage our performers to explore the different ways our parang music can fuse to create new musical feelings.\u201d\nTraditional parang will always have its place during Christmas, but Jaggasar is clear that the genre itself is not seasonal:\n\u201cActually, traditionally, parang music is played all through the year in areas such as Paramin, Lopinot, Arima, Moruga and other areas,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can hear the sounds of parang at birthday parties, weddings, funerals, christenings. Many of these performances are not publicised.\u201d\nParang\u2019s Christmas appeal remains sacred, but Jaggasar believes its growth as a commercial genre depends on expanding its reach throughout the calendar.\n\u201cParang at Christmas holds a special place in the hearts of citizens of Trinidad and Tobago,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many parang shows are presented during the year, none will compare to the sweet songs of parang at Christmas time.\u201d\nBaby steps towards a bigger vision\nNPATT is already working on multiple fronts to build out that expanded vision. Jaggasar says the association has been engaging embassies and local ministries to push parang into regional and international cultural conversations.\n\u201cWe are happy that our ambassadors are interested in our parang culture,\u201d she said. \u201cTrinidad and Tobago will be seeing a lot more cultural exchanges where parang is concerned.\u201d\nThe association has begun forming new partnerships and plans to grow its footprint both at home and abroad. That includes a long-term goal to create an international parang festival, new cross-genre showcases such as \u201cCarniParang,\u201d and a rebranded senior competition.\n\u201cWe move forward to the return of the National Parang Competition\u2014soon to be international\u2014and the recognition of the first parang orchestra in Trinidad and Tobago, Orquesta Nacional de Parang de Trinidad y Tobago, ONPaTT,\u201d she said.\nParang\u2019s Spanish roots are a central part of the pitch. Jaggasar sees the genre as a tool for cultural and linguistic education in an increasingly bilingual nation: \u201cWe see parang as a teaching tool, as the only local genre in Spanish. We are poised and ready to show what parang can do.\u201d\nNPATT\u2019s annual Junior Parang Festival has already helped deepen that connection for younger audiences: \u201cWe have the ears and hearts of our nation\u2019s children. Many tell stories of the impact of parang on their study of the Spanish language.\u201d\nKeeping the momentum alive requires more than music. It takes programming, partnerships, and policy support. It also requires navigating the push and pull between tradition and evolution\u2014something Jaggasar faces daily in her multiple roles:\n\u201cAs a performer and administrator, I am challenged many days to find a balance. So I depend heavily on my relationship with God to give me the strength and clarity of mind.\u201d\nJaggasar credits her executive team and NPATT\u2019s membership for helping hold the vision together, but said funding remains a challenge.\n\u201cParang is not seen as a big-ticket item. We continue to work on changing that perception and look forward to corporate T&T lending us an ear so they can once again place that trust and faith in the work we are doing to change lives in our communities.\u201d \u201cThere are 12 months in a year,\u201d Jaggasar concluded, \u201cand we intend to create a space for the evolution.\u201d"

South Korea, US and Japan hold aerial drill in demonstration of strength against North Korea\nTop South Korean, U.S. and Japanese military officers are urging North Korea to cease all unlawful activities that threaten regional security, as the three nations fly advanced warplanes for a joint exercise in a show of force against the North\nSEOUL, South Korea -- Top South Korean, U.S. and Japanese military officers urged North Korea to cease all unlawful activities that threaten regional security, as the three nations flew advanced warplanes for a joint exercise in a show of force against the North.\nThe development came Friday as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was to travel to North Korea amid booming military and other cooperation between the two countries that have raised concerns among their neighbors.\nDuring their regular meeting in Seoul on Friday, the chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff from South Korea, the U.S. and Japan discussed North Korea's deployment of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine and Russia's potential transfer of military technology to North Korea in return.\n\u201cThey urged the DPRK to immediately cease all unlawful activities to destabilize the Korean Peninsula, the Indo-Pacific, and beyond, and pledged to continue working together to respond to the DPRK\u2019s threats,\u201d the three top military officers said in a joint statement.\nDPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's formal name.\nNorth Korea and Russia have grown sharply closer in recent years, with North Korea supplying thousands of troops and ammunitions to Russia in return for economic and military assistance. Seoul, Washington and their partners worry Russia might provide North Korea with sensitive technologies that can enhance its nuclear and missile programs as well.\nThe three joint chiefs of staff \u2014 South Korea's Kim Myung-soo, the United States' Dan Caine and Japan's Yoshida Yoshihide \u2014 discussed various ways to deepen their cooperation in order to ensure peace and stability in the region, according to the joint statement.\nAlso Friday, the three countries staged a trilateral aerial drill in international waters off South Korea's southern Jeju island. The training, which involves America's nuclear-capable B-52H bomber, is meant to improve the deterrence and response capabilities against North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile programs, according to South Korea's Defense Ministry.\nIn recent years, South Korea, the U.S. and Japan have been expanding or restarting their regular military training exercises to cope with North Korea's enlarging nuclear arsenal. North Korea views such U.S.-led drills as invasion rehearsals and often responds with missile tests.\nLavrov, the Russian foreign minister, was to begin a three-day trip to North Korea on Friday, according to North Korean and Russian state media reports earlier this week.\nRussia's Tass news agency, citing Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, reported Wednesday that Lavrov's North Korea trip was part of the second round of \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d with his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui.

            "Op-Ed: The West threatened by Russia, North Korea alliance. Op-Ed: The West threatened by Russia, North Korea alliance\n\"If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear a hundred battles.\" \u2013 Sun Tzu\nUpon the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, Americans looked to General Douglas MacArthur for leadership to end the Korean War. MacArthur was one of the most popular, decorated and powerful military figures in the U.S. When North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, MacArthur was put in charge of the UN forces in South Korea. MacArthur's final plan was to invade North Korea and end their reign of terror but was nixed by Harry S Truman when he fired MacArthur. North Korea has been a global threat and liability since then. Most historians claim that was the worst decision Truman ever made.\nAccording to the Bill Of Rights Institute, Truman acted within his presidential powers firing General MacArthur. But the way it was done, in the middle of a war, it was an unethical and bad decision.\nFounded under the communist bloc, North Korea and Russia both have a long history as Marxist partners. The Soviets supported North Korea during the Korean War and recognized North Korea's military state on October 12, 1948. North Korea had officially recognized Crimea as part of Russia in 2017, thereby supporting Moscow's position at the international level. North Korea has sided with Russia on every attempt to increase their global dynamism over the U.S. and all U.S. world allies.\nWhen North Korea recognized the independence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, supported by Russia, this immediately ended relations between Ukraine and North Korea. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, North Korea has continued to supply Russia with ammo and war supplies. In the fall of 2024, North Korea sent its army into Russia to fight against Ukraine under Russian command. Since Russia and North Korea have been close allies for 75 years, nations around the globe knew this was coming. It was just a matter of when.\nRelations between Russia and North Korea have been flourishing in recent years, with North Korea supplying troops and ammunition to Russia in return for military and economic assistance. The war in Ukraine has escalated this relationship. Driven by Russia\u2019s need for ammunition and N. Korea\u2019s need for food and energy, these burgeoning ties pose challenges for the U.S. and its allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific region. The U.S. cannot protect the free world order alone.\nSupport from European allies, hungry for Russian energy, could replace any doors left open in Ukraine with U.S. support for the war in question. Russian technology could also boost N. Korea\u2019s satellite, nuclear submarine, and ICBM programs, making them a legitimate threat to the U.S.\nAs the Russian-Ukrainian war continued to escalate, Joe Biden and the Democrats allowed the relations between rogue military Russia and North Korea to fester while he and his Congress tiptoed around the reality of this regional war turning into a deadly global conflict. The world community has stood around and done nothing for 75 years as these two unpredictable nations continue to build a united military capable of turning world peace into a world war.\nRecognizing the threat of a united security front formed by Japan, the U.S. and South Korea against North Korea, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke recently at North Korea\u2019s eastern Wonsan city, where he met the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un. He spoke enthusiastically about the growing relationship between Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un and promised to protect North Korea from any attacks from any nations that try to interfere with North Korea's ammunition production factories since they are the number one ammo supplier for Russia.\nKim in turn reaffirmed his government\u2019s commitment to \u201cunconditional support for Russia's military build up.\" Kim also said that his government supported all measures taken by Russia in its conflict with Ukraine and any additional endeavors taken by Russia to increase the strength and power of Russia's military for the purpose of gaining military dominance over the U.S. and its allies.\nAccording to North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency, Pyongyang and Moscow share identical views on \u201call strategic issues in conformity under their alliance.\u201d Lavrov called for the two countries to further strengthen their \u201cstrategic and tactical cooperation and intensify joint action\u201d in international affairs. This was reported by KCNA, which is ultimately controlled by North Korea's Propaganda and Agitation Department, which spreads their goals and objectives internationally.\nAccording to Russia\u2019s state Tass news agency, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui accused the U.S., South Korea and Japan of what he called military buildups around North Korea to intimidate them and encourage them to cut back on the amount of ammunition they are making and selling to Russia. Lavrov added, \u201cWe warn everyone against exploiting our ties to build coalitions against anyone, besides North Korea and Russia.\u201d\nMore in World\nThe U.S., South Korea and Japan have expanded their trilateral military exercises in response to North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program. The three countries held a joint air drill involving U.S. nuclear-capable bombers near the Korean Peninsula as their top military officers met in Seoul and urged North Korea to cease all unlawful activities threatening global and regional security.\nTruman's firing of General MacArthur and not allowing him to occupy North Korea during the Korean War has allowed North Korea to threaten world peace for years. It has allowed Kim Jong Un and his predecessors to build one of the world's most unpredictable and dangerous military regimes in world history. It has been one of the most feared countries in the world for over seven decades. And this recently accelerated relationship between North Korea and Russia due to the Russian-Ukrainian war has raised the bar for North Korea as an arms supplier for weapons.\nTruman was asked many times by reporters and historians why he ousted General MacArthur in the middle of the Korean War. MacArthur was directing all U.S. and UN troops. Yet Truman bluntly claims that as president he had the power to do whatever he wished since MacArthur disobeyed his orders although he had not completed his mission.\nTruman and MacArthur were polar opposites and seldom agreed on anything. MacArthur did not defy Truman because of his ego as Truman had repeatedly claimed. MacArthur had a chance to take out a dangerous Communist leader and restore democracy in one of the poorest nations in the world. His problem was he had a president who did not like his style of leadership or him.\nToday the global community is faced with the challenge of accepting the status quo of a powerful North Korea aligned with Russia or to be prepared to fight back for world freedom, and liberty.",
            "Russia warns U.S., South Korea and Japan against forming security alliance targeting North Korea. SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Russia\u2019s foreign minister on Saturday warned the U.S., South Korea and Japan against forming a security partnership targeting North Korea as he visited his country\u2019s ally for talks on further solidifying their booming military and other cooperation.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov flew to North Korea\u2019s eastern Wonsan city on Friday for a meeting with his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui.\nRelations between Russia and North Korea have been flourishing in recent years, with North Korea supplying troops and ammunitions to support Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine in return for military and economic assistance. That has raised concerns among South Korea, the U.S. and others that Russia might also transfer to North Korea sensitive technologies that can increase the danger of its nuclear and missile programs.\nAfter a meeting with Choe on Saturday, Lavrov accused the U.S., South Korea and Japan of what he called their military buildups around North Korea.\n\u201cWe warn against exploiting these ties to build alliances directed against anyone, including North Korea and, of course, Russia,\u201d he told reporters, according to Russia\u2019s state Tass news agency.\nThe U.S., South Korea and Japan have been expanding or restoring their trilateral military exercises in response to North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program. On Friday, the three countries held a joint air drill involving U.S. nuclear-capable bombers near the Korean Peninsula, as their top military officers met in Seoul and urged North Korea to cease all unlawful activities that threaten regional security.\nNorth Korea views major U.S.-led military drills as invasion rehearsals. It has long argued that it\u2019s forced to develop nuclear weapons to defend itself from U.S. military threats.\nLavrov said Russia understands North Korea\u2019s decision to seek nuclear weapons.\n\u201cThe technologies used by North Korea are the result of the work of its own scientists. We respect North Korea\u2019s aspirations and understand the reasons why it is pursuing a nuclear development,\u201d Lavrov said.\nDuring their meeting, Choe reiterated that North Korea \u201cunconditionally\u201d supports Russia\u2019s fight against Ukraine. She described ties between North Korea and Russia as \u201cthe invincible alliance.\u201d\nLavrov said he repeated Russia\u2019s gratitude for the contribution that North Korean troops made in efforts to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk border region.\nWonsan city, the meeting venue, is where North Korea recently opened a mammoth beach resort that it says can accommodate nearly 20,000 people.\nIn his comments at the start of his meeting with Choe, Lavrov said that \u201cI am sure that Russian tourists will be increasingly eager to come here. We will do everything we can to facilitate this, creating conditions for this, including air travel,\u201d according to the Russian Foreign Ministry.\nThe Wonsan-Kalma tourist zone is at the center of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s push to boost tourism as a way to improve his country\u2019s troubled economy. But prospects for the biggest tourist complex in North Korea aren\u2019t clear, as the country appears unlikely to fully reopen its borders and embrace Western tourists anytime soon."

            "Fourth of July holiday traffic led to gridlock traffic, deadly crashes on Colorado mountain roads. Fourth of July holiday traffic led to gridlock traffic, deadly crashes on Colorado mountain roads\nColorado transportation officials reported major delays on Interstate 70 both before and after the holiday\nTens of thousands of visitors flocked to the Colorado Rocky Mountains over the Fourth of July weekend despite a deadly crash that closed Interstate 70, snarling traffic for hours ahead of the holiday.\nJust over 170,000 vehicles traveled through I-70\u2019s Eisenhower-Johnson Memorial Tunnels from Thursday, July 3, through Sunday, July 6, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation.\nThat includes about 38,800 vehicles that traveled through the tunnels July 3, the same day the fatal crash closed westbound travel in the area for 5.5 hours and eastbound travel for about two hours, CDOT Mountain Corridor Communications Manager Austyn Dineen said. (In July 2024, the tunnels saw an average daily total of about 42,000.)\nDespite the closures, traffic counters recorded slightly more than 23,000 vehicles going through the westbound tunnel and just shy of 15,800 vehicles headed through the eastbound tunnel July 3, Dineen said. Transportation officials on July 3 told travelers to wait out the closures in Denver and expect \u201cextremely long delays.\u201d\nThe crash, which killed a man and his dog, not only closed I-70 in both directions near the tunnels for hours, but traffic backups also closed U.S. Highway 40, a popular detour when I-70 is closed, she said.\nA deadly holiday weekend\nStatewide, the Colorado transportation officials documented at least four crashes that resulted in fatalities over the Fourth of July weekend, according to a news release.\nColorado State Patrol trooper Hunter Mathews said the fatal crash July 3 occurred around 1 p.m. when a Dodge Ram 3000 headed westbound in the rightmost lane of I-70 collided with a semitractor-trailer parked on the right shoulder just outside the tunnels.\nThe pickup truck rolled one time before it was engulfed in flames, resulting in the death of the 40-year-old driver and his dog, Mathews said. The driver of the semitractor had no injuries, he said.\nAnother fatal crash occurred Saturday, July 5, when a bicyclist competing in the KowTown Gravel bike race out of Kremmling collided with a pickup truck pulling a trailer on U.S. Highway 40 near Mile Marker 916, according to the Colorado State Patrol.\nThe bicyclist disregarded a stop sign as he made a left onto the highway from Grand County Road 309, Mathews said. The man \u2014 identified by the Grand County Coroner\u2019s Office as a 62-year-old Boulder man \u2014 was ejected from his bike after colliding with the passenger door of the pickup truck, he said. Officials declared him dead on scene.\nMathews said neither excessive speeds nor impairment are suspected to have played a role in the fatal crash.\nThe two other fatal crashes that occurred over the weekend involved a motorist who was struck and killed while changing their tire on Interstate 25 and a pedestrian who was struck by a vehicle on U.S. Highway 50 in Delta County, according to the Colorado State Patrol.\nFollowing the series of deadly crashes, state transportation officials called on drivers to put safety first when behind the wheel. The Colorado Department of Transportation reminded the public never to drive impaired, to avoid distractions and to buckle up. Speed, impairment and failure to use seatbelts are top factors in fatal crashes in Colorado, according to the news release.\n\u201cThis holiday weekend, Colorado roads became the scene of preventable tragedies,\u201d CDOT acting Executive Director Sally Chaffee said in a statement. \u201cWe witnessed multiple fatalities statewide.\u201d\nTraffic jams before and after the holiday\nMore than one Colorado mountain town reported slight delays to July 3 events due to the fatal crash on I-70 that caused hourslong traffic impacts.\nFrisco communications director Vanessa Agee said in an email that a free Concert in the Park event scheduled for 5:30 p.m. July 3 was postponed two hours because it took the band 7.5 hours to get from Denver to Summit County due to the \u201ctragic accident\u201d on I-70.\nMagic Beans guitarist Scott Hachey said that when his band did eventually make it up to Frisco to perform, \u201cPeople were pumped to boogie\u201d though the delay lessened the crowd size.\nAvon chief cultural officer Danita Dempsey said she also thinks that the traffic delays had a \u201csmall impact\u201d on attendance levels at the town\u2019s Salute to the USA event at Harry A. Nottingham Park on July 3.\nBoth the headliner and the supporting acts for the event got stuck in traffic due to the I-70 closure, Dempsey said. She said the acts kicked off about 15 minutes later than planned but after that \u201call went off without a hitch.\u201d\nFollowing the Fourth of July holiday, another vehicle fire on I-70 also led to significant delays, this time for eastbound traffic. State Patrol trooper Mathews said eastbound I-70 closed near Exit 244 to Beaver Brook around 3:20 p.m. July 5 after a semitrailer\u2019s back wheels caught fire. Around 4:40 p.m., the left lane reopened to traffic and eastbound I-70 was completely reopened at 9:30 p.m., he said.",

There is a growing shortage of drivers, rising costs, and relentless demand for faster deliveries. Plus's SuperDrive software is designed to address these pain points by enabling safe, scalable autonomous trucking. The technology is not just theoretical. It has already been tested over five million miles across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, gathering real-world data to make its AI smarter and more reliable with every trip.\nFounded in Silicon Valley in 2016 by engineers and entrepreneurs with deep roots in AI and machine learning, Plus has always aimed to do things differently. Instead of relying on hand-coded rules, Plus uses advanced AI models to create a \"driving intelligence\" that learns and adapts from every mile on the road. This AV 2.0 approach helped Plus achieve a major safety milestone in April 2025, when its SuperDrive system successfully completed \"driver-out\" validation. The truck operated autonomously without a human behind the wheel. Plus is currently running public road tests in Texas and Sweden, with more fleet trials coming soon.\nHOW TO LOWER YOUR CAR INSURANCE COSTS IN 2025\nDRIVERLESS BIG RIG ROBOTRUCKS ARE NOW ON THE ROAD IN THIS STATE\nThe power of partnerships: OEMs and industry leaders\nOne of Plus's biggest strengths is its deep integration with top truck manufacturers, including TRATON GROUP, Hyundai, and IVECO. These companies are working closely with Plus to factory-build, validate, and support autonomous trucks powered by SuperDrive. This OEM-led strategy means that fleet operators will receive autonomous trucks ready for the road, complete with support from trusted manufacturers.\nPlus is not working in isolation. The company has formed strategic collaborations with industry leaders like DSV, Bosch, and NVIDIA. These partnerships are designed to accelerate the rollout of autonomous capabilities and ensure that the technology is robust, reliable, and ready for real-world deployment. By working together, they are building an ecosystem that supports fleet operators every step of the way.\nWOULD YOU HOP ON THIS DRIVERLESS ELECTRIC CITY BUS?\nFinancial strength and a smart business model\nThe upcoming merger with Churchill Capital Corp IX is expected to provide Plus with up to $300 million in gross proceeds. This capital will help fund the commercial launch of SuperDrive-enabled, factory-built autonomous trucks in 2027. Plus is entering the public market with a pre-money valuation of $1.2 billion, offering an attractive opportunity for investors interested in the next wave of AI-driven logistics.\nWhat sets Plus apart financially is its capital-light, software-focused model. Instead of building trucks from scratch, Plus provides the AI \"brain\" that powers them, generating recurring revenue through a driver-as-a-service approach. This means high margins, scalable growth, and a clear path to profitability. The company is led by a team of experienced founders and executives, including CEO David Liu, who has a proven track record of building and scaling technology startups. Liu underscores the company\u2019s broader mission, stating:\n\"Our long-term vision is to empower fleet operators to run global freight networks with autonomous vehicles that improve safety, enhance efficiency, and reduce costs. We believe the industry is at a critical inflection point, driven by breakthroughs in AI, supportive regulatory momentum, and ecosystem readiness.\"\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\nBIG RIGS DELIVER CARGO WITH NO HUMANS AT THE WHEEL\nWhy autonomous trucking is more relevant than ever\nThe numbers tell a compelling story. The U.S. and Europe together face a shortage of over 300,000 truck drivers every year, and that gap is only expected to widen as the workforce ages. Autonomous trucks offer a real solution by reducing operating costs, increasing truck utilization, and helping fleet operators keep up with demand. Plus's SuperDrive system is purpose-built for these challenges. With ongoing fleet trials and partnerships, the company is well-positioned to deliver a safe, scalable alternative to traditional trucking.\n15 BEST FEATURES OF AMAZON PRIME YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT\nWhat's next for Plus and the industry?\nLooking ahead, Plus is targeting the commercial launch of its SuperDrive-enabled trucks in 2027, starting in the U.S. and expanding into Europe. With operations in California, Texas, and Germany, Plus is ready to support customers on both sides of the Atlantic. The company's long-term vision is to empower fleet operators to run global freight networks with autonomous vehicles that improve safety, boost efficiency, and cut costs.\nNot everyone is onboard: Skepticism and industry pushback\nWhile Plus Automation's vision is ambitious, it is not without critics. The autonomous trucking industry continues to face scrutiny from regulators, labor unions, and some logistics professionals who question whether the technology is truly ready for wide-scale deployment.\nRegulatory uncertainty remains one of the biggest obstacles. Fully autonomous, driver-out operations like Plus is testing raise complex questions about safety, liability, and insurance. Many policymakers are cautious, arguing that current oversight and laws have not yet adapted to the fast-moving landscape of vehicle automation.\nLabor organizations, particularly the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have voiced strong opposition. They warn that the widespread adoption of autonomous trucks could displace tens of thousands of human drivers and impact job security across the freight industry. These groups are pushing for more transparency, safety assurances, and legal protections for workers as automation expands. In a public statement opposing the rapid rollout of autonomous trucks, Sean M. O'Brien, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said this:\n\"We are not going to sit back and watch as automation threatens the livelihood of millions of truck drivers across America.\"\nThis quote underscores the growing tension between innovation and labor rights. For many in the workforce, autonomous trucking is seen less as a technological leap forward and more as a potential disruption to long-standing jobs and livelihoods.\nEven within the logistics industry itself, some operators remain skeptical about the pace of adoption. Questions remain about how autonomous systems will handle unpredictable real-world conditions such as bad weather, complex intersections, and rural roadways where sensor performance can vary.\nIn response, Plus emphasizes its phased approach to automation. Rather than replacing drivers overnight, the company positions its SuperDrive system as a way to augment human capabilities, improve safety, and reduce fatigue. Its deep partnerships with trusted manufacturers and logistics providers are also aimed at easing the transition and building confidence across the industry.\nAs Plus prepares to go public, how it addresses these concerns from regulators, workers, and industry stakeholders will be critical. Earning trust may prove just as important as advancing the technology itself.\nSUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES\nThe long road to autonomous safety\nAccording to Linda Garner-Bunch, managing editor of The Trucker Media Group:\n\"The idea of developing viable \u2014 and safe \u2014 autonomous Class 8 trucks has been around since the 1990s, with lots of tech firms tossing their hats in the ring. Many of those firms have failed, often because of a lack of funding. In addition, both the general public and the trucking industry have expressed concerns about the safety of current autonomous technology. After all, an 80,000-pound driverless truck can do a lot more damage than a 6,000-pound passenger car if something goes wrong!\nTo address this, legislation has been introduced requiring that a qualified human operator be present in autonomous heavy-duty trucks to take over manual control as needed. Even so, autonomous tech is becoming increasingly common in both commercial and private vehicles \u2014 think anti-lock brakes, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane assist, camera systems \u2026 the list goes on and on.\nAutonomy may be the future of the trucking industry, but it\u2019s not ready for full deployment at this time. Adequate funding is needed to ensure that the development and testing of autonomous technology is done properly and safely. The merger between Plus and Churchill Capital Corp IX will help ensure the company has the necessary capital to conduct research, development, and testing while ensuring the safety of everyone on the road.\"\nKurt's key takeaways\nAutonomous trucking might still sound futuristic to some, but companies like Plus Automation are proving it's already becoming a reality. With real-world testing, major industry partnerships, and a smart approach to scaling, Plus is putting itself in a strong position to lead this next chapter in logistics. That said, the journey won't be without its challenges. From regulatory roadblocks to concerns about the impact on jobs, there's still a lot to figure out. But if Plus can keep building trust and showing that its tech really does make trucking safer and more efficient, it could help reshape how freight moves across the U.S. and beyond.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAre you ready to share the road with autonomous trucks powered by AI instead of human drivers, or do you think there are still hurdles to overcome before this technology should go mainstream?

Rubio to meet China's foreign minister in Malaysia as US-Chinese tensions mount\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is wrapping his up his second and final day at a Southeast Asian security conference with a high-stakes meeting with his Chinese counterpart as tensions grow over issues from trade to security and China\u2019s support for...\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is wrapping his up his second and final day at a Southeast Asian security conference with a high-stakes meeting with his Chinese counterpart as tensions grow between Washington and Beijing over issues from trade to security and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine.\nAfter discussions with regional countries at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations forum in Malaysia, Rubio on Friday was close out his first official trip to Asia in his first face-to-face talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the State Department said.\nThe meeting comes less than 24 hours after Rubio met in Kuala Lumpur with another rival, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, during which they discussed potential new avenues to jumpstart Ukraine peace talks.\nThe meetings come against a backdrop of global and regional unease over U.S. policies, notably on trade and large tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on friend and foe alike.\nWhile Rubio heard complaints about the tariffs from his Southeast Asian counterparts, he told reporters Thursday that many of them focused their discussion on security issues, their concerns about Chinese domination and desire for cooperation with the U.S.\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s raised. It\u2019s an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t say it solely defines our relationship with many of these countries. There are a lot of other issues that we work together on, and I think there was great enthusiasm that we were here and that we\u2019re a part of this.\u201d\nHowever, Trump sees China as the biggest threat to the United States in multiple fields, not least technology and trade, and like previous U.S. presidents has watched the country greatly expand its influence globally while turning increasingly assertive in the Indo-Pacific, notably toward its small neighbors over the South China Sea and Taiwan.\nTrump has warned of massive tariffs that he could impose on Chinese exports to the United States and preliminary discussions between the two sides have yet to produce significant progress.\nSince former President Joe Biden was in office, the U.S. has also accused China of assisting Russia in rebuilding its military industrial sector to help it execute its war against Ukraine. Rubio said the Trump administration shares that view.\n\u201cI think the Chinese clearly have been supportive of the Russian effort, and I think that generally they\u2019ve been willing to help them as much as they can without getting caught,\u201d Rubio said Thursday, suggesting the topic would be discussed if he and Wang met.\nRubio and Wang have been shadow boxing during the two-day ASEAN meeting with each touting the benefits of their countries' partnerships with Southeast Asian nations.\nWhile Rubio has played up cooperation with the U.S., signing a civil-nuclear cooperation agreement with Malaysia for instance, Wang has railed against Trump's threatened tariffs, notably against almost all of ASEAN's 10 member states, calling them an abuse and an attempt to subvert free and open trade and a danger to global financial stability.\nWhile noting an overall \u201cpositive\u201d situation in East Asia, in his discussions with Southeast Asian foreign ministers, Wang warned of growing challenges brought by \u201cunilateral protectionism and the arbitrary imposition of tariffs by certain major powers.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Wang and Lavrov met and delivered a subtle but unmistakable warning to the United States over Southeast Asia.\n\u201cRussia and China both support ASEAN\u2019s central role in regional cooperation, are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and are wary of certain major powers creating divisions and instigating confrontation in the region,\u201d they said, according to Russia's foreign ministry.\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",
            "Rubio in discussions with Russia\u2019s Lavrov as war tensions soar - OrissaPOST. Kuala Lumpur: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart met Thursday in Malaysia as tensions between the countries rise over Moscow\u2019s increasing attacks on Ukraine and whether Russia\u2019s leader is serious about a peace deal.\nRubio and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held talks in Kuala Lumpur on the sidelines of the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, which brings together 10 ASEAN members and their most important diplomatic partners, including Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, European nations and the US.\nThe meeting lasted around 50 minutes. Rubio was seen winking at Lavrov afterwards as reporters shouted questions, which they both ignored.\nThe meeting was their second encounter since Rubio took office, although they have spoken by phone several times. Their first meeting took place in February in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as the Trump administration sought to test Russia and Ukraine on their willingness to make peace.\nThursday\u2019s meeting occurred shortly after the US resumed some shipments of defensive weapons to Ukraine following a pause, ostensibly for the Pentagon to review domestic munitions stocks, which was cheered in Moscow.\nThe resumption comes as Russia fires escalating air attacks on Ukraine and as US President Donald Trump has become increasingly frustrated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\u201cPutin is not, he\u2019s not treating human beings right,\u201d Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, explaining the pause\u2019s reversal. \u201cIt\u2019s killing too many people. So we\u2019re sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I\u2019ve approved that.\u201d\nUS diplomatic push could be overshadowed by tariff threats\nRubio was also seeing other foreign ministers, including many whose countries face tariffs set to be imposed August 1. The tariff threat could overshadow the top diplomat\u2019s first official trip to Asia, just as the US seeks to boost relations with Indo-Pacific nations to counter China\u2019s growing influence in the region.\nRubio sought to assuage concerns as he held group talks with ASEAN foreign ministers.\n\u201cThe Indo-Pacific, the region, remains a focal point of US foreign policy,\u201d he told them. \u201cWhen I hear in the news that perhaps the United States or the world might be distracted by events in other parts of the planet, I would say distraction is impossible, because it is our strong view and the reality that this century and the story of next 50 years will largely be written here in this region.\u201d\n\u201cThese are relationships and partnerships that we intend to continue to build on without seeking the approval or the permission of any other actor in the region of the world,\u201d Rubio said in an apparent reference to China.\nTrump notified several countries Monday and Wednesday that they will face higher tariffs if they don\u2019t make trade deals with the US. Among them are eight of ASEAN\u2019s 10 members.\nUS State Department officials said tariffs and trade won\u2019t be Rubio\u2019s focus during the meetings, which Trump\u2019s Republican administration hopes will prioritise maritime safety and security in the South China Sea, where China has become increasingly aggressive toward its small neighbours, as well as combating transnational crime.\nBut Rubio may be hard-pressed to avoid the tariff issue that has vexed some of Washington\u2019s closest allies and partners in Asia, including Japan and South Korea and most members of ASEAN, which Trump says would face 25 per cent tariffs if there is no deal.\nRubio also met with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has warned that global trade is being weaponised to coerce weaker nations. Anwar urged the bloc Wednesday to strengthen regional trade and reduce reliance on external powers.\nRubio\u2019s \u201ctalking points on the China threat will not resonate with officials whose industries are being battered by 30-40 per cent tariffs,\u201d said Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific during the Obama administration.\nWhen Anwar said \u201cASEAN will approach challenges as a united bloc\u2019 he wasn\u2019t talking about Chinese coercion but about US tariffs,\u201d Russel noted.\nMajority of ASEAN members face major tariff hikes\nAmong ASEAN states, Trump has announced tariffs on almost all of the bloc\u2019s 10 members.\nTrump sent tariff letters to two more ASEAN members Wednesday: Brunei, whose imports would be taxed at 25 per cent, and the Philippines at 20 per cent. Others hit this week include Cambodia at 36 per cent, Indonesia at 32 per cent, Laos at 40 per cent, Malaysia at 25 per cent, Myanmar at 40 per cent and Thailand at 36 per cent.\nVietnam recently agreed to a trade deal for a 20 per cent tariff on its imports, while Singapore still faces a 10 per cent tariff that was imposed in April. The Trump administration has courted most Southeast Asian nations in a bid to blunt or at least temper China\u2019s push to dominate the region.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, Rubio will also likely come face-to-face with China\u2019s foreign minister during his visit of about 36 hours.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is a veteran of such gatherings and \u201cfluent in ASEAN principles and conventions,\u201d while Rubio \u201cis a rookie trying to sell an \u2018America First\u2019 message to a deeply skeptical audience,\u201d Russel noted.\nIssues with China remain substantial, including trade, human rights, militarisation of the South China Sea and China\u2019s support for Russia in Ukraine.\nUS officials continue to accuse China of resupplying and revamping Russia\u2019s military industrial sector, allowing it to produce additional weapons that can be used to attack Ukraine.\nEarlier Thursday, Rubio signed a memorandum on civilian nuclear energy with Malaysia\u2019s foreign minister, which will pave the way for negotiations on a more formal nuclear cooperation deal, known as a 123 agreement after the section of US law allowing such programmes.\nThose agreements allow the US government and US companies to work with and invest in civilian energy nuclear programmes in other countries under strict supervision.\nAP",

Rubio was seen winking at Lavrov afterward as reporters shouted questions, which they both ignored.\nThe meeting was their second encounter since Rubio took office, although they have spoken by phone several times. Their first meeting took place in February in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as the Trump administration sought to test Russia and Ukraine on their willingness to make peace.\nThursday's meeting occurred shortly after the U.S. resumed some shipments of defensive weapons to Ukraine following a pause, ostensibly for the Pentagon to review domestic munitions stocks, that was cheered in Moscow.\nThe resumption comes as Russia fires escalating air attacks on Ukraine and as U.S. President Donald Trump has become increasingly frustrated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\u201cPutin is not, he\u2019s not treating human beings right,\u201d Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, explaining the pause\u2019s reversal. \u201cIt\u2019s killing too many people. So we\u2019re sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I\u2019ve approved that.\u201d\nRubio was also seeing other foreign ministers, including many whose countries face tariffs set to be imposed Aug. 1. The tariff threat could overshadow the top diplomat\u2019s first official trip to Asia, just as the U.S. seeks to boost relations with Indo-Pacific nations to counter China\u2019s growing influence in the region.\nRubio sought to assuage concerns as he held group talks with ASEAN foreign ministers.\n\u201cThe Indo Pacific, the region, remains a focal point of U.S. foreign policy,\u201d he told them. \u201cWhen I hear in the news that perhaps the United States or the world might be distracted by events in other parts of the planet, I would say distraction is impossible, because it is our strong view and the reality that this century and the story of next 50 years will largely be written here in this region.\u201d\n\u201cThese are relationships and partnerships that we intend to continue to build on without seeking the approval or the permission of any other actor in the region of the world,\u201d Rubio said in an apparent reference to China.\nTrump notified several countries on Monday and Wednesday that they will face higher tariffs if they don\u2019t make trade deals with the U.S. Among them are eight of ASEAN's 10 members.\nU.S. State Department officials said tariffs and trade won't be Rubio\u2019s focus during the meetings, which Trump\u2019s Republican administration hopes will prioritize maritime safety and security in the South China Sea, where China has become increasingly aggressive toward its small neighbors, as well as combating transnational crime.\nBut Rubio may be hard-pressed to avoid the tariff issue that has vexed some of Washington's closest allies and partners in Asia, including Japan and South Korea and most members of ASEAN, which Trump says would face 25% tariffs if there is no deal.\nRubio also met with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has warned global trade is being weaponized to coerce weaker nations. Anwar urged the bloc Wednesday to strengthen regional trade and reduce reliance on external powers.\nRubio\u2019s \u201ctalking points on the China threat will not resonate with officials whose industries are being battered by 30-40% tariffs,\u201d said Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific during the Obama administration.\nWhen Anwar said \"ASEAN will approach challenges \u2018as a united bloc\u2019 he wasn\u2019t talking about Chinese coercion but about U.S. tariffs,\u201d Russel noted.\nAmong ASEAN states, Trump has announced tariffs on almost all of the bloc's 10 members.\nTrump sent tariff letters to two more ASEAN members Wednesday: Brunei, whose imports would be taxed at 25%, and the Philippines at 20%. Others hit this week include Cambodia at 36%, Indonesia at 32%, Laos at 40%, Malaysia at 25%, Myanmar at 40% and Thailand at 36%.\nVietnam recently agreed to a trade deal for a 20% tariffs on its imports, while Singapore still faces a 10% tariff that was imposed in April. The Trump administration has courted most Southeast Asian nations in a bid to blunt or at least temper China\u2019s push to dominate the region.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, Rubio also will likely come face-to-face with China's foreign minister during his visit of about 36 hours.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is a veteran of such gatherings and \u201cfluent in ASEAN principles and conventions,\u201d while Rubio \u201cis a rookie trying to sell an \u2018America First\u2019 message to a deeply skeptical audience,\" Russel noted.\nIssues with China remain substantial, including trade, human rights, militarization of the South China Sea and China's support for Russia in Ukraine.\nU.S. officials continue to accuse China of resupplying and revamping Russia\u2019s military industrial sector, allowing it to produce additional weapons that can be used to attack Ukraine.\nEarlier on Thursday, Rubio signed a memorandum on civilian nuclear energy with Malaysia\u2019s foreign minister, which will pave the way for negotiations on a more formal nuclear cooperation deal, known as a 123 agreement after the section of U.S. law allowing such programs.\nThose agreements allow the U.S. government and U.S. companies to work with and invest in civilian energy nuclear programs in other countries under strict supervision.\n___\nEileen Ng contributed to this report.\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

            "A court called off a key 9/11 suspect's plea deal. Here's where the case stands. NEW YORK \u2014 The United States' long legal case against accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed remains in limbo after an appeals court this week scrapped a plea deal that the government had negotiated but had later withdrawn.\nEssentially, the ruling leaves the case on track for trial before a military commission. It is unclear when that might happen.\nHere's what to know about the case and how it got here:\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed is accused mastermind of 9/11\nMohammed is accused of developing and directing al-Qaida\u2019s plot to crash hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. Another of the hijacked planes flew into a field in Pennsylvania. In all, nearly 3,000 people were killed in one of the deadliest attacks ever on the United States.\nMohammed was arrested in 2003 in Pakistan and eventually taken to the U.S. military base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. At the time, it was where the U.S. held hundreds of men captured in President George W. Bush's \u201cwar on terror.\u201d\nMilitary prosecutors filed charges in 2008 against Mohammed and some co-defendants. After an Obama-era plan to try them in a civilian court in New York collapsed, the case remained with the military commission.\nThe case dragged on through years of legal and logistical challenges. A major point of contention has been how much the evidence and case have been tainted by the men\u2019s torture while in CIA custody during the first years after their capture. Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times.\nThe plea deal called for life in prison\nMilitary prosecutors and defense lawyers began plea talks several years ago. Last year, Mohammed and two others agreed to plead guilty, under an agreement that would have led to life in prison instead of a potential death penalty. The deal also would have required the men to answer questions posed by Sept. 11 victims' relatives.\nMilitary prosecutors called the arrangement \u201cthe best path to finality and justice.\u201d Some 9/11 families also saw the deal as the best hope for bringing the painful case to a conclusion and getting some answers from the defendants.\nBut other victims\u2019 relatives said a trial was the right way to get justice and information, and some saw the plea deal as capitulation. Republican lawmakers also criticized the agreement, negotiated during Democratic President Joe Biden's administration.\nDefense secretary withdrew the plea deal\nThen-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin soon rescinded the deal, saying that victims' relatives, U.S. troops and the American public \u201c deserve the opportunity \u201d to see military commission trials play out.\nDefense attorneys and the government wrangled in various courts over whether Austin was legally able to scrap the deal. It was on-again, off-again for months. A panel of appeals judges put it on hold in January and then, on Friday, issued 2-1 ruling saying that Austin had the authority to rescind the agreement. The order bars the military judge from taking any guilty pleas under the now-undone deal.\nThe case could be headed to pretrial stage\nIt is not clear whether defense lawyers plan to appeal. A message seeking comment was sent Saturday to Mohammed's attorneys.\nWithout a plea deal, the case would once again be back in the pretrial stage within the military commission system, with the legal and logistical complications that it has faced. Questions about whether the men's torture would prevent the use of evidence, including statements they made, are yet to be resolved.\nCopyright 2025 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

            "From the Streets of LA to the National Stage: The Left Must Win the Cultural War. Part of the Series\nThe Public Intellectual\nDid you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.\nOn June 6, resistance ignited in the streets of Los Angeles to confront the Trump regime\u2019s brutal campaign against immigrants, enforced by the brutality of ICE agents and the machinery of mass deportation. In a chilling escalation, Trump branded the protesters \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d and threatened the use of military force \u2014 turning dissent into a crime and protest into a pretext for repression. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, called Los Angeles \u201coccupied territory,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for years this is a fight to save civilization.\u201d\nThis is not merely the rhetoric of strongman fantasies; it is the language of fascist ambition, a calculated pretext to invoke the Insurrection Act and erect a police state. Beneath this chilling facade lies something far more ominous: the weaponization of the war on immigrants as a means to orchestrate ethnic cleansing, veiled under the apparatus of law and the grotesque spectacle of state power. Moreover, as Kristi Noem and Trump have blatantly outlined, their assault on immigrants extends beyond individual lives \u2014 it\u2019s a direct attack on the U.S.\u2019s largest cities, like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, which stand as Democratic Party strongholds. When they claim to be liberating these urban centers from \u201csocialists,\u201d they are not just declaring war on ideological foes, they are also setting the stage for a fascist takeover, one rooted in division and destruction. This is not about upholding law and order; it is the calculated weaponization of authoritarian culture to escalate state violence, instill terror, criminalize dissent, and legitimize white nationalist ideology. By framing defiance as treason, Trump attempts to cloak his own authoritarian crimes while constructing a political climate where any challenge to power is met with brutal retaliation. As Michelle Goldberg noted in The New York Times, \u201cThis is what autocracy looks like.\u201d\nThe authoritarian dream is rooted in the belief that state violence should serve as the primary tool of governance. When the guardrails of democracy are dismantled, violence shifts from being a last resort to a governing principle. This is precisely what unfolded in Los Angeles, where Trump deployed the National Guard and Marines to crush protests against his mass deportation policies, while mobilizing ICE as a modern-day Gestapo. What cannot be ignored is that the militarization of civil society is not merely an overreaction or illegal response to a fabricated insurrection; it is the very foundation upon which martial law is established, paving the way for a fully realized fascist state. What unfolded in LA was not an insurrection; it was the people rising in defense of democracy. The true insurrection happened on January 6, with Trump as its chief architect. Yet once again, violence was being used not to protect democracy, but to crush it.\nGet our free emails\nWhat we are witnessing is a spectacle of domination. The deployment of troops, the vigilante targeting of Democratic lawmakers, the planned grotesquerie of Trump\u2019s military parade, and Trump\u2019s order for ICE to target cities led by Democrats are not isolated events \u2014 they are scenes in the same authoritarian drama. Together, they represent a fusion of militarism and national identity, designed to normalize cruelty, fetishize strength, and recast obedience as patriotism. As Susan Sontag once warned, fascism cloaks violence in the aesthetics of spectacle \u2014 making submission not only palatable, but seductive. This is the pornography of power \u2014 where culture and repression merge in a theater of fear, scripted to extinguish political imagination and render dissent illegible.\nIn this moment of escalating violence, Trump\u2019s use of force is more than a show of control \u2014 it is a pedagogical performance meant to normalize repression and etch it into public consciousness. This is fascist aesthetics reimagined for a media-saturated age, where power must not only be wielded but displayed as performance. Here, domination is choreographed, televised, and turned into a civic lesson. The spectacle becomes a tutorial in submission, transforming images of state violence into instruments of mass indoctrination. Culture is not summoned to illuminate reality but to obliterate it, replacing historical memory with myth, dissent with loyalty, and resistance with silence. The convergence of Trump\u2019s militarized crackdown in Los Angeles and his self-aggrandizing parade of force reveals a machinery of destruction no longer hidden but flaunted, a grotesque exhibition engineered to numb the senses and turn state terror into a national ritual.\nThe Terrain of Culture Is Central in the Struggle Against Authoritarianism\nIn the current political moment, we would do well to remember Milan Kundera\u2019s words from The Book of Laughter and Forgetting:\nThe first step in liquidating a people is to erase its memory. Destroy its books, its culture, its history. Then have someone write new books, manufacture a new culture, invent a new history. Before long the nation will begin to forget what it is and what it was.\nIndeed dominant culture is not peripheral to politics; it is its staging ground, its arsenal, and, increasingly, its most contested terrain. Authoritarianism does not rely solely on law or policy; it reshapes consciousness, manufactures consent, and weaves the logic of domination into the fabric of everyday life. Under Trump, culture is not merely an accessory to power \u2013 it is the weapon and the war zone.\nDemocracy is not shattered only by the blunt force of military coups; instead, it can be hollowed out from within, undermined by the ghosts of past tyrannies reanimated through symbols, digital technologies, and the ever-churning machinery of social media. Today, power speaks in the seductive language of images laced with bigotry, seeded with cruelty, and driven by the logic of exclusion and ethnic cleansing. Culture is no longer merely a reflection of the past; it has become its erasure. It functions as pedagogy \u2014 through what Ariella A\u00efsha Azoulay names as \u201cimperial technologies,\u201d and what I have called \u201cdisimagination machines.\u201d It is designed to strip the colonized not only of their futures but of their histories, their very presence in the world. In this age of resurgent fascisms, we see its devastating effects in the genocidal assault waged by Israel against the Palestinian people, and in the scorched-earth war on historical memory and civic belonging carried out by the Trump regime in the United States. Culture is no longer a backdrop to political struggle \u2014 it is its very stage, its arsenal, and its battleground. Culture as an educational force is no longer subordinate to relations of power \u2014 it is the very essence of politics.\nAs Catherine Caruso points out in Harvard News, \u201cAI-powered autonomous weapons represent a new era in warfare and pose a concrete threat to scientific progress and basic research.\u201d Yet the danger extends far beyond the battlefield. Artificial intelligence now plays an insidious role in shaping policy, normalizing militarism, censoring ethical debate, and legitimizing what can only be described as a culture of war. It reconfigures not only how we fight but also how we think \u2014 molding public consciousness in ways that privilege surveillance over solidarity, control over compassion.\nFor instance, the rise of artificial intelligence is accelerating a cultural transformation that is as dangerous as it is seductive. When OpenAI recently shut down its ChatGPT responses on the Gaza war for \u201csafety\u201d reasons, it wasn\u2019t a glitch, \u2014 it was a warning. AI is not just organizing knowledge; it is curating memory, defining what can be said, and erasing what must be forgotten. In the wrong hands \u2014 and increasingly in the hands of authoritarian regimes and corporate overlords \u2014 AI becomes a weapon not of innovation but of ideological control. Brett Wilkins reports in Common Dreams that \u201ccommercial AI models are directly being used\u201d by Israel in Gaza for mass surveillance and the targeting of \u201ccritics, dissidents, and opponents.\u201d Culture, in this context, is no longer merely shaped by human struggle and historical memory; it is engineered, automated, and sanitized.\nToo many on the left have long overlooked a fundamental truth: The real battle against gangster capitalism and its updated fascist versions is not solely over policies or economies but over culture itself \u2014 over the values, desires, and everyday practices that shape how people see the world and their place within it.\nCapitalism Is Not Merely an Economic System\nHistorically, some strands of Marxist and progressive thought have dismissed culture as secondary or irrelevant \u2014 a critique that scholar Judith Butler powerfully challenged in their 1997 essay. They argued that the left\u2019s cultural focus was wrongly seen as abandoning the materialist core of Marxist politics, often accused of being \u201cfactionalizing, identitarian, and [narrowly] particularistic.\u201d\nDownplaying the role of culture is not just a tactical misstep \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental error. As Antonio Gramsci warned, all politics is pedagogical, and every exercise of \u201chegemony\u201d is inherently an educational act. In a capitalist society, the power of education does more than repress critical thought and informed consciousness, it actively shapes and empowers. It creates subjects, molds emotions, and defines what we accept as sensible.\nAs Theodor Adorno argued, capitalism is not merely an economic system but a totalizing cultural force, shaping desire through the \u201cculture industry\u201d \u2014 reducing human experience to commodified clich\u00e9s and reinforcing conformity through repetition and distraction. Raymond Williams insisted that culture is both ordinary and political, embedded in the everyday practices through which people live and make meaning. Like Vaclav Havel, he believed that, \u201cthe political is not independent of the cultural, but it follows it.\u201d\nIn this view, politics follows culture because the culture is the terrain in which politics establishes itself, the framework through which individuals are shaped, and the force that reproduces societies in ways that sustain distinct political systems. Stuart Hall\u2019s work is crucial here in illuminating how culture is the site where ideology takes root, where identities are formed, contested, and secured. As Bruce Robbins notes in a commentary on Hall, the cultural theorist argued that everyday life could not be separated from politics as a matter of lived experience, and that culture could not be removed from \u201cthe political and economic structures that constrained it.\u201d\nThis was particularly true for Hall\u2019s critique of neoliberalism, which he viewed not only as an economic system but also as a pedagogical project. According to Hall, capitalism is not just enforced from above; it is lived, felt, and reproduced from below, woven into the most intimate structures of daily life, particularly given its notion that the market is the template for all social relations and embracing Margaret Thatcher\u2019s toxic claim that there is no such thing as society.\nConfronting the Current Dominant Culture of Cruelty\nWe are, in this Trumpian historical moment, suffocating under a dominant culture that functions as a powerful disimagination machine, shaping desires, identities, and common sense through a vast network of pedagogical sites, from social media and news platforms to advertising, entertainment, and relentless political spectacles. Education is no longer merely an institutional force; it has become the most decisive cultural arena where individual and collective consciousness is produced and contested. Hall understood this with prophetic clarity. For him, culture is never outside politics, it is the terrain on which political struggle is fought, particularly through the politics of identification.\nLater in his life, Hall warned that the left had failed to grasp the educative dimension of politics, the need to transform not just policies but the very framework through which people interpret the world and their place in it. In a 2012 interview with The Guardian\u2019s Zoe Williams, Hall put it bluntly: \u201cThe left is in trouble. It\u2019s not got any ideas, it\u2019s not got any independent analysis of its own, and therefore it\u2019s got no vision. It just takes the temperature: \u2018Whoa, that\u2019s no good, let\u2019s move to the right.\u2019 It has no sense of politics being educative, of politics changing the way people see things.\u201d\nFor Hall, without this pedagogical imperative, the left forfeits its ability to generate hope, build alliances, and forge new political subjectivities: The promise of democracy is torn asunder. In the shadow of rising state terrorism, bodies are broken, abducted, and freedoms extinguished. Silence spreads like a fog. It blankets the cries of the young, the starving children of Gaza; lives obliterated by bombs and buried by indifference as entire families are killed by Israel in Gaza. The horror knows no borders, reproduced at home as immigrant youth in the United States are torn from their families, thrust into a trauma so vast it swallows the future.\nMeanwhile, as Peter Baker notes in The New York Times, the demagogue-in-chief revels in gifts from dictators, ranging from a luxury flying palace from Qatar to collecting \u201c$320 million in fees from a new cryptocurrency\u201d and shamelessly brokering \u201coverseas real estate deals worth billions of dollars.\u201d Trump displays his vast corruption while openly normalizing the widespread abuse of presidential power. How else to explain his \u201copening an exclusive club in Washington called the Executive Branch [while] charging $500,000 apiece to join,\u201d all the while presiding over a regime that slashes \u201cfunding for health care, food and education through some of the largest cuts in U.S. history, while even raising taxes on many low-income families\u201d?\nThis is a Trump-Musk-engineered culture of cruelty, ramped up to grotesque extremes, a form of state terrorism that Bill Gates aptly describes as \u201ckilling the world\u2019s poorest children,\u201d both here and abroad. Beneath the surface, the agenda is clear: Trump\u2019s budget, which he calls \u201cone big, beautiful bill,\u201d is a deliberate weapon of mass inequality, ruthlessly crafted to fatten the coffers of the financial elite while punishing the most vulnerable. In addition, it has the \u201cpotential to increase the federal deficit by up to $3.8 trillion over the next decade.\u201d This monstrous budget, born from the twisted minds of Trump and his MAGA sycophants, is so brutal that Paul Krugman condemns it as a product of \u201csadistic zombies,\u201d a horrifying manifestation of cruelty that reflects the regime\u2019s moral decay. His anger is rightly focused on a budget that slashes taxes for the ultra-wealthy while funneling endless resources into instruments of state violence, all in the name of control, domination, and the obliteration of any semblance of social justice, both within our borders and beyond.\nThis is more than a policy crisis. It is a cultural catastrophe. Fascism today is not only wrapped in lawless decrees and armed repression, it is also cloaked in spectacles of cruelty and a language steeped in hate and terminal exclusion. Trump\u2019s fervent advocates, Elon Musk and Steve Bannon, raise Nazi salutes, as though rehearsing for the dark future they are determined to summon. Stephen Miller channels Hitler\u2019s rhetoric under the guise of patriotism, declaring that \u201cAmerica is for Americans and Americans only.\u201d Trump resurrects the Confederacy, embracing its monuments, symbols, and genocidal logic. In their hands, the culture of fascism is not hidden. It is performed, televised, and normalized. The horror of fascist violence is back, though it is now draped in AI-guided bombs, ethnic cleansing, and white supremacists basking in their project of racial cleansing while destroying every vestige of decency, human rights, and democracy.\nWhat we are witnessing is the death not just of democracy but of moral and civic conscience itself. A collective numbness has settled in, a culture of forgetting, cruelty and complicity, where silence speaks louder than resistance, enabling the violence to grow unchecked. In part, this is fueled by an anti-intellectualism and culture that embraces civic illiteracy, a culture of immediacy that banishes informed judgment and contemplation, and institutions that embrace critical thought as a foundation for creating critical citizens. We are not merely talking about the death of the imagination, but an attack on any institutions that provide what Hannah Arendt once called \u201cthinking without a banister.\u201d\nAt the heart of this decay lies a cultural ethos cultivated by capitalism for decades: to live is to consume, selfishness is freedom, personal responsibility eclipses systemic problems, and solidarity is weakness. Culture has become a site of struggle, now more intense than ever, amplified by new digital technologies, social media, podcasts, and a host of other pedagogical platforms. These platforms not only disempower resistance but also amplify the forces of domination, shaping the contours of public discourse and ideological control. Society fragments further, social atomization rises, and the numbing routines of a consumer-driven spectacle are matched by what Jonathan Crary calls \u201cvacant forms of attentiveness.\u201d\nCorporate-controlled cultural apparatuses now hold immense pedagogical and political power, reshaping the relationship between power, culture, and daily life. Everyday existence is captive to new modes of socialization, a tsunami of fragmentation, and the dissolution of society, driven by the morally numbing routines of a punishing state and its ever-expanding criminalization of free speech and social problems. In such a climate, the ideological mobilization of memory, agency, and desire becomes inseparable from the pedagogical construction of neoliberal public spaces and civic life, laying the foundation for an emerging authoritarianism.\nAlso central to this emerging fascism is a culture in which memory is rendered inaccessible, critical thinking is scorned, and dissent is branded as treason, subject to harsh penalties imposed by a regime of terror \u2014 one that includes abductions, attacks on due process, an unprecedented assault on higher education, and a growing political culture of corruption and lawlessness.\nThis isn\u2019t to suggest that culture is simply absorbed into an all-encompassing system of domination, subjugated by the unchecked power of brutal billionaires and Vichy-like politicians. On the contrary, culture has moved to the front lines of struggle, central to the effort to normalize gangster capitalism, erase institutions that promote democratic values, and create an army of loyal fascist subjects. The vicious attacks by the Trump administration on higher education, public schools, journalists, oppositional media, and dissident politicians demonstrate the fear of Trump and his enablers who recognize the power of these institutions in potentially educating students and the wider public to hold power accountable, to engage in refusal rather than in conformity, adaptation, and political resignation.\nAt the same time, the right\u2019s attacks have eroded the responsibility of institutions like Columbia University to stand against Trump\u2019s assault on academic freedom and free speech. In failing to resist, they become complicit in what Chris Hedges describes as \u201ccapitulations and crackdowns on pro-Palestine activism,\u201d resulting in the suspension, expulsion, and firing of students and professors protesting the genocide in Gaza.\nIn this context, as I recently stated in an interview on Courage My Friends podcast, that critical education is the glue that connects hope, justice, and the fight for a real, radical democracy. If we fail to recognize the centrality of education, the left will be in serious trouble. But equally crucial is the need to rethink the power of culture as a site of both domination and empowerment, a site that holds profound pedagogical, economic, and political significance in the digital age.\nBuilding a Culture of Solidarity\nCultural politics has a long legacy in Marxist thought, from Gramsci and Hall, to Robin D.G. Kelley, the Frankfurt School and the Situationists, to the radical movements of the 1960s and the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement. It\u2019s time to reignite and propel this work forward, to shape it anew in the crucible of our present crisis and the urgency of this historical moment.\nLate former Uruguayan President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, in one of his speeches, reprinted in Jacobin, argued poignantly that capitalism is not just property relations but a set of cultural values that the Left must confront with a culture of solidarity. He argued strongly that social change could not be reduced to changing capitalist economies and that \u201ccapitalism is a culture\u201d with enormous power that must be understood, analyzed and resisted. The late cultural critic Ellen Willis adds to this insight by noting that at the core of cultural politics is the recognition \u201cthat the project of organizing a democratic political movement necessarily entails the hope that one\u2019s ideas and beliefs are not merely idiosyncratic but speak to vital human needs, interests, and desires, and therefore will be persuasive to many and ultimately most people.\u201d\nMujica\u2019s reflection on the limits of revolutionary strategy underscores the crucial role of culture in any transformative movement, emphasizing that without a profound shift in cultural consciousness, systemic change remains unattainable. This insight directly ties into the larger thesis that fascism cannot be countered merely through political and economic reforms but requires a radical transformation of culture itself, a cultural shift that challenges the very values and ideologies that sustain authoritarianism. He makes clear that struggles over culture are not just about struggles over meaning and identity, but struggles over power, human freedom and equality.\nMujica\u2019s lament is our warning. My generation, he said, made the mistake of believing that revolution meant taking over the means of production. Some of us thought we could change the system without changing the culture. But capitalism, he insisted, survives not through force alone, but through the everyday values it instills, values stronger than any army. You cannot build a new world with people shaped by the old one: \u201cYou cannot build a socialist building with bricklayers who are capitalists,\u201d he warned, because their consciousness will reproduce the very system they seek to overthrow.\nThis insight could not be more relevant and urgent. If we are to resist the death cult of fascism, if we are to reclaim democracy not as a slogan but as a living, breathing ethos, we must begin with culture. Not the commodified culture of products and performances, but culture in its deepest sense: the web of values, relationships, and meanings that shape how we live and what we imagine possible. We need, in short, a cultural revolution rooted in a politics of solidarity, care, limits, and humility. To be revolutionary today means more than redistributing wealth and changing economic structures, however fundamental. It also means redefining what it means to live well. It means teaching each other to resist the seductions of greed and the numbness of cruelty. It means building new ways of being together, of listening, of imagining. As Mujica said, \u201cPoor is the one who needs a lot.\u201d The left must reclaim a culture of enough, of sufficiency rather than excess, of cooperation rather than conquest.\nCulture, as an educational force, does more than mirror society \u2014 it challenges dominant ideologies, unsettles normalized values, and disrupts the social relations that sustain oppression. It cultivates a critical awareness of how power operates, but awareness alone is not enough. Knowledge must ignite action. Critical consciousness must be bound to collective struggles \u2014 to movements that confront the machinery of poverty, the cruelty of inequality, the devastation of climate collapse, and the enduring violence of systemic racism. Without this fusion of insight and resistance, culture risks becoming reflection without consequence, critique without transformation.\nThe challenge for left progressives and others is to produce an anti-capitalist culture that provides the modes of literacy, comprehensive analysis, historical consciousness, and vision to make clear and resist a long legacy of colonialism with its fantasies of displacement, dispossession, and extermination. One cannot be silent or ignore a cultural politics in which Trump calls for a policy that amounts to the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from northern Gaza.\nTrump\u2019s neocolonial vision of an ethnically cleansed Gaza is not policy; it\u2019s cultural imperialism draped in empire, a death wish spoken aloud, a nightmare clawing its way into daylight. The rigor mortis of ethical and political decay, born from colonial and imperial fantasies, is made even more visible by Trump\u2019s call to annex Canada, Panama, and Greenland. Intoxicated with power, this resurgent view of globalization is fashioned on a toxic mix of greed, fear, delusions of grandeur, and cruelty. This is cultural politics in the service of death, a form of politics that not only perpetuates violence but also reshapes society in its own image, normalizing annihilation and dispossession as acceptable byproducts of imperial ambition.\nThere is no future without a cultural shift away from gangster capitalism. Without it, the left risks fading into a mere ghost, clinging to slogans while the world burns, as the politics of extermination, displacement, and ethnic cleansing rage on. The horrors of the past are back, but so too must be our memory, our imagination, and our courage to begin again \u2014 not as mourners of a failed nostalgia, but as creators of a new, insurgent radical democratic culture. A culture that remembers the children, hears the silences, and refuses to let the future be stolen without a fight. The fight against fascism demands a new language, one that integrates materialist and cultural concerns, where the critique of structural domination is inseparable from cultural and educational struggles. This language must reshape how we think about power, justice, and agency, emphasizing the need for a critical pedagogy and cultural transformation that challenges the ideologies sustaining authoritarianism while empowering collective resistance.\nIn this struggle, pedagogy is not peripheral; it is the front line. Education, culture, and daily life are the terrains where fascism is either normalized or resisted. This is where mass consciousness takes root and where the seeds of a transformative political movement are sown. Despair is not an option; it is surrender. In an era when silence is complicity and culture is weaponized to erase memory and stifle dissent, what\u2019s needed is a revolutionary pedagogy, a cultural politics that teaches us to remember, to resist, and to reimagine the world. As the late political philosopher Sheldon Wolin warned, \u201cthe central challenge of our time \u2026 is about nurturing a discordant democracy,\u201d a task that depends on awakening \u201cthe civic consciousness of the nation.\u201d This means placing culture at the very heart of politics \u2014 where critique, agency, and the radical imagination converge.\nKeep the press free.

I\u2019ve got a bit of a heavy heart, watching all the news of the world, and we\u2019re not sure when this will air, but we\u2019re speaking in the midst of the big anti-ICE rebellion in Los Angeles. And also, as a lot of the work that I\u2019ve been organizing for with the Debt Collective is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. So, it\u2019s been real, I\u2019ll say that.\nKH: This is such an overwhelming time, and I\u2019m really grateful for the opportunity to talk with you amid everything that\u2019s happening. Some of our listeners are no doubt familiar with your work and might remember our last conversation, but for the unacquainted, can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you do?\nAT: I am a writer and an occasional documentary filmmaker and an organizer. So, I\u2019ve written books on democracy, my most recent book is on solidarity, but a lot of my energy over the last decade has been focused on building a movement of debtors. So, I co-founded a group called the Debt Collective, which is an experimental union of debtors. We\u2019re most known for our work on student debt cancellation, but we are actually involved in organizing rent debtors or tenants, as well as medical debtors. We also fight for the abolition of school lunch debt, and for the provision of what we call reparative public goods. In other words, the free, high-quality, universal, inclusive public goods that we need, so that we don\u2019t have to go into debt in the first place.\nKH: Well, those sound like essential efforts, and I am extremely grateful that the Debt Collective is out there fighting the good fight. As a fellow writer and organizer, I respect the balancing act, and I also want to pivot, for a moment, to talk about your written work.\nYou and Naomi Klein recently wrote a piece called \u201cThe Rise of End Times Fascism.\u201d What is end times fascism, and how are its leading players different from some of our previous opponents and adversaries?\nAT: First, I guess I just want to say that it was such a delight to get to write an article with Naomi Klein, who is an icon of mine, and someone that I learned a tremendous amount from over the years, and continue to learn from. So, we worked on this piece together, and I think this is one of those pieces where the topic is so bleak, that it was good to have a buddy. Bleak in the sense of spending hours listening to Peter Thiel\u2019s podcast, listening to other reactionary tech figures, and diving into some of the horrors of the Trump administration. So, I know you\u2019re also someone who does co-writing a lot, and I think it can be a great mechanism not just to sort of expand your conceptual and political horizons, but just to have the fortitude required sometimes to face this stuff. So, despite the bleakness of the topic, end times fascism, it was actually an enjoyable writing experience.\nSo, yeah, end times fascism is our name for the specific brand of fascism that we\u2019re facing today, and we call them \u201cend times fascists\u201d because we want to gesture towards a kind of theological resonance. So, these are political figures who are steeped in a religious or quasi-religious narrative that the apocalypse is coming, it\u2019s the end of the world. These are people who have a kind of resonance with the Christian idea of the rapture. So, look at the Trump administration. There are people who are associated with Christian nationalism and Christian Zionism all over the administration, and also there are a lot of technologists, Silicon Valley billionaires, who are also sort of finding Jesus these days, including the aforementioned Peter Thiel.\nSo, end times fascism hints at that, but it also has a material component, which is that these are people who are pursuing policies that are hastening the collapse of ecosystems, of economies, of ways of life, that this is a kind of genocidal politics as well. Fascism is strange, and obviously fascism isn\u2019t new, but we, at one point, cite Umberto Eco, who has a famous book about fascism that listeners have probably read, and sort of lists some of the traits of sort of classic what he calls \u201cUr-Fascism,\u201d sort of universal fascism: anti-intellectualism, hatred of others, immigrants, a lack of curiosity, the merging of corporations and the state. And then he highlights\u2026 he flags what he calls an \u201cArmageddon complex,\u201d this idea that there\u2019s a constant prepping for the end of the world, this final battle, this sort of militaristic Armageddon mindset.\nBut what he says is, the fascism of his time, this was a writer who grew up under Mussolini, did at least say, \u201cHey, for our followers, things are going to get better. We\u2019re going to have this purified paradise at the end of this conflict.\u201d And our provocation is that the fascists today aren\u2019t even offering that.\nWhat they\u2019re offering is a kind of constant remix of the past, right? This, \u201cWe\u2019re going to make America great again.\u201d This kind of nostalgia, combined with this sort of even more sinister but realist acceptance that the policies they\u2019re pursuing really are apocalyptic. The people in the Trump administration are not climate denialists. Corporate America knows that climate change is real, and they\u2019re choosing to accelerate it anyway. So, these are people who aren\u2019t just putting their hands up as the world burns, they\u2019re actually adding gasoline to the fire.\nSo, that was a little bit of a long introduction to the idea, but this is why I think this idea that these are people who understand, they\u2019re not in the dark, they understand that what they\u2019re doing is devastating, and they\u2019re doing it anyway. And their hope is basically that they can grab a lot of wealth, and insulate themselves from the horrors that they\u2019re unleashing.\nKH: Let\u2019s talk more about the religiosity of this phenomenon. On this show, we\u2019ve dug into longtermism and other cults of Silicon Valley, and we\u2019ve also discussed the role of Christian Nationalism in the current moment. In a second Trump administration, the accelerationist ideologies of tech and the evangelical agenda really converge. How are beliefs about death, judgment, and the fate of humanity fueling the politics of end times fascism?\nAT: What\u2019s interesting is there\u2019s been a lot of attention, and I think rightly so, because it could be strategically helpful on the divisions in the Trump Coalition, which is a very strange coalition. A lot has been made, for example, the battle between Steve Bannon, who claims to be a sort of economic populist, that he\u2019s a hardcore nationalist, and the tech bros, especially Elon Musk, and now there\u2019s a battle between Elon Musk and Trump, it seems. But what we\u2019re trying to ask in this piece is sort of what unites these people? How is it that these Christian Nationalists, or Christian Zionists as sometimes they call themselves, and these often secular tech moguls come together and what unites them?\nOne thing that unites them is just a contempt for the world, the contempt for other living beings. And so, you have figures like Elon Musk saying, he actually just tweeted the other day, I was really struck by it, he said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t go to Mars, we\u2019ll be stuck on earth forever.\u201d And I was like, \u201cStuck on earth?\u201d Earth is amazing. I love Earth. Who\u2019s stuck here? This is home. This is the most beautiful planet we know in the entire universe at this point.\nThere\u2019s figures like Eric Schmidt, who was a major power player at Google, which is now Alphabet, who we quote as when he recently testified before Congress. He essentially says, well, we need to triple the energy consumption of the AI industry because we\u2019re building a higher consciousness, something higher than humanity, something better than all of these carbon-based life forms. And there\u2019s something kind of, again, quasi-religious about that, right? This idea that the earthly realm is mundane. The earthly realm is something that needs to be transcended. And they see themselves as the people with a special knowledge, whether that\u2019s access to this religious truth or the scientific-technical truth. But really, what they have is just the money to advance an agenda that is not popular, that is not geared towards our collective wellbeing. And it is ultimately just incredibly hubristic, short-sighted, greedy, and fascist.\nAnd so, I think there\u2019s these points where these folks can recognize that they have more in common with each other, whether they\u2019re the engineer, the far right politician, or the religious fundamentalist leader. I think that we need to pay attention to those points of connection, and take seriously their contempt for life. And this is why in the piece, Naomi, and I actually call them traitors, which is a word we don\u2019t usually use, but they\u2019re traitors to this earth, they\u2019re traitors to life and all of its diversity and beauty. And yet, again, to get to your question, it does seem to me, that on some deeper level, it is about a sort of fear of mortality, fear of death, an inability to accept our hereness, our limits. And because they don\u2019t have the maturity to face that stuff, they\u2019re basically going to destroy us all.\nAnd what we argue is that they think they can kind of shield themselves from, they can buy enough time for themselves that they can survive whatever disasters they\u2019re unleashing. So, this is why we talk about bunkers, whether it\u2019s billionaires building their underground safety zones, or whether it\u2019s the bunkered nation, this idea that we\u2019ll turn the United States into a kind of armed lifeboat. This is why we talk about the phenomenon of Freedom Cities, so-called Freedom Cities, which are these sort of fantasy zones where there\u2019s no regulation, where cryptocurrencies can run in the day. But it\u2019s all of these fantasies of flight, of escape from here, from the earthly material, mortal realm. It\u2019s weird stuff. This is why I\u2019m like, \u201cThese people are weird.\u201d\nKH: They are really fucking weird. And they\u2019re also tapping into something highly exploitable about the present moment, about our uncertain future, and the spiritual longings people have. The tech bros and the theo bros, as you call them in the piece \u2014 some of them are true believers in Evangelical Christianity or in tech cults, like longtermism or effective accelerationism, but they\u2019re all exploiting the scarred psyches of lost, frightened people.\nI\u2019m thinking about the conversations I\u2019ve had with \u00c9mile P. Torres about how a lot of people are walking around with a \u201cGod-shaped\u201d hole in their lives, either because we grew up with religion and walked away from it, or because we\u2019re just grappling with the spiritual emptiness of our lives under capitalism. So many of us have been deprived of opportunities to pursue meaning, purpose, connection, and spiritual understanding. In a lot of people, that creates a kind of longing, even if they don\u2019t know how to name it.\nAnd we are also in this moment of extreme crisis, from climate chaos to global political instability, and all of the violence that entails. In moments of collapse and extreme crisis, people become more vulnerable to cults and hyper-religiosity. We want answers. And when we can\u2019t make sense of our conditions, we can become desperate, and attach ourselves to charlatans and monsters.\nIn the Trump coalition, we have these Evangelical accelerationist perspectives, which tell us that accelerationism is good, because the aftermath of the apocalypse will be paradise on earth for god\u2019s chosen people \u2014 which is why they cheer and abet the genocide in Gaza, so that Jewish people can be settled where they\u2019re supposed to be settled according to the Book of Revelations, and be slaughtered in accordance with scripture. And then, we also have tech accelerationists, who either argue that it\u2019s fine to destroy the environment to produce AI, because AGI will solve every imaginable problem \u2014 or, actually arguing, as Elon Musk has, that humanity is just a \u201cbiological bootloader\u201d for advanced artificial intelligence. So, basically, it\u2019s okay if we ultimately make the world uninhabitable for biological humans, because artificial general intelligence is going to replace us. And so we just have to devote ourselves to the creation of a new digital god, and these new digital higher beings.\nThese are beliefs that treat cataclysmic events as transformative and redeeming. And this kind of eschotological thinking has been part of a lot of major historical tragedies. Hitler, for example, talked about the Thousand-Year Reich, which evokes the Christian notion of the millennial kingdom. That was another example of downtrodden, desperate people, buying into a transformative vision that justified mass destruction in the name of a paradisiacal outcome that wasn\u2019t real. So, I think it\u2019s really important to think about people\u2019s spiritual vulnerabilities, and spiritual desperation, in times of crisis and collapse. Because our enemies are attuned to that desperation, and they are exploiting it. They are giving people the opportunity to cosign destructive acts and ways of being, while feeling like it\u2019s all happening for a reason, and headed somewhere important.\nAT: What you just said was so well put, and I think really right on the money. I mean, one thing I really love about your work, and something I\u2019ve been trying to do in my most recent books, is to talk about the connection between the material and the emotional, the political, and the psychic. So, in 2023, I put out a book called The Age of Insecurity, which is about precisely what you were laying out, which is the way that economic insecurity has all of these affective consequences. It makes people, as you said, more vulnerable to fascist appeals.\nYou can respond to insecurity in different ways. You can respond to instability in different ways. If an organizer comes up to you, then maybe you can join a movement and find solidarity in it. But if what happens is you get sucked into a YouTube wormhole, and all you\u2019re hearing are these far right messages that are trying to help you, or claiming that they\u2019re making sense of you\u2019re suffering, then you\u2019re going to spiral in that direction.\nSo, I think this is why the right is intensifying their rhetoric and their appeal. So, one thing we talk about in the piece is this explicit turn on empathy, because in this moment when people are feeling insecure and feeling unstable, then maybe they could be more open to hearing a message from the left, one that says, \u201cHey, we\u2019re all suffering right now. Let\u2019s band together.\u201d So, what does the right do? They do everything in their power to stop that. I think this is evidence that the right realizes; basically the policies they\u2019re pursuing are end times policies. They know climate change is real. They\u2019re not doing anything to stop it. They are not doing anything to curb inequality, despite their sort of faux populist comments to the base.\nAnd so, you have figures in the Christian community writing books and talking about how empathy is toxic. There\u2019s a book called Toxic Empathy. You have Elon Musk saying that empathy is the sort of fatal flaw of Western civilization. You have Mark Zuckerberg coming back and saying we need a culture of aggression and masculinity in Silicon Valley. This is sort of part of the bigger pushback on \u201cwoke,\u201d the bigger pushback on progressive gains of the last few years.\nAnd famously, we had Vice President J.D. Vance a few months ago talking about his brand of Catholicism, and what he called \u201cordered love,\u201d just basically that, yes, it\u2019s okay to only love your family, and only love the people next to you, and maybe the people you share a nation with. But no, the church does not actually command you to love beyond maybe your neighbor, that it\u2019s okay to actually have shrinking circles of care and concern. And so, I think this is part of a concerted effort to turn people against each other in this moment. And it\u2019s just another interesting moment of alliance between the tech bros and the theo bros, that they\u2019re all kind of saying, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s make selfishness a legitimate and actually kind of glorified position to hold.\u201d\nThis is a bit of a tangent, but when we\u2019re talking about how strange these people are, I also think it\u2019s important to talk about how a sort of component of this agenda is really vilifying people who are trying to do good. So, there is the broader just war on \u201cwoke,\u201d and attack on progressive ideologies, but we also quote Peter Thiel, who\u2019s, of course, a co-founder of PayPal, venture capitalist, and also it\u2019s important to note, was a kind of key figure in elevating JD Vance politically. And he\u2019s Christian, he was raised evangelical, he\u2019s libertarian, he\u2019s gay, he\u2019s religious, but he has just repeatedly gone on and on about how Greta Thunberg is the anti-Christ. And he\u2019s not joking when he\u2019s talking about this. This is how bonkers these people are.\nAnd he is very erudite on some levels. And so, he goes on and on about philosophy and theology, but his point is essentially that the antichrist comes bearing messages of peace and safety, but ultimately, what they\u2019re going to do is harmful. So, somebody like Greta Thunberg comes along and says, peace and safety, no more genocide in Gaza, no more environmental destruction. And for Thiel, she\u2019s the harbinger of doom, because ultimately she would regulate his industry and the industries of his allies, but he\u2019s not so direct about it. Instead of just saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like Greta Thunberg, I don\u2019t like environmentalists because they would curb my profits,\u201d he is speaking of her in these pretty unhinged theological terms. This is the antichrist. And so, the biblical proportions of their rhetoric are not just rhetoric, because I think it speaks to the conviction with which they\u2019re pursuing their extremely lethal ends.\nKH: I really appreciate what you\u2019re saying about empathy, and the way that these folks are seeking to vilify and pathologize empathy. Breaking solidarity has obviously always been important to our opposition, but the extremity of how empathy is being portrayed as a potentially civilization-ending disease \u2014 that feels alarming to me, and also instructive, in terms of what actually has the potential to undermine these monsters. When Elon Musk talks about \u201csuicidal empathy,\u201d it\u2019s a lot like Peter Thiel calling Greta Thunberg the anti-christ. What he\u2019s really saying is, this undermines my vision, and my vision is everything.\nAnd Elon Musk\u2019s vision, and the vision of the tech bros and theo bros driving this moment, involves a lot of people getting on board with more and more categories of people being deemed inherently unworthy of empathy, inherently punishable, and disposable. We already have a vehicle for that kind of condemnation and disregard, here in the United States, in the prison industrial complex. Once people are criminalized and disappeared, we have social permission to stop caring about them, their living conditions, and the manufacturing of their premature deaths. These folks are looking to massively expand the bounds and reach of that thinking.\nWe see this effort to broaden forgetting and the absence of empathy to include all immigrants. We see the term \u201cgang member\u201d being freely applied to people who are sent to CECOT, weaponizing a stigma to dehumanize the administration\u2019s victims. We see Palestine solidarity activists being portrayed as inherently punishable, and therefore, inherently disposable and deportable. We also see disabled people being targeted in the administration\u2019s rhetoric around it being our duty to stay well, RFK Jr.\u2019s lies about how infectious diseases aren\u2019t a threat to healthy people, and his false characterizations of autism \u2014 all of this feeds into ideas that some lives aren\u2019t worth saving or living. It\u2019s a eugenics agenda, which is reminiscent of Nazi Germany, and of eugenics policies here in the U.S. that had horrific outcomes for a lot of people.\nThe idea that empathy itself is deadly, and that not everyone can or should be saved, is really at the heart of what we\u2019re up against right now.\nAT: Yeah, I think what you\u2019re saying is exactly right. I mean, think about George W. Bush and \u201cCompassionate Conservatism.\u201d Those days are done. They\u2019re saying empathy is bad. And I feel like, a couple of years ago, I would\u2019ve been like, \u201cEmpathy? No, no, we need more than empathy. We need solidarity.\u201d But empathy is a path, it\u2019s a kind of doorway. It\u2019s a portal to recognizing that you\u2019re not the only human being who matters, right? It\u2019s a way out of a kind of solipsism, and I think the right understands that it is a first step towards the kind of solidarity that\u2019s very dangerous to them.\nIt\u2019s interesting, the MAHA stuff, it\u2019s not in this piece, but I think of it as a kind of bunkering of the body. The bunker is a recurring motif in this article because, of course, as they unleash the flames, the rich people aren\u2019t expecting to be incinerated themselves. That\u2019s part of the delusion is that they\u2019ll be safe in their fortress nation, or in their very fancy estate in New Zealand, or maybe high up in the hills of Hawaii, or wherever it may be. But the MAHA is a bunkering of the body \u2014 that your health is just up to you. It\u2019s like, if you\u2019ve had enough beef tallow slathered on you, and you\u2019re free enough of vaccines, then you\u2019re healthy, and everyone else then deserves their fate. They had pre-existing conditions, they were weak.\nAnd it is this rationing up of disposability, and that flows from this devaluation of the here, and the now, and the people in non-human creatures we share this planet with. And so, when you\u2019re preparing for Armageddon, when you are someone who has bought into this Armageddon complex, to use the language of Umberto Eco, then you have to find ways to rationalize life being disposable. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing these people do, is concoct these ever greater categories [of disposability].\nAnd a lot of us were warning people, right? We\u2019re like, \u201cPalestine, Gaza, this is not an isolated issue,\u201d or, \u201cHey, racial justice is not just about Black and brown people. It\u2019s about all of us.\u201d And I think we are seeing a\u2026 It feels always later than it should be, but maybe opportunities to advance a kind of acceptance, awareness, or awakening to the fact that it\u2019s never just the other who bears the brunt of these kinds of politics. It always expands and ends up having harmful effects for more and more people.\n[musical interlude]\nKH: In your piece, you refer to a political force that you and Naomi Klein characterize as the \u201cstartup country contingent.\u201d Can you talk about that movement, and how it\u2019s gained momentum under Trump?\nAT: Many of the ideas we\u2019re talking about were sort of fringe ideas on the tech right or on the religious right, and pretty risible. For years now, this fellow Patrick Friedman, who is Milton Friedman\u2019s grandson \u2014 Milton Friedman, of course, being the esteemed libertarian intellectual advisor to Ronald Reagan \u2014 has been peddling this idea of seasteading, of creating libertarian nations, maybe on abandoned oil rigs. And he\u2019s just been a jokester in the sense that it hasn\u2019t gotten anywhere.\nAnd, of course, that idea sort of riffs on things like free trade areas, these sort of zones, where typical regulations don\u2019t apply, and corporations can go about their business less encumbered by labor law, environmental regulations, et cetera. So, there\u2019s sort of precedents for this pivot, but some of these sort of tech utopian guys have come up with this idea of Freedom Cities, which is sort of these free trade zones, but ideally for them, places where people would live, and where they would be liberated from pesky governments, regulation, and also currencies. So, a lot of these fantasies are sort of now financed by cryptocurrency.\nAnd the idea is maybe rich people can go to a sort of med spa and do some self-augmentation that\u2019s not allowed in the United States or in Europe, or maybe a nuclear power plant could be constructed without as much environmental oversight.\nSo, one of these, we open with an account of this Freedom City called Pr\u00f3spera, which is a startup in Honduras that has really gone sideways. Honduras is one of the poorest nations in the world. And so, these tech bros made a deal with a corrupt government [under Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez] to start a little Freedom City on an island, and we don\u2019t need to get into the details, but there\u2019s ongoing litigation, and these guys are now trying to sue this impoverished country for over $10 billion. So, they\u2019re absolutely willing to devastate a nation and its people for this utter fantasy of freedom from taxation, freedom from regulation, and ultimately, on a deeper level for this fantasy of exit.\nSo, influential tech figures, Peter Thiel is one of them, have taken and kind of twisted the ideas of this political philosopher and economist, Albert Hirschman, who wrote a book called Exit, Voice, and Loyalty. And they have taken this idea of exit, this idea that the ultimate freedom that they want for themselves is to be able to abandon communities, abandon countries, and to start something new. And so, this fantasy of exit speaks to this, again, broader conviction that these people should be able to destroy the planet, and yet somehow survive, whether they\u2019re exiting to a Freedom City like Pr\u00f3spera, or if they think they should be able to exit to Mars, in the case of Elon Musk, or whether they think they should be able to exit by having their consciousness uploaded to some yet unprogrammed AGI.\nBut it\u2019s this desire to not be bound to anyone else, to cut those empathetic ties, cut those communal ties, cut those social ties, cut those ties of taxation, and be this hyper individual entity. And so, these Freedom Cities were really on the margin \u2014 they were able to track some sort of investment money, but they got a big boost on the campaign trail by Donald Trump, who kind of unexpectedly made a promise in the middle of one of his rambling campaign speeches, where he said, \u201cIf I\u2019m president, I will help start up 10 Freedom Cities.\u201d And though he hasn\u2019t made any concrete moves in that direction, it has really galvanized and energized this movement. And it\u2019s one that, yeah, I don\u2019t think we should laugh at anymore.\nKH: So, I want to note what I\u2019m seeing on that front, because I am particularly concerned about this kind of corporate partitioning, and how it would affect people\u2019s lives. In March, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum proposed the sale of as much as 625 square miles of land currently controlled by the Bureau of Land Management near existing cities, supposedly to create more affordable housing to address the housing crisis. Three days later, the American Enterprise Institute \u2014 a rightwing think tank \u2014 proposed what it calls \u201cHomesteading 2.0,\u201d which calls for the privatization of 850 square miles of federal land in two steps. First, 3 million new homes would be built over the next ten years, then, later this century, 20 new Freedom Cities, which would be home to millions of people, would be created around the Western United States. At the time that we\u2019re recording this, the administration is trying to wedge the sale of federal lands into the budget reconciliation bill, which is controversial, even among Republicans. Right now, they\u2019re focused on selling federal land in Idaho, Alaska, Utah and Nevada.\nI also think we need to pay close attention to this administration\u2019s plans to dismantle FEMA. The current, stated plan of the administration is to put the onus on states to manage disaster relief, which states obviously don\u2019t have the resources to handle on their own. The administration says that far less federal money will be available, and that funds that are dispersed will either come directly from the White House or from the Department of Homeland Security. Now, this not only gives Trump a whole lot of leverage, in terms of arm-twisting Democratic governors into complying with his fascist policies, but also makes Democratic states and cities incredibly vulnerable to disaster capitalists. We know that more and more climate catastrophes are going to occur, so what does it mean when there\u2019s no federal money to rebuild? Who will local governments submit to, in order to restore their water systems, their electricity or their transit systems? It could be Trump, or it could be a tech billionaire who wants to annex some land.\nWe\u2019ve talked previously on this show about how Curtis Yarvin \u2014 an anti-democratic tech theorist, whose ideas are cherished by tech billionaires like Peter Thiel \u2014 has promoted the idea of replacing our current system with a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of corporate tech dictatorships. These corporatized societies would exist under a kind of totalizing state surveillance. Given the current state of surveillance tech, what do you think life would be like for people living in one of these corporate fiefdoms?\nAT: I mean, I think it would be pretty damn hellish, right? I mean, there are so many problems with the government as it currently exists, but there\u2019s a whole lot that it provides that I take for granted right now. I mean, I\u2019m sitting in a house that has running water that is safe to drink. I could smell the Canadian wildfire smoke a few days ago, but right now, I can breathe the air. I also know that if something happens and I impale myself this afternoon in my kitchen, that the emergency room, that I could get to maybe by calling an ambulance, has to take me in by law. I mean, there\u2019s just a million sort of protections that we take for granted. I\u2019m pretty confident that unless I\u2019ve let something get moldy in my fridge, that the food I am going to eat later today isn\u2019t going to kill me, that there\u2019s basic food safety.\nNone of this would be guaranteed in a \u201cFreedom City.\u201d The idea of a Freedom City is to have none of that, right? I mean, things that are so basic, that movements won going back to the 1800s, to the early 1900 hundreds.\nI think it kind of boggles the mind to imagine this kind of retro future, where there\u2019s this high-tech network surveillance technology coupled with an absence of all of these basic protections that we fought for, from food safety, to things like ramps and basic accessibility for disabled people, to basic worker protections. As off-the-rails capitalist as America is, we\u2019ve never ever existed in a space that was fully controlled by the market. That is not the society that we actually inhabit.\nSo, I think it would be pretty dark. And one indication of how dark it would be was Curtis Yarvin\u2019s excitement at the devastation, destruction, the genocide in Gaza, when he said, hey, now is our chance. Let\u2019s make Gaza into the first corporate city state. \u201cGaza Inc.\u201d is what he called it. For him, the destruction of a people is an opportunity to impose a vision that is not just market-driven, but monarchic, in that he literally says, \u201cWe need a kind of CEO king running society.\u201d\nSo, the fact that this guy, Curtis Yarvin, is peddling\u2026 I mean, anti-democratic doesn\u2019t do it justice, but corporate fascist, genocidal nonsense, because he is an idiot who calls himself a philosopher. He\u2019s truly an idiotic human being. I mean, this is someone who is on the record saying, \u201cEnslaved people were better off before emancipation.\u201d The fact that he\u2019s being profiled in the New Yorker, that he\u2019s being interviewed and featured on the front page of The New York Times is an abomination and is a real sign to me that the liberal establishment does not realize what we\u2019re up against.\nKH: I also want folks to think about the fact that every fascism has its subhumans. To technofascists like Elon Musk, humans are the subhumans. We\u2019re \u201cbiological bootloaders\u201d for a more consequential reality. Now, that\u2019s not all people, of course. People who are building the tech infrastructure for that new world are the only players that matter in their minds. The rest of us are non-player characters [NPCs]. When Musk talks about the \u201cKobayashi Maru\u201d \u2014 for the non-nerds among us, that\u2019s a Star Trek reference, and it means hacking a simulation to make a no-win situation winnable \u2014 he\u2019s talking about his belief that some people, like him, can retool the system to make their worldviews inevitable. He sees himself as a player, potentially driving the outcome of the game, and we\u2019re all just NPCs. We\u2019re subhuman. Fully expendable in the pursuit of his vision. Now, I am not arguing that he\u2019s driven by true belief, because his stated beliefs have morphed a lot over time, but this is the worldview that he is zealously pursuing right now. It drove him to help Trump win an election, and to gut federal services. And now that he\u2019s kind of shot himself in the foot with Trump, I think it\u2019s critical that we maintain our understanding of him, and never allow him any semblance of redemption, because he\u2019s too dangerous, and there\u2019s no coming back from the things he\u2019s done.\nBut something else I\u2019ve talked to Brian Merchant about is the idea that, rather than marketing us the potential for salvation, these tech billionaires are really trying to market us a role within the apocalypse. Like, there\u2019s a way out of being an NPC. You could win the apocalypse video game if you buy the right gadgets, sacrifice the right people, and learn to love AI. I\u2019m thinking about something Mark Zuckerberg said recently, about how companies are already \u201csystems that are smarter than any one individual\u201d because they harness the intelligence of many people to accomplish a goal. He claimed \u201cinstead of having relatively few people\u201d able to harness the power of \u201ca 10,000 person organization\u201d \u2014 by which he presumably means CEOs \u2014 AI technology will mean that \u201cin the future\u201d almost \u201ceveryone will have that.\u201d Theo Von summarized this argument as \u201cuniversal basic technology,\u201d in a perverse play on the idea of universal basic income. The idea is that we, too, can become consequential. We can be overseers of digital intelligence. We can cease to be non-player characters by embracing the rise of AI, even as it contributes to the destruction of our world.\nSo, in addition to talking about societies where people might have to get RFID [Radio Frequency Identification] chips implanted in their hands to track their movements, and be subject to a level of monitoring and control that\u2019s tough for us to currently imagine, we\u2019re also talking about a world where the idea of liberation that\u2019s marketed to us is to be humanized by our dehumanization. We are being sold the idea that to escape our subhuman status, we need to dehumanize others and embrace isolating, dehumanizing technologies.\nAnd the degree to which a focus on the self, and the abandonment of others, is treated as a form of survivalism, in this philosophy, cannot be overstated.\nAnd on the subject of survivalism, in your recent piece with Naomi Klein, the two of you wrote, \u201cThe governing ideology of the far right in our age of escalating disasters has become a monstrous, supremacist survivalism.\u201d Can you say more about that monstrous survivalism?\nAT: Part of what\u2019s so disturbing about that survivalism is not only do we see it happening, but we see it glamorized. We see it augmented, we see it turned into propaganda, and spit out through the social media feeds of the most powerful people on this planet. I mean, we were very struck, writing in this piece, by the way that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has become a kind of recurring figure in this grotesque anti-immigrant propaganda, making videos from the CECOT prison in El Salvador. And there was also the White House\u2019s \u201cASMR\u201d video, with the sounds of chains, people chained, and the sound of their shackles.\nSo, I mean, there\u2019s something\u2026 Obviously, we shouldn\u2019t be naive. I mean, deportations happened under Democratic administrations, and this is building on a long troubling history in this country. But something has happened that has made it, I think, more monstrous. And it is part and parcel of this larger, self-conscious, propagandistic effort to make empathy seem pass\u00e9 and to make cruelty seem cool.\nAnd there\u2019s something kind of pathetic about it. Cruelty will never be cool. Being a bully, it\u2019s not cool. It actually just shows you\u2019re an insecure asshole. But it\u2019s really disturbing, and honestly, it just makes me really heartsick, literally sick at heart, to see that this stuff is out there, and that there are people kind of eagerly and gleefully responding to it.\nAnd I think one thing we were trying to do in this piece is say these people are tapping into really ancient myths. This idea of the chosen few, this idea that some people will be the chosen few who survive, who are able to make it to the promised land, who are, again, able to survive the rapture, able to survive Armageddon. This idea that there\u2019s a grand sort of final battle, these are old, old, old stories that are kind of, even if you\u2019re not religious, they\u2019re kind of woven into our cultural narratives. And that\u2019s part of their appeal. They\u2019re also really simplistic.\nAnd so, we need different, and we need better stories. And I think part of what we\u2019re saying is that we also need mythic stories. We need stories where, in contrast to those traitors, we\u2019re part of a movement that is brave, resilient, courageous, compassionate, and committed to being here. And defending not just other human beings, but the planet and all the other species and creatures who call it home. And that this is actually epic, heroic, important work. And that there\u2019s something actually kind of mythic about that, about being someone who is part of a movement that is open-hearted and unruly, and refuses to take the bait of that hate.\nKH: I really agree that we need to position ourselves, on a spiritual level, in opposition to the dehumanization of these fascist politics. And on that note, I would love to talk more about AI. How do you see AI functioning as a tool of fascism? How is this technology being used to advance a fascist agenda, while also divorcing us from our humanity?\nAT: I mean, I think on the one hand, all of the arguments that I and other tech critics and you, I mean people have been making now for years, if not decades, is we have to pay attention, not just to the technology, but the underlying business interests. Who owns the machines? Who owns the code? Whose agendas are being served?\nSo, this question of political economy of ownership is incredibly important, because you could put these data sets to decent use, maybe trying to figure out how to make a public transit system run more efficiently. You could put some of these data sets to use to help scientists identify patterns and cure diseases. I think there\u2019s ways that technology could be deployed at scale for democratic ends. That is not what\u2019s happening here because we live under capitalism.\nAnd so, if you look at OpenAI, they\u2019re creating a labor disruption machine, that is the goal of their business, of their enterprise, because they know that then they can sell their services to bosses who want to reduce labor costs. And it actually doesn\u2019t matter always whether the machines can actually do the jobs, or whether the machines can just be used as a foil to scare workers and into accepting less.\nSo, there\u2019s a whole lot of hype happening right now with AI, and we\u2019ve been hearing about automation making us replaceable for ages. And so, I think part of what we\u2019re on the progressive end of the spectrum need to say is just we\u2019re not replaceable. And now, they\u2019re not just saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll be replaced,\u201d but they\u2019re saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll be replaced with something better than you.\u201d So, Eric Schmidt\u2019s saying, \u201cWe\u2019re building a higher consciousness.\u201d Who are you to say you\u2019re building something higher? That you\u2019re creating a digital God, that you\u2019re creating something that we should sacrifice ourselves for?\nI mean, the fact is these guys know that they cannot actually just create a mirror world, an AI world, because AI requires too much energy, resources, and critical minerals \u2014 it actually is a force of depletion. And in that sense, it is kind of a zero-sum thing. It\u2019s like us, or\u2026 I\u2019m not going to say them, because it\u2019s that, us or this thing that is not animate.\nSo, I think we have to be real about the material conditions. We have to be real about the hype. What is hype? What is ideology? What\u2019s propaganda that\u2019s being used to kind of scare us into submission? And I think we should just be very incensed because none of us are asking for this. Nobody is asking for the kind of AI that they\u2019re offering. It\u2019s being foisted on us. It\u2019s being imposed on us.\nAnd Steve Bannon is full of shit, and he\u2019s a liar \u2014 and Naomi Klein is far more of an expert on him and his rantings than I am \u2014 but he is extremely against AI, because this is something that\u2019s also not popular with people on the right. And so, there\u2019s potential here, I think, for a kind of alliance of us against the machines, actually. And so, I think this is something just on a strategic level that we should be paying attention to.\nAnd I don\u2019t think ordinary people want their kids to be taught by AI. I don\u2019t think other people want to train AI to take their jobs. I think that people don\u2019t want to be cared for in old age by AI, and people want to live as human beings for now, and we need to nurture that sentiment, and organize against it, and just be relentless about following the money.\nAnd for these guys, they\u2019re bringing about the apocalypse with their policies, but for them, the apocalypse would just be regulation. That\u2019s what they see, the idea of people waking up to their agenda, and restraining it as something worth waging an incredible war over. And we need to stop calling them geniuses, and just take them down a few pegs.\nKH: What\u2019s coming up for me, as you talk about nobody wanting this technology is the ways that some people are embracing it, sometimes because they can\u2019t get away from it, or because they can\u2019t keep up with what\u2019s being demanded of them. It\u2019s been estimated that 86% of students are using AI in the course of their studies. Teachers and professors have spoken at length about how this has complicated their grading processes, and in some cases, eroded the communication and critical thinking skills of their students. And I really want us to understand that for the tech bros, that\u2019s not a bug, it\u2019s a feature.\nCapitalism has already deskilled us socially in a variety of ways, because capitalism is competitive, isolating, and alienating. But we\u2019re seeing, more and more, people relying on AI in situations when they could be learning how to form arguments, think critically, and analyze the information in front of them. At the same time, we are being further deskilled socially, because people are out-sourcing opportunities to practice self-expression, and in some cases, turning to AI chatbots for companionship, or even therapy \u2014 which has already had horrifying results in some cases. All of this is by design. The ultra wealthy tech bros don\u2019t want us to have critical thinking skills or emotional intelligence. They don\u2019t want us to be able to analyze our reality, or come up with strategies to change our conditions, or have the social skills to band together around those strategies. We are being captured and altered by these technologies in real time, and in some cases, we are cooperating.\nThese systems, which are being inserted into the government agencies that DOGE has gutted, are poised to further entrench inequality and human disposability. And these tech titans want us and the US government to be unable to function without the help of AI their models. They are cultivating a reliance that they think we\u2019ll be unable to break with \u2014 and one that will ultimately render us less thoughtful, and less able to advocate for and protect ourselves.\nThey call it progress, but it\u2019s conquest, and it\u2019s happening in plain sight, as they pillage our intellectual work and artistic work, and cause ruinous damage to the natural world.\nWe are being deskilled and devalued, because we are being made into the ideal, feudal subjects of corporate tech states. I think it\u2019s really noteworthy, for example, that Elon Musk, whose beliefs seem to lean toward longtermism and effective acceleration, has said positive things about Christianity in the last year or so. Not that he believes in the Christian faith, but that, maybe it\u2019s a good thing to be a Christian.\nAT: Exactly.\nKH: Now, I am not trying to knock Christianity or Christians, but why does Elon Musk want people to be Christian? Because he sees religion as a control mechanism. He longs for the days when people were more easily ruled by religious ideas, and by the people who dictated and interpreted those ideas. He spouts hoaxes and indulges right-wing myths because he wants us to be ruled by myths. He doesn\u2019t want us to critically evaluate our conditions or to believe first and foremost in each other. Because he wants us primed for exploitation, above all else.\nSo, in opposition to all of the terrible things we\u2019ve been describing, what kind of organizing do we need right now?\nAT: Good organizing. It\u2019s interesting, just to go back to what you just said, though, I did torture myself one day and listened to Mark Andreessen in his three-hour conversation with Joe Rogan. And one thing he said is that, and it is just very in sync with what you were just commenting on. He said that essentially that, as AI gets more advanced, we, ordinary humans, will actually have to get more medieval, kind of like people in previous ages who believed in angels and had this kind of confusion about what kind of entities we share the world with.\nAnd I thought it was just a really telling moment, because it was exactly what you\u2019re saying, which is just to be dumbfounded. Don\u2019t ask who\u2019s behind the curtain, don\u2019t look into it too much. Just enter the realm of myth. Leave the hard stuff to us engineers, and we will create a kind of quasi-religious technology that fleeces you and controls you. It was such a strange comment. It wasn\u2019t the typical hype, which is, Oh, wow, you\u2019re going to have this chatbot that can answer all the questions for you, and the world of knowledge at your fingertips. It was like, No, actually, you\u2019ll just be even more in the realm of illusion, as a consequence of our new tools and our emerging business models.\nI think one of the challenges in a moment like this, and it\u2019s kind of the eternal challenge, is keeping our eyes on continuity and change. I mean, so contrary to what the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and their cheerleaders in Washington have been saying for decades, we still need unions. We still need labor unions, we still need regulations. We still need these things that they want to tell us are out of date. Because somehow, these new tools are so novel and so innovative, that they\u2019ve made all of these old mechanisms obsolete. I mean, that\u2019s bullshit. I mean, what people still need is to get organized in formation to find ways to militate against concentrated capital. That\u2019s it.\nBut we also need to be like, Okay, but things have changed in some ways. The labor force is more dispersed. Labor law has been undone. So, maybe we need to be creative and think of different forms of unions. That\u2019s why I\u2019m dedicated to the Debt Collective. It\u2019s like, okay, so can we create an economic formation that helps people come to political consciousness, engage in coordinated strategies, when they might not have the opportunity to join a traditional union, given the nature of their employment or given the state they live in, maybe they live in a right to work state, or given the stage in their career they\u2019re at? Maybe they\u2019re retired, and they are living on a fixed income, but they have a lot of debt. Right? So, we\u2019re all in the economy. We have to find different ways we can organize together to change things.\nAnd that change in continuity thing, I think, is at the heart of this piece with Naomi. This is fascism, but what\u2019s new about it? We\u2019re not fighting the Nazis all over again. We\u2019re not fighting Mussolini\u2019s fascism all over again. We\u2019re not actually fighting the white supremacists that imposed Jim Crow on the American south. There\u2019s elements of all of those previous types of right-wing politics and reactionary movements, but there\u2019s something new about this moment as well. I mean, we are fighting on a terrain of impending ecological collapse in an awareness of that. We\u2019re fighting on a terrain of accelerating communicative and network technologies.\nSo, the last thing I\u2019ll say is that what we\u2019re calling for in this piece is a movement that is attuned to the fact that the people we\u2019re up against are traitors to this planet, and its people, and the other species who we share the earth with. And so, we think that there\u2019s something potentially valuable about explicitly committing to here, that\u2019s the language that we use, to saying, \u201cWe are the people who are going to fight for one another, and fight for the livability and habitability of this planet, of this place.\u201d And that seems so basic, but it is unfortunately something that at this moment needs to be said, and needs to be said really clearly.\nI think it\u2019s also anti-nihilistic. It\u2019s anti-despair. It\u2019s like, No, this is actually a beautiful place, and it\u2019s worth fighting for, and other people are worth fighting for. In this moment, I think just underscoring that commitment is actually valuable and worth doing.\nKH: I really appreciate what you keep underscoring about rejecting this idea of exit, and really fighting for the livability of this world. That means fighting to preserve ecosystems and fighting to save each other. As Mariame Kaba and I repeatedly emphasize in Let This Radicalize You, it means refusing to abandon each other. I also think it means rethinking our own relationship with escapism, to some degree. Because, don\u2019t get me wrong, I love television, but we are being offered a world of distraction to get lost in, technologically, in these times, when we desperately need to get grounded in reality. One of the things tech bros idealize about a digitized future, populated by digital people, is the idea that there will be no suffering, and I feel like we really see flashes of that fantasy in the way we\u2019re encouraged to live now \u2014 constantly seeking stimulation, and then numbing ourselves out. Living in cycles of exhilaration or numbness, whether we\u2019re numbing ourselves out chemically or by consuming mindless content. What we need is to be able to live in the world and to be uncomfortable sometimes. We need to be able to relate to each other. We need to deepen our awareness of each other\u2019s struggles, and our regard for one another, and understand that by defending you I am also defending myself, because we have a shared home and destiny.\nEverything they\u2019re handing us is further removing us from what is glorious, sacred, and worth fighting for about this world. Everything that makes us human, they\u2019re seeking to further detach us from. Because the more we lose touch with our humanity, the more we lose touch with each other, and the closer we get to that sort of techno-feudal world they want, where they imagine us celebrating each other\u2019s disposal \u2014 the way you see feudal subjects in movies cheering for executions in the public square. They believe the enlightenment was a setback, and they hate movements for liberation, and for the rights of marginalized people. They want to undo all of that, and to force everyone into silos of self-concern, and that really is their path to victory.\nAT: Anyway, I think you just nailed it. I mean, what you said, though, made me think that part of the war on empathy, this idea that empathy is suicidal. The end result is actually turning us into the robots that we\u2019re supposedly being replaced with, right? A robot can\u2019t empathize, it doesn\u2019t have a self. It can compute, it can find patterns, but it can\u2019t empathize. So, I think we are, you\u2019re exactly right, being encouraged to cut ourselves off from our humanity and from our interdependence.\nAnd for me, that is a kind of credible spiritualism. I\u2019m not a religious person. I\u2019m sort of proudly atheistic. But I think movements do have to speak to something higher than the self. And this is something I wrote about with Leah Hunt-Hendrix in our book on solidarity, that movements need a sense of the sacred. And that\u2019s why, I think, as simplistic as it might be, it\u2019s also really profound to say, \u201cNo, this planet is actually sacred.\u201d That\u2019s why I was so incensed by Musk\u2019s comment, \u201cWe\u2019ll be stuck here.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, we are so lucky to be here.\u201d\nActually, we are already living in a miracle, that we evolve, that we\u2019re on a planet that we are perfectly attuned to. I mean, we\u2019re not made to live on fucking Mars, dude. The gravity is off, the air is poisoned. There are no microbes, there\u2019s nothing there. And this guy is so incurious about the world around him, that he can\u2019t even see the wonder and beauty of this world. So, I think, fundamentally, that\u2019s it. Every day, take a moment, and just experience some awe, and let that fortify you in the fight against these ridiculous, pathetic dudes.\nKH: What a great note to end on. Astra Taylor, thank you so much for joining us today. It\u2019s always so great to talk to you.\nAT: It\u2019s always fun to talk to you too. Thanks.\nKH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today. I will be taking a few weeks off to tend to my health, but I will be back in August with more conversations about how we can organize for change and support each other during these difficult times. For now, I hope you\u2019re all doing what you can to fight for a better world, and to take care of yourselves, and each other. If you\u2019re feeling discouraged and unsure of what to do, remember that our best defense against cynicism is to do good and to remember that the good we do matters.

I\u2019m your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today, we\u2019re talking about public assemblies and how we can build direct democracy at the community level. You\u2019ll hear from Denzel Caldwell, an organizer with the Black Nashville Assembly \u2014 a quarterly gathering where Black residents of Nashville come together to discuss the issues impacting their lives, develop solutions, and take action.\nAs authoritarianism intensifies in the U.S., we often hear calls to \u201csave democracy.\u201d But one of the problems with that framing is that many people don\u2019t feel they have a meaningful relationship with democracy. But the participatory nature of a public assembly can allow people to create democratic experiences, hear each other out, and begin to solve problems together. I think this is going to be an essential organizing tactic in the coming months and years, and I am excited for you all to hear from Denzel about it. Denzel recently shared some of these ideas here in Chicago at a workshop I organized on this subject. That workshop went so well that I decided we should cover some of the same ground here on the show so that those of you who weren\u2019t able to attend could engage with these ideas as well.\nIf you appreciate this podcast, and you would like to support \u201cMovement Memos,\u201d you can subscribe to Truthout\u2019s newsletter or make a donation at truthout.org.

I\u2019m glad to be here.\nKH: How are you doing today?\nDC: So far so good. It\u2019s climate change-degrees outside, so it\u2019s a little hot, but I\u2019ll take it for now.\nKH: I am right there with you. It\u2019s burning hot outside, and the air here in Chicago is awful today, but the sun is shining through my window, and everything looks lovely, so there\u2019s that at least.\nDC: Yeah, exactly.\nKH: I am so happy you could join me today, and I\u2019m really glad we\u2019ve had the chance to collaborate a bit recently. For folks who may not be familiar with your work, can you share a little about who you are and what you do?\nDC: Yeah, so peace to everyone listening. My name is Denzel Caldwell. I am a kid born, raised, and organizing in Nashville, Tennessee. I do organize under a number of different formations, but the one I definitely want to talk about today is the Black Nashville Assembly. I\u2019ve been organizing overall for about a little under 10 years or a little bit over 10 years. And with the BNA I\u2019ve been organizing for about five. And so, yeah, I\u2019ve been doing that for quite some time, learning along the way, got some lessons and victories. But yeah, outside of that, I love to read. I love to work out and talk to cool people like Kelly.\nKH: Well, I love hanging with you, too \u2014 and I\u2019ve been so interested in the work you\u2019ve been doing in Nashville. But before we get into the evolution of the Black Nashville Assembly, can you start by explaining: What is a People\u2019s Movement Assembly?\nDC: Yeah, so I think the easiest, most straightforward answer to this question is it\u2019s a gathering of community members. And when I say community members, I mean people who share particular geographic location, at least traditionally. And they answer three questions: What are the shared problems that they face? What are the solutions that they need for those problems? And how can they work together to make those solutions concrete? I would say that\u2019s the most distilled, easiest answer to shape or to explain what it does or what it is.\nNow, I would say historically, people\u2019s movement assemblies as we know them today, can be traced back to what\u2019s called the World\u2019s Social Forum. And this was a coalition of organizations, movements and those that are adjacent who were coming together to combat neoliberalism, capitalism, imperialism. And within that body, the People\u2019s Movement Assembly was a mode of governance that they used to make decisions. And so, from there, given the fact that this was an international body, when folks went home, folks utilized this mode of governance and it made its way to the USA in the 2000s, I\u2019ll say, because I\u2019m forgetting the date. And since then we\u2019ve seen a number of different people\u2019s movement assemblies emerge in the United States as the idea or the concept spread. And so, you\u2019ll have some that are regional, some that are very local, and something that I think will be very relevant to this current political moment.\nKH: I couldn\u2019t agree more about the relevance of this approach in the current moment. And while the World Social Forum is a clear predecessor to some of the assemblies we\u2019re seeing today, this kind of gathering and this approach to organizing has ancient roots, across the Americas and Africa. The Muscogee councils, which have existed for hundreds of generations, are one just one example. Within my lifetime, we\u2019ve seen a resurgence of some of these traditions during moments of transition, upheaval and social reclamation. The Zapatista movement, for example, created village assemblies to facilitate decision-making at the community level. The Landless Workers\u2019 Movement in Brazil, known as MST, has used assemblies for collective decision making in their encampments. In 2011, the Indignados movement in Spain held horizontal, plaza-based assemblies to deliberate and make decisions outside of formal institutions. And that same year, I got my first experience of direct democracy in the Occupy movement.\nOccupy\u2019s General Assemblies were messy, and we didn\u2019t always get where we needed to go, but gathering together with dozens and sometimes hundreds of people to listen, share ideas, and make decisions that would shape our movement and affect our lives was a really important experience for me as an activist. I had never had that kind of opportunity to be heard, or to decide what would happen next, at that scale, in concert with other people. Eventually, we had neighborhood-based assemblies here in Chicago, and some of the core people who attended those neighborhood Occupy assemblies in my area became part of an organizing crew that I worked with for years after the Occupy movement had faded. A lot of really important work was born out of that moment, and out of those spaces that incubated so many ideas and so much potential.\nDuring Occupy, we were moved by the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, the austerity of neoliberalism, and the momentum of global justice movements. What moved you and your co-organizers to create the Black Nashville Assembly?\nDC: There were a couple of factors. Prior to 2020, because 2020 is really a watershed moment for us. Prior to 2020, there was some growing interest across the local (and by local, I\u2019m referring to Nashville) ecosystem in terms of doing invest/divest campaigns or abolitionist campaigns that encouraged city councils to spend more money on social services and things that people actually need and less on cops, courts and cages.\nAnd so, what emerged from that was just a coalition where folks who were on the left were committed to that work. So that was around the budget cycle. But as we initiated this work in 2019 going into 2020, one of the themes that kept coming up from our opponents on the city council was that we weren\u2019t organizing Black people in Nashville. They were trying to make this claim that we didn\u2019t represent the interest of working-class Black folks in the city.\nAnd so, a number of different organizers, including myself, Erica Perry, Jamel Campbell-Gooch, Mike Floss, we who are from Nashville, decided to go out and organize our folks. And so, we initially were bringing Black folks, and in this case for us, this was our family and friends and our networks to the larger coalition, the assembly work to challenge the carceral appropriations to the city budget. But what we realized is that along the way, a lot of our folks were interested in creating a container where Black folks, working-class Black folks were able to build their own analysis, assess their own problems, and create strategies and methods for making those solutions concrete. And so, from there, that\u2019s when the Black Nashville Assembly emerged, which is a Black autonomous space. So those who participate are of African descent or identify as Black, but we do have spaces where we invite our comrades to build with us.\nKH: I love that you and your co-strugglers responded to this claim that you didn\u2019t represent your community by mobilizing your community in such a highly visible and participatory way. I think there\u2019s a lot to be learned from that example. So, how did this project evolve over time?\nDC: So initially as it started, it was a call, as I mentioned earlier, from a larger coalition to particularly organize Black people to build a people\u2019s budget for the city, an abolitionist one. And so, a lot of that initially at the beginning was focused solely on that. And that still is a pretty key core to our work. But over time, as we learn more and more about the importance of organizing working-class Black folks in the city, and more importantly falling within the lines of the traditions that we descend from, that being SNCC and others, within the Black Radical Tradition, we learned that our assembly had to become more multifaceted and it had to reflect our people.\nSo a lot of it evolved where we had artists that we were organizing perform during the assemblies. We\u2019ve developed a youth assembly that has come out of our work where our youth are organizing our political agendas and bringing it to the larger assembly, and going through the voting process to land on an agreed upon political agenda.\nAnd a lot of other programs from that assembly work have emerged. We\u2019ve had book clubs, we have a men\u2019s circle. We\u2019re just constantly coming up with different ways and things to evolve our work and to reflect the needs of our folks. Black Nashville Assembly is also a project of Southern Movement Committee, which is a container that we created not only for our youth assembly work, but also to engage in statewide assembly work or aspirationally engage in statewide assembly work for Black communities across the state of Tennessee. And so, those are just some of the ways that our work has evolved over time and we\u2019re constantly evolving in terms of our cultural organizing, our assembly work, and our youth assembly work as well.\nKH: I really appreciate what your story is illustrating here around the creation of book clubs, the BNA\u2019s men\u2019s circle and the youth council. Larger gatherings and political projects often serve as incubators in ways that people don\u2019t always consider or realize. Years ago, I was involved with a project called \u201cWe Charge Genocide\u201d here in Chicago, which challenged police violence. That effort sent a group of young people to present a shadow report to the UN about police violence and torture in Chicago. It also played an important role in winning reparations for police torture survivors. At We Charge Genocide meetings, we would engage as a large group, and then break into working groups that were focused on different projects and pursuits. My collective, Lifted Voices, which provided political education workshops for thousands of people during the decade or so before it sunsetted, wouldn\u2019t have existed without We Charge Genocide\u2019s radical education working group. Those working groups set people on a number of paths. In a moment like this one, when we don\u2019t have all of the projects, participation, and experiments that we need, we need to create more fertile ground for that work to begin.\nBut circling back to the growth process of the Black Nashville Assembly, did you have a plan or formula to start with or did the people you organized inform the process?\nDC: So it was definitely more so of the latter than the former. When we started as an assembly formation, a number of us who had founded this assembly had previous organizing experience, and we had already a developing political ideological orientation. And so, that colored how we approached the assembly work. However, one of the most brilliant things that has come from our assembly work in these past five plus years has been that a lot of the most innovative, radical, grounded ideas have come from folks who have participated in the assembly process. I think sometimes there\u2019s this assumption that for those of us, especially on the left, but that we have to take this evangelical approach to organizing. But one of the most powerful things that we\u2019ve recognized doing our assembly work here is that a lot of our folks know exactly what we need and do have a grounded analysis in the systems that oppress them and really are looking for a container to actualize some of the solutions that would need to take root and to be birthed into reality to address those problems.\nAnd so, of course we have political struggle and our politics are evolving, our practice is evolving, but a lot of our direction, if not most of it, comes directly from those who participate in the assembly. And one of the things I definitely want to lift up here is that the first time that we released a political agenda, that was the result of months and months of deliberation, power mapping with our folks, turning some solutions into policy demands or into policy language and then doing things like a candidate forum during a judicial election as well as the city council and mayor elections, so that instead of politicians coming to our space to do a stump speech, they are being interrogated based on the concretized political agenda of the assembly. And so, that\u2019s heavily shaped how the electoral outcomes have happened, not only in the judicial elections, but also in the mayoral and city council elections.\nKH: I love the idea of politicians having to contend with questions that are informed by an agenda a community collectively built. So, in reflecting on what you all have built, can I ask, what surprised you about this process?\nDC: Yeah, I think for me it\u2019s a couple of things. One, just as I mentioned before, the first thing is (I would hear this often) to trust the people and to trust their ability to lead, to organize, and to dream of a fundamentally better world, but seeing that is different and that was huge for me. It didn\u2019t take this, again, this evangelical approach where we\u2019re just browbeating people over the head with our ideological reading and position necessarily. A lot of folks came to very abolitionist, anticapitalist conclusions on their own.\nI\u2019ll never forget one time or often, we do this often anytime we table, we\u2019ll create a poster and we\u2019ll ask folks, \u201cWhat makes you feel safe?\u201d And we\u2019ve done that several times and every time that we do it, not once do people write down \u201cpolice,\u201d not once do people write down \u201ccages\u201d and not once do people write down this carceral system, any piece of this carceral system that makes them feel safe. They talk about family, their faith, their community, their loved ones, the things they love to do, the things that make the city great, things like that from music to culture. But not once do people bring up police.\nAnd so, I think sometimes we can really underestimate the radical potential of our people. And so, that\u2019s been one thing that was huge. I think the other thing that stands out to me was the outcome or the reaction to our candidate forums. In our candidate forums, we had an agenda and we sent the agenda to the candidates that were running for various offices and we gave them an opportunity to fill out their responses to each position, policy position, and we interrogated them once we got there. And you can actually find at least the mayoral one on YouTube and I\u2019ll share that link for folks to see later.\nBut I think the thing that surprised the most was that a lot of organizations in the city and people in the city were really just amazed by the fact that we asked the questions as an assembly rather than the politicians answering a question that no one asks in terms of what they\u2019re going to do for their constituents. And it threw me off and it threw others off because in my mind I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s a lot of civic organizations throughout the city, throughout the state that do civic engagement, electoral work. And you would think, oh yeah, folks have asked the critical questions. But when folks felt like this was groundbreaking, we were like, wait, all we did was just concretize the political agenda that folks our base wanted and then interrogated politicians based on that. How is that groundbreaking? But for me, that was surprising because that just showed how anti-democratic just like our norm is in terms of how we engage in governance under this current structure. But it was just a reminder also of how powerful the People\u2019s Movement Assembly process is.\nKH: One thing I really appreciate about this process is that it\u2019s really the opposite of how a lot of people are experiencing politics right now, alone together in the glow of their screens. We have a serious problem in the U.S., in that our reliance on digital mobilization has left us with a generation of organizers who never learned how to base build or how to canvas. In this alienating culture, that often means that people simply don\u2019t know how to talk to strangers or how to work with people who aren\u2019t of their own choosing. And I\u2019m not blaming people or getting down on people, that alienation is inflicted by design. And unless your political work evolved within an organization that wanted you to canvas or do the labor of base-building, you probably never got that training. We got a lot done by other means, but now, we\u2019re about a decade and a half into the process of being deskilled in this way within our social movements. When you compound that with the alienating dynamics that have evolved on social media, and the isolation of late capitalism, we\u2019re in real fucking trouble. Even when people want to make a difference, they often don\u2019t know how to do more than seek or reward affinity and agreement. They don\u2019t know how to navigate difference or talk about justice with people who don\u2019t understand them or their goals. We need to get practiced at talking to people we would never normally engage with about their fears, hopes, and desires \u2014and we need to be able to build around the shared interests that emerge in those conversations.\nSo, that said, I\u2019m really curious, how did you and your co-organizers adapt some of your movement, language, and ideas to fit the needs of the community?\nDC: Yeah, so that\u2019s a great question. This was an experiment. This is, very much so, an experiment. And what we have found to be successful is attaching the assembly process and the demands and the desires of folks to larger political language. And there\u2019s a meta-note that I have to make here. One of the most important organizing lessons that we have learned in the past five years is our people are very receptive to listening and engaging in learning and political struggle when you consistently show up, I think too often, and I don\u2019t think this is exclusive to liberals, but I think too often even those of us on the left will engage in momentary organizing with folks based on a campaign or a particular flashpoint, but we\u2019re not continuing to cultivate those relationships with our base, which leads to this hamster wheel where we don\u2019t get any farther.\nAnd so, part of our work has really centered on relationship building. So that means in our early days we used to have this thing called \u201cthe recharge\u201d where instead of there being an assembly, it was like a party essentially. We got a DJ, people were playing music, and folks were just recharging because we probably went through a particular election season or some really rough moment or we just needed a break. And so, we would do things like the recharge, we have cookouts with our families and folks who are part of the assemblies and bringing folks together.\nAnd so, it\u2019s through that constant interaction that it gives us the trust and basis to do certain, what we would consider mass meetings, because our mass meetings are different than our people\u2019s movement assemblies, where our mass meetings are where we engage in civic and political education and the people\u2019s movement assemblies are the moments where we actually develop our political agenda and strategy.\nAnd so, it\u2019s through those constant interactions, constant events where we\u2019re bringing together community members that we get the trust to engage in civic and political education. So we talk through some of the things that we\u2019re developing in the People\u2019s Movement Assembly and say, Hey, the folks who shape that problem we\u2019re dealing with are in the courts. Let\u2019s break down how the courts work. Or the reason that we keep running into this issue around youth violence is because this carceral system adds to or shapes the violence that our youth are victimized by.\nAnd so, we really just take the opportunity through relationship building and through moments where people are assessing their problems to inject this political, more politicized conversation and some of the movement language, where we reshape things like public safety, reshape things like the notion of community safety and things like that. And that\u2019s what helps people to sharpen their analysis in our experience.\nKH: Can you give me an example of something that you might hear in a leftist space language-wise and how it might be talked about differently in the community space?\nDC: I think I\u2019ll just use abolition. This is the easiest one to think of where in most leftist spaces, we talk about abolition as this challenge to the legitimacy of the state where we challenge the need or notion of law enforcement or police and the larger carceral system that shapes this arm of the state. And we talk about how we need to build a world where those things don\u2019t exist, and we have these robust accountability processes that exist that allow us to get to the root of a problem. So that\u2019s in our leftist spaces. But then when we\u2019re talking about talking to our folks in the assembly, we might be in conversation and our folks are like, \u201cYeah, we don\u2019t rock it to police. We\u2019re not interested in that.\u201d\nWe are interested in something else. We feel we are forced to talk to police. We\u2019re forced to go through this court system, but I really just want to be in a place where I can talk to my folks and have some type of community trust and buy-ins, where we can address the problems without having to involve the law. Or people will bring up a lot of these really robust ideas, especially the youth, around how we resolve conflict in the public schools. Our youth are bringing up restorative justice processes on their own. They\u2019re brilliant enough to say, \u201cHey, we have to find ways to restore relationships within the school because we know that the school resource officers and the metal detectors and things are a threat to our safety.\u201d And so, our people are talking about the things that they already do to avoid the carceral system.\nAnd what they\u2019re doing is talking about ways to institutionalize those things, so that the necessity for police becomes less and less, or the legitimacy of the police becomes radically less. And so, this is how the abolition conversations come up. And sometimes, honestly, we may not even use the word \u201cabolition,\u201d but the spirit of abolition is within the conversation in the analysis-building and the concretization of our political agenda. So it\u2019s in there, it\u2019s materially in there. But sometimes we may use the language and they\u2019re familiar with it, but we may not. And that\u2019s okay, because we care about the material outcome of our agenda and our struggles for wins.\nKH: That really resonates with me, and I have had a similar experience talking with people who are trying to combat the damage done by the opioid overdose crisis. In Native communities, some of the people I talk to are on the same page as me about not fucking with police, but I\u2019ve also heard people talk about holding out hope that there was some way the cops could arrest our way out of this. They thought that if the cops could just be pushed to \u201cdo their jobs,\u201d or do their jobs in a particular way, fewer of our people would die. And then, over time, those people observed the actual trends on the ground. They saw that people who were using substances were more likely to overdose after getting arrested. Because while they\u2019re locked up for a few days, their tolerance to the drug drops, and when they get out and use \u2014 which will happen, because people don\u2019t heal in jail, they just become more traumatized \u2014 they are more vulnerable to overdose. So, some people who previously looked at cops as a potential solution now recognize that our people actually need care, and to be insulated from contact with the police, whenever possible. And these are things I\u2019ve heard from people across different communities, and the Native people I\u2019ve talked to about this stuff, most of them wouldn\u2019t call themselves abolitionists, and they are not out here calling for the abolition of prisons, but the work of replacing carceral responses with care is abolitionist. The work of reducing contact between our community members and police is abolitionist. So, often, I\u2019ve found, it\u2019s really about addressing people\u2019s needs in very concrete terms. What actually helps? What actually hurts? And if we\u2019re thorough and honest in our analysis on those points, there\u2019s going to be alignment with some of our radical politics \u2014 because those politics exist for a reason.\nOf course, the work of hearing each other, and meeting people where they are, can get messy. Activists and justice-minded people have really built their own cultures and subcultures around the pursuit of justice, and we can sometimes be intolerant of people using the wrong terminology, or knowingly or unknowingly saying things that are problematic or disrespectful. So, how do you handle it, in the public assembly setting, when someone says something fucked up, or there\u2019s a harmful impact that occurs?\nDC: Yeah, I appreciate this question, because this is something we definitely have experienced before. I want to say that one of the first things that we do with that expectation that something like that would happen is we have a set of community agreements in our assembly that folks have to consent to before we begin.\nAnd so, some of those things include not making assumptions about folks, being curious, making space and taking space. Some of these things, we\u2019re familiar with. A lot of us on the left and in movement spaces are familiar with. And of course we are adjusting it to reflect our folks who are organizing with. And so, that\u2019s sort of like the basis or the agreement or the account upon which we can engage in accountability. Because oftentimes when people talk about accountability, people forget that a prerequisite of accountability is relationship and an agreed upon set of values or agreements to which we hold people to account. And so, in our assembly, the community agreements are the things that people consent to first.\nSo when someone says something fucked up or when someone says something that is out of alignment, we take time to remind people, \u201cHey, we agreed to these community agreements. Let\u2019s reground.\u201d We\u2019ve done different things, we\u2019ve had conversations, we brought people to the side and talked with folks during and then after our assemblies. But one of the things we also do as well is we remind people of the agreements. We always center the agreements, and we push back. We have no problem pushing back in our space. We do it not from a place always of combativeness, from a place of love, and love being the willingness to see the fullness of our people and the willingness to struggle with them towards a collective liberatory victory.\nSo we talk about our edges, our growth edges as something as a part of our community agreement. We recognize it. We recognize that people come in with fucked up ideas, that people come in with a colonial mentality or colonial outlook. We are all under colonialism. And so, we acknowledge that up front. We don\u2019t run away from that, and that\u2019s embedded in our agreement so that when we do hear things that are colonial, are carceral, are anti-Black, all these things, we are able to address it from a more solid basis than just calling somebody out because they said something fucked up, but not really being in relationship with them, which is something we see too often online and unfortunately even in some spaces, real world spaces.\nSo I would say that our community agreements have been the basis for how we respond and struggle principally with our assembly members, and then also just relying on our relationships. So it can take a lot of organic forms. We can hit folks up and just say, \u201cHey, I want to follow up with you and just talk with you about what you said at the assembly.\u201d Or sometimes that might even shape our mass meeting content. And there\u2019s a number of examples there. And oftentimes it\u2019s something that within the assembly work and the political agenda development, that shapes the conversations and policy demands and agendas that we develop in the assembly. So I say all that to say that that political struggle is embedded within our assembly work and we don\u2019t run from it. It\u2019s embedded in our community agreements and our folks are still here.\nKH: Can you say a bit about how you developed the community agreements?\nDC: Yeah. So a couple of things that I think it\u2019s important to note. I think with the community agreements, that is probably of the places that initially was shaped by our political orientation, our political pillars, and to specify, our four political pillars as an organization are pan-Africanism, Black queer feminism, economic democracy, and police and prison abolition. And so, as I mentioned earlier, a number of those of us who were at the beginning and formed the assembly, we came in with a certain set of politics or political dispositions already. And so, a lot of the things we saw in community agreements, in other spaces, other movement spaces of the base-building organizations we brought with us.\nBut the thing about it is that as we started to engage our people, as we started to learn our folks, struggle with our folks and have the assembly shape be shaped in our folks\u2019 collective image, the way in which those community agreements evolved began to more directly reflect the people that were in the space. So it\u2019s not that so much they shifted in terms of being curious about people not making assumptions, acknowledging growth edges. It\u2019s not so much that they shifted in terms of the spirit, but the language might have shifted to reflect our people. The way in which we ground the assemblies or the mass meetings more accurately reflect our folks who are part of the assembly. And so, yeah, I say that to say that there was a mixture of our initial or our base political orientation that shaped it, but it has evolved based on the engagement of folks in the assembly work.\nKH: I really hope people will internalize this piece around developing an approach that reflects the culture of the community and the space. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and the language and norms of our movement cultures and subcultures are not going to copy-paste well into a neighborhood practice. We need to be of the community, and for the community, rather than trying to simply prescribe something for the community. And we need to shape our goals in the same way.\nSpeaking of goals, what are some of the wins you\u2019ve experienced since beginning this project?\nDC: We\u2019ve had a couple of strong wins, actually. I would say just as we began the assembly five years ago, we played a critical role in the normalization of abolitionist language on the city level, particularly when it came to the budget cycle. Because before 2020, if you brought up this idea that money needed to be reallocated away from Metro Nashville Police to the social services, there would be a lot of pearl clutching.\nBut we played a huge role in normalizing that language when post-2020, post-George Floyd uprising, in a way that has shifted the Overton window left locally, as far as the budget cycle is concerned. I would say more concretely our biggest, we\u2019ve had back-to-back wins in the past two years, this year and as well as last year. Last year, just to give you context, our youth, when they developed their demands for the budget cycle in 2024, they came up with this plan called the Varsity Spending Plan.\nAnd this was a $10 million plan where you had money that would go to the nation\u2019s first Office of Youth Safety, which was an office that was dedicated to creating proactive solutions, youth-led solutions to youth gun violence that is fundamentally working separate from the carceral system. And this is language that was included in the executive order, the mayoral executive order when this office was erected. The other part of the varsity and spending plan includes some restorative justice programs or pilots in a number of different schools, public schools that are predominantly Black in the city, as well as providing more support for community center funding as well as ensuring there\u2019s funds for a full-time restorative justice staff.\nAnd so, with this Varsity Spending Plan, the assembly got behind it. There was a consensus with the adults and the youth that this was the assembly or the political agenda that we would put forth. And so, back in 2024, we were able to secure a million dollars towards this plan. And again, this is not something that\u2019s going to our organization. This is something that\u2019s a part of the larger city infrastructure, so the Metro Nashville infrastructure. And so, that a million dollars had $750,000 go towards the Office of Youth Safety, which again, according to our analysis, is the first of its kind in the nation, not just in Nashville. And we also got funding to go towards restorative justice pilots in some of our targeted schools.\nThis year, we were able to increase that budget allocation to $1.7 million. And so, since then, our youth have played a direct role in the selecting of the director for the Office of Youth Safety, as well as the organizing and advocacy and public commentary that led to the additional allocation for the restorative justice programs as well as the Office of Youth Safety. And so, we\u2019ve been on a two-year winning streak. We hope to continue building and moving towards that $10 million allocation to fully fund the Varsity Spending Plan. But we\u2019re proud of our youth, we\u2019re proud of the assembly, and we look forward to continue winning.\nKH: That is all so heartening. And we need heartening stories right now.\nWe both expressed earlier that we think that the creation of public assemblies is a particularly important organizing tactic right now. Can you talk about the importance of the public assembly as a tactic in this moment of intensifying authoritarianism?\nDC: Yeah, I think that there\u2019s always, in this country, even when we take a decolonial lens, in public discourse, there\u2019s always been this question or conversation around democracy. Depending on who you talk to, some would say that democracy has been under threat for a while or maybe even is coming under threat under Trump. I think those of us who fall under the Black radical tradition recognize that this U.S. project was inherently anti-democratic from the perspective of the colonized.\nAnd so, I think in that vein, I think that what this process, the People\u2019s Movement Assembly process provides is a unique opportunity for people to build a democracy that has yet to be born or has yet to exist. And I think that is particularly unique and something very opportune in this moment because a number of people across the political spectrum, honestly here in the United States, are looking for something different. People recognize the dilapidating social safety nets, the increased cost of living, the impending climate disaster and Armageddon we\u2019re facing, and the imperial boomerang that we see coming back home to roost with the increase in ICE raids, the further militarization of police.\nAnd so, with that, one of the most potent tools that people can do, not only as a means of survival, but as a means of world making is to engage in a governance structure process like the People\u2019s Movement Assembly, because this process invites people to be active participants in shaping the collective outcome of our people\u2019s futures.\nAnd that is a primary and oftentimes missing ingredient in building mass movements, because if people don\u2019t participate in the shaping of their futures, then we can\u2019t hope for more radical or revolutionary outcomes. And if we look across history at various revolutionary moments, radical moments, especially throughout the world, one critical component was organizing the masses towards being active participants in the shaping of their futures. Whether that\u2019s through literacy campaigns, whether that\u2019s through collective assemblies, whether that\u2019s through party formations, all of the above. And I think particularly in this moment in the United States history and this particular political moment, not just domestically, but internationally, that the U.S. and people who live within the U.S. can in some ways, once again, depending on the history that you reference, can participate in a larger struggle for a world where people and systems are governed directly and democratically by the masses, and controlled by the masses rather than by a wealthy predominantly European few.\nKH: I couldn\u2019t agree more, and I think that we need to give people a different set of experiences, if we want people to want folks to develop a different perspective. Right now, a lot of people are experiencing politics as consumers of takes and information. We consume opinions, we approve or disapprove. Maybe we echo a perspective or add one to the mix. But we need to get people into a practice of actually hearing each other, and actually having a voice among other people who are trying to solve a problem or a set of problems together. Some of that needs to happen in person. Some of it can happen digitally, outside of algorithmically curated spaces. It can also happen with an eye toward accessibility and COVID safety. When we gathered to talk about public assemblies in Chicago with you recently, Denzel, it was too hot to gather outside, so we were indoors and we were masked. The important thing we need to realize is that we need to create space to build the kind of relationships and potential that we want to see right now. Repeating the same patterns isn\u2019t going to give us different outcomes.\nIf we want people to fight for democracy, let\u2019s give them a sense of what democracy can feel like. Let\u2019s build that together. And whether people are gathering around a specific issue, like housing struggles, austerity, a site fight, or defending their neighbors, let\u2019s give people a hands-on sense of what it means to come together and make decisions that shape what happens next. I know some people in this country already have a passionate or romanticized relationship with democracy, but that\u2019s not everyone, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s most people. Most people just want better lives. They want less suffering and more justice. We have to make democracy a vehicle toward those ends.\nSo, all of that said, is there anything else you would like to share with or ask of the audience today?\nDC: Yeah, definitely, if folks are interested in following the developments of the Black Nashville Assembly or the Southern Movement Committee, definitely feel free to connect with us or support our work through OurSMC.org. Beyond that, I would highly encourage folks to find an organization.\nWhether you\u2019re engaged in mutual aid, whether you\u2019re engaged in particular policy campaigns or whether you\u2019re engaged in assembly work, to find an organization, find an organization in particular that is, ideally, anti-imperialist, that is challenging capital and wants to build a fundamentally different world. Especially in this political moment, there\u2019s a wide political window, and we hope that you are able to find one that fits, and there are many out there. And if you don\u2019t see one that exists, feel free to build one that meets the need. But yeah, I would encourage folks to find an organization. I would encourage folks to do political education in connection to collective work, as opposed to just engaging in ideological study and ideation, attach it to some work.\nAnd lastly, to maintain hope, maintain revolutionary optimism. I think it\u2019s very easy and it\u2019s a tool of the empire for folks to engage in Doomerism, especially those of us on the left. So I would highly encourage folks to adopt a revolutionary optimism that isn\u2019t delusional, it\u2019s not idealist. It is a optimism that says that we can win if we choose to actively engage in collective struggle against these systems that oppress us and the planet. So I would leave with just those parting words of: join an organization, maintain revolutionary optimism, and ensure that your political education that you\u2019re engaged in is tied to some type of organizational work.\nKH: That\u2019s good advice. And in addition to joining an organization or starting up a project, I also want to encourage folks to keep picking up skills. Over the years, I have worn a lot of hats, because I\u2019ve picked up a lot of skills. Sometimes, skills that weren\u2019t immediately relevant to what I was doing became crucial under unforeseen circumstances. In unpredictable times like these, having just-in-case skill sets is going to be important.\nAnd on the subject of skill-building, if you want to learn more about facilitating public assemblies, Denzel and I are planning a virtual followup workshop that will build on some of the ideas Denzel covered in his recent workshop in Chicago, and in today\u2019s episode. So, if you attended that workshop or listened to this episode, you will be welcome to join us. And you can look for updates about that in my newsletter. Right now, we are thinking that will happen in early October.\nDenzel, I want to thank you again for joining me today. I am so grateful to be working in collaboration with you, and to have the chance to learn from you and everything that the Black Nashville Assembly is accomplishing.\nDC: Thank you so much. I\u2019m excited to be participating and I\u2019m looking forward to leading this virtual workshop and conversation and talking with more folks who are interested in engaging in this type of work.\nKH: I\u2019m looking forward to it too. Let\u2019s keep connecting and building.\nDC: All right. Peace, everybody.\nKH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I\u2019ll see you in the streets.\nShow Notes\nYou can learn more about the Black Nashville Assembly here.\n-\nYou can sign up for Kelly\u2019s weekly newsletter here.\n-\nPress freedom is under attack\nAs Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.\nTruthout produces reporting you won\u2019t see in the mainstream: journalism from on the ground in Gaza, interviews with grassroots movement leaders, high-quality legal analysis, and more.\nOur work is possible thanks to reader support.

            "South Korea's ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol rearrested. South Korea's ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol rearrested\nSouth Korea's former president has been rearrested over last year's failed martial law bid that plunged the country into political turmoil.\nYoon Suk Yeol was impeached in April over the order, which saw military rule introduced for six-hours in December.\nA senior judge at Seoul's Central District Court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon on Wednesday, citing fears he could destroy evidence.\nYoon, who was the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested, faces trial on charges of leading an insurrection over his attempt to impose martial law.\nDuring Wednesday's seven-hour hearing, a special counsel team argued for the arrest warrant on five key charges, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.\nThe charges include Yoon's alleged violation of the rights of cabinet members by not inviting some of them to a meeting before he declared martial law.\nYoon initially attended the hearing alongside his lawyers to deny the charges, before being taken to Seoul Detention Center to await a decision on an arrest warrant.\nHe was first arrested in January following a lengthy stand-off, with investigators scaling barricades and cutting through barbed wire to take him into custody from his residence in central Seoul.\nYoon was released two months later after a court overturned his arrest on technical grounds, but still faces trial.\nIf found guilty, he could face life in prison or the death penalty.\nProsecutors have reportedly found evidence that Yoon ordered military drones to be flown over North Korea to provoke a reaction that would justify his martial law declaration, according to reports.\nOther senior officials also face charges including insurrection and abuse of authority over the martial law declaration.\nInsurrection is one of a small number of criminal charges from which South Korean presidents do not have immunity, but now Yoon is no longer president he is open to other criminal charges.\nSouth Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, was elected in June following a snap election after Yoon's impeachment.\nLee campaigned on the promise to strengthen the country's democracy following the crisis and appointed a special counsel team to investigate Yoon over the imposition of martial-law, as well as other criminal allegations surrounding his administration.",
            "Wife of South Korea's jailed ex-President Yoon arrested over corruption allegations. Wife of South Korea's jailed ex-President Yoon arrested over corruption allegations\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The wife of South Korea's jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol has been arrested as investigators seek to charge her over various suspected crimes, including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a candidate.\nIn granting a special prosecutor's request for an arrest warrant late Tuesday, the Seoul Central District Court said Kim Keon Hee posed a risk of destroying evidence.\nThe investigation into Kim is one of three special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul's new liberal government targeting the presidency of Yoon, a conservative who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December.\nWhile Yoon's self-inflicted downfall extended a decades-long run of South Korean presidencies ending badly, he and Kim are the first former presidential couple to be jailed simultaneously over criminal allegations.\nYoon's surprising yet poorly planned power grab on Dec. 3 came amid a seemingly routine standoff with the liberals, who he described as \"anti-state\" forces abusing their legislative majority to block his agenda. Some political opponents have questioned whether Yoon's actions were at least partly motivated by growing allegations against his wife, which hurt his approval ratings and gave political ammunition to his rivals.\nKim did not speak to reporters as she arrived at the Seoul court Tuesday for an hours-long hearing on the warrant request. She is being held at a detention center in southern Seoul, separate from the facility holding Yoon. She is expected to face further questioning on Thursday by investigators, who can extend her detention for up to 20 days before formally filing charges.\nThe investigation team led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki, who was appointed in June by new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, initially questioned Kim for about seven hours on Wednesday last week before deciding to seek her arrest.\nKim spoke briefly to reporters as she appeared for last week's questioning, issuing a vague apology for causing public concern but also hinting that she would deny the allegations against her, portraying herself as \"someone insignificant.\"\nInvestigators suspect that Kim and Yoon exerted undue influence on the conservative People Power Party to nominate a specific candidate in a 2022 legislative by-election, allegedly at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun.

            "South Korean court orders arrest of wife of jailed ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol. South Korean court orders arrest of wife of jailed ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol\nA South Korean court has ordered the arrest of the wife of jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol as investigators seek to charge her over various suspected crimes, including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a political candi...\nSEOUL, South Korea -- A South Korean court on Tuesday ordered the arrest of the wife of jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol as investigators seek to charge her over various suspected crimes, including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a candidate.\nIn granting a special prosecutor\u2019s request for an arrest warrant near midnight, the Seoul Central District Court said Kim Keon Hee poses a risk of destroying evidence.\nThe investigation into Kim is one of three special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul\u2019s new liberal government targeting the presidency of Yoon, a conservative who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December.\nWhile Yoon\u2019s self-inflicted downfall extended a decades-long run of South Korean presidencies ending badly, he and Kim are the first presidential couple to be simultaneously arrested over criminal allegations.\nYoon\u2019s surprising yet poorly planned power grab on Dec. 3 came amid a seemingly routine standoff with the liberals, who he described as \u201canti-state\u201d forces abusing their legislative majority to block his agenda. Some political opponents have questioned whether Yoon\u2019s actions were at least partly motivated by growing allegations against his wife, which hurt his approval ratings and gave political ammunition to his rivals.\nKim did not speak to reporters as she arrived at the Seoul court Tuesday for an hours-long hearing on the warrant request. She will be held at a detention center in southern Seoul, separate from the facility holding Yoon.\nThe investigation team led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki, who was appointed in June by new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, questioned Kim for about seven hours on Wednesday last week before deciding to seek her arrest.\nKim spoke briefly to reporters as she appeared for last week\u2019s questioning, issuing a vague apology for causing public concern but also hinting that she would deny the allegations against her, portraying herself as \u201csomeone insignificant.\u201d\nInvestigators suspect that Kim and Yoon exerted undue influence on the conservative People Power Party to nominate a specific candidate in a 2022 legislative by-election, allegedly at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun. Myung faces accusations of conducting free opinion surveys for Yoon using manipulated data that possibly helped him win the party\u2019s presidential primaries before his election as president.\nKim is separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received luxury gifts via a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, and possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme tied to a local BMW dealership company.\nMin\u2019s investigation team arrested one of Kim\u2019s close associates earlier Tuesday following his arrival from Vietnam, as they look into suspicions that he used his connection to the former first lady to secure millions of dollars in business investments for his financially struggling company.\nThe investigators also raided a construction company on Monday over allegations that its chairman purchased a luxury necklace reportedly worth $43,000, which they believe was the same one Kim wore while accompanying Yoon on a 2022 trip to Europe.

            "$250 million (AED 917 million) financing agreement signed with U.S. International Development Finance Corporation for major expansion project in Kurdistan Region of Iraq - QUICK NEWS AFRICA. Sharjah, United Arab Emirates \u2013 Pearl Petroleum Company Limited (\u201cPearl Petroleum\u201d), the consortium led by Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum of the UAE, has signed a $250 million financing agreement with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (\u201cDFC\u201d) to support the gas expansion works currently underway at the Khor Mor gas plant in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI).\nDFC is the development finance arm of the U.S government and proceeds from the 7-year DFC financing will support an increase in gas production capacity by 50% to 690 million standard cubic feet (scf)/day to meet rising demand for clean natural gas for electricity generation and industry in the KRI. The total project cost is $630 million and the remaining financing has already been secured through a regional bank facility and the EPC contractor.\nThe KM-250 project is the first stage of a two-train expansion project at Khor Mor that aims to boost total production capacity to approach 1 billion scf/day. Work resumed in April 2021 after onsite construction was halted last year due to the COVID pandemic and is currently on track for completion by April 2023.\nTotal investment by Pearl Petroleum at Khor Mor to date exceeds US$2.1 billion with total cumulative production of over 341 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in natural gas and liquids. The uninterrupted supply of gas to power plants in Erbil, Chemchemal and Bazian has resulted in significant fuel cost savings and economic benefits for the Kurdistan Region and Iraq as a whole.\nThe gas produced to date has enabled emissions savings of 42 million tonnes of CO2 by displacing diesel fuel in power generation in the KRI, thereby making a major contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution in the region as well as supporting the transition to better energy sources to tackle global climate change.\nBetween 2018 and 2021, the Khor Mor Gas Plant also benefitted from a 45% production increase through an optimization of the facility bringing current total production to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). The project is today the largest regional private sector upstream gas operation in Iraq.\nMr. Majid Jafar, CEO of Crescent Petroleum and Board Managing Director of Dana Gas, commented: \u201cThis financing agreement with DFC underscores the importance of developing the natural gas resources in the KRI to support regional economic development and growth. Despite the global challenges presented by the COVID pandemic, we have continued to maintain our record of uninterrupted operations and even managed to grow production. The DFC agreement is a testament to our successful track record and further highlights the potential of these resources and the bright future for the KRI.\u201d\nDr. Patrick Allman-Ward, CEO of Dana Gas, added: \u201cWith our partners in Pearl Petroleum we are proud to be further developing the gas sector of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, delivering expanded supply of cleaner energy, and supporting local economic development. This agreement underscores our continued confidence in the region and its long-term prospects.\u201d\nMr. Dev Jagadesan, Acting CEO of DFC, said: \u201cDFC\u2019s investment in the Khor Mor expansion will substantially increase access to energy for people all across the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. This highly developmental project represents the United States\u2019 continuing investment in the KRI.\u201d\nIn April 2007, Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum entered into an agreement with the KRG for exclusive rights to appraise, develop, produce, market, and sell petroleum from the Khor Mor and Chemchemal fields in the KRI. Production from a newly built plant at Khor Mor began just 15 months later, in October 2008, an industry record. In 2009, Pearl Petroleum was formed as a consortium with Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum as the majority shareholders, and with OMV, MOL, and RWE joining the consortium subsequently with a 10% share each.\nFull-time staff at the operation number over 500, with over 85% local staff, including many in senior management positions. The companies have implemented a corporate social responsibility program to support local communities with equipment and supplies to deal with the COVID pandemic such as ventilators, sanitizers and protection equipment, in addition to a pledge to donate 100,000 vaccines to be administered in those local communities. This is in addition to ongoing support with local education, health and power supply as well as humanitarian aid for persons displaced from conflict zones as well as orphans. These initiatives assist the local communities in improving their standard of living, health, well-being, security and stability and the development of human capital.",
            "University of KwaZulu-Natal aims to run on mini solar power stations. UKZN's ambition to become South Africa\u2019s first predominantly renewable-powered university is taking shape through a new high tech project\nA partnership between the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) and a Hong Kong-based tech innovator is confronting the issues of ageing energy infrastructure and rising electricity costs to bring a greener future for South Africa\u2019s energy landscape.\nThe joint venture agreement with Youtility, launched at the university\u2019s Westville campus recently, harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology to change how electricity is generated, distributed and paid for.\nInnovators believe the project, which will eventually span all five of the university\u2019s campuses, positions it as a pioneer in sustainable energy and a testbed for technologies that could reshape how South Africa powers itself.\n\u201cThis concept of green energy is going to transform the energy landscape in South Africa,\u201d UKZN acting deputy vice-chancellor for research and innovation Anil Chuturgoon, said.\nDespite not having load-shedding for some time now, the country\u2019s energy system remains under strain, with the national grid still reliant on coal and plagued by inefficiencies, outages and electricity theft.\nInnovators believe the UKZN partnership offers an alternative for a decentralised, renewable-powered model that leverages microgrids, solar energy, battery storage and new technology to deliver reliable, clean electricity.\nThe initial rollout at Westville campus will see about 2 000 solar panels, each producing 600 watts, installed to generate on-site power. Battery banks and a sentient AI system called Wizdom will manage energy flows, ensuring seamless supply even when the national grid falters.\n\u201cThis partnership introduces a decentralised energy model, which is the opposite of our current, overly centralised power grid that often fails,\u201d UKZN Eskom power engineering programme acting director Leigh Jarvis said.\n\u201cMicrogrids ensure that different campuses or buildings can keep operating independently. So if the national grid is down, the university can still function \u2014 classes can continue, labs stay powered, and essential services remain online.\u201d\nMicrogrids are self-contained energy systems that integrate solar panels, battery storage and smart controllers. Unlike traditional power stations that send electricity over long distances, microgrids generate power close to where it\u2019s needed, reducing waste and improving reliability.\n\u201cThe resolution of the data and real-time nature will open up insight into electricity use and enable unparalleled control to power flow in relation to solar, storage, and grid,\u201d Jarvis said, highlighting how AI optimises energy distribution across buildings, labs and residences.\nAt the heart of this system is Youtility\u2019s Wizdom, described by director Wayne Mostert as \u201can evolving, AI-driven utility brain with enhanced capabilities which include real-time, decentralised decision-making and smart discharge of power into micro and macro grids\u201d.\nThis cloud-based operating system acts like a conductor, orchestrating energy flows to ensure efficiency and reliability. When the sun is not shining, Wizdom directs stored energy from battery banks to where it\u2019s needed most, preventing disruptions and maximising the use of renewable energy.\nOne of the project\u2019s innovative features is its blockchain-based billing system, which ensures transparency and fairness.\nBy providing real-time data on energy consumption, users can monitor their usage and utilities can track payments instantly. This tamper-proof approach could reduce electricity theft, which costs South Africa billions annually.\n\u201cEvery person or building gets charged only for what they use, in real-time, using a digital billing system that\u2019s as secure as online banking. This simplicity belies the project\u2019s complexity, which integrates advanced technology with real-world applications to create a scalable, resilient energy model,\u201d Jarvis said.\n\u201cIf everyone pays their fair share, then no one has to pay extra,\u201d Jarvis said, encapsulating the system\u2019s potential to eliminate unfair pricing and reduce the need for rate hikes. For the university this means lower operational costs, while for the broader population, it could serve as a model for equitable energy access.\nJavis said about 10,000 solar panels are being installed across campuses and will \u201cproduce clean, carbon-free energy every day \u2014 enough to power key facilities and reduce fossil fuel reliance significantly\u201d.\nThe initiative is expected to reduce air pollution, cut greenhouse gas emissions and promote smarter energy use in real-time. Greener buildings, labs and residence halls will lower UKZN\u2019s carbon footprint and serve as a living laboratory for sustainable practices.\nStudents are at the heart of the transformation.They will help maintain equipment, conduct research and develop new technologies.\nThe project includes plans for a UKZN spin-off company focused on energy tech, researching innovations like liquid air energy storage and superconductor systems as alternatives to lithium batteries.\n\u201cThrough this JVA, we envision student-led spin-off companies and a direct link between academic learning and the industries shaping our energy future,\u201d Jarvis said.\nThe partnership also has broader implications. Eskom Distribution is observing the project in an advisory capacity, recognising its potential to serve as a blueprint for national energy reform.\nIf successful, the UKZN model could be scaled to power schools, clinics, towns and even cities.\nIn layman\u2019s terms, Jarvis described the system as a self-sufficient mini power station: \u201cSolar panels collect energy from the sun. That energy gets stored in large batteries. A smart digital system figures out when and where to send power to buildings automatically.\n\u201cAt its core is the recognition that the future of electricity lies in disruption networks and decentralised energy systems.\u201d"

            "US immigration officials release Iranian woman nabbed from her home\u2019s yard. Federal immigration officials have released an Iranian woman whom they allowed to stay in the US without legal status for the last 47 years, until agents in tactical gear and unmarked vehicles suddenly nabbed her in front of her New Orleans home on 22 June \u2013 the day after American forces bombed Iran.\nA letter-writing campaign extolling decades of community service by Mandonna \u201cDonna\u201d Kashanian, 64, and care for her neighbors in the quiet Lakeview section of the city helped get her case in front of Steve Scalise, the Republican US House majority leader, and then top Trump administration officials, Kashanian\u2019s neighbor and longtime friend Connie Uddo said.\n\u201cWe got a little over 200 letters in just a week,\u201d Uddo said. \u201cPeople were calling constantly.\u201d\nShe recounted how Scalise, their community\u2019s congressperson, \u201cwas inundated with phone calls and emails and said he had to take a look\u201d. Scalise and his staff met with Kashanian\u2019s family, researched her case, spoke with Trump administration officials and got it to federal immigration officials.\nKashanian\u2019s American husband of 35 years, Russ Milne, and their 32-year-old daughter, Kaitlynn, are now able to pick her up from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center in Basile, Louisiana \u2013 three hours west of New Orleans \u2013 and bring her home.\nKashanian came to the US legally on a student visa in 1978, when she was just 17. She tried to stay beyond her visa by seeking asylum after the anti-American Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u2019s Islamic revolution seized control of her home country in 1979. But court records show she was denied asylum in 1984 and lost her last appeal in 1993.\nShe also tried to get permanent legal residency \u2013 colloquially known as a green card \u2013 in her 20s by marrying a US citizen, but she admitted it was a sham and got divorced. A federal court ruled in 2001 that the fraudulent marriage disqualified her from ever getting legal status by getting married, no matter how legitimate. The court acknowledged her marriage to Milne was \u201cbona fide\u201d but ruled that she couldn\u2019t overcome the sham one from her 20s.\nStill, Stephanie Hilferty, a Louisiana state House member and Republican from the New Orleans suburb of Metairie, said Kashanian\u2019s case deserved a second look. And she worked with Kashanian\u2019s family to gather letters about Kashanian\u2019s character and dedication to America, hoping to get them in front of Donald Trump.\nScalise also spoke with Russ and Kaitlynn Milne about Kashanian\u2019s case. Scalise then spoke with the Trump administration, ensuring that Ice officials reviewed her file and read the hundreds of letters Hilferty had collected.\nKashanian\u2019s court records show immigration officials ordered her deportation several times since 1983. But each time, they made her departure voluntary because of what the court called her \u201cgood moral character\u201d. And for the last two decades, a judge allowed her to stay as long as she continued to follow the law and checked in regularly.\nShe has no criminal record and her family says she\u2019s never missed an immigration check-in appointment. But she was never able to attain legal immigration status despite obeying the rules the government and courts imposed on her so she could stay.\nScalise\u2019s office is planning to work with Kashanian\u2019s attorney to help her pursue asylum or permanent residency under current immigration laws, which have changed since she first pursued those avenues four decades ago.\nThe timing of Kashanian\u2019s detention came just after the US\u2019s 21 June airstrikes in Iran. Those bombings coincided with the ramping-up of deportations of Iranians by the Trump administration.\nKashanian\u2019s Ice detention also came amid a nationwide crackdown by the agency, which has seen tens of thousands of immigrants detained, often by masked agents, plunging many communities into fear and outraging civil liberties advocates.",
            "Iranian mother released from ICE detention after Republican House Majority Leader intervenes - myMotherLode.com. Iranian mother released from ICE detention after Republican House Majority Leader intervenes\nIranian mother released from ICE detention after Republican House Majority Leader intervenes\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 An Iranian mother detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers has been released this week following advocacy from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise.\nMandonna \u201cDonna\u201d Kashanian, 64, was detained by ICE officers last month as she gardened in the yard of her New Orleans home. She had been living in the United States for 47 years, and her husband and daughter are both U.S. citizens.\nKashanian had been allowed to stay in the U.S. as long as she checked in regularly with immigration authorities, as she had done without fail, her family and attorney said.\nAfter a surge of community support for Kashanian, Scalise, who represents Louisiana\u2019s 1st Congressional District, including the New Orleans suburbs, told media outlet WDSU that he asked the Department of Homeland Security to give Kashanian \u201ca fair shake.\u201d\nScalise said Kashanian should be judged on \u201cher life\u2019s work\u201d and role in her community.\n\u201cWhen she was picked up, we looked at it and said, \u2018Are they really looking at it the right way, objectively?\u2019\u201d Scalise told WDSU. \u201cAnd so they took a second look at it.\u201d\nScalise\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment from the AP.\nScalise\u2019s intervention was \u201cabsolutely crucial\u201d to behind-the-scenes advocacy to secure Kashanian\u2019s release, her attorney Ken Mayeaux told The Associated Press. What happens next for Kashanian\u2019s legal status is still being worked out, said.\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that \u201cthe facts of this case have not changed.\u201d\n\u201cMandonna Kashanian is in this country illegally,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cShe exhausted all her legal options.\u201d\nRep. Stephanie Hilferty, a Republican who represents Kashanian\u2019s community, said she had been a \u201cdevoted mother and wife, a caretaker, neighbor and dedicated volunteer\u201d with Habitat for Humanity, her local school district and other organizations.\nMore than 100 of Kashanian\u2019s neighbors wrote letters of support for her, which Hilferty told the AP she and Scalise had shared with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\u201cShe\u2019s just been an incredible volunteer and servant to our Lakeview community, everybody knows her because of all she gives and does,\u201d said Connie Uddo, a neighbor of Kashanian\u2019s who leads the NOLA Tree Project where Kashanian and her husband have volunteered for years.\nSome neighbors wrote letters addressed to Trump expressing support for his immigration policies but saying that some people like Kashanian were being detained improperly and urging him to reconsider her case.\nKashanian had arrived in the U.S. in 1978 on a student visa and unsuccessfully applied for asylum based on her father\u2019s support of the U.S.-backed shah.\nICE New Orleans said in a June post on the social platform X that Kashanian had failed to depart the U.S. after the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld a deportation order in 1992.\n\u201cShe was ordered by a judge to depart the U.S. and didn\u2019t,\u201d the agency said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be a surprise we came knocking.\u201d\nBut Kashanian was allowed to remain with her husband and child as long as she checked in regularly with immigration authorities, her family said. For decades, she had \u201cfaithfully and fully complied with those terms,\u201d said Mayeaux, her attorney. She even managed to check in with authorities while displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\nKashanian met her husband, Russell Milne while bartending as a student in the late 1980s. She filmed Persian cooking tutorials on YouTube and doted on the neighboring children.\nMilne told the AP his family was \u201cextremely grateful\u201d for all the support from their community and elected officials.\n\u201cShe\u2019s meeting her obligations,\u201d Milne told the AP following her detention. \u201cShe\u2019s retirement age.

            "Iranian mother released from ICE detention after Republican House Majority Leader intervenes. Iranian mother released from ICE detention after Republican House Majority Leader intervenes\nAn Iranian mother detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers has been released following advocacy from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise\nNEW ORLEANS -- An Iranian mother detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers has been released this week following advocacy from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise.\nMandonna \u201cDonna\u201d Kashanian, 64, was detained by ICE officers last month as she gardened in the yard of her New Orleans home. She had been living in the United States for 47 years, and her husband and daughter are both U.S. citizens.\nKashanian had been allowed to stay in the U.S. as long as she checked in regularly with immigration authorities, as she had done without fail, her family and attorney said.\nAfter a surge of community support for Kashanian, Scalise, who represents Louisiana's 1st Congressional District, including the New Orleans suburbs, told media outlet WDSU that he asked the Department of Homeland Security to give Kashanian \u201ca fair shake.\u201d\nScalise said Kashanian should be judged on \u201cher life\u2019s work\u201d and role in her community.\n\u201cWhen she was picked up, we looked at it and said, \u2018Are they really looking at it the right way, objectively?\u2019\u201d Scalise told WDSU. \u201cAnd so they took a second look at it.\u201d\nScalise\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment from the AP.\nScalise\u2019s intervention was \u201cabsolutely crucial\u201d to behind-the-scenes advocacy to secure Kashanian\u2019s release, her attorney Ken Mayeaux told The Associated Press. What happens next for Kashanian's legal status is still being worked out, he said.\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that \u201cthe facts of this case have not changed.\u201d\n\u201cMandonna Kashanian is in this country illegally,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cShe exhausted all her legal options.\u201d\nRep. Stephanie Hilferty, a Republican who represents Kashanian\u2019s community, said she had been a \u201cdevoted mother and wife, a caretaker, neighbor and dedicated volunteer\u201d with Habitat for Humanity, her local school district and other organizations.\nMore than 100 of Kashanian\u2019s neighbors wrote letters of support for her, which Hilferty told the AP she and Scalise had shared with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\u201cShe\u2019s just been an incredible volunteer and servant to our Lakeview community, everybody knows her because of all she gives and does,\u201d said Connie Uddo, a neighbor of Kashanian\u2019s who leads the NOLA Tree Project where Kashanian and her husband have volunteered for years.\nSome neighbors wrote letters addressed to Trump expressing support for his immigration policies but saying that some people like Kashanian were being detained improperly and urging him to reconsider her case.\nKashanian had arrived in the U.S. in 1978 on a student visa and unsuccessfully applied for asylum based on her father's support of the U.S.-backed shah.\nICE New Orleans said in a June post on the social platform X that Kashanian had failed to depart the U.S. after the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld a deportation order in 1992.\n\u201cShe was ordered by a judge to depart the U.S. and didn\u2019t,\u201d the agency said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be a surprise we came knocking.\u201d\nBut Kashanian was allowed to remain with her husband and child as long as she checked in regularly with immigration authorities, her family said. For decades, she had \u201cfaithfully and fully complied with those terms,\u201d said Mayeaux, her attorney. She even managed to check in with authorities while displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\nKashanian met her husband, Russell Milne while bartending as a student in the late 1980s. She filmed Persian cooking tutorials on YouTube and doted on the neighboring children.\nMilne told the AP his family was \u201cextremely grateful\u201d for all the support from their community and elected officials.\n\u201cShe\u2019s meeting her obligations,\u201d Milne told the AP following her detention. \u201cShe\u2019s retirement age. She\u2019s not a threat.

            "Freed from ICE detention, Mahmoud Khalil files $20 million claim against Trump administration. Freed from ICE detention, Mahmoud Khalil files $20 million claim against Trump administration\nPalestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, whose role in campus protests against Israel led to his detention for over three months in immigration jail, is now seeking $20 million in damages from the Trump administration\nNEW YORK -- On a recent afternoon, Mahmoud Khalil sat in his Manhattan apartment, cradling his 10-week-old son as he thought back to the pre-dawn hours spent pacing a frigid immigration jail in Louisiana, awaiting news of the child\u2019s birth in New York.\nFor a moment, the outspoken Palestinian activist found himself uncharacteristically speechless.\n\u201cI cannot describe the pain of that night,\u201d Khalil said finally, gazing down as the baby, Deen, cooed in his arms. \u201cThis is something I will never forgive.\u201d\nNow, weeks after regaining his freedom, Khalil is seeking restitution. On Thursday, his lawyers filed a claim for $20 million in damages against the Trump administration, alleging Khalil was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite as the government sought to deport him over his prominent role in campus protests.\nThe filing \u2014 a precursor to a lawsuit under the Federal Tort Claims Act \u2014 names the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the State Department.\nIt comes as the deportation case against Khalil, a 30-year-old recent graduate student at Columbia University, continues to wind its way through the immigration court system.\nThe goal, Khalil said, is to send a message that he won't be intimidated into silence.\n\u201cThey are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable,\u201d Khalil said. \u201cUnless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.\u201d\nKhalil plans to share any settlement money with others targeted in Trump\u2019s \u201cfailed\u201d effort to suppress pro-Palestinian speech. In lieu of a settlement, he said he would also accept an official apology and changes to the administration\u2019s deportation policies.\nIn an emailed statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, called Khalil\u2019s claim \u201cabsurd,\u201d accusing him of \u201chateful behavior and rhetoric\u201d that threatened Jewish students.\nA State Department spokesperson said its actions toward Khalil were fully supported by the law. Inquiries to the White House and ICE were not immediately returned.\nThe filing accuses President Donald Trump and other officials of mounting a haphazard and illegal campaign to \u201cterrorize him and his family,\u201d beginning with Khalil\u2019s March 8 arrest.\nOn that night, he said he was returning home from dinner with his wife, Noor Abdalla, when he was \u201ceffectively kidnapped\u201d by plainclothes federal agents, who refused to provide a warrant and appeared surprised to learn he was a legal U.S. permanent resident.\nHe was then whisked overnight to an immigration jail in Jena, Louisiana, a remote location that was \u201cdeliberately concealed\u201d from his family and attorneys, according to the filing.\nInside, Khalil said he was denied his ulcer medication, forced to sleep under harsh fluorescent lights and fed \u201cnearly inedible\u201d food, causing him to lose 15 pounds (7 kilograms). \u201cI cannot remember a night when I didn\u2019t go to sleep hungry,\u201d Khalil recalled.\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration publicly celebrated the arrest, promising to deport him and others whose protests against Israel it dubbed \u201cpro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.\u201d\nKhalil, who has condemned antisemitism before and since his arrest, was not accused of a crime and has not been linked to Hamas or any other terror group. \u201cAt some point, it becomes like reality TV,\u201d Khalil said of the allegations. \u201cIt\u2019s very absurd.\u201d\nA few weeks into his incarceration, Khalil was awoken by a fellow detainee, who pointed excitedly to his face on a jailhouse TV screen. A new memo signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged Khalil hadn\u2019t broken the law, but argued he should be deported for beliefs that could undermine U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\u201cMy beliefs are not wanting my tax money or tuition going toward investments in weapons manufacturers for a genocide,\u201d Khalil said. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\nBy then, Khalil had become something of a celebrity in the 1,200-person lock-up. When not dealing with his own case, he hosted \u201coffice hours\u201d for fellow immigrant detainees, leaning on his past experience working at a British embassy in Beirut to help others organize paperwork and find translators for their cases.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty good at bureaucracy,\u201d Khalil said.\nAt night, they played Russian and Mexican card games, as Khalil listened to \u201cone story after another from people who didn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening to them.\u201d\n\u201cThis was one of the most heartbreaking moments,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople on the inside don\u2019t know if they have any rights.\u201d\nOn June 20, after 104 days in custody, Khalil was ordered released by a federal judge, who found the government's efforts to remove him on foreign policy grounds were likely unconstitutional.\nHe now faces new allegations of misrepresenting personal details on his green card application. In a motion filed late Wednesday, attorneys for Khalil described those charges as baseless and retaliatory, urging a judge to dismiss them.\nThe weeks since his release, Khalil said, have brought moments of bliss and intense personal anguish.\nFearing harassment or possible arrest, he leaves the house less frequently, avoiding large crowds or late-night walks. But he lit up as he remembered watching Deen taking his first swim earlier in the week. \u201cIt was not very pleasant for him,\u201d Khalil said, smiling.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying as much as possible to make up for the time with my son and my wife,\u201d he added. \u201cAs well thinking about my future and trying to comprehend this new reality.\u201d\nPart of that reality, he said, will be continuing his efforts to advocate against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. On the day after his arrest, he led a march through Manhattan, draped in a Palestinian flag \u2014 and flanked by security.\nAs he poured Deen\u2019s milk into a bottle, Khalil considered whether he might\u2019ve done anything differently had he known the personal cost of his activism.\n\u201cWe could\u2019ve communicated better. We could\u2019ve built more bridges with more people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the core thing of opposing a genocide, I don\u2019t think you can do that any differently. This is your moral imperative when you\u2019re watching your people be slaughtered by the minute.\u201d\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.\nDemocracy Now! was there when Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil reunited with his family over the weekend after being released on bail by a federal judge Friday, ending his detention in a Louisiana ICE jail after more than 100 days. Khalil was seized by federal agents at his home in New York on March 8, with the Trump administration seeking to deport him even though he is a legal permanent resident with a green card and married to a U.S. citizen. Khalil\u2019s wife Noor Abdalla was eight months pregnant at the time of the arrest and gave birth to their son while he was jailed. \u201cI just want to go back and continue the work I was already doing, advocating for Palestinian rights,\u201d says Khalil, who played a prominent role in the Palestine solidarity protests at Columbia University last spring. He addressed over 1,000 supporters at a rally Sunday before leading a march to the gates of the school. We feature part of Khalil\u2019s comments and also hear from Democratic Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and members of Khalil\u2019s legal team.\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I\u2019m Amy Goodman.\nStay in the loop\nNever miss the news and analysis you care about.\nColumbia University graduate, Palestinian student, protest leader Mahmoud Khalil has been reunited with his wife and newborn son after being released on bail by a federal judge Friday after spending over 100 days in an ICE jail. He was seized by federal agents March 8. His wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, a U.S. citizen, was eight months pregnant at the time. Mahmoud spoke briefly Saturday after flying from Louisiana to Newark Airport, joined by Democratic Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Democracy Now! was at Newark Airport.\nAMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re at Newark Airport, and we\u2019re waiting for Mahmoud Khalil to come out. He has just landed. His plane was diverted to Philadelphia then took off again. It\u2019s at Newark right now. He\u2019s playing with his baby, Deen. He\u2019s reunited with his family, and he\u2019s about to walk into the press scrum. And there are a number of people here who are here to greet him, playing drums, they have flowers for him. He\u2019s coming out.\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Well, first, friends, thank you so much for everything. Not only for today, it\u2019s just for every day. Like, just your words, your words of support, your messages have kept me going. Still, the fight is far from over. The genocide\u2019s still happening in Gaza. Israel is still waging a full war against Palestinian \u2013 across Palestine. The U.S. government is funding this genocide, and Columbia University is investing in this genocide. This is why I was protesting. This is why I will continue to protest with every one of you. Not only if they threaten me with detention. Even if they would kill me, I would still speak up for Palestine. Again, I just want to go back and just continue the work that I was already doing, advocating for Palestinian rights, a speech that should actually be celebrated than \u2013 rather than punished, as this administration wants to do. But we\u2019ll take a few questions.\nREPORTER 1: Mahmoud, what would you say to the Trump administration? Because they wanted to keep you detained. What is your message for President Trump?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Just the fact that I\u2019m here, it sends a message. The fact that all these attempts to suppress pro-Palestine voices have failed now. So, this is the message. My existence is the message. The Palestinian existence is the message to this administration.\nREPORTER 2: Mahmoud, how does it feel to be free? How does it feel to be free?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: To be honest, [Laugh] I\u2019m still trying to just comprehend that. Of course, it feels great. When I was on the inside, I was free, it\u2019s just I was locked up. The fact that they put me in that place, that didn\u2019t mean that I was not free. I continued to advocate for Palestinians, for the emigrants who are left behind in that facility, that 1,200 men who, all of them, are incredible men, who the Trump administration are trying to portray as whether criminals, or just, like, illegals as they say. And as I said yesterday, whether you are a citizen, an immigrant, anyone, on this land, you\u2019re not illegal. That doesn\u2019t make you less of a human. And this is what the administration is trying to do, to dehumanize me, to dehumanize the immigrants, dehumanize anyone who actually does not agree with what the administration is doing.\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: Thank you, everyone. First and foremost, I think we speak on behalf of so many people across this country, across the state of New York, but also across so many communities in the United States in welcoming Mahmoud home, to be here and to be reunited with his wife and his newborn son. Mahmoud Khalil was imprisoned for 104 days by this administration, by the Trump administration, with no grounds and for political reasons. Because Mahmoud Khalil is an advocate for Palestinian human rights, he has been accused baselessly of horrific allegations, simply because the Trump administration and our overall establishment disagrees with his political speech. This was a form, his detention by ICE, being taken from his home as well as other advocates, Ms. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk in Boston, Massachusetts, ripped off of the street. Being taken is wrong. It is illegal. It is a violation of his First Amendment rights. It is an affront to every American. And we will not allow, and we will continue to resist, the politicization and the continued political persecution that ICE is engaged in.\nBAHER AZMY: I\u2019m Baher Azmy, A-Z-M-Y, Center for Constitutional Rights. I\u2019m one of his attorneys. This is an incredibly significant and important victory, although one that came far too late. And as much as we\u2019re celebrating, I think we can\u2019t fully let go of the outrage that Mahmoud had to fight for so long and so hard against this outrageous and unconstitutional government conduct by the administration, namely to persecute him simply for advocacy for Palestine and dissenting from United States foreign policy. So, I think Mahmoud and Palestinian advocates are still the tip of the authoritarian spear with this administration. But collectively, I think people want to keep up the resistance and keep up the fight for justice in Palestine.\nRAMZI KASSEM: Ramzi Kassem, CLEAR Project, CUNY School of Law. We\u2019re attorneys for Mr. Khalil.\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you first respond to Mahmoud\u2019s being freed? Tell us what took so long. What was the decision that the judge made? What was it based on after these months?\nRAMZI KASSEM: The district judge, quite appropriately, yesterday, took a hard and studied look at all of the factors that govern release and found that there was absolutely no basis, none. He was unequivocal. Mahmoud is not a danger of any sort. He\u2019s not a flight risk of any kind. And there\u2019s absolutely no justification for his detention. The judge did this meticulously, methodically in a two-hour hearing that should withstand any sort of appellate scrutiny. The fundamental reality remains that Mahmoud Khalil was detained by this administration in an attempt to make an example out of him, in an attempt to stifle speech that frankly should be celebrated and commended, speech in defense of the human rights of Palestinians, their dignity, their right to life, speech in opposition to an ongoing genocide. And for that, the administration tried that make an example out of him and tried to establish a template that it would then apply to any other set of issues that it happens to disagree with. That, as we\u2019ve seen today, is failing. It is backfiring. Mahmoud is out, of course, and he is, as you heard, uncowed, unbowed, he\u2019s going to resume his activism. But he\u2019s not alone, more importantly. Hundreds of thousands of others have expressed not just their solidarity with him, but their solidarity with the Palestinian people. And this is not a movement that the Trump administration is going to be able to deport its way out of. It\u2019s very much an American movement.\nAMY GOODMAN: Does Mahmoud face deportation today? Explain the difference between the two courts.\nRAMZI KASSEM: Well, the simplest way to think about it is that the immigration case is the Trump administration\u2019s case. It\u2019s the case that they want because it\u2019s before an immigration judge who isn\u2019t really a judge at all. An immigration judge is a DOJ employee, Department of Justice employee, who serves at the pleasure of the president and can be fired by the president at any time. The case in federal court in New Jersey, on the other hand, now, that\u2019s Mahmoud\u2019s case. That\u2019s the case that he brought to vindicate his own constitutional rights in front of an independent judge who does not serve at the pleasure of the president, who has lifetime tenure, and who, as was demonstrated yesterday, can issue rulings that are critical of the president. The contrast was extremely clear yesterday. You had a federal judge agreeing with Mahmoud and vindicating his constitutional rights against the Trump administration. And at the same time, you had an immigration judge, who\u2019s an employee of the Trump administration, agreeing with the Trump administration. There could be no clearer illustration of the difference between the administrative immigration proceedings and Mahmoud\u2019s constitutional case in federal court.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, does he face deportation?\nRAMZI KASSEM: He is in ongoing removal proceedings. We will continue to fight that fight, and that\u2019s why the fight is not over. But the latest round of this fight was resoundingly run by Mahmoud Khalil.\nAMY GOODMAN: Ramzi, you were there when Mahmoud was freed. Can you describe what that was like? And also, making your way from Jena, Louisiana, you flew from Dallas to Newark.\nRAMZI KASSEM: Amy, I was there with Mahmoud. We were listening to the hearing in court together in Jena in a room over a phone. And when the ruling came down\u2026\nAMY GOODMAN: From the bench at that moment?\nRAMZI KASSEM: Yeah. When the ruling came down over that phone, he and I jumped up, we hugged each other, we screamed, we shouted. And then, we started planning. And we drove through the night to catch the first flight out. We haven\u2019t slept. But we\u2019re happy, and I can\u2019t imagine his happiness, embracing his wife and child, and their happiness. And I\u2019m just ecstatic that they\u2019re together, that they get this time to be together. They should\u2019ve never been separated, of course. But now, they are together, and he\u2019s in a much better position, not just to fight these legal cases that we\u2019ve been talking about, but also to resume his all-important political work as an outspoken advocate for the most basic human rights for the Palestinian people.\nAMY GOODMAN: We are standing at Newark Airport, where Mahmoud Khalil has just arrived, reuniting with his wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, and his almost two-month-old son, Deen, whose birth he missed as he was jailed for more than 100 days in Jena, Louisiana. And as we stand here at Newark Airport where \u2013 in terminal A, where he came out, and welcomed his supporters, and talked to the press, we\u2019re standing in front of a mural by the Ecuadorian muralist, Layqa Nuna Yawar. It is a mural that celebrates immigrants in the United States. I\u2019m Amy Goodman. This is Democracy Now!.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, that was Saturday. On Sunday, Mahmoud Khalil addressed over a thousand supporters as well as the press outside the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine here in Manhattan, blocks from the campus of Columbia University.\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: I would like to salute the courage of all the students at Columbia and across the nation. These students who continue to protest. I want to honor especially my friends at Columbia University, especially those who are currently battling expulsion and suspension for their consciousness stand. As many of you know, the board of trustees at Columbia, the shameful board of trustees at Columbia, is currently attempting to expel 15 more students and to suspend tens of others, basically stealing their future, their degrees, their labor, merely because these students are not afraid. These students are not afraid to stand for Palestine. Columbia University will do everything and anything it can to ensure that the words free Palestine are not uttered anywhere near it. But while we are here, free, free Palestine!\nCROWD: Free, free Palestine!\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Free, free Palestine!\nCROWD: Free, free Palestine!\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Viva, viva Palestina!\nCROWD: Viva, viva Palestina!\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Viva, viva Palestina!\nCROWD: Viva, viva Palestina!\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: I hope that Columbia University heard your chants. In fact, even today, Columbia University refused to allow this press conference and rally to be held at the gates just so that we cannot remind them that they fund the killing in Gaza. Well, who is Mahmoud Khalil? That\u2019s why the administration has tried its best to portray me as someone who\u2019s violent. Mahmoud Khalil is a human rights defender. Mahmoud Khalil is a freedom fighter. Mahmoud Khalil is a refugee. Mahmoud Khalil is a father and husband. And above all, Mahmoud Khalil is Palestinian. Mahmoud Khalil is a Palestinian who refused to remain silent while watching a genocide in Palestine, a genocide that\u2019s, of course, committed by the genocidal state of Israel that\u2019s funded by the U.S. government, that\u2019s invested by Columbia University.\nAMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil addressing over 1,000 supporters as well as the press outside the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine in Manhattan. He then led a march as the marchers held the banner \u201cWelcome home, Mahmoud.\u201d He wore a Palestinian flag as a cape, and they marched from 110th Street, where the Cathedral is, to Columbia University at 116th Street. Mahmoud Khalil still faces deportation but now can deal with these proceedings as a free man with his wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, and his newborn son, Deen Khalil. That does it for our show.

            "Mahmoud Khalil: Let\u2019s Focus on Palestinians Right Now Instead of My Freedom. In his first live broadcast interview since being released from ICE detention, Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil tells Democracy Now! about his experience behind bars, the ongoing threat of deportation that hangs over him and why he continues to speak out against the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza. The Columbia University graduate was the first pro-Palestinian campus protester to be jailed by the Trump administration. Khalil is now reunited with his wife Noor and newborn son Deen, after he was released on bail last month by a federal judge. Khalil says the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to silence him are \u201ca distraction from the genocide in Palestine.\u201d\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman.\nStay in the loop\nNever miss the news and analysis you care about.\nOfficials in Gaza say Israeli attacks have killed over 300 Palestinians over the past 48 hours. One strike on the home of the renowned cardiologist Marwan al-Sultan at Indonesian Hospital killed the doctor, along with his mother, sister and aunt. He\u2019s at least the 70th healthcare worker killed by Israel in the past 50 days.\nThis comes as Palestinians say at least 33 people were slaughtered today as they lined up for aid at militarized aid distribution sites run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The reportedly unprovoked killings came as the Associated Press published recent video showing U.S. contractors at GHF sites firing live ammunition and stun grenades at starving Palestinians as they scrambled for food. The AP says it received the footage from two U.S. contractors who wish to remain anonymous in order to blow the whistle on abuses. The contractors report security staffers were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed, and seemed to have an open license to do whatever they wished. In this clip published by the AP, contractors erupt in cheers as shots ring out.\nJULIA FRANKEL: At that moment, bursts of gunfire erupt close by, at least 15 shots.\nU.S. CONTRACTOR 1: I think you hit one.\nU.S. CONTRACTOR 1: Hell, yeah, boy!\nAMY GOODMAN: This comes as the Trump administration continues its crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrators, especially at universities across the United States. In a moment, we\u2019ll be joined by the first pro-Palestinian campus protester to be jailed by the Trump administration: Columbia University graduate and Palestinian student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil. Video shows his arrest on March 8th, when he was detained by plainclothes officers who did not identify themselves. The video was filmed by his eight-month-pregnant wife, Noor Abdalla, whose voice you\u2019re hearing in this clip.\nDR. NOOR ABDALLA: Can you \u2014 can you please specify what agency is taking him, please? Excuse me. They\u2019re \u2014 nobody \u2014 they\u2019re not talking to me. I don\u2019t know. Excuse me, the lawyer would like to speak to somebody. Oh my god, they\u2019re literally running away from me.\nAMY GOODMAN: That was March. Mahmoud Khalil has now reunited with his wife and newborn son, after he was released on bail less than two weeks ago by a federal judge following over 100 days in a Louisiana ICE jail. Khalil spoke outside the jail in Jena, Louisiana, when he was freed.\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: No one is illegal. No human is illegal. That\u2019s the message. The message is: Justice will prevail, no matter what this administration may try to portray.\nAMY GOODMAN: Two weeks ago, on Saturday, Democracy Now! was at Newark Airport when Mahmoud Khalil was reunited with his wife and his son.\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: I just want to go back and just continue the work that I was already doing, advocating for Palestinian rights, a speech that should actually be celebrated rather than punished, as this administration wants to do.\nAMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil was standing next to the New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\nOn Sunday, the following day, the Palestinian student leader, now graduate of Columbia University, stood next to his wife, Noor Abdalla, and addressed over a thousand supporters, as well as the press, on the Upper West Side outside the Cathedral of St. John the Divine here in Manhattan, blocks from his campus of Columbia University.\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: I would like to salute the courage of all the students at Columbia and across the nation, these students who continue to protest. I want to honor especially my friends at Columbia University, especially those who are currently battling expulsion and suspension for their consciousness stand.\nAMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil is lawful permanent resident green card holder who has not been charged with any crimes, yet he was held in a Jena, Louisiana, ICE jail for 104 days.\nThis all comes amidst growing calls for Israel to be held accountable for alleged war crimes in Gaza, including attacks on hospitals.\nMahmoud Khalil joins us now for his first live global broadcast since his release.\nMahmoud, welcome to Democracy Now!\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Thanks, Amy. Thanks for having me.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, I want to start with the same question I asked you at the airport: How does it feel to be free?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: I mean, absolutely, it goes without saying, it feels \u2014 it feels good just to be reunited with the family and with my baby son. But at the same time, it feels difficult watching the Palestinian people, like, massacred, being massacred right now in Gaza. And this really adds more responsibility on me to continue advocating for the rights of the Palestinians.\nAnd this is what we should focus on right now, because my freedom is nothing compared to the suffering that the Palestinian people are going through right now in Palestine. And this is what the message should be, that whether it\u2019s my arrest, whether the focus right now on immigration, it\u2019s just like a distraction of what\u2019s really happening in Palestine, that this administration is investing and funding war crimes in Gaza, that this administration is unconditionally supporting Israel, whether politically or militarily. This is what we should focus on rather than individual cases, I believe.\nAMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, I\u2019m wondering if you can take us back to March 8th, that day when you were taken by Homeland Security or federal agents. I don\u2019t even know \u2014 at this point, do you know who it is that you were taken by? And what happened on that day, where you were?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah, so, the Trump administration basically illegally ripped me away from my family, because they are simply trying to silence anyone speaking out against Israel atrocities against the Palestinians. The officers or the agents who kidnapped me did not introduce themselves. They said at first it\u2019s police, then DHS, without giving any details, without even presenting an arrest warrant, which is the most basic thing that any law enforcement \u2014 any law enforcement should do in a country that proclaims justice and due process, which unfortunately did not happen. So, they basically kidnapped me and, for more than 30 hours, kept moving me from one place to another, literally moving me more than 1,400 miles across the country.\nAMY GOODMAN: Can I ask you something? One of the men who abducted you in your Columbia University housing, is it true that he was the Homeland Security agent who was honored by President Trump in his first term in office, Elvin Hernandez?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: To be honest, I don\u2019t have concrete information about that. It has been only two weeks since my release. I \u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: And you didn\u2019t know at the time who he \u2014\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Inside, I didn\u2019t have access to internet.\nAMY GOODMAN: You didn\u2019t know at the time who these men were.\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: I didn\u2019t.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, I mean \u2014\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: No, no, I didn\u2019t. Like, to be honest, the story that the government presented was once over \u2014 one time over another changed to sort of serve their part of the story. At the beginning, they said, \u201cWell, we had an arrest warrant, and we arrested Mahmoud outside of Columbia, of his Columbia residence.\u201d But then, when we presented the video evidence, they said, \u201cOh, he tried to flee.\u201d So, these agents are trained to lie, are trained to just instigate violence with those who they are seeking to detain.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, we have played over and over the video of your wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, on the phone with the lawyer, desperately trying to figure out what was happening and where you were being taken. In fact, can you talk about when you had emailed the president of Columbia University, Dr. Armstrong at the time, because you were so concerned about what was happening to you? You wanted some kind of protection.\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah. I mean, ICE, ICE acts as Trump\u2019s militia arm. That\u2019s the way that now they are functioning. And we can see this evident not only in my case, in just like cases across the country.\nIn the weeks leading up to my arrest, I noticed a more vicious, coordinated smear campaign against me online, the same \u2014 the same accounts mentioning Rubio, the White House, mentioning also, like, just baseless claims about Mahmoud Khalil, who he is, like an international student, a Hamas agent and all these labels. So, I felt that since I didn\u2019t have any legal, at that point, representation, I wanted, like, Columbia first to protect me, because these actors are Columbia students and faculty, the ones who were waging this smear campaign against me online and calling for the administration to deport me. So, this is the minimum that Columbia should have done, is to protect the students against these hostile actors. So, and that was not \u2014 I mean, I sent the email the morning of my arrest, I believe. And this was not the first email that we sent to Columbia and no answer.\nUnfortunately, Columbia did not and does not, until now, treat all students as equal. What they care about is basically money and protecting their brand, rather than going and listening to their students, protecting their students with their legitimate concerns, not to have any special treatment for the Palestinian or the students supporting Palestine on campus.\nAMY GOODMAN: I\u2019m wondering if Columbia \u2014\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: But Columbia failed to do that.\nAMY GOODMAN: Did Columbia University support you in any way? I remember in the case of R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, who is the Tufts Fulbright scholar and graduate student also abducted by federal agents, Tufts wrote a statement of support. And then Suri Khan, the Dr. Suri Khan at Georgetown, Georgetown also spoke out. What about Columbia University on your behalf?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Columbia did not offer any sort of support when it comes to the legal case. And this is shameful on a university that claims to support international students and to support the right of freedom of speech. But this was not surprising. Columbia has capitulated to the Trump administration, but before then, they capitulated to the Zionist donors and politicians in this country. So, to see them not offer this kind of support absolutely was not surprising, unfortunately.\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about your time in the Jena ICE jail? You were held for over a hundred days there. Can you talk about the other prisoners, the conditions under which you were held? And then I want to get to the day your baby, your baby Deen, was born without you there. But talk about the jail until that point.\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: So, in jail, you spend 24/7 with the same people. So, one of the things that we do is to just share stories from people from around the ward. And every day it\u2019s just a more heartbreaking story than another, with people being snatched off the street or during their court hearings or ICE check-ins, where these people, like, they were trying to fix their documentation. They committed no crimes whatsoever. So, you have this shock with everyone who\u2019s coming in around why they are there. I shared a dorm with over 70 men, and the stories are really heartbreaking, Amy, with people leaving their family outside without any kind of support, people who don\u2019t have their rights \u2014 don\u2019t know their rights, don\u2019t know if they have any rights, in fact. And with ICE, who basically don\u2019t tell anyone what their rights are and just deport people, I\u2019ve seen people who unknowingly sign their deportation documents because ICE agents tricked them into doing so, which is a blatant violation of any rule of law or due process.\nAnd just, like, to say that, like, the conditions inside were horrible. The food was horrible, the sleep quality equally bad, and just the atmosphere, where you are inside, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, and you\u2019re just expecting to follow orders and wait for an ICE officer to come and update you on your case. Unfortunately, a lot of these detainees don\u2019t have legal representation. And I was very privileged to have an amazing legal team fighting on my behalf. And that took us three months for me to be released, despite me being a legal resident in the United States. So, imagine for a lot of these individuals who don\u2019t have this kind of representation and who have, like, more complications in their documentation.\nAMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, can you talk about the day of Deen\u2019s birth, your firstborn son? How did you learn that Noor had given birth?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: That days was absolutely one of the most difficult days that I had to endure in my life, being away from my wife and not having the opportunity to support her during this moment. And I was over the phone, so I would call every hour just to see, like, if Noor is in labor, yeah or no. And the moment of the delivery, I spent like over three hours over the phone, from 1:00 \u2014 I think 1:30 in the morning until 4:00 or 4:30, just, like, trying to support Noor as much as I could, because I did not want to miss that moment at all.\nAnd what made it very difficult is because, like, this could have been easily avoided, were the Trump administration to follow the law, or at least, like, to offer me furlough, like, to go and be with my family for a few hours. But they refused that, because this administration thrives on cruelty and thrives on separation and family separation. So that was not surprising.\nAMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the moment when you met Deen for the first time? I mean, as you describe it now, you really were with Noor then. Of course, you were separate, but you were there. Over the phone, you heard his first cries. But talk about holding him for the first time. I remember \u2014 I mean, it was just weeks ago. Why it was that your lawyers had to fight, a battery of lawyers, for so many hours for Noor and Deen, for you to be able to have a contact visit? I mean, you have not been charged with a crime. But in the jail \u2014 is that right \u2014 where it was, in Jena, Louisiana?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah. As you said, I mean, it shouldn\u2019t take an army of lawyers to get a one-hour contact visit to let me hold my son. The first time I saw my son was, in fact, through glass. So, he was literally in front of me, but separated by glass. I couldn\u2019t hold him during the first time I saw him, which made me very, very angry about, like, a one-centimeter or one-inch glass separating me from holding my son.\nAnd this is all by design, the cruelty of this administration, because their goal is to punish me as much as they could and in any way that they find, because what they want is they want to break me. They want to make an example out of me. So, the first time when we managed to get a court order, in fact \u2014 imagine getting a court order to force ICE to let me hold my son. And we had it for literally an hour, 7:00 in the morning. So, even when they agreed to do that \u2014 or, not agreed \u2014 even when they were forced to allow me to hold my son, they chose to make it at 7:00 in the morning in detention.\nSo, I mean, the feeling, I don\u2019t think I can describe it. I was both very happy, but at the same time very angry and sad that it took us all this effort to have this one hour in detention. And basically, I was really anxious. I was just looking at the clock, when this hour would end. I just didn\u2019t want this hour to end. And the hour was the fastest hour in my life, just like \u2014 you know, like, it went like this.\nAMY GOODMAN: And so \u2014\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah, Amy.\nAMY GOODMAN: You were released less than two weeks ago, and now you are living at home with your wife and your infant son. Do you feel safe?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: I don\u2019t fully feel safe, to be honest, Amy. We all know the rhetoric that\u2019s currently going around in this country, the Islamophobia, the anti-Palestinian bigotry and racism, and this violence that was exported by Israel to this country. I\u2019m being targeted by Israeli government-affiliated groups here in the U.S. who are very dangerous, who would do anything to silence Palestinians, because, for them, silencing is much more easier than dealing with the argument, because they have no argument about what they are doing in Palestine. And this is why they want to shut off the \u2014 shut down the conversation any way they can do, even if this would mean hurting or harming me and my family. And it\u2019s a huge concern. But it\u2019s a price that I need to accept for advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people, because, once again, this is all just a distraction from the genocide in Palestine. And these attempts to silence me are just one way for them to attack us and to cut \u2014 just not to let the public know about what Israel is doing and how the U.S. is complicit in this genocide.\nAMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, you led a march from the steps of St. John the Divine up to Columbia University, wearing a Palestinian flag as a kind of cape, with a thousand supporters there, and you were one of the leaders of the encampment at Columbia that led to so many protests and encampments around the country on university campuses. Many of the protesters were Jewish. Many of the supporters for you who would march when you were detained were Jewish. I was wondering: What did that level of Jewish support mean to you here in the United States?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: First of all, just a correction: The student movement at Columbia doesn\u2019t have leaders. I believe all the students equally contribute to the movement. And it\u2019s being mobilized by a large number of students, hundreds of students at Columbia University.\nBut going back to your question, Amy, I mean, Jewish students are an integral part of the student movement, whether at Columbia or in the United States. And this is very, very important, because these Jewish students, they show the world that what Israel is doing is not in their name, is not in the name of Jewish safety, which is very important. And these, also, Jewish students are acting upon their values, of protecting the \u2014 protecting the weak or supporting justice. So, it\u2019s really \u2014 to us, it\u2019s very important. This shows that the Palestinian cause goes beyond Palestinians, Arabs or Muslims. It\u2019s a universal cause for justice, for freedom and for human rights.\nAMY GOODMAN: And finally, Mahmoud, as you are free now here in New York, you still face deportation?\nMAHMOUD KHALIL: I do. I mean, now I\u2019m out on bail, which means that the court proceedings can continue while I am out. So, I\u2019m still facing deportation. However, a judge, a federal judge, ruled that the Rubio determination on what Rubio did to me is likely unconstitutional, and that\u2019s why he ordered my release on bail. So I\u2019m confident that we will prevail in court, that this administration attempts to silence us wouldn\u2019t succeed, and now that I will seek accountability. I will seek accountability from this administration, from the individuals and actors who contributed to my arrest, and now exploring these options with my lawyer, because in the first place, what I was protesting, I was protesting for accountability, to hold Columbia and the U.S. government accountable for their complicity in war crimes and genocide against the Palestinians. And I will continue to do so, because what happened to me shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place. I shouldn\u2019t have been prosecuted simply for my freedom of speech, simply for speaking up for Palestinian rights. And those who have contributed to that in any way should be held accountable.\nAMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, thanks so much for joining us, Columbia University graduate, Palestinian student activist, detained by ICE March 8th and held for 104 days at the ICE jail in Jena, Louisiana. During that time, his wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, gave birth to their first child, Deen. Mahmoud was released June 20th. You can see him coming to Newark Airport and the next day\u2019s event in front of St. John the Divine with a thousand people greeting him at democracynow.org, as well as our interview with Mohsen Mahdawi, who also graduated from Columbia University after being jailed in Vermont for several weeks. You can go to democracynow.org.\nWhen we come back, we\u2019ll be joined by Congressmember Ro Khanna, as the House continues to debate President Trump\u2019s budget bill. Stay with us.\nMedia that fights fascism\nTruthout is funded almost entirely by readers \u2014 that\u2019s why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative. But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political repression under Trump.\nWe rely on your support to survive McCarthyist censorship.

Thousands of people from Bosnia and around the world gathered in Srebrenica to mark the 30th anniversary of a 1995 massacre there of more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim boys and men, which has been acknowledged as Europe's only genocide after the Holocaust.\nSeven newly identified victims of the massacre \u2014 including two 19-year-old men \u2014 will be laid to rest in a collective funeral at a vast, ever-expanding cemetery near Srebrenica Friday, next to more than 6,000 victims already buried there. Such funerals are held annually for the victims who are still being unearthed from dozens of mass graves around the town.\nRelatives of the victims, however, often can bury only partial remains of their loved ones as they are typically found in several different mass graves, sometimes miles apart.

General Assembly last year adopted a resolution to commemorate the Srebrenica genocide on the July 11 anniversary. Scores of international officials and dignitaries are expected to attend the commemoration ceremonies and the funeral on Friday.\nOn the eve of the anniversary, an exhibition was inaugurated displaying personal items belonging to the victims that were found in the mass graves over the years.\nThe conflict in Bosnia erupted in 1992, when Bosnian Serbs took up arms in a rebellion against the country's independence from the former Yugoslavia and with an aim to create their own state and eventually unite with neighboring Serbia.

Bosnian Serb political and military leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, along with many others, have been convicted and sentenced for genocide.\nSerbia's populist President Aleksandar Vucic expressed condolences on X while calling the Srebrenica massacre a \"terrible crime.\" Vucic added that \"we cannot change the past but we must change the future.\"",

            "Thousands gather in Srebrenica on 30th anniversary of Europe&#8217;s only acknowledged genocide since WWII. Associated Press\nAssociated Press\nLeave your feedback\nSREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) \u2014 Thousands of people from Bosnia and around the world gathered in Srebrenica to mark the 30th anniversary of a 1995 massacre there of more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim boys and men, which has been acknowledged as Europe\u2019s only genocide after the Holocaust.\nSeven newly identified victims of the massacre, including two 19-year-old men, will be laid to rest in a collective funeral at a vast cemetery near Srebrenica Friday, next to more than 6,000 victims already buried there. Such funerals are held annually for the victims who are still being unearthed from dozens of mass graves around the town.\nRelatives of the victims, however, often can bury only partial remains of their loved ones as they are typically found in several different mass graves, sometimes kilometers (miles) apart. Such was the case of Mirzeta Karic, who was waiting to bury her father.\n\u201cThirty years of search and we are burying a bone,\u201d she said, crying by her father\u2019s coffin which was wrapped in green cloth in accordance with Islamic tradition.\n\u201cI think it would be easier if I could bury all of him. What can I tell you, my father is one of the 50 (killed) from my entire family.\u201d\nJuly 11, 1995, is the day when the killings started after Bosnian Serb fighters overran the eastern Bosnian enclave in the final months of the interethnic war in the Balkan country.\nAfter taking control of the town that was a protected U.N. safe zone during the war, Bosnian Serb fighters separated Bosniak Muslim men and boys from their families and brutally executed them in just several days. The bodies were then dumped in mass graves around Srebrenica which they later dug up with bulldozers, scattering the remains among other burial sites to hide the evidence of their war crimes.\nThe U.N. General Assembly last year adopted a resolution to commemorate the Srebrenica genocide on the July 11 anniversary.\nScores of international officials and dignitaries were present in Srebrenica for the commemoration ceremonies and the funeral Friday.\nDutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said he was personally touched because U.N. troops from the Netherlands were based in Srebrenica when Bosnian Serbs stormed the town.\n\u201cI feel humble to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I see to what extent commemorating Srebrenica genocide is important.\u201d\nIn an emotional speech, Munira Subasic, who heads the respected Mothers of Srebrenica association, urged Europe and the world to \u201chelp us fight against hatred, against injustice and against killings.\u201d\nSubasic, who lost her husband and youngest son in Srebrenica along with more than 20 relatives, told Europe to \u201cwake up.\u201d\n\u201cAs I stand here many mothers in Ukraine and Palestine are going through what we went through in 1995,\u201d Subasic said, referring to ongoing conflicts. \u201cIt\u2019s the 21st century but instead of justice, fascism has woken up.\u201d\nOn the eve of the anniversary, an exhibition was inaugurated displaying personal items belonging to the victims that were found in the mass graves over the years.\nThe conflict in Bosnia erupted in 1992, when Bosnian Serbs took up arms in a rebellion against the country\u2019s independence from the former Yugoslavia and with an aim to create their own state and eventually unite with neighboring Serbia.

            "Thousands of river pollution tests cancelled because of staff shortages. Thousands of river pollution tests cancelled because of staff shortages\nThousands of water tests to identify potential harmful pollution in rivers, lakes and estuaries in England have been cancelled in the last three months due to staff shortages, the BBC has learned.\nThe Environment Agency confirmed the cancellations after campaigners showed us internal emails and documents with plans for extensive cuts to monitoring programmes.\nThe cancelled tests are for so-called inorganic pollutants - substances such as nitrates and phosphates that can indicate sewage or agricultural pollution.\nThe EA says its testing programme \"remains robust\" but this week a landmark report said it had \"struggled to effectively oversee and manage the water system\".\nIn the three months from May to July the water regulator says that 10,000 scheduled tests at its main laboratory at Starcross in Devon did not take place due to staff shortages.\nOthers were combined with other tests or postponed in what the EA says was an \"optimisation\" process.\nThe Environment Agency said seven national inorganic testing programmes had been completely \"paused\". They include programmes that track chemical pollution in rivers, lakes and estuaries as well as one that monitors the regulator's plans for dealing with drought.\nJo Bradley, who worked at the Environment Agency's water quality team for more than 20 years, told the BBC: \"Some inorganic substances, such as copper and zinc, are directly toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish and insects,\"\n\"Others, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, are nutrients and they can affect river health when they are present in high quantities.\n\"These substances must be tested routinely, at many hundreds of locations, so that we can see trends in river chemistry and quickly identify problems.\"\nThe EA said it \"paused\" 17.5% of its inorganic testing at the Starcross Laboratory from May to July.\nOver the entire year it said it was expecting to operate at 15% below capacity.\nA spokesperson blamed the reduction in tests on \"fluctuations in staffing capacity\" and said the laboratory would be working at full capacity again by October.\nStaffing problems are nothing new at the EA. In 2023 its chairman Alan Lovell told parliament that it had \"struggled with recruitment and retention of staff\".\nInternal emails obtained by campaign groups Greenpeace and Desmog through freedom of information requests were shared with the BBC. They show EA officials discussing the impact of staff departures on testing and saying that others planned to leave.\nOne senior official, writing an email to her colleagues, said it was \"not good news I'm afraid\" adding \"this isn't where we want to be (again)\".\nHelen Nightingale, who worked at the Environment Agency as a catchment planner, analysing data from its water quality programme until 2022, says that while she was there she saw a shift of focus away from serious investigation to trying to find \"successes\".\nShe also said that morale was low: \"The pay is not great \u2013 we didn't have pay rises for years due to austerity,\n\"But a lot people are in it [the EA] because they want to make a difference \u2013 and when you're not even getting that - well, what's the point?\"\nDocuments seen by the BBC show that the work affected by the cuts to testing this year included investigations into the water industry in various parts of the country, and monitoring of protected areas including the River Wye, which is currently facing a pollution crisis linked to intensive chicken farming.\nStuart Singleton White from the Angling Trust which has been running its own citizen scientist testing programme., said: \"This spring, while the EA cut 10,000 water samples, our Water Quality Monitoring Network collected its 10,000th.\n\"Our latest annual report showed that 34% of sites breached \"good ecological status\" for phosphate, and 45% showed signs of nitrate pollution. Pollution is out of control, and extensive testing is key to addressing the problem.\"\nSinger-turned-campaigner Feargal Sharkey said the cancelled tests are further confirmation of the EA's limitations.\n\"When is a regulator not a regulator? When it's the Environment Agency,\" Mr Sharkey told the BBC.\n\"With impeccable timing the Environment Agency reminds us all of exactly why they to should be added to Sir Jon Cunliffe's bonfire of the quangos [the Water Commission]. Institutionally incompetent, complacent and discredited.\"\nThis week, Sir Jon recommended that a single water regulator be created, with the EA handing over responsibility for monitoring water pollution.\nA spokesperson for the EA said: \"We are committed to protecting the environment and water quality testing remains a top priority having received an extra \u00a38m in funding.\"\n\"Our water quality testing programme remains robust and prioritised on the basis of need - only a small proportion of tests were impacted by this issue, with no impact on pollution incidents and bathing water testing.\"",
            "'I can't drink the water' - life next to a US data centre. 'I can't drink the water' - life next to a US data centre\nWhen Beverly Morris retired in 2016, she thought she had found her dream home - a peaceful stretch of rural Georgia, surrounded by trees and quiet.\nToday, it's anything but.\nJust 400 yards (366m) from her front porch in Fayette County sits a large, windowless building filled with servers, cables, and blinking lights.\nIt's a data centre - one of many popping up across small-town America, and around the globe, to power everything from online banking to artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT.\n\"I can't live in my home with half of my home functioning and no water,\" Ms Morris says. \"I can't drink the water.\"\nShe believes the construction of the centre, which is owned by Meta (the parent company of Facebook), disrupted her private well, causing an excessive build-up of sediment. Ms Morris now hauls water in buckets to flush her toilet.\nShe says she had to fix the plumbing in her kitchen to restore water pressure. But the water that comes of the tap still has residue in it.\n\"I'm afraid to drink the water, but I still cook with it, and brush my teeth with it,\" says Morris. \"Am I worried about it? Yes.\"\nMeta, however, says the two aren't connected.\nIn a statement to the BBC, Meta said that \"being a good neighbour is a priority\".\nThe company commissioned an independent groundwater study to investigate Morris's concerns. According to the report, its data center operation did \"not adversely affect groundwater conditions in the area\".\nWhile Meta disputes that it has caused the problems with Ms Morris' water, there's no doubt, in her estimation, that the company has worn out its welcome as her neighbour.\n\"This was my perfect spot,\" she says. \"But it isn't anymore.\"\nWe tend to think of the cloud as something invisible - floating above us in the digital ether. But the reality is very physical.\nThe cloud lives in over 10,000 data centres around the world, most of them located in the US, followed by the UK and Germany.\nWith AI now driving a surge in online activity, that number is growing fast. And with them, more complaints from nearby residents.\nThe US boom is being challenged by a rise in local activism - with $64bn (\u00a347bn) in projects delayed or blocked nationwide, according to a report from pressure group Data Center Watch.\nAnd the concerns aren't just about construction. It's also about water usage. Keeping those servers cool requires a lot of water.\n\"These are very hot processors,\" Mark Mills of the National Center for Energy Analytics testified before Congress back in April. \"The surface of each chip is hotter than the surface of the sun. It takes a lot of water to cool them down.\"\nMany centres use evaporative cooling systems, where water absorbs heat and evaporates - similar to how sweat wicks away heat from our bodies. On hot days, a single facility can use millions of gallons.\nOne study estimates that AI-driven data centres could consume 1.7 trillion gallons of water globally by 2027.\nFew places illustrate this tension more clearly than Georgia - one of the fastest-growing data centre markets in the US.\nIts humid climate provides a natural and more cost-effective source of water for cooling data centres, making it attractive to developers. But that abundance may come at a cost.\nGordon Rogers is the executive director of Flint Riverkeeper, a non-profit advocacy group that monitors the health of Georgia's Flint River. He takes us to a creek downhill from a new construction site for a data centre being built by US firm Quality Technology Services (QTS).\nGeorge Diets, a local volunteer, scoops up a sample of the water into a clear plastic bag. It's cloudy and brown.\n\"It shouldn't be that colour,\" he says. To him, this suggests sediment runoff - and possibly flocculants. These are chemicals used in construction to bind soil and prevent erosion, but if they escape into the water system, they can create sludge.\nQTS says its data centres meet high environmental standards and bring millions in local tax revenue.\nWhile construction is often carried out by third-party contractors, local residents are the ones left to deal with the consequences.\n\"They shouldn't be doing it,\" Mr Rogers says. \"A larger wealthier property owner does not have more property rights than a smaller, less wealthy property owner.\"\nTech giants say they are aware of the issues and are taking action.\n\"Our goal is that by 2030, we'll be putting more water back into the watersheds and communities where we're operating data centres, than we're taking out,\" says Will Hewes, global water stewardship lead at Amazon Web Services (AWS), which runs more data centres than any other company globally.\nHe says AWS is investing in projects like leak repairs, rainwater harvesting, and using treated wastewater for cooling. In Virginia, the company is working with farmers to reduce nutrient pollution in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the US.\nIn South Africa and India - where AWS doesn't use water for cooling - the company is still investing in water access and quality initiatives.\nIn the Americas, Mr Hewes says, water is only used on about 10% of the hottest days each year.\nStill, the numbers add up. A single AI query - for example, a request to ChatGPT - can use about as much water as a small bottle you'd buy from the corner shop. Multiply that by billions of queries a day, and the scale becomes clear.\nProf Rajiv Garg teaches cloud computing at Emory University in Atlanta. He says these data centres aren't going away - if anything, they're becoming the backbone of modern life.\n\"There's no turning back,\" Prof Garg says.\nBut there is a path forward. The key, he argues, is long-term thinking: smarter cooling systems, rainwater harvesting, and more efficient infrastructure.\nIn the short term, data centres will create \"a huge strain\", he admits. But the industry is starting to shift toward sustainability.\nAnd yet, that's little consolation to homeowners like Beverly Morris - stuck between yesterday's dream and tomorrow's infrastructure.\nData centres have become more than just an industry trend - they're now part of national policy. President Donald Trump recently vowed to build the largest AI infrastructure project in history, calling it \"a future powered by American data\".\nBack in Georgia, the sun beats down through thick humidity - a reminder of why the state is so attractive to data centre developers.\nFor locals, the future of tech is already here. And it's loud, thirsty, and sometimes hard to live next to.\nAs AI grows, the challenge is clear: how to power tomorrow's digital world without draining the most basic resource of all - water.",
            "Chicago\u2019s Water Runs Through Lead Pipes. Why Are They Taking Decades to Replace?. Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.\nGrowing up in Chicago, Chakena D. Perry knew not to trust the water coming out of her tap.\n\u201cIt was just one of these unspoken truths within households like mine \u2014 low-income, Black households \u2014 that there was some sort of distrust with the water,\u201d said Perry, who later learned that Chicago is the city with the most lead service lines in the country. \u201cNo one really talked about it, but we never used our tap for just regular drinking.\u201d\nNow, as a senior policy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, Perry is part of a coalition that fought for stricter rules to force cities like Chicago to remove their toxic lead pipes faster. Last year, advocates celebrated a big win: The Biden administration\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency mandated that water systems across the country replace all their lead service lines. Under the new rule, most water systems will have 10 years to complete replacements, while Chicago will likely get just over 20, starting in 2027, when that requirement kicks in.\nGet our free emails\nBut the city\u2019s replacement plan, submitted to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency in April per state law and obtained through a public records request, puts it 30 years behind that timeline.\nChicago\u2019s plan adheres to state law and an outdated EPA rule from the first Trump administration. It aims to replace the city\u2019s estimated 412,000 lead service lines by 2076 \u2014 completing 8,300 replacements annually for 50 years, starting in 2027.\nThe latest federal rule requires Chicago to replace nearly 20,000 pipes per year beginning in 2027 \u2014 more than double the speed of the city\u2019s current plan. Documents show city officials are aware of the new requirements, but have not yet updated their plans.\nA delayed timeline will expose many more children and adults to the risk of toxic drinking water, and rising temperatures from climate change may exacerbate the risk by causing more lead to leach off pipes and into water.\nFor Perry, even 20 more years of lead pipes was a compromise.\n\u201cPeople are already being exposed \u2014 they\u2019re being exposed daily,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThere is no number [of years] that is satisfactory to me, but 20-ish years is better than 50.\u201d\nIn recent decades, drinking water crises in Washington, D.C., and Flint, Michigan, put the public health threat of lead on the national map. Lead pipes are a danger across the country, where about 9 million lead service lines need to be replaced to adhere to the new requirements. About a million of those are in Illinois \u2014 the most of any state in the country. Among the five U.S. cities estimated to have the most lead pipes \u2014 Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Detroit, and Milwaukee \u2014 only Chicago has yet to adopt the latest federal deadline. The rest plan to replace their lead pipes within a decade of 2027.\nLead can damage the human brain and nervous system, kidney function, and reproductive health, and it\u2019s also an underappreciated cause of cardiovascular problems.\nLead is particularly harmful to children: It can hamper brain development and cause permanent intellectual disabilities, fatigue, convulsions, comas, or even death. Lead exposure during pregnancy can also cause low birth weight or preterm birth.\nExperts emphasize that there is no safe level of lead exposure.\nIn Illinois, the Metropolitan Planning Council found that people of color are up to twice as likely as white people to live in a community burdened by lead service lines.\nBecause of a three-year grace period in the 2024 EPA rule \u2014 the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements, or LCRI \u2014 the city does not have to begin complying with the new replacement requirements until 2027. But Chicago\u2019s plan outlines a timeline that starts the very same year and is significantly slower.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what Chicago is thinking there,\u201d said Marissa Lieberman-Klein, an Earthjustice attorney focused on lead in drinking water.\nChicago is facing a Herculean task. Even with a 50-year timeline, it will have to start moving much faster than its current replacement speed: The city will need to replace more lead service lines annually than the total of 7,923 it managed over the past four years ending in March. Of these replacements, about 60 percent occurred alongside repairs for breaks and leaks or water and sewer main replacements.\nMegan Vidis, a spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Water Management, said Chicago is ramping up its replacement speeds. The city will replace 8,000 lines this year, she said.\n\u201cWe have been and will continue to move as quickly as resources allow to replace lead service lines,\u201d Vidis wrote in an email.\nAsked about the feasibility of the current EPA rule\u2019s 20-year replacement timeline, Vidis wrote, \u201cWe need substantial additional funding, particularly the kind available to help pay for private side replacements.\u201d That refers to the city\u2019s split ownership structure, where homeowners own one part of the line and the city owns the other.\nErik D. Olson, senior strategic director for environmental health at the NRDC, said these financial woes are a reason for Chicago to put forward a more ambitious replacement plan.\nOlson pointed out that $15 billion in national lead service line replacement funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law, expire next year.\n\u201cIf Chicago isn\u2019t beating down the doors to get that money, that is tragic, because that money could evaporate,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThey should be front-end loading as much of the service line replacement as they possibly can.\u201d\nU.S. EPA spokesperson David Shark confirmed that Illinois water systems are currently under the new rule. But the agency did not answer specific questions about Illinois\u2019 obligations between now and when the compliance deadlines start in 2027, citing pending litigation on the rule.\nIllinois EPA spokesperson Kim Biggs wrote in an email that the state is operating under the replacement requirements included in the 2021 EPA rule and the state\u2019s law until 2027.\nLead service lines were required by Chicago\u2019s municipal code \u2014 reportedly influenced by lead companies and the plumbers union \u2014 for decades after much of the country stopped using them due to health concerns. According to a study published last year, two-thirds of the city\u2019s youngest children \u2014 under 6 years old \u2014 live in homes with tap water containing detectable levels of lead.\nDrinking water is just one way that people are exposed to lead. It\u2019s also found in soil and paint. But experts estimate that water could make up at least 20 percent of a person\u2019s exposure.\nWhen lead pipes corrode, the toxic material can dissolve or flake into water and poison residents without their knowledge. Rising temperatures due to climate change could be exacerbating lead risks, and researchers have found that childhood lead poisoning levels spike during hotter periods.\nPerry now lives in Oak Forest, one of Chicago\u2019s southern suburbs, but she also owns the home her mother lives in, on Chicago\u2019s South Side. That home has a lead service line, Perry said, and she doesn\u2019t know when it will be replaced.\nThe city has \u201ca responsibility to the residents in the city of Chicago to protect them at all costs,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThere\u2019s no price that\u2019s too high to pay for safe drinking water.\u201d\nChicago\u2019s plan is based on a 2021 state law requiring that water systems with 100,000 or more lead service lines \u2014 which includes Chicago \u2014 replace all of them within 50 years from 2027.\nAt the time of its passage, this state law was stronger than the federal Lead and Copper Rule Revisions of 2021, which did not require replacement in most cases.\nExperts and advocates criticized and even sued the EPA over that rule \u2014 enacted by the Trump administration in the final days of the president\u2019s first term \u2014 saying it weakened existing efforts to achieve safe drinking water nationwide.\nNear the end of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, the EPA finalized the current rule. Most systems across the country must replace all their lead service lines before 2038, with deferral allowances for places with large proportions of lead service lines \u2014 like Chicago, which would likely get until mid-2049 to finish.\nThe EPA estimated that each year this rule will prevent up to 900,000 cases of low birth weight and 1,500 cases of premature death from heart disease. Many advocates praised the rule, while others noted that two more decades of lead pipes still pose significant health risks in Chicago.\nBut according to the document the city submitted to the state, Chicago\u2019s plan hasn\u2019t yet caught up to the newer federal law. The plan acknowledges the faster federal timeline but notes that Chicago isn\u2019t abiding by that yet.\nThe city, its plan states, will comply \u201cif the regulations go into effect.\u201d\nNationally, the regulation is already in effect, Earthjustice\u2019s Lieberman-Klein said, and the EPA does not need to release any additional documents to make that true.\nBut what city officials might be thinking, she said, is that given the continued rollbacks of many environmental and health regulations by President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA, this requirement might eventually be wiped off the books.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible Chicago is just looking at what this administration has been generally saying about rules promulgated by the previous administration, and it\u2019s saying, \u2018We\u2019d like to wait and see what they say about this rule,\u2019\u201d Lieberman-Klein said.\nSome congressional Republicans tried to revoke the lead pipe replacement rule legislatively, but they missed the deadline to do so.\nLast year, the American Water Works Association \u2014 a water industry organization \u2014 challenged the rule in court, alleging that its requirements are not feasible. Environmental groups stepped in to defend the rule, but it remains to be seen whether the EPA will do likewise. The agency declined to comment on the pending litigation.\nChicago\u2019s water department cited the lawsuit as one of its reasons for submitting a plan that doesn\u2019t account for the 20-year replacement timeline. But the rule isn\u2019t on pause, Earthjustice\u2019s Lieberman-Klein clarified.\n\u201cThe litigation does not stay the rule or change its effective date,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still went into effect at the end of October and nothing about the compliance dates have changed.\u201d\nOver the past few years, Chicago officials say each service line replacement has averaged about $35,000, although they plan to lower these costs by more frequently replacing the service lines for full blocks at a time. This is much higher than national estimates, which range from about $4,700 to $12,000 per line.\nRegardless, it will be no easy feat for Chicago to piece together the funds to finish the job quickly, and big proposed cuts to federal funding would make a challenging task even harder.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s proposal for the EPA next fiscal year would cut the agency\u2019s budget by more than half. Part of that plan: slashing almost all the money for the low-interest loan program that states rely on to update water pipes.\nTrump\u2019s budget proposal says \u201cthe states should be responsible for funding their own water infrastructure projects.\u201d Chicago\u2019s plan notes that $2 million of expected funding for a program focused on replacing lead service lines in daycares serving low-income communities was lost this year in the blanket elimination of congressional earmarks.\nMegan Glover, co-founder and former CEO of 120Water, an Indiana-based company that runs a digital platform to help water systems manage lead replacement programs, wasn\u2019t surprised by the news. Federal funding is a concern for her company\u2019s customers across the country, she said.\n\u201cAll grants and earmarks, we\u2019re kind of starting from a ground-zero standpoint,\u201d Glover said. \u201cAll of that is kind of up for grabs at this point with the new administration.\u201d\nAnna-Lisa Gonzales Castle is director of water policy at Elevate, a Chicago-based nonprofit focused on water and energy affordability that is also involved with local lead service line replacement programming. She said that ramping up replacement speeds will be a challenge, but homeowners shouldn\u2019t be left on the hook for something that wasn\u2019t their fault.\n\u201cWe want to see the city move swiftly, and we want to see the federal government and the state bring resources to bear on this too,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be an all-hands-on-deck approach.\u201d\nThis story is a partnership between Grist, Inside Climate News, and WBEZ, a public radio station serving the Chicago metropolitan region.

            "Gov. Jeff Landry appoints new head of Louisiana coastal agency. Crucial challenges ahead.. Gov. Jeff Landry announced Friday he has appointed a new head of the state's coastal protection agency, a key role as Louisiana does battle against its worsening land loss crisis and intensifying hurricanes while facing upcoming money shortages.\nMichael Hare replaces Glenn Ledet as executive director of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. Ledet recently departed to take over as secretary of the state Department of Transportation and Development.\nHare has served in a variety of roles in both government and the private sector related to environmental and coastal policy. His past roles include deputy district director and legislative assistant to former U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany and director of government affairs and business development at RES, which bills itself as the nation's largest environmental mitigation company.\nBefore his appointment he was serving as founder of Wildhare Solutions LLC, consulting clients entering environmental markets, focusing on mitigation and coastal restoration, Landry's office said in a statement. Both of those issues are important to Louisiana, which is required to carry out mitigation plans when projects such as levee construction damage the natural environment.\nWhile not a scientist or engineer, he holds an MBA from LSU and a master's degree in U.S. foreign policy from American University. His bachelor's degree was in political science and economics.\n\u201cMichael has years of experience in coastal restoration, and I am confident that his leadership and commitment to our state make him well-suited to lead CPRA,\" Landry said.\nHare said he looks \"forward to working with the coastal community to deliver projects that will protect and sustain our culture and way of life for future generations.\"\nBeyond looming funding shortages, Hare will also have to manage the future of the state's largest-ever coastal project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion. That $3 billion project, which Landry opposes in its current form, is paused indefinitely and the state is evaluating potential replacements for it.\nIt was largely paid for with money related to the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Using the money for a separate project requires approval from trustees overseeing those funds, whose uses are restricted to a shortlist of possibilities, as well as lengthy environmental assessments.\nFuture money shortages will result from fines and settlement dollars related to the 2010 spill expiring at the end of 2031. More than half of the CPRA's nearly $2 billion project budget for the 2026 fiscal year comes from those funds.\nThe state has been seeking ways of at least partially replacing those dollars but has not yet found real solutions.\nIt did, however, receive good news recently when the tax and spending bill approved in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump boosted the amount of money Louisiana will receive from offshore revenue by up to around $50 million a year over a decade. That money must be used for coastal protection and restoration.\nThe CPRA oversees a wide portfolio of coastal projects, ranging from large-scale levee building to marsh reconstruction. It has a $50 billion, 50-year master plan to restore parts of the coast, but finding money for the work in future years will be challenging.\nLouisiana has lost around 2,000 square miles of land over the last century \u2014 roughly the size of Delaware. Projected sea level rise connected to human-caused climate change will greatly worsen the problem in the decades ahead.\nThe Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, a nonprofit that has worked on land loss issues for decades, welcomed Hare's appointment, saying he \"has built a reputation for busting through red tape and working with communities to get things done.\"\n\"His experience in both the private and public sectors proves he can bring together stakeholders from across our coast,\" Ethan Melancon, CRCL's government affairs director, said in a statement.",
            "Years into home insurance crisis, when will Louisiana residents get relief?. While Louisiana lawmakers debated auto insurance this spring during their legislative session, sky-high home insurance premiums continued to crush residents along the state\u2019s coast.\nHomeowners insurance rates keep rising, forcing some residents out of their homes, while the state waits for the free market to look more favorably on Louisiana.\nSo far, the approach has not led to lower rates for most homeowners in the state. Many saw their insurance premiums climb to unaffordable levels after a series of hurricanes in 2020 and 2021 upended the market.\nHome insurance rates rose by 16% in 2022 and by 14% in 2023, on average, according to data from the Louisiana Department of Insurance. A dozen insurers went belly up.\nLast year, homeowners insurance rates rose by 6.6%, on average.\nAnd so far this year, rates are up 1.2%. If the trend holds through the end of the year, it would be the smallest jump since 2018, according to state data.\nNot everyone is seeing relief. In May, an insurance group for teachers raised rates by an average of 6%, according to rate filing data. A month earlier, two insurers from another group raised rates by 12.5%. A handful of insurers cut rates by varying levels, from 2% to 11%.\nState lawmakers made a few attempts to scale back those increases by passing legislation this spring that strengthens incentives and grants for homeowners who put fortified roofs on their homes. The changes to the law come as Louisiana has reentered hurricane season, and storms have grown more extreme from climate change.\nInsurance Commissioner Tim Temple touted several bills he supported that became law, including on fortified roofs, giving customers more notice when their policy is canceled and requiring parishes to permit and inspect new roofs. Temple also supported several bills that didn\u2019t pass, including proposals to set up deductible savings accounts and requiring coastal areas to mandate fortified roofs.\nTemple said it\u2019s too soon to know whether the new laws will affect rates, but said many of the proposals will \u201cbring competition, reduce risk, increase insurability and support consumers.\u201d\n\u201cI am encouraged by the early positive trends we are seeing, like insurers filing fewer, less costly rate increases, and even beginning to file more rate decreases than in recent years,\u201d Temple said in a statement.\nPolitical fight\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature sidelined bills that would have taken a more direct approach to the crisis, including proposals to give homeowners tax breaks to offset weighty premiums and requiring insurers to deliver certain discounts to residents who put stronger roofs on their homes.\nInstead, they largely continued to embrace Temple\u2019s favored free-market approach. He has embraced policies that loosen rules on insurers, making it easier for them to drop policyholders and charge customers as they see fit.\nThe Legislature did pass bills that set up a dedicated source of funding for the state\u2019s fortified roof grant program, though only a fraction of homeowners who apply will be able to benefit from it. The program gives homeowners $10,000 to put stronger roofs on their homes, and many have reported significant savings on insurance after installing them.\nAnd Gov. Jeff Landry recently signed a bill by State Sen. Kirk Talbot, R-River Ridge, to give people a $10,000 tax credit if they put fortified roofs on outside the grant program. The credit must be used against tax liability \u2014 it\u2019s not a check \u2014 and it is capped at about 1,000 people per year on a first-come, first-served basis. That means people who file their taxes earlier will be first in line.\nTalbot said he\u2019s telling constituents to shop their insurance quote to try to find a better rate, and to put a stronger roof on if they can afford it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to deal with things we can control,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cWe obviously can\u2019t control storms and all that, but we can control these other things.\u201d\nLandry was front and center on the car insurance debate that took up most of the oxygen in the Capitol this spring, and sparred publicly with Temple over high auto insurance rates. But he has not championed a package of bills so far focused on the rising cost of homeowners insurance.\nOne bill he supported, HB148 by Rep. Jeff Wiley, R-Maurepas, gives Temple more power to reject rates for home and car insurance that he deems \u201cexcessive.\u201d But Temple has all but vowed not to use the authority, saying it would upend the market by arbitrarily setting rates. It\u2019s unlikely to have any immediate impact on lowering rates.\nIn a statement Friday, Temple railed against the bill as a \u201cred flag,\u201d saying it destabilizes the market by \u201cgiving one politician the power to reject rate changes without clear rules or reasons.\u201d He said he\u2019s meeting with a \u201cmajor national insurer\u201d next week to talk about how it will impact the company\u2019s operations in Louisiana.\nLandry\u2019s spokesperson, Kate Kelly, touted the governor\u2019s signing of bills to strengthen the fortified roof program and said the state can reduce homeowner\u2019s insurance costs through \u201cother structural improvement programs that have already proven effective in coastal states.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond to further queries about those programs.\n\u201cThe governor continues to engage directly with insurance companies to discuss other avenues that can bring relief to Louisianans,\" Kelly said in a statement.\nState Rep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, was less optimistic. He said the Legislature did nothing to reduce home insurance costs this session, saying members were sidetracked by the yearslong fight between trial attorneys and insurers over \u201ctort reform,\u201d or changing the legal system to help insurers avoid big payouts when sued.\n\u201cThe best you should expect is for the rate to stabilize and not go up,\u201d Willard said. \u201cThat\u2019s just me being honest. I have no indication to tell people otherwise. I\u2019m not going to sell them false hope. The state has done that for long enough.\u201d\nGlobal business\nIn January, the reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter published an obscure but crucial statistic: The cost of reinsurance was expected to drop by 6.6% this year.\nInsurers take premium dollars from homeowners and promise to pay if they have a covered loss. But they don\u2019t keep all that risk. Instead, they spend billions of dollars buying their own form of protection \u2014 reinsurance \u2014 from a more loosely regulated network of companies around the world, many based in Bermuda.\nAfter 2017 wildfires in California caused billions in damages, reinsurance costs soared for seven straight years. Those effects reached insurance companies in Louisiana, who faced huge cost hikes and passed them along to homeowners in the form of higher premiums. Many rely heavily on reinsurance because they are smaller, and have less money than giants like State Farm.\nRising reinsurance is a big reason Louisianans have seen rates rise. And the projected drop this year could be good news.\nThe drop is likely the result of investors flooding the reinsurance market to take advantage of massive profits tied to the years of cost increases by reinsurers. A recent report by Howden Re, a reinsurance adviser, said insurers were finally able to take advantage of competition in the market this year.\n\u201cRate levels remain historically high but are now outpacing loss trends in many areas,\u201d wrote Kyle Menendez, managing director of Howden Re, North America, in a recent report.\nThe dynamic with reinsurance also underscores a hard truth for Louisiana: Even if state lawmakers make a host of changes, the global insurance industry could be upended by a storm in Miami or wildfire in California, like happened earlier this year.\nLate in Louisiana\u2019s legislative session, more than 30 lawmakers of both parties signed onto a resolution by Willard, the New Orleans Democrat, urging Congress to step in and provide solutions. Some insurance advocates and members of Congress have pushed for a federal intervention into the reinsurance market, which they say could stabilize costs for homeowners amid increasingly devastating natural disasters.\nWillard\u2019s resolution doesn\u2019t have the force of law, but he said he hopes it will encourage federal lawmakers to \u201cstep in and provide some relief.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a precarious situation where our rates are affected by any natural disaster that happens across the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that, I think it\u2019s worth Congress at least exploring some type of national program.\u201d\nEditor's note: This story has been updated the correct rate increase for an insurance group for teachers. The rate increase was 6%, not 14%. The Times-Picayune regrets the error.",
            "This Louisiana lawyer is suing Big Oil for billions. But don't call him a tree hugger.. John Carmouche isn\u2019t who you think he is.\nThe Baton Rouge lawyer, who just won a $745 million verdict against Chevron for damaging wetlands, is taking on Big Oil in Louisiana and winning. But he\u2019s no tree hugger. Nor, he says, a headline-chasing trial lawyer.\nThrough three governors\u2019 administrations, he and his firm have navigated political headwinds to keep their lawsuits against oil companies alive. Carmouche has helped quash bills and candidacies that would have threatened his efforts. While his work seeks to make oil companies pay billions for damage they\u2019ve done to the environment, he insists he wants the oil industry to thrive in Louisiana, as long as it doesn\u2019t leave behind a mess.\n\u201cI have a Democrat\u2019s heart but I\u2019m a Republican, because I understand business,\u201d Carmouche said, seated at a conference table in his Baton Rouge office, a mosaic of photos of the Louisiana marsh on the wall behind him. \u201cWe want the state to thrive. We\u2019re tired of our kids leaving. To bring this state back, we have to take away the oil companies\u2019 liability.\u201d\nThat means suing them, and getting them to pay for the damage they\u2019ve done to the coast, he says.\nNot quite Republican nor Democrat. Neither fully pro-industry nor environmentalist. In Louisiana, taking on oil companies doesn\u2019t just take legal know-how. Carmouche is walking a political tightrope.\nHe\u2019s about as far from a Birkenstock-wearing environmentalist as anyone could be. He\u2019s built like a small tank with a fitted suit and a Panerai wristwatch. During the recent trial in Plaquemines, he carried a plastic can of Zyn, the trendy nicotine pouches popularized by conservative social media influencers.\n\u201cThey're very skilled politically. And they're very skilled in the courtroom,\u201d John Barry, the Tulane historian and author who led an unsuccessful effort to sue oil companies over coastal damage, said of Carmouche and his law partners. \u201cThey've gone through hell to get where they are.\u201d\nCarmouche, 57, and his firm have been suing oil companies for decades. But the April verdict in Plaquemines Parish, a historic win against the oil and gas industry, marks the beginning of a new phase of his fight.\n\u201cThis is one of the largest verdicts ever won by a local government for environmental damage \u2014 not only in the United States, but globally,\u201d Michael Gerrard, the founder of Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said after the verdict. \u201cI'm sure the oil companies will vigorously pursue all possible appeals, unless some kind of master settlement is reached first.\u201d\nIndeed, Carmouche and his team expected oil companies to come to the table to open settlement negotiations after the trial in Plaquemines. That didn\u2019t happen.\nLast week, it became clear why. They were waiting to hear from the Supreme Court, which announced it would hear an argument from the oil companies about whether Carmouche\u2019s lawsuits, and perhaps others like them around the U.S., belong in state or federal court. The companies argue that some of the oil production in question took place under directives from the federal government during World War II, which would justify moving the cases to federal court.\nThat also means the $745 million verdict \u2014 and any payday for Carmouche \u2014 is up in the air.\nDelays, attorneys argued, are part of Chevron\u2019s strategy.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t pay until they have to pay,\u201d said Billy Goodell, a private attorney who was previously a Louisiana assistant attorney general for environmental enforcement. \u201cCarmouche is making them pay.\u201d\nThe oil companies see it differently. They feel that they're being blamed for land loss that should be attributed to the levees along the Mississippi, which have starved coastal wetlands of sediment. Climate change-driven sea level rise has also played a role, they admit.\nBeyond that, they say such lawsuits threaten to put a chokehold on the industry in Louisiana, hurting employment and energy production in the process. The companies point out, too, that some of the operations in question occurred before a law they are accused of violating took effect in 1980.\n\"It\u2019s time to stop incentivizing trial lawyers to pick industry\u2019s pockets and start protecting the future of both our state and the 306,750 people working in and alongside the oil and natural gas industry here every day \u2014 because in Louisiana, they\u2019re one and the same,\" Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association, said in a statement this month.\n\u2018Friends along the coast\u2019\nThe story of the Carmouche practice starts with his father, Don, who has been practicing since 1966. Does he plan to retire? \u201cNo way,\u201d he said.\nJohn argues the cases now \u2014 it\u2019s a young man\u2019s game, Don said \u2014 but the 84-year-old looks sharp enough to have prosecuted the Plaquemines case himself.\nThe elder Carmouche served as district attorney in the 23rd Judicial District, which covers Ascension, Assumption and St. James parishes, between 1985 and 1990, when he lost his bid for reelection.\n\u201cThank God he lost,\u201d his law partner, Vic Marcello, recalls. \u201cWe had to make money.\u201d\nThey did just that. Their focus shifted to personal injury work. But Don\u2019s political connections would prove crucial as they turned to environmental litigation.\nThe firm\u2019s coastal lawsuits, the first of which were filed in 2013, evolved out of what are often called \u201clegacy lawsuits,\u201d cases brought by private landowners against oil companies for pollution done decades ago. But Carmouche\u2019s approach is distinct.\nThe strategy involves going after major oil companies for failing to abide by state coastal use laws that went into effect in 1980. They went about identifying sites across the coastal zone where major oil companies \u2014 Shell, Exxon, Chevron, and the like \u2014 once produced oil. Since then, many of the large companies have sold their Louisiana wells to smaller firms.\nHis coastal litigation focuses on holding the companies that drilled the wells and profited off of them the most accountable. That also allows Carmouche to go after the companies with the deepest pockets.\nRather than representing private landowners, as the Carmouches do in the legacy suits, they represent parishes. To convince coastal parishes to sign on, they leaned on the political connections Don forged as district attorney.\n\u201cI had a lot of friends along the coast that I\u2019ve known in my 60 years of being a lawyer,\u201d the elder Carmouche said. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t difficult for any elected official along the coast to clearly see that something should be done, and the state and the parishes just don\u2019t have the funds to do it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why shouldn\u2019t those companies that destroyed it pay for it? It really wasn\u2019t a difficult sell. They embraced it,\u201d he said.\nJohn stepped in to correct the record: \u201cNot all of them,\u201d he said.\nIndeed, Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, two of the largest coastal parishes that historically produced a huge amount of oil, have not joined the lawsuits, even though they would be entitled to funds that result from litigation in the other coastal parishes. The Lafourche Parish Council even passed a resolution this month opposing the litigation. In Plaquemines, which did join the litigation, there was local pushback, fueled by a campaign funded by oil companies.\n\u201cThe pressure placed on parish officials to sue the largest industries in their parishes is unrelenting and daily,\u201d said Marc Ehrhardt, the executive director for GROW Louisiana, an oil and gas industry advocacy group.\nCarmouche does make a strong case to politicians. He has self-funded polls, he said, which indicate that 88% of Louisiana voters think the industry should pay to repair damage to the coast \u2014 up from 70% a decade ago.\nThe pitch to elected officials isn\u2019t subtle: Carmouche believes that if they support his cause, they\u2019ll get reelected.\nDifferent governors, same game\nIn 2013, when the lawsuits were first filed, Gov. Bobby Jindal was running Louisiana. Carmouche dodged his ire.\n\u201cWe were getting ready to file these coastal lawsuits when the levee district filed their lawsuit,\u201d Carmouche said, referring to the lawsuit that the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East filed in 2013.\nCarmouche would file 42 separate lawsuits related to locations that he alleged were damaged by oil and gas production by specific companies. The flood protection authority would file a single suit, against about 100 companies, alleging broad damage to the Louisiana coast.\nThat caught Jindal\u2019s attention \u2014 and drew it away from Carmouche. \u201cIt took his eyes off of the true coastal claim and allowed our lawsuits to move forward,\u201d Carmouche said. \u201cThey took the bullet.\u201d\nThe flood protection authority\u2019s litigation would be struck down by a federal appeals court. Carmouche\u2019s cases continued on.\nIn 2015, at the end of Jindal\u2019s term, they didn\u2019t wait for the next governor to be elected before moving to ensure that his successor would support their lawsuits. They spent $2 million to fight David Vitter, a Republican U.S. senator at the time.\n\u201cWhen Vitter announced he was going to run, the first thing he said was \u2014 \u2018I\u2019m going to get rid of legacy lawsuits,'\u201d Marcello said.\n\u201cThey gave us no choice,\u201d Carmouche said. \u201cThey kind of put a gun to our head.\u201d\nJohn Bel Edwards, a Democrat, won the election. The lawsuits continued.\nDuring Edwards\u2019 term, Republican Attorney General \u2014 and current governor \u2014 Jeff Landry threatened to take over the lawsuits. He would have boxed out Carmouche, installing state lawyers in the cases. Had that happened, Carmouche would not have earned legal fees.\nIt didn\u2019t happen, and the state ultimately intervened on Carmouche's side.\nCarmouche also worked to win over the future governor. He cut Landry\u2019s campaign large checks in 2023; last year, Landry appointed Carmouche to the LSU board of supervisors, a plum gig that comes with free season tickets to sit in the board suite at all LSU football games.\nLandry has spoken of wanting to reduce the number of such lawsuits through negotiated settlements, \"where everyone works together to protect our coastal communities.\"\nIn many ways, the oil and gas industry has pursued similar political strategies.\nIt has had to work with vastly different presidents over the last decade, said Faucheux of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association. And the industry has also made substantial political donations in Louisiana over the same time period. Landry tapped Faucheux\u2019s predecessor, Tyler Gray, to run the Department of Energy and Natural Resources.\n\u201cBy going to small communities in Louisiana and promising them billions, they\u2019ve been able to keep communities motivated,\u201d Faucheux said of Carmouche's lawsuits. \u201cThat, in turn, keeps policymakers, even at the statewide level, motivated.\u201d\nBut what, ultimately, motivates Carmouche? He\u2019ll say he\u2019s not in it just for the money, though the money doesn\u2019t hurt. He says he\u2019s a sportsman and loves the outdoors, but that doesn't seem like the main thing.\nPerhaps the most convincing theory of what makes Carmouche tick is that he is legitimately fired up by a fight, and the oil industry is giving him one.\n\u201cIt took us 15 years fighting in court, filing motions to compel, finally getting the research they had going back to the 1940s,\u201d he said.\nHe describes himself as motivated by righteous anger, fueled by \u201cknowing what they knew, and how they went about destroying the coast, and how they got away with it.\u201d"

            "Sanitation Workers Demand Higher Wages as Trash Pickup Strikes Spread Nationwide. Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.\nA local sanitation workers strike that began on July 1 in Boston, Massachusetts, and left trash unpicked across the city is now spreading nationwide in a series of labor actions coordinated by the Teamsters union as frustrated workers demand better pay and benefits from Republic Services, a major waste disposal company.\nThe Teamsters said in an email on Friday that about 550 sanitation workers were on strike in multiple cities while 1,600 others refused to cross picket line extensions in solidarity with the strikers at local Republic Services sites in Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois, Washington State, and California. For example, workers in the Bay Area launched a temporary trash pickup stoppage this week in solidarity with fellow workers striking over negotiations with Republic Services for better pay at a regional landfill near Stockton.\n\u201cRepublic Services has been threatening a war with American workers for years \u2014 and now, they\u2019ve got one,\u201d said Teamsters General President Sean M. O\u2019Brien in a statement on Wednesday.\nNever miss another story\nGet the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.\nWhile trash collection has resumed in some Boston residential neighborhoods, trash bags continued to pile up this week outside businesses and in dumpsters as sanitation workers demand higher wages, better benefits, and paid time off, according to local reports. The Boston City Council voted unanimously on July 9 to support the workers in their strike, which council members said was both a labor issue and a public health issue.\nIn a statement to local media this week, Teamsters Local 25 in Boston told Republic Services on July 3 that it was prepared to extend the picket line to other cities if the company failed to begin contract negotiations with the union by July 7, but the company did not meet the deadline. Republic Services is a private contractor in charge of waste pickup and disposal in cities across the country, and work stoppages spread coast to coast this week after Local 25 extended the picket line to job sites beyond Boston.\nRepublic Services did not respond to a request for comment from Truthout by the time this story was published. In a statement to local media in Boston, the company said it stands ready to meet with the Teamsters Local 25 \u201cwhen they are ready to re-engage.\u201d\n\u201cWe will continue to focus on providing service and doing right by our employees,\u201d Republic Services said. \u201cWe call on Teamsters\u2019 leadership to immediately stop the instigation, intimidation, and criminal acts, and resolve this situation.\u201d\nThe right to join a union and go on strike is protected by federal labor law, so it\u2019s unclear what \u201ccriminal acts\u201d Republic Services could be referring to in its response to Local 25 in Boston. Raising the specter of criminal prosecution may itself be an intimidation tactic. O\u2019Brien said the Teamsters are not backing down because Republic Services \u201cabuses and underpays\u201d sanitation workers serving communities across the country.\n\u201cThey burn massive profits and funnel money to undeserving, corrupt executives,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThe Teamsters have had it with Republic. We will flood the streets and shut down garbage collection in state after state. Workers are uniting nationwide, and we will get the wages and benefits we\u2019ve earned, come hell or high water.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Teamsters union says Republic Services has refused to bargain in good faith and settle fair labor contracts with sanitation workers despite months of negotiations in cities around the country. Instead, the company has resorted to \u201cunion-busting tactics\u201d and \u201cillegal threats\u201d in order to provoke a nationwide strike. Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said Republic Services is one of the most \u201cdepraved employers we\u2019ve ever come across.\u201d\n\u201cRepublic has lied, stalled, and broken the law to try to squeeze every last dime out of workers. But these corporate thieves have underestimated our members,\u201d Zuckerman said in a statement on July 9.\nThe war of words comes as work stoppages spread, potentially delaying trash pickup for millions of people. However, Zuckerman said the Teamsters will not give up until they receive a fair contract from Republic Services.\n\u201cTo the millions of Americans seeing their trash pile up because of Republic\u2019s strike, remember one thing: this corporation has hauled in $77 billion,\u201d said Victor Mineros, director of the Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division, in a statement. \u201cRepublic can easily afford a fair and competitive contract that meets the needs of everyday hardworking Americans.\u201d\nWhile Truthout was unable to verify that Republic Services has brought in $77 billion in revenue, an earnings statement released to investors shows the company had a net income of $2 billion in 2024. Republic Services reported revenue growth at 5.6 percent over the three months ending in December 2024, and the company returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders last year.\nAdan Alvarez, a waste management worker in southern California, said his local Teamsters union is not technically on strike against Republic Services. Instead, their union contract allows workers to refuse crossing a picket line, and workers in southern California announced a work stoppage after Local 25 in Boston extended its picket line this week.

The company must bargain in good faith,\u201d Mineros said.\nMeanwhile, after more than a week of work stoppage, an unrelated trash pickup and city services strike in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, came to an end after eight days in the early hours of Wednesday morning after members of the local American Federation of State, Council and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union reached a tentative finalized a contract with city officials. However, rank- and- file workers still need to approve the contract, and some union leaders left the final negotiations in frustration.\nThe deal includes a one-time $1,500 bonus and a 3 percent annual wage increase for three years, for a total of 9 percent by 2028, according to reports. Union leaders pushed for a 5 percent annual wage increase after originally proposing an 8 percent annual increase.

I\u2019m Amy Goodman.\nGet our free emails\nThe largest municipal workers\u2019 strike in decades in the city of Philadelphia has ended. Eight days ago, the 9,000 members of AFSCME District Council 33, who are primarily sanitation workers, walked off the job. Growing piles of trash on the streets of Philly brought the strike into clear view for city residents. The average sanitation worker salary in Philadelphia is currently $46,000 a year, which the union has argued is not a living wage for workers required to live within the city limits. DC 33 President Greg Boulware spoke last week.\nGREG BOULWARE: This is about trying to get these working people here, who service the city every day, an adequate raise that actually meets the demands that are required to live inside of the city. That\u2019s all this is about. It\u2019s not about personal things. It\u2019s not about any of the other things. It\u2019s about these members. These members are citizens, first and foremost, of Philadelphia, and they service every aspect across the city and can\u2019t afford themselves to have any decent quality of life inside the city. There\u2019s something wrong with that, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here, to try to make that change.\nAMY GOODMAN: The union also represents 911 dispatchers, water service workers, crossing guards, other city workers. Some of the workers, like the 911 dispatchers, have already been ordered back to work by the court. Support for the workers came from inside and outside Philly. These are two city residents.\nPHILADELPHIA RESIDENT 1: Pay these people what they worth. You know what I mean? They\u2019re not worth these pennies y\u2019all are paying them. That\u2019s my views on the strike.\nPHILADELPHIA RESIDENT 2: This city is very proud to be blue-collar and hard-working and trade and all that type of pro-union. So, for the people of Philadelphia, you know, if \u2014 it sucks that this is what we have to do, but if this is how we got to support, you know, us, this is what we\u2019ve got to do.\nAMY GOODMAN: Rapper LL Cool J and singer Jazmine Sullivan refused to cross the picket line last week and perform at the July 4th WAWA Welcome America Festival. This is rapper LL Cool J\u2019s statement to his over 3 million followers on Instagram.\nLL COOL J: I understand there\u2019s a lot going on in Philadelphia right now. And, you know, I never, ever, ever want to disappoint my fans, and especially in Philadelphia. Y\u2019all mean too much to me. But there\u2019s absolutely no way that I could perform, cross a picket line and pick up money, when I know that people are out there fighting for a living wage. I\u2019m not doing that.\nAMY GOODMAN: And at least three activists with the Philadelphia chapter of the Sunrise Movement were arrested Monday for participating in a peaceful sit-in protest dumping trash at City Hall in solidarity with the striking workers.\nREPORTER: Why are you here?\nSUNRISE MOVEMENT PROTESTER: Our workers deserve dignity! Cherelle, pay your workers! Meet DC 33\u2019s demands!\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, negotiations between the union and Philadelphia ended early this morning at 4 a.m. More details are expected later today.\nFor more on the historic strike and what led to it, we\u2019re joined by labor historian Francis Ryan, associate professor at Rutgers University, director of Rutgers\u2019 Master of Labor and Employment Relations program. He\u2019s author of the book AFSCME\u2019s Philadelphia Story: Municipal Workers and Urban Power in the Twentieth Century.\nThis is the first major sanitation strike in a generation, Professor Ryan. You know, I can\u2019t help think back to Memphis 1968, where Dr. Martin Luther King died in the midst of a sanitation workers\u2019 strike, with the signs that the sanitation workers carried, \u201cI am a man.\u201d Professor Ryan, the significance of this strike and it ending today, apparently?\nFRANCIS RYAN: Yes, this is the first municipal strike in a generation. And I think the significance of this particular moment is the role that social media has played. I really think that the union won the public relations battle over the past week. And I think this goes back to the pandemic, that the narrative of the essential worker has become so much a part of how especially the younger generation thinks. And it\u2019s clear that, through social media, that there is such wealth disparity in this country, and it is so obvious. And I think that your average Philadelphia citizen, in ways that I don\u2019t think has been done since 1938, when the union was founded, have come out and supported the strikers.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, talk about the history of the sanitation workers, how they compare to the police, to the firefighters in Philadelphia.\nFRANCIS RYAN: Yes. The union was originally founded back in 1938 and reached their first contract in 1939. It was the first city in the nation to recognize AFSCME as their exclusive bargaining agent. And what I think makes this union so historically significant is that it\u2019s the most powerful interracial union in the city\u2019s history, and it has been able to bridge neighborhoods together, bridge the various sectors within the public workforce, and really make them a force in city politics. And I think, over the years, in my own study of it, what\u2019s clear is that the union has been able to make significant gains in the lives of their members.\nAnd I think that what this strike shows is that the wages that the sanitation workers and crossing guards and water department workers are making is not keeping up with the \u2014 with the cost of living. And I think that there is just such frustration on the part of the members, that it led them to walk over the past eight days. And I think that this is a significant moment in its history, because what I saw on the picket lines last week was kind of a spark of social justice unionism, that \u2014 you mentioned Dr. King in Memphis in 1968 \u2014 I think is the most iconic example of that kind of social justice. And by that, I mean a trade union movement that\u2019s connected to the neighborhoods and to the community centers and to the churches and to students and to all members of the working class, not just members of the particular union. So, I see that as an undercurrent of what happened this past week. And I think that the union, and maybe, hopefully, the entire labor movement in the region, will develop and build on that.\nAMY GOODMAN: You talk about social justice, and particularly racial justice. Can you talk about the early representation for Black workers in Philadelphia?\nFRANCIS RYAN: Yes. There\u2019s a reason why so many of the sanitation workers and first-line workers, let\u2019s say, in sewage treatment have been African Americans. And that is because in Philadelphia the hiring gate excluded Black men and women from working, let\u2019s say, in the textile industries, in other large industries. So, the one employer that was really open to so many Black workers in Philadelphia was the municipal government. And they took these blue-collar jobs and built lives that way. So, the fact that the union represents these workers historically, you know, it shows the racial dynamics of how the economy has worked, and continues to work, across the country, and certainly in Philadelphia.\nAMY GOODMAN: And finally, what do you see coming next? I mean, we just got the rumblings of the end of the deal \u2014 the end of the strike this morning at 4:00. There hasn\u2019t even been a news conference yet. Francis Ryan?\nFRANCIS RYAN: Right, right. I think that what the union leadership will be doing is they need to convince their members that the contract is the best one that they can get. And it\u2019s the union members themselves, over the next few days, that will vote upon this contract, and it\u2019s really in their hands. So, like every other citizen in the city, we\u2019re waiting to see what the union members do. And I know that the hearts of a lot of Philadelphians are with these workers as they return back to work today.\nAMY GOODMAN: Francis Ryan, labor historian, associate professor at Rutgers University, author of AFSCME\u2019s Philadelphia Story: Municipal Workers and Urban Power in the Twentieth Century.\nYou can go to democracynow.org to see our full-time job offerings for multiple positions, democracynow.org/jobs.

            "Why people who borrowed $1 million-plus are more likely to fall behind. Why people who borrowed $1 million-plus are more likely to fall behind\nBy Alice Uribe\nHome borrowers who took out supersized home loans and were hit with successive interest rate hikes over recent years are falling into arrears at a greater rate than those with comparatively smaller or older loans.\nFor mortgages over $1 million, 0.4 per cent of these were in late-stage arrears, or more than 90 days past due, at the end of June, according to credit data company Equifax. This is up from 0.29 per cent at the same time in 2024.\nDepending on when the loans were initiated, borrowers may have enjoyed interest rate cuts in February and May. But they may also have experienced 13 hikes, from rock-bottom levels during the pandemic, substantially increasing repayments over time.\nThis comes as the Reserve Bank on Tuesday cut the cash rate by 25 basis points, its third cut this year, to 3.6 per cent \u2013 its lowest in more than two years. This could provide some relief in the form of lower mortgage repayments, but may also push up house prices, experts say.\nKevin James, chief solutions officer at Equifax, said larger home loans were \u201cmore challenged.\u201d The data covers almost all owner-occupier and investor loans taken out in Australia.\n\u201cMortgages, in general, arrears are going up a bit, but certainly those that are a million-plus are the ones that we are actually seeing are pulling away from the others,\u201d he said.\nWhile 90-plus day arrears for smaller home loans also rose over the year to June, they haven\u2019t grown as much as larger loans. For those loans classed as small by Equifax, less than $750,000, 90-plus day arrears rose from 0.34 per cent to 0.38 per cent over the year to June.\nArrears for medium-sized loans, of $750,000 to $999,000, jumped from 0.26 per cent to 0.34 per cent for the same period.\nThe RBA\u2019s latest Financial Stability Review found the \u201cvast majority\u201d of borrowers are on schedule, but highly leveraged borrowers were \u201csignificantly more likely to fall into arrears, and a higher share of these borrowers are currently in arrears compared with the pre-pandemic period.\u201d\nMortgage brokers say to be approved for a loan of $1 million or over, a buyer would be likely to need a household income of about $250,000, depending on circumstances. PRD Real Estate chief economist Dr Diaswati Mardiasmo said $1 million loans were becoming more of \u201cthe norm,\u201d particularly in cities like Sydney with its median house price above $1.7 million.\nErin Kitson, a director at S&P Global Ratings, speaking generally about arrears trends, said debt to income levels can often be a forward indicator of where arrears pressures may appear, alongside having savings buffers or other income streams, with investors often having a better ability to repay than recent owner-occupiers.\n\u201cIf people are coming in at a very high point in the property market where interest rates are still quite high and you\u2019ve had to take on a lot of debt, relative to your income, to service that, that\u2019s going to make you more predisposed to arrears,\u201d she said.\nAtelier Wealth managing director Aaron Christie-David said job loss could have an impact, particularly among high-income earners.\n\u201cTheir biggest concern is losing a job and being able to manage their mortgage,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got kids in private schools, they\u2019ve got leased vehicles, for example \u2026 It makes it very hard to roll back their lifestyle when they\u2019ve committed to a certain way of living.\u201d\nThe time of borrowing may also affect the potential for late-stage arrears, particularly for those who bought pre-rate hikes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the size of the loan,\u201d said Mardiasmo. \u201cBecause, depending on the timeline, that will really impact what your monthly mortgage repayments are.\u201d\nAcross the mortgages valued at $1 million-plus reviewed by Equifax, some that were taken out in the last half of 2022, when rates were lower and affordability was higher, were more challenged now compared to older loans, James said.\n\u201cOver a period of time, rates have gone up, potentially savings have started to dwindle a bit,\u201d he noted.\nAnthony Landahl, managing director and mortgage broker at Equilibria Finance, said some who borrowed in recent years may have eaten into their cash buffers, due to the rate hikes.\n\u201cWhile those rising rates are now coming down, monthly repayments through that period of rising rates for some borrowers with large mortgages were going up by a few thousand per month, which is a massive impact,\u201d he said.\nRepayments also spiked for households who rolled off fixed rates to variable.\n\u201cA lot of our clients and a lot of people came off those two- and three-year very low fixed rates over the last 12 months, and for those with a higher loan, in some cases repayments were going up three or four thousand dollars a month,\u201d Landahl said.",
            "Lehman Brothers: When the financial crisis spun out of control. Editor\u2019s Note: This story originally published on September 14, 2018.\nLegendary investment bank Lehman Brothers was on fire \u2014 and no one was coming to put it out.\nBank of America refused to rescue the 158-year-old Wall Street firm without support from Uncle Sam. The British government wouldn\u2019t let Barclays (BCS) buy Lehman Brothers and its toxic balance sheet. And Washington decided against another politically unpopular bailout.\nSo Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. At 1:45 a.m. on Monday, September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nWhat ensued was the largest and most complex bankruptcy in American history. But that doesn\u2019t do justice to the damage Lehman\u2019s demise caused the financial system. The implosion of Lehman Brothers \u2014 and the mayhem it unleashed \u2014 was the most terrifying moment for business and the US economy since the Great Depression.\n\u201cIt was the moment when the financial crisis fully burst upon us, when panic seized the markets,\u201d Phil Angelides, who led the official bipartisan inquiry into the 2008 meltdown, told CNN.\nLehman\u2019s failure shook Wall Street to its core. The Dow plummeted 504 points, the equivalent of 1,300 points today. Some $700 billion vanished from retirement plans and other investment funds. The panic that followed plunged the American economy into a severe downturn, now known as the Great Recession.\nToday, Lehman Brothers and its CEO Dick Fuld are the poster children for the reckless risk-taking that wrecked the economy.\nFrantic talks\nLehman\u2019s final days were marked by frantic last-minute negotiations over its fate.\nRight up until the end, everyone thought someone would rescue Lehman Brothers: Surely the firm wouldn\u2019t be allowed to fail. Bear Stearns, a smaller investment bank, had been saved just six months earlier by Washington and JPMorgan Chase.\nOn Wednesday, September 10, South Korea\u2019s Korean Development Bank dropped out of the running to be Lehman Brothers\u2019 white knight. The news \u2014 combined with Lehman\u2019s announcement of a record $3.9 billion quarterly loss \u2014 sent the bank\u2019s shares cratering 45%.\nWith South Korea out, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson called Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis to ask him to find a creative way to buy Lehman Brothers. Put on your \u201cimagination hat,\u201d Paulson urged Lewis.\nBut by Friday, September 12, Bank of America said it was bowing out unless the government was willing to help. Lehman was simply stuck with too many \u201cilliquid\u201d mortgage assets, and it couldn\u2019t sell them quickly enough to meet other obligations. Bank of America decided instead to buy the next investment bank in line to fail: Merrill Lynch.\n\u201cYou just didn\u2019t know what was going to happen when you got into work on Monday,\u201d said Brady Kim, who worked as an analyst on Lehman\u2019s trading desk. \u201cWere you going to be working for Barclays? Some Korean conglomerate?\u201d\nThe one option few saw coming was bankruptcy. \u201cThey\u2019re not just going to let the bank go under,\u201d Kim said.\n\u2018Not a penny\u2019\nThat Friday evening, Paulson ordered the heads of the big Wall Street firms to meet at the New York Fed\u2019s headquarters. They were told to come up with a private-sector solution to save Lehman.\nAmerican officials had little appetite for another bailout. They had just seized control of teetering mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the weekend before. Fed officials said Paulson made it clear there would be no government help this time, \u201cnot a penny.\u201d\nSaturday brought an apparent breakthrough for Lehman: Barclays agreed to buy Lehman \u2014 as long as Wall Street would take some assets off its hands. But the Barclays deal went up in smoke on Sunday when UK regulators balked at blessing the risky deal.\n\u201cImagine if I said yes to a British bank buying a very large American bank which \u2026 collapsed the following week,\u201d Alistair Darling, the UK\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer, later told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.\n\u2018It was pandemonium up there\u2019\nWith no buyers left, regulators pressured Lehman Brothers to file for bankruptcy on Sunday night, before trading opened in the morning.\nLehman\u2019s lawyers and executives left the New York Fed to inform the board that no rescue was coming.\n\u201cWe went back to the headquarters, and it was pandemonium up there,\u201d Harvey Miller, the bankruptcy counselor for Lehman Brothers, later told investigators.\nThe Fed rejected a last-minute Lehman plea for additional assistance from the central bank, leading to the early-morning bankruptcy.\nThe collapse shocked employees.\n\u201cI never thought the company would go out of business. It was terrible,\u201d said James Chico, who worked as an analyst in the back office at Lehman for more than two decades.\nTom Rogers was on his honeymoon in St. Lucia when the bank, his employer for seven years, went bust.\n\u201cI came back, and it was just mass chaos,\u201d said Rogers, who started as an intern at Lehman and moved up to senior analyst in the firm\u2019s reinsurance business.\n\u2018Cataclysmic proportions\u2019\nThe turmoil showed just how fragile and interconnected the entire system was. The situation was exacerbated by the near-collapse of AIG, the insurance behemoth. Regulators feared AIG\u2019s demise would bring down the whole system \u2014 so AIG was given a $182 billion bailout.\nFear and panic quickly spread through the financial system, causing credit markets to freeze. Even large and iconic industrial companies such as General Motors were unable to receive short-term funding.\n\u201cThe financial crisis reached cataclysmic proportions with the collapse of Lehman Brothers,\u201d the crisis inquiry commission concluded.\nFuld, who had infamously told shareholders in April 2008 that \u201cthe worst is behind us,\u201d emerged as one of the villains of the crisis. He steered Lehman right into the face of an epic storm.\nBetween 2000 and 2007, Lehman\u2019s assets had more than tripled to $691 billion. And its borrowing ratio, known as leverage, jumped to 40 times its shareholders\u2019 equity in the company. The firm had relatively little capital to protect against trouble.\nMadelyn Antoncic, Lehman\u2019s chief risk officer from 2004 to 2007, tried and failed to warn Fuld against taking on more mortgage risk.\n\u201cAt the senior level, they were trying to push so hard that the wheels started to come off,\u201d Antoncic told the commission.\nFor his part, Fuld told lawmakers in 2008 that the pain of Lehman\u2019s failure \u201cwill stay with me for the rest of my life.\u201d\nThe former Lehman Brothers boss, who made and lost a $1 billion fortune on Wall Street, has made few public appearances since the crisis. He did speak at a 2015 event where he admitted he would do some things differently.\n\u201cI missed the violence of the market and how it spread from one asset class to the next,\u201d Fuld said.\nWhere were the regulators?\nFuld doesn\u2019t deserve all the blame. The firm\u2019s demise underscored the wild risk-taking that regulators and CEOs had allowed to become rampant across Wall Street.\nConsider, for example, the 2000 deregulation of exotic financial instruments known as derivatives. Regulators had little window into how these trades linked banks to one another. When one bank failed, other financial institutions fell in a kind of domino effect.\nEven a month before Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy, officials at the Fed were still seeking information on the bank\u2019s 900,000 derivative contracts. And they were clueless about the risk posed by AIG\u2019s enormous book of derivatives.\n\u201cThe people charged with overseeing our financial system were flying blind as the crisis developed,\u201d Angelides said.\nOnly in 2010, with the passage of the sweeping Dodd-Frank financial reform law, were derivatives required to be bought and sold on exchanges.\nRegulators also failed to get Lehman Brothers to slow its headfirst dive into mortgages. The firm kept buying real estate assets well into the first quarter of 2008.\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Thrift Supervision didn\u2019t issue a report warning of Lehman\u2019s \u201coutsized bet\u201d on commercial real estate until two months before its collapse. The OTS was abolished by Dodd-Frank.\nLikewise, the SEC declined to call Lehman Brothers out for exceeding risk limits \u2014 even though the agency was aware.\n\u201cThe SEC\u2026knew of the firm\u2019s disregard of risk management,\u201d the commission said.\nLehman Brothers also got away with using accounting gimmicks to mask how much money it borrowed. Bart McDade, Lehman\u2019s president and chief operating officer, wrote in an email at the time that the accounting maneuvers are \u201canother drug we R on.\u201d\nShould Lehman have been saved?\nEconomists will debate for decades whether Washington should have rescued Lehman to prevent the chaos that followed. Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke maintains that regulators had no authority to lend to a failing Lehman.\n\u201cWe essentially had no choice and had to let it fail,\u201d Bernanke told the commission.\nBut others say Bernanke and Paulson should have realized that allowing Lehman to fail would deepen the crisis.\n\u201cOur regulatory system is made of humans \u2014 and humans make mistakes,\u201d said James Angel, a business professor at Georgetown University. \u201cThe Fed clearly could have done a better job of containing the damage.\u201d\nThe inconsistent response by Washington \u2014 deciding not to rescue Lehman after saving Bear and before helping AIG \u2014 \u201cadded to uncertainty and panic,\u201d the financial crisis inquiry concluded.\nCould it happen again?\nToday\u2019s financial system is safer thanks to the reforms put in place after 2008. Banks have bulked up on vast amounts of capital. Regulators are more vigilant.\nBut some worry about the risk of another downturn, even if it doesn\u2019t start with banks.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about now,\u201d said famed Yale professor Robert Schiller, pointing to \u201chighly priced\u201d stocks and rising home values.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already in for what could be a repeat of 2008,\u201d Shiller said. \u201cIt will look different this time, but there could be a decline in home prices and recession coming in.\u201d\nLet\u2019s hope the lessons from the last crisis haven\u2019t been forgotten.\nA Decade Later: It\u2019s been 10 years since the financial crisis rocked America\u2019s economy. In a special yearlong series, CNN will examine the causes of the crisis, how the country is still feeling its effects, and the lessons we have \u2014 and have not \u2014 learned.\nCNN\u2019s Julia Horowitz contributed to this report."

            "Genea-Musings. Memories of Abigail A. (Vaux) Smith\nAs told to my family in 1930, at age 86\nTell me about your childhood\nI was born on October 28th, 1844, in Aurora, Erie County, New York, the third child of six in our family. My dear father Samuel came from England with his parents as a young man - he carried with him stories of the old country and a determination to make something of himself in America. My mother Mary Ann Underhill was born right there in New York state, her family having deep roots in this country.\nWe were a bustling household with six children. My older sisters Mary Almeda and Celia Ann were my constant companions - Mary Almeda was five years older than me, born in 1839, and Celia Ann just two years my senior. Then came me, followed by my brother James in 1847, my sister Elizabeth in 1849, and finally little Amos in 1854. The house was never quiet with all of us children about!\nFather worked hard as a farmer and did well for himself - by 1850, he had accumulated $1,166 in real property, which was quite respectable for those times. I remember our farmhouse in Aurora, with its large kitchen where Mother would cook for our big family, and the fields where Father grew his crops. The seasons marked our lives - planting in spring, tending the crops through summer, harvest time when we all pitched in, and the quiet winter months when we'd gather around the fire in the evenings.\nSchool was a joy to me, even starting so young. I remember walking with Mary and Celia Ann to the little schoolhouse, my small hand in theirs, learning my letters and numbers. The teacher was strict but fair, and I took to reading like a duck to water. Mother always said I was the bookish one in the family. Even at age five, I was already sitting with the primer, sounding out words while my sisters helped me along.\nOur fun came in simple pleasures - picking berries in summer, sledding in winter, helping Mother with the cooking and learning to sew. I was fascinated watching Mother mend and make our clothes, and she taught me the fine art of needlework. Little did I know then how valuable those skills would become! We'd have corn huskings with the neighbors, barn raisings where the whole community came together, and church socials where we children would play games while the adults talked.\nBut the biggest adventure of my childhood came when I was about eleven. Father made the momentous decision to sell our New York farm and move us all the way to Wisconsin. The frontier was calling, with promises of cheaper land and greater opportunity. What an upheaval that was! I remember the wagon loaded with all our possessions, saying goodbye to everything familiar, and starting the long journey west to Burnett township in Dodge County, Wisconsin. The frontier was wilder than New York - more forests, fewer neighbors, and a sense that we were truly building something new.\nWhat occupations did you have?\nMy primary occupation, and the one I was proudest of, was being a wife and mother. But that doesn't tell the whole story of the work I did to help keep our family afloat through all those years of moving and uncertainty.\nI became skilled as a milliner - the art of making and trimming ladies' hats. This wasn't just simple sewing; it required an eye for fashion, knowledge of the latest styles, and the ability to work with delicate materials like silk, velvet, ribbons, and feathers. I learned to shape felt, to sew tiny stitches that wouldn't show, and to create confections that would make any lady feel beautiful when she wore them to church or social gatherings.\nDuring our time in Kansas in 1875, when we lived in Lincoln township in Cloud County, the census taker recorded me as a milliner with $340 in personal property from my hat-making business. That might not sound like much now, but it was a significant contribution to our household income. Devier was running a livery and sale stable then, and between his business and mine, we were making a decent living.\nI took great pride in my work. Ladies would come to me with specific requests - perhaps they'd seen a hat in a catalog from back East, or they needed something special for a wedding or funeral. I'd listen carefully to what they wanted, take their measurements, and create something beautiful just for them. Word spread, and soon I had regular customers who trusted me to keep them fashionable even out on the Kansas frontier.\nThe work was meticulous and required good light, so I'd often work by the window during the day, my fingers flying as I stitched. I taught both Della and Mary Ann some of these skills, though they both took more to music. Still, they learned to appreciate fine handwork and attention to detail.\nWhen we moved to Nebraska and Devier started the Blue Front livery stable in McCook, I continued my millinery work when I could, though keeping up with his various business ventures and managing our household kept me plenty busy. The income from my hat-making often meant the difference between getting by and having a little extra for necessities.\nWhat were the hardest challenges in your life?\nOh my dear ones, where do I begin? Life tested me in ways I never could have imagined as that young girl in New York.\nThe greatest heartbreak - one that still brings tears to my eyes even now - was losing two of my precious babies. Little Agnes Bell, our fourth child, was born on February 26th, 1868, in Rolling Prairie, Wisconsin. She was such a sweet baby, with the prettiest smile and the most trusting eyes. But when we moved to Bedford, Iowa, she took sick. Despite all our care and prayers, she died on April 23rd, 1870, when she was just two years and two months old. I can still remember holding her little body, so light it seemed she might float away, and the awful finality of laying her to rest in Bedford Cemetery.\nThen, as if losing Agnes hadn't broken my heart enough, we lost our youngest, Lucian H., whom we called \"Lutie.\" He was born June 16th, 1875, in Lincoln, Kansas - our little surprise baby when I thought my childbearing days were behind me. He was such a bright little fellow, always getting into mischief and making us laugh. But in March of 1878, when he was not quite three years old, he took ill in Concordia, Kansas. We tried everything - the doctor, home remedies, prayers - but on March 19th, 1878, our little Lutie slipped away from us. They buried him in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Concordia. A mother is never supposed to outlive her children, and to lose two... well, there are some sorrows that never fully heal.\nThe constant moving was another great challenge. Count them up - we went from New York to Wisconsin, then to Iowa, then Missouri, then to different parts of Kansas, then to Nebraska. Always it was Devier with another grand plan, another opportunity that was going to make our fortune. Sometimes I felt like a nomad, never able to put down proper roots or make lasting friendships because we'd be packing up again before long.\nEach move meant leaving behind everything familiar - neighbors who'd become friends, a church community we'd grown to love, a garden I'd tended, rooms where my children had played. It meant packing up our entire lives into wagons, wondering what the new place would be like, hoping the children would adapt, praying that this time we'd find our permanent home.\nThe separation from Devier in our later years was perhaps the most complicated challenge. After I came to California in 1889 to help Della with her first baby, I found myself reluctant to return to Nebraska. The truth was, I was tired of moving, tired of uncertainty, and California felt like the first place in years where I could truly rest. Della needed me, little Lyle needed his grandmother, and Henry Carringer welcomed me into their home like I was his own mother.\nBut it meant living apart from my husband for the last years of his life. We wrote letters, and there was talk of him joining us in California or me returning to Nebraska, but somehow it never happened. When he died in 1894, I felt the weight of that separation - the conversations we never had, the companionship we missed in those final years. It was a choice that brought me peace but also carried its own burden of regret.\nFinancial uncertainty was a constant companion through most of my married life. Devier was a dreamer and a hard worker, but his various ventures - farming, running livery stables, speculation - brought mixed results. There were times when my millinery income was what kept food on the table. I learned to make do with very little, to stretch a dollar until it squeaked, and to find contentment in simple pleasures because fancy ones weren't always within reach.\nWhat major life decisions did you make and how did they work out?\nThe most momentous decision of my young life was accepting Devier Smith's proposal of marriage. I was barely sixteen when we wed on April 4th, 1861, in Rolling Prairie, Dodge County, Wisconsin. Some might say I was too young to know my own mind, but I knew I loved this man with his ambitious dreams and gentle way with me.\nDevier was seven years older than me, born in New York like myself, and he had such plans for our future together. He promised me we'd build something fine, that our children would have opportunities we never had. In many ways, he kept that promise, though not always in the ways either of us expected.\nOur marriage weathered thirty-three years together, through five children born and two lost, through more moves than I care to count, through lean times and better times. Was it always easy? Heavens no. Devier had a restless spirit that sometimes clashed with my growing desire for stability. But he was a good man, faithful to me and devoted to our children. He worked hard, even when his ventures didn't pan out as planned. And he supported my millinery work, never thinking it beneath his dignity to have a wife who earned her own money.\nThe decision to come to California in 1889 changed the entire course of my later life. Della had married Henry Carringer two years earlier, and when their first child Devier was born, she needed help. The journey from Nebraska to California was long and difficult for a woman of forty-five, but when I held that little grandson in my arms, I knew I was where I belonged.\nCalifornia was a revelation to me. The climate was gentle, the growing season long, and there was a sense of possibility that reminded me of my youth in Wisconsin. Henry and Della made me feel truly welcome - not like a burden or an obligation, but like a cherished member of their family. For the first time in years, I felt settled.\nThe decision to stay in California rather than return to Nebraska was gradual rather than sudden. Months turned into a year, then years. Devier and I wrote letters discussing it, but somehow I kept finding reasons to stay a little longer. Lyle was born and Della needed me. Della's health wasn't strong. Henry's business was doing well and they had room for me. The truth was, I was bone-tired of moving and starting over, and California felt like home in a way no place had since my childhood in New York.\nWhen Devier died in 1894, that choice became permanent. By then, I'd been in California for five years and had become part of the fabric of Henry and Della's life. Looking back, I believe it was the right decision for all of us, though it came with the cost of those separated years from my husband.\nAnother significant decision was purchasing property in City Heights in San Diego in 1908. At age sixty-four, I invested in Lots 15 and 16 in Block 97, which gave me a measure of independence and security I'd never had before. Having my own property meant I wasn't entirely dependent on Della and Henry's generosity, though they never made me feel unwelcome. When I deeded that property to Della in 1922, it was with the satisfaction of knowing I could contribute something substantial to the family that had cared for me so well.\nWhat was your biggest accomplishment?\nWithout question, my biggest accomplishment was raising my three surviving children to be decent, capable, productive adults despite all the upheaval and uncertainty of our nomadic life.\nDella, my eldest, became everything I could have hoped for in a daughter. She learned music and became a teacher, which gave her skills and independence. When she married Henry Carringer in 1887, she chose a man of steady character who would provide the stability our family had often lacked. Henry has been a carpenter and cabinet-maker, skilled with his hands and reliable in his work. Together, they've built a good life in San Diego, owning their own home and raising their son Lyle with love and firm guidance. Della has the refined accomplishments I wanted for her - she can play music, she's well-read, she keeps a beautiful home - but she also has the practical strength that came from all those years of moving and adapting.\nMy son David, whom we called \"Davie,\" took after his father in his entrepreneurial spirit but with more steady success. He ran our Blue Front livery stable in McCook, Nebraska, and made a good living at it. The railroad was bringing more people through town, and David understood how to serve travelers' needs. He married twice - first to Leava Smith in 1889, had a daughter Eva in 1890, and after they divorced, he came to San Diego. He married Amy Ashdown in 1902, and they had a daughter Maybelle in 1902. Though he died too young in 1920 at age fifty-six, he lived to see success in his business ventures and to contribute to his community.\nMary Ann, my youngest daughter whom we called \"Matie,\" had perhaps the most challenging path. She was always spirited, sometimes too much so, and she married three times - first to George Chenery in 1889 in Nebraska and divorced in 1895. She came to San Diego and married Joseph Cramer in 1904, who died in 1920 in Oregon, and finally to John Morrill in 1921 in Los Angeles. Each time, I hoped this marriage would bring her the happiness and stability she sought. She became a music teacher like her sister Della, which gave her a way to support herself between marriages. She had no children. Though she died young in 1922 at age fifty-six, she lived life on her own terms and never lost her determination to find happiness.\nAll three of my surviving children learned to work hard, to value education and refinement, and to adapt to changing circumstances. Despite our many moves, they grew up knowing they were loved and that family comes first. They learned practical skills alongside book learning, and they all contributed to their communities wherever they settled. In a time when many children were lost to disease, accident, or the harshness of frontier life, I kept three of mine safe to adulthood and helped them become people of character.\nPerhaps just as importantly, I helped create a family legacy that continues. My grandson Lyle is now a fine young man of thirty-eight, working in finance in a downtown department store - a field that didn't even exist when I was his age. He's steady and reliable like his father Henry, but also curious about the world like his grandfather Devier. Watching him grow from that tiny baby I came to California to help with into the man he is today may be the sweetest fruit of all my labors. Then there is my great-granddaughter, Betty Carringer born in 1919 to Lyle and his wife, Emily. She is growing up and is very artistic.\nWhat are you proudest of?\nI'm proudest of my resilience - the way I learned not just to survive but to find joy and purpose wherever life took me. From that farm girl in Aurora, New York, to a grandmother in San Diego, California, I adapted to each new place and situation while holding onto what mattered most: my family, my faith, and my sense of dignity.\nI'm proud that I never became bitter, despite the losses and disappointments. When we buried little Agnes and later little Lutie, I could have let grief consume me. When Devier's various business ventures didn't work out as planned, I could have become resentful. When we had to move again and again, leaving behind friends and familiar places, I could have grown hard and closed off. But I chose, again and again, to look for the good in each new situation and to make the best of whatever circumstances we found ourselves in.\nI'm proud of my work as a milliner and the way it allowed me to contribute financially to our family while also bringing beauty into women's lives. There's something special about helping a woman feel lovely and confident, whether she's going to church on Sunday or attending a community social. My hats weren't just accessories - they were little pieces of artistry that brought refinement to the frontier.\nI'm proud that I could read and write well throughout my life, and that I passed that love of learning on to my children. Education was sometimes hard to come by in all the places we lived, but I made sure my children valued books and knowledge. Both Della and Matie became music teachers, which required not just skill but also the confidence to stand in front of others and share their knowledge.\nI'm particularly proud of the way I've been able to be a true help to Della and Henry in their marriage. Rather than being the interfering mother-in-law that causes friction, I've tried to be a support and blessing to their household. I've helped raise Lyle, kept house when Della was unwell, and provided the wisdom of experience without being overbearing. Henry treats me like his own mother, and that's a testament to the relationships we've built over these forty-one years I've been in California.\nI'm proud that I learned to find contentment in simple pleasures - a well-tended garden, a letter from family, a grandchild's laughter, a beautiful sunset over San Diego Bay. After all those years of chasing after bigger and better things, following Devier's dreams from place to place, I found that happiness was often in the quiet moments right where I was.\n(AI Enhanced image of Abigail A. (Vaux) Smith and family in about 1900, from family sources)\nHow do you want to be remembered?\nI want to be remembered as a woman who loved deeply and held on tightly to what mattered most, no matter how many times life tried to shake it loose from my grasp.\nRemember me as someone who faced loss with grace. When we buried those two precious babies, I could have let it destroy my faith or my capacity for joy, but instead I chose to love the living children I had even more fiercely. Let that be my legacy - not that I suffered, but that I survived with my heart intact.\nRemember me as a woman who found strength she didn't know she had. I was just sixteen when I married Devier, a young girl who'd never been away from home and family. But life asked me to cross a continent, to start over again and again, to bury children and keep going, to make homes out of nothing but love and determination. I did things I never thought I could do, and I want my grandchildren and their children to know that they have that same strength in them when they need it.\nI want to be remembered as someone who valued beauty and tried to create it wherever I went. Whether it was a hat trimmed just so, a garden planted with care, or a home made welcoming even if we'd only be there a year, I believed that life was better when touched with grace and loveliness. Don't remember me as someone who just endured - remember me as someone who tried to bloom wherever she was planted.\nRemember me as a woman who adapted without losing herself. Yes, I followed Devier from Wisconsin to Iowa to Missouri to Kansas to Nebraska, and finally came to California. But in each place, I found ways to be useful, to contribute, to make friends, to help my children feel at home. I learned new skills, met new challenges, and kept growing even as I grew older.\nMost of all, I want to be remembered as someone who understood what family really means. It's not just the people who share your blood - it's the people who stand by you through thick and thin, who make room for you at their table, who celebrate your joys and comfort your sorrows. Henry Carringer isn't my son by birth, but he's been a son to me in every way that matters. That's the kind of family I tried to create and nurture, and I hope that legacy continues long after I'm gone.\nRemember me with a smile, not with tears. I've had a long life, longer than many of my generation, and I've seen my grandson grow into a fine man. I've lived to see automobiles and airplanes, electric lights and moving pictures - wonders I never could have imagined as a girl in New York and Wisconsin. I've been blessed beyond measure, and I want that to be what you remember most.\nWhat advice do you have for your grandchildren?\nMy dear Lyle, Edgar, Eva and Maybelle, listen closely to your old grandmother who has seen much of life's joys and sorrows.\nFirst and most importantly, hold fast to family. Blood relations are precious, but don't limit your definition of family to just those who share your name. Your father Henry has been a son to me though we share no blood, and you'll find throughout your life that some of your dearest relationships will be with people who choose to love you, not just those who are obligated to by birth. Treasure these chosen family members - they are gifts beyond price.\nLearn to adapt, but never lose your core self. Life will take you places you never expected to go and ask you to do things you never thought you could do. I went from a New York farm girl to a California grandmother, with stops in six different states along the way. Each place required something different of me, but I tried to remain true to my values of hard work, kindness, and dignity. Be flexible like a willow tree - bend with the storms, but keep your roots strong.\nAlways, always learn something with your hands. I don't care if you're a man or woman, rich or poor - learn to create something beautiful and useful with your own two hands. My millinery work wasn't just about money, though that was important. It was about the satisfaction of taking raw materials and turning them into something that brought joy to others. Your father's carpentry, your grandfather Devier's work with horses and cattle, your mother's music - we all found ways to make something good with our skills. Find yours and treasure it.\nDon't be afraid of hard work, but also don't confuse being busy with being productive. Your grandfather Devier was always chasing the next big opportunity, always convinced that the grass was greener somewhere else. Sometimes that restless energy served us well - it brought us to new places and new possibilities. But sometimes it kept us from putting down roots and really flourishing where we were. Learn to recognize when it's time to move on and when it's time to dig deeper where you are.\nTake care of each other in sickness and in health, in prosperity and in lean times. When your mother was a young wife with a new baby, I came to California to help her. When I grew old and needed a home, she and your father welcomed me without question. That's what family does - we show up for each other, not just when it's convenient, but especially when it's needed.\nBe grateful for simple pleasures. Some of my happiest memories aren't of special occasions or grand achievements, but of quiet evenings with family, gardens blooming in spring, letters from loved ones, the satisfaction of a job well done. Learn to find joy in everyday moments, because they're the foundation that grand occasions are built upon.\nDon't let hardship make you hard. Life will test you - it's tested every generation before you and it will test the ones that come after. You'll face losses that seem unbearable, disappointments that feel crushing, challenges that seem impossible. But don't let those experiences close your heart or dim your capacity for joy. I buried two babies and could have let grief consume me, but instead I chose to love the living children I had even more deeply. Let your struggles make you stronger and more compassionate, not bitter.\nRemember that home isn't always a place - sometimes it's the people who love you. I lived in many houses over the years, but I've been truly at home here in San Diego with your parents because they made me feel valued and wanted. When you're building your own life, remember that the walls don't make the home - the love inside them does.\nFinally, write things down. Keep letters from people you love. Record the stories of your family, even the difficult ones. Take photographs when you can. Someday you'll be the old one, and the young people in your family will want to know where they came from and what their ancestors were made of. These memories I'm sharing with you today - they're not just stories, they're your inheritance. Pass them on with pride.\nThe world is changing faster now than it ever did when I was young. You have opportunities I couldn't have dreamed of, but you also have challenges I never faced.\nTrust in the strength that runs in your blood, the love that surrounds you, and the God who watches over us all. Make us proud, but more importantly, live a life that makes you proud.\nAnd remember your old grandmother with love. I may not live to see all the wonderful things you'll do with your life, but I have faith that you'll do them well.\nWritten down by Della Carringer from Mother's words, December 1930\n---------------------------\nI think that these relatively short memoirs are poignant and would be interesting to her family members, especially to her great-grandchildren, and even to her 2nd great-grandchildren.\nThis format provides a different perspective than a biography, doesn't it? It is historical fiction, but many of the historical facts from the genealogical sketch are included and it rings true to me.\nIn 1930, Abbie had four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. She died on 11 September 1931 in San Diego at age 87.\nI will write more of these memoirs or life memories as told by my ancestors as time goes on. This is great genealogy fun for me!\n==============================================\nCopyright (c) 2025, Randall J.

            "New 'Superman' muscles to $217 million at global box office. The movie that introduces David Corenswet as the Man of Steel added $95 million in international markets for global ticket sales expected to reach $217 million through Sunday, Warner Bros said.\n\"Superman\" is a reboot of the movie franchise based on the hero who debuted in comic books in 1938. The film's performance is critical to the future of Warner Bros and its DC Studios division.\nDespite a stable of iconic characters including Batman and Wonder Woman, DC has not been able to match the box office power of Walt Disney's Marvel superhero films.\nThe new \"Superman\" was written and directed by James Gunn, the filmmaker known for three offbeat \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies for Marvel. Gunn was tapped as co-CEO of DC Studios in 2022, alongside producer Peter Safran, and billed as the hero who could bring consistent success to its film and TV projects.\n\"Superman\" is meant to set the stage for coming DC films including a \"Supergirl\" movie next summer and future Batman and Wonder Woman films.\n\"The DC vision is clear, the momentum is real, and I couldn't be more excited for what's ahead,\" Warner Bros Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav said in a statement.\n\"Superman\" is one of only three films to debut with more than $100 million in domestic ticket sales in 2025 as moviegoing lingers below pre-pandemic levels.\n\"The domestic number is great. You can't beat a top three opening of the year,\" Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co, said of the \"Superman\" results.\nHe called the international ticket sales \"troubling\" for a big-budget action movie. The film cost $225 million to make, according to a source with knowledge of the budget.\nJeff Goldstein, president of global distribution at Warner Bros., said the studio was thrilled with the domestic response and that the movie about an American icon performed as expected overseas.\n\"We always knew that this would be bigger in the U.S. than international,\" Goldstein said. \"Superman has always been very American-centric.\"\nGunn's take on the character earned positive reviews from critics. Eighty-two percent of reviews collected on the Rotten Tomatoes website gave the film a thumbs up.\nCorenswet stars opposite \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" actor Rachel Brosnahan as journalist Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as villain Lex Luthor.\nAfter box office misfires last year including \"Furiosa\" and \"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\" Warner Bros has notched six No. 1 openings in 2025. The studio boasts this year's highest domestic opening with \"A Minecraft Movie,\" which pulled in $162.8 million over its first three days in April.\nThe studio also has delivered hits with \"Sinners,\" \"Final Destination Bloodlines\" and \"F1.\"\nSome conservative commentators objected to \"Superman\" when Gunn said the movie about a refugee from another planet was an immigrant story. U.S. President Donald Trump posted a meme that showed his face in place of Corenswet's on a Superman poster.\nThe director and stars said the film was a tale about kindness and no political message was intended.\n\"It's just a movie guys,\" actor Nathan Fillion, who plays Green Lantern, told Variety at the film's Los Angeles premiere.\nYear-to-date ticket sales for all movies in the U.S. and Canada hovered 15% above 2024 but 24% below the pre-COVID times of 2019.\nMax: 1500 characters\nThere are no comments yet.

            "Woke but not broke? Superman soars above culture wars to dominate global box office. Superman has many impressive traits. He\u2019s faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound and, apparently, impervious to culture wars. The Man of Steel is back in the zeitgeist thanks to James Gunn\u2019s new film, Superman, the latest effort by Warner Bros to reboot DC Studios.\nAhead of the film\u2019s release, which stars David Corenswet as Superman and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, Gunn gave an interview with The Times, in which he described Superman, America\u2019s favourite superhero, as an \u201cimmigrant\u201d who models \u201ckindness.\u201d\nNaturally, the comments rankled right-leaning media figures who rushed to declare that Superman had gone super woke.\nKellyanne Conway, a former Trump staffer turned Fox News personality, said on her program that \u201cwe don\u2019t go to the movie theatre to be lectured to and to have somebody throw their ideology on to us.\u201d Meanwhile, Conway\u2019s colleague Jesse Watters suggested that Superman \u201cfights for truth, justice, and your preferred pronouns.\u201d\nNever one to miss a beat, President Trump took to social (faster than a speeding bullet) to add his contribution, posting a photo depicting himself as Superman, alongside the ALL CAPS caption: THE SYMBOL OF HOPE. TRUTH. JUSTICE. THE AMERICAN WAY. SUPERMAN TRUMP.\nAccording to conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro, Superman\u2019s rebrand was certain to be kryptonite for the long-running franchise.\nIn a video titled \u201cSuperman is Going WOKE - You Know What That Means,\u201d Shapiro explained that the film was going to tank because \u201cHollywood actors and filmmakers were no longer willing to clearly align themselves with American values.\u201d\nBut not even a manufactured culture war can keep Superman down. Rather than going woke and going broke, the film banked $330 million at the global box office over its opening weekend, the fifth consecutive number one film for Warner Bros.\nIn addition to dominating the global box office, Superman earned $185 million in America, mainly due to positive reviews (the film boasts Rotten Tomatoes scores of 82 per cent from critics and 94 per cent from the audience).\nThe first standalone Superman movie since Zack Snyder\u2019s Man of Steel in 2013, the reboot doesn\u2019t address present-day politics, but also doesn\u2019t shy away from encouraging real-world parallels. Hoult\u2019s Lex Luthor is a power-obsessed yet insecure tech executive who trolls Superman on the internet (sound familiar, Mr Musk?)\nMeanwhile, Superman becomes involved in a geopolitical conflict between two fictional nations: Boravia, whose leader has a vaguely Eastern European accent, and its neighbouring nation, Jarhanpur. When Boravia invades Jarhapur, it\u2019s Superman to the rescue.\nCritics were quick to identify similarities with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, though Gunn has said he didn\u2019t have any specific real-life turmoil in mind during production. Instead, the director has looked to downplay any controversy around his film.\nDuring Superman\u2019s Los Angeles premiere last week, Gunn addressed the backlash to his comments, telling Variety: \u201cI\u2019m not here to judge people, I think this is a movie about kindness, and I think that\u2019s something everyone can relate to.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s that in the sky? Is it a bird? A plane? No, it\u2019s a well-timed misdirection from a savvy director who knows how to handle himself.\nFind more of the author\u2019s work here.

            "Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's Superman's sidekick Krypto. James Gunn tussled with various ideas on how to deliver a new take on Superman for the big screen.\nThe writer and director of the sassy, swaggering Guardians of the Galaxy films was well aware of the many ways the noble superhero has been presented since his debut in 1938, initially in comic books and then radio serials, television shows and movies.\nThe challenge was to deliver something fresh that would appeal to a new generation of moviegoers and reinvigorate Warner Bros Discovery's DC Studios.\nGunn opens his new reboot movie, titled simply Superman, with a visual that's unusual for the Man of Steel: a Superman, played for the first time by David Corenswet, who is bloodied and beaten.\n\"I wanted to take the character of Superman and just focus on a piece of him that we haven't necessarily seen before,\" the filmmaker said.\nAnd who better to come to the fallen hero's rescue than Superman's best friend Krypto, the superpowered dog that even Gunn describes as \"an often frivolous character\" from the DC Comics.\n\"Having Krypto come to his rescue at the beginning of the movie was adding the whole spin to what this Superman movie was,\" Gunn said.\n\"It wasn't the [1978 Richard] Donner Superman. It wasn't Zack [Snyder]'s Superman. It is a different Superman, where there's a superdog that flies around and also can shoot beams out of his eyes, where there are other superheroes. It's a world where metahumans have existed for years and Superman just happens to be the greatest of them, although we're meeting him at a time before he's quite reached that stature.\n\"This is really about presenting the Superman to the world that I love and have loved since I was a kid.\"\nWhen Gunn was a boy he was \"really attracted to the Superman family comics, with Superman and Supergirl and Krypto and the whole gang. And I was a huge fan of the Richard Donner film as a child. The score and everything about it just kind of blew my mind. It was at a time when I was starting to become more aware of how important films were to me in my life\".\nWarner Bros is counting on Superman to power a new era at DC Studios, which has failed to match the super-sized box office success of Disney-owned Marvel. Gunn was appointed co-CEO of DC Studios in 2022 after bringing his Guardians Of The Galaxy vibe to DC's The Suicide Squad in 2021.\nWith co-CEO Peter Safran, Gunn has plotted a long-term production slate that features a Supergirl movie for 2026, a film based on Swamp Thing and TV shows for HBO Max. Wonder Woman and Batman also are expected to return to cinemas.\nAs writer and director of Superman, Gunn wanted to combine \"the big magic world\" of the DC Comics with the cinematic legacy.\n\"In a world where there's so much meanness and so many petty things happening, Superman ... can often be seen as old-fashioned or too earnest, too kind. He is those things [but] I think that's the most rebellious thing that you can be in this day and age. It's a movie about kindness. But it's all told in this universe with giant monsters and flying dogs and robots and space battles and everything else.\"\nThe actors\nDonning the famous red cape for the first time gave actor David Corenswet a big confidence boost. A relative newcomer, Corenswet follows Christopher Reeve and more recently Henry Cavill in the role of mild-mannered newspaper reporter Clark Kent and his high-flying alter-ego.\n\"When the cape gets on, it really ties the whole thing together,\" Corenswet said. \"You walk out with it flowing behind you, you feel like, 'Yeah, I'm all right, I'll do okay'.\"\nWith acting credits that include TV series The Politician and Hollywood and films Twisters and Pearl, Corenswet said he hoped his iteration of the character would appeal \"to a new generation\".\n\"So much of [the history] is already in the character and people's knowledge and love of the character,\" the 31-year-old said. \"So that sort of came for free, and I just had the great opportunity to maybe explore some different forms of the character and hopefully bring him to a new generation who maybe haven't had their first Superman experience.\"\nCorenswet said he was determined to make the Superman character \"his own\".\n\"You can't help but make it your own,\" he said. \"I wish I could just give the great performances that have come before, but I couldn't help but do my own thing.\"\nHe joked that he didn't have big shoes to fill as his were custom-made, so they \"fit like a glove\". The actor opted not to wear a traditional muscle suit but instead stacked on 20 kilograms to fill out the blue bodysuit - complete with traditional red trunks worn on the outside (after Cavill's all-blue get-up in the previous Man of Steel movies).\nBritish actor Nicholas Hoult, from Nosferatu, About a Boy and the X-Men franchise, plays Lex Luthor. He also drew inspiration from the comics for his portrayal of the villain as a ruthless tech billionaire.\n\"For instance, reading All-Star Superman,\" Hoult said of the DC Comics series that ran from 2005-2008. \"Lex really prides himself on being the peak alpha human, and so I really wanted to bring that kind of energy.\"\nThe Marvelous Mrs Maisel star Rachel Brosnahan, who plays Lois Lane, likes that the film leans heavily into Lane's romantic connection with Clark as co-workers in the Daily Planet newspaper office. She said filming with her co-stars and Gunn was \"a blast\".\n\"[The film] gave us the opportunity to deepen the relationship between Lane and Kent and explore more deeply this relationship that you've come to know in the comics for so many years,\" she said.\nGunn's vision for the movie set it apart from the previous films and TV series: \"I think James's knowledge of and love for these characters and the different adventures that he's taking them on with the different friends he's taking them with, kind of inherently brings it into present day.\"\nThe dog\nThe inspiration for Gunn's Krypto - a character first introduced in a 1955 Superman comic - was his real-life pet dog, a misbehaving rescue mutt called Ozu.\n\"He's named after the great Japanese director Yasujir Ozu,\" Gunn said.\nOf all the rescue dogs he looked at adopting, Ozu \"was very scrawny and skinny, but he had one ear sticking up and it was like a beacon to me\".\n\"So, for some reason, I was attracted to this silly dog, and I brought him home. And he didn't know people. He was about a year old, he had never really been touched or interacted with human beings, so he didn't have much use for me whatsoever. And he loved my other dog, instantly followed her around everywhere - really bothering her. He also proceeded to destroy my house. He tore up all our furniture. He destroyed every shoe he could get his paws on. He ate my laptop. For real. Destroyed my laptop.\n\"And every time anything vaguely resembling an animal came on screen, he would attack the television screen and attack the furniture around the television screen. He was the worst dog you've ever seen in your life. He was biting my feet constantly and so I had to wear shoes around the house when I normally like to be barefoot in my house. He would bite my feet when I was on the phone, so I couldn't scream at him and also I couldn't scream in pain. Instead I would sit on top of my kitchen counter and cross my legs and try to get over in a corner, and then all of a sudden, he would jump up onto the counter and start biting my feet anyway.\n\"And for some reason I thought, 'Oh, what if this awful, terrible, maniac dog had superpowers? We'd be in real trouble'. And then I thought, maybe Krypto is terrible, and that was the start of the movie, adding this unexpected element, this terrible dog. So, Krypto is Ozu. We brought Ozu in and scanned him. Because Ozu could never be a stand-in, we had a wonderful dog by the name of Jolene, who is every kind of respectable - a smart dog, not an idiot dog like my dog Ozu. So, we scanned Ozu, enlarged him a bit and turned him white, and that's Krypto.\"\nThe special effects\nFor visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, a three-time Oscar nominee who worked with Gunn on Guardians of the Galaxy, bringing Krypto to life was only one piece in a vast array of special effects. But it was essential for the tone of the film.\n\"Krypto is Ozu's shape and the way he behaves is very much inspired by Ozu,\" he said. \"He's a very funny dog because it's got this ear that pops up all the time - he cannot really have his ear down. He's a very, very cute dog - a little crazy. James kept calling him a bad dog, and I think that inspired James to put Krypto into the movie.\"\nAnimators used scans of Ozu and footage of his antics to create Krypto.\n\"The way it was written into the script was inspired a lot by James's experience with his dog and James was very keen on us understanding his dog more, so he filmed a tonne of footage with Ozu at home and everywhere he was taking him,\" Ceretti explained. \"Krypto is a slightly bigger dog, so we had to change the proportions, and then change the color of his fur. But apart from that, the face, the eyes, the ears, all of that is really inspired by Ozu's anatomy. And the way he behaves, you know, we have all these videos of Ozu biting someone's foot, going crazy around in circles, jumping on things, which we looked at all the time for everything we did for him in the movie.\n\"It's actually really complicated to try and get the right look, because when you build a CG character, you have to first build the surface and everything, then the fur, you have to groom the fur, and then the eyes had to be very precisely like Ozu's eyes, so that we could get that kind of deadpan expression that he has.\""

            "50 Years of Gowon's Overthrow \u2013 THISDAYLIVE. Latest Headlines\n50 Years of Gowon\u2019s Overthrow\nEric Teniola\nOn Tuesday, July 29 it will be the 50th anniversary of the overthrow of General Yakubu Gowon GCFR. He was overthrown in a bloodless military coup on the same Tuesday, July 29, 1975. Most of us remember where we were at 6.00 a.m. on Tuesday, July 29, 1975, when the Commander of the Brigade of Guards made the following announcement.\n\u201cFellow countrymen and women, I, Colonel Joseph Nanven Garba, in consultation with my colleagues, do hereby declare that in view of what has been happening in our country in the past few months, the Nigerian Armed Forces decided to effect a change of the leadership of the Federal Military Government.\nAs from now, General Yakubu Gowon ceases to be head of the Federal Military Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria. The general public is advised to be calm and to go about their lawful duties.\nHowever, in view of the traffic situation in Lagos area, all workers other than those on essential services like NEPA, Medical Services, Water Works, NPA, the P & T, all workers and all Tanker Drivers will observe today, 29th of July, 1975, as a work free day.\nA dusk to dawn curfew is hereby imposed until further notice. Nigeria Airways operations are suspended and all Airports and Borders are closed till further notice.\nFellow countrymen, this has been a bloodless operation and we do not want anyone to lose his or her life. You are therefore warned in your own interest to be law abiding. Anyone caught disturbing the public order will be summarily dealt with.\nWe appeal to everyone to co-operate in the task ahead. Further announcements will be made in due course. Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\nOn a personal note, on that day I rushed to see my friend, late Richard Tokunbo Amayo of THE NIGERIAN OBSERVER, who was living nearby at Isale Ososami, Oke-Ado, Ibadan, to discuss what Colonel Garba has just announced on the radio. I was then the Western state Chief Correspondent for the Kwara Government state owned newspaper, THE NIGERIAN HERALD.\nColonel Joseph Garba (17 July 1943 \u2013 1 June 2002) was from Langtang in the then Benue-Plateau state which was near Gowon\u2019s aboriginal village in Angas.\nAs a lieutenant in November 1964, Joe Garba was originally handpicked (by then Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon) from the 4th battalion in Ibadan, to the Federal Guards Company where he became the second-in-command to Major Donatus Okafor. He remained there until July 1965 when he was posted to 2 Brigade HQ as GSO III under Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna who served as Brigade Major to Brigadier Zakari Maimalari from the present Yobe state.\nGeneral Yakubu Gowon (Rtd.) (90) GCFR ruled Nigeria uninterruptedly for nine years.\nOn October 1, 1970, General Gowon announced a six-year nine-point plan, which he said, must be accomplished \u201cbefore the government of the country can be handed over with a full sense of responsibility\u201d. The points were as follows: reorganization of the armed forces; implementation of a national economic development plan, including reconstruction of war damaged areas, eradication of corruption; establishment of more states; adoption of a new constitution; introduction of a formula for allocating revenue; completion of a national census; organization of national political parties; and elections at federal and state levels.\nHowever, in another nationwide broadcast on October 1, 1974, General Gowon announced that the 1976 date was \u2018unrealistic,\u2019. He failed to announce a new date.\nHe was overthrown because he broke his pledge to the people.\nWhile declaring a state of emergency, on May 27, 1967, during which he created twelve states, General Gowon declared \u201cMy duty is to all citizens. I propose to treat all sections of the country with equality. The main obstacle to future stability in this country is the present structural imbalance in the Nigerian Federation. Even Decree No. 8 or Confederation or Loose Association will never survive if any one section of the country is in a position to hold the others to ransom.\u201d\nGeneral Gowon then appointed twelve governors of which only two of them are still alive. Those alive are Brigadier General Christpher Oluwole Rotimi (Rtd.) of defunct Western state (90) and Lt Commander Alfred Papapreye Diete-Spiff (Rtd.) of defunct Rivers state (82), the Amayanabo (King) of Twon-Brass, Bayelsa State.\nThe other governors he appointed from time to time and who have answered the final call were Mr. Joseph Dechi Gomwalk (13 April 1935\u2013 15 May 1976) (Benue/Plateau), Brigadier Musa Uman (Rtd.) (1940-1991), North East, Brigadier Abba Kyari (Rtd.) (17 November 1938 \u2013 25 November 2018), North-Central, Brigadier Femi David Lasisi Bamigboye (7 December, 1940-21 September, 2018), Kwara state, Brigadier Jacob Udokaha Esuene (1936-1993), South Eastern state, Anthony Ukpabi Asika (28 June 1936-14 September 2004), administrator, East Central state, Brigadier Mobolaji Olufunso Johnson (Rtd.) (8 February, 1936- October 30, 2019), Lagos state, Major General Robert Adeyinka Adebayo (9 March 1928 \u2013 8 March 2017) Western state, Alhaji Usman Farouk (1932-18 December 2020), North West, Lt. Colonel David Akpode Ejoor (10 January 1932 \u2013 10 February 2019) and Colonel Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia (17 September 1932 \u2013 9 March 2017), Mid-West State and Alhaji Audu Bako (1924-1980), Police, Kano state.\nThe interesting thing is that General Yakubu Gowon survived them all including most of his Ministers, who were then classified as Federal Commissioners.\nThose of the Federal Commissioners still alive are Brigadier Olusegun Obasanjo GCFR (Works and Housing) (88), Colonel Ahmadu Alli (Education) (89) and Alhaji Lateef Olufemi Okunnu (Works and Housing) (92).\nThose of them who are now deceased were Major-General Eyo Okon Ekpo( Agriculture and Natural Resources), Professor Adebayo Adedeji (Economic Development and Reconstruction), Dr Okoi Arikpo (External Affairs), Alhaji Aliyu Usman Shehu Shagari (Finance) GCFR, Brigadier Emmanuel Olumuyiwa Abisoye (Health), Colonel Mohammed Inua Wushishi (Industries), Chief Edwin Kiagbado Clark(Information), Mr Adamu Suleman(Internal Affairs), Brigadier Henry Edmund Olufemi Adefope (Labour), Mr Gabriel Chukwuemeka Akwaeze(Trade) and Captain Olufemi Olumide (Transport).\nOthers were Colonel Dan Suleiman(Special Duties), Chief Anthony Enahoro (Special Duties), Alhaji Shettima Ali Monguno (Mines and Power), Major General Hassan Usman Katsina (Labour), Mallam Aminu Kano (Health), Chief Joseph Sarwan Tarka (Communications), Brigadier Murtala Mohammed GCFR (Communications), Chief Abudu Yesufu Eke (Education), Chief Obafemi Awolowo(Finance) GCFR, Dr. Taslim Elias (Justice), Mr. B.O. Mafeni (Agriculture and Rural Development), Chief Wenike Opurum Briggs (Education and later Trade), Colonel I.D. Bisala (Defence) and Mr. Russel Aliyu Barau Dikko (Mines and Power).\nDuring General Gowon\u2019s tenure, for the first ten months there was no FEDERAL CABINET. Permanent Secretaries dealt directly with General Gowon. That was during the era of Super Permanent Secretaries. Except for Chief Phillip Chikwuedo Asiodu (91) almost all of them have passed on.\nUnder General Gowon, there was the Central Planning Office, under the Ministry of National Planning and Reconstruction. That office was the engine room of the second and third development plans.\nOther top government officials who worked with General Gowon in that Planning office were Owelle Gilbert Prince Obiajulu Chikelu (94), Chief Samuel Oluyemisi Falae (87), Chief John Odigie Oyegun (86), Chief John Dikenwiwe Edozien (born April 20, 1943), Boye Ilori, Wole Okunfulure, Gbenga Tiamiyu, Chief Ayo, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife (20 November 1937 \u2013 14 December 2023) and others.\nThere were other Permanent Secretaries who worked directly with him including the then Secretary to the Government, Chief H. A. Ejueyitchie, an Itsekiri from the then Mid-West, Chief Ufot Ekaette (his private secretary for 8 years), Alhaji Yusuf Gubir, Chief Allison Ayida, Chief Charles Olatunde Lawson, Ime James Ebong, Alhaji Musa Daggash, Abdul Aziz Atta, Chief Stanley Olabode Wey, S.S. Waniko, Chief Eniolorunda Ojumu, Mr. B. Popo, Imafidon Akade, Prince Solomon Akenzua, M. A. Tokunboh, Chief B.M. Okagbue, Chief Edwin Ogbu, Chief Victor Adegoroye, E. E. Nsefik, Alhaji Umaru Sanda Ndayako, who later became the 12th Etsu Nupe from 1978-2003 and others.\nGeneral Gowon also worked with the members of the Federal Public Service Commission in which Alhaji Sule Katagum was the chairman. Other members were Dr. Samuel Manuwa, Alhaji Yusuf Jega and Dr. L.O. Wochia.\nDuring General Gowon\u2019s tenure, Nigeria had the finest civil servants that any country could boast of. At that time, they were the envy of Africa and the Commonwealth of nations.\nMention must be made of Chief Jerome Oputa Udoji, Chief Augustus Oladipo Adebayo, Chief Peter Odumosu, Chief Simeon Olaosebikan Adebo, Chief Christopher Sunday Olatunde Akande, Chief Samuel Oyewole Asabia, Chief Sam Epelle, Mr. M.I. Alege, Mr. L. A. Nsefik, Mr. Benjamin Akinnusi Osunsade, Dr. Christopher Kolade, Chief N.U. Akpan, Chief D.P. Lawani, Alhaji Ali Akilu, Chief (Mrs) Folayegbe Akintunde-Ighodalo (17 December 1923 \u2013 14 February 2005), the first woman Permanent Secretary and lots of them.\nThere were other top officials like Mr. C. Olumese, Mr. Gboyin Alabi, Mr. Olufemi Akande, Mr. Nyalander, Chief Olu Awotesu (Registrar of Ships), Mr. Felix Bankole Cardoso (Accountant-General at that time), father of the present Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Chief (Mrs.) Ebun Oyagbola (Accountant), Mr. Adeyinka Samuel George Nelson (government\u2019s Printer) and others.\nOn January 2, 1975, General Yakubu Gowon appointed the following as Permanent Secretaries. A.S.N.Egbo (Cabinet Secretariat), Yaya Abubakar (Political), Dr. J.O. Adekunle (Economic), Mrs. F.Y. Emmanuel (Public Service), M. Saidu Gwarzo (Police Affairs), B.S. Oloruntoba (Agriculture and Rural Development), F.M.C. Obi (Civil Aviation), I. Akade (Co-Operatives and Supply), S.A. Musa (Health), Festus I. Adesanoye (Housing, Urban Development and Environment), A. Fika (Internal Affairs), J. Taggert (Social Development, Youth and Sports), J. A. Adeyeye (Trade), M.E.P. Udebiuwa ( Works) and J.D. Ogundele (Justice).\nOthers were S. O. Williams (Communications), Sunday B. Awoniyi (Defence), I.J. Ebong (Economic Development), A. Lima Ciroma (Education), G. A. E. Longe (Establishments), J.T.F. Iyalla (External Affairs), I.M. Damcida, Ahmed Joda (Industries), A. Tatari-Ali (Information), S.O. Koku (Labour), G.A. Ige (Mines and Power), P.C. Asiodu (Petroleum and Energy), Y. Gobir (Transport) and Dr. Bukar Shaib (Water Resources).\nIn overthrowing General Yakubu Gowon, on the evening of July 30th, 1975, Brigadier General Murtala Ramat Mohammed (8 November 1938 \u2013 13 February 1976) declared \u201cFellow Nigerians the events of the first few years have indicated that despite our great human and material resources, the government have not been able to fulfill the legitimate expectations of our people. Nigeria has been left to drift. This situation, if not arrested, would inevitably have resulted in chaos and even bloodshed.\n\u201cIn the endeavour to build a strong, united and virile nation, Nigerians have shed much blood.\nThe thought of further bloodshed, for whatever reason must, I am sure, be revolting to our people. The Armed Forces, having examined the situation, came to the conclusion that certain changes were inevitable. After the civil war, the affairs of state hitherto a collective responsibility, became characterised by a lack of consultation, indecision, indiscipline and even neglect.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, the public at large became disillusioned and disappointed by these developments. This trend was clearly incompatible with the philosophy and image of a corrective regime. Unknown to the general public, the feeling of disillusionment was also evident among members of the armed forces whose administration was neglected but who, out of sheer loyalty to the Nation, and in the hope that there would be a change, continued to suffer in silence.\u201d\n\u201cThings got to a stage where the head of administration became virtually inaccessible even to official advisers; and when advice was tendered, it was often ignored. Responsible opinion, including advice by eminent Nigerians, traditional rulers, intellectuals, et cetera, was similarly discarded. The leadership, either by design or default, had become too insensitive to the true feelings and yearnings of the people. The nation was thus plunged inexorably into chaos.\u201d\nIt was obvious that matters could not, and should not, be allowed in this manner, and in order to give the nation a new lease of life, and sense of direction, the following decisions were taken: 1. The removal of General Yakubu Gowon as Head of the Federal Military Government and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. 2. The retirement of General Yakubu Gowon from the Armed Forces in his present rank of General with full benefits, in recognition of his past services to the nation. 3. General Gowon will be free to return to the country as soon as conditions permit; he will be free to pursue any legitimate undertakings of his choice in any part of the country. His personal safety and freedom and those of his family will be guaranteed.\u201d\nGeneral Yakubu Gowon GCFR was overthrown in Uganda while attending the meeting of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).\nMr. Nowa Omoigui, a renowned Journalist and an authority on Nigeria issues described the plight of General Gowon after the overthrow. He declared \u201cNevertheless, General Gowon, far away in Kampala, had friends. Many offers of residence came to him in Kampala from various African countries.\nGeneral Gowon notified the new regime in Lagos that he would leave Kampala for Lome in Togo. Since he was financially broke, teary-eyed members of the Nigerian delegation along with staffers at the Nigerian High Commission in Kampala donated 3000 pounds sterling to enable him begin a new life. He was flown to Lome \u2013 via Garoua in Cameroon \u2013 aboard President Idi Amin\u2019s executive jet. Part of the flight passed through Nigerian airspace and Gowon took the opportunity to transmit a radio message reaffirming loyalty to and support for Brigadier Muhammed\u2019s new regime. Although offered permanent domicile in Togo he chose to join his family in the United Kingdom. He received an additional 10,000 pounds sterling donation from General Eyadema. Following a telephone call to Brigadier Muhammed, during which he made requests for elementary federal assistance, he left for London.\nWhen General Gowon got to London, he was offered official accommodation by the Nigerian government which he, however, turned down for a variety of reasons. After some weeks at the Portman Hotel, he moved into the house of an old friend \u2013 Mr. Emmanuel Otti \u2013 at 472 Finchley Road, London. The delay was to enable the house to be redecorated by Mr. and Mrs. Otti and Brigadier Sam Ogbemudia (who had been in the UK when the coup took place in Nigeria). Other friends came to the assistance of the family. It was not until September 1975 that he began to get his pension and gratuities as a retired Four-Star General.\nIn the nine years he had been Nigeria\u2019s ruler he had not built himself a single house, inside or outside the country, nor did he expropriate one kobo of government money. Unlike some of those who served under him, his TOTAL savings throughout his service years as well as his years as Nigeria\u2019s leader was N75,000 \u2013 all of which was inside Nigeria. In time to come this would stand in stark contrast to the conduct of and personal fortunes of most of those who conspired to remove him from office \u2013 or benefited from it.\nOnce settled in with his family, the General, who was offered several Masters Degree programs, signed up for undergraduate studies in Political Science at Warwick University. Newspapers in Nigeria later carried news items and photographs depicting the former Nigerian leader carrying trays in a student cafeteria in the UK. The Muhammed regime was embarrassed and therefore dispatched Brigadier TY Danjuma (who, took Kano born Col. Wali along) to ask Gowon adopt a supposedly more dignified stance. Gowon rejected the overture and reassured his \u201cembarrassed sympathizers\u201d that he was comfortable with his situation. (Conceivably nothing could have been more embarrassing than to be overthrown while attending an OAU summit).\nHe made friends among the Nigerian students at Warwick, including a family friend of mine, Desmond Guobadia, now a legal practitioner in Lagos. Meanwhile his spouse, the former First Lady, Mrs. Victoria Gowon (who was a nurse) registered as a catering student at a University College in London.\u201d\nAfter his overthrow, there was a commission of enquiry to probe General Gowon. At the end of it all, he was never found guilty of corruption. Also, two of his governors, Brigadier Mobolaji Johnson and Brigadier Oluwole Rotimi were cleared of corruption charges.\nIn foreign affairs, he excelled.\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is one of the achievements of the leaders of West African in the seventies. It has just celebrated its 50th anniversary. Unfortunately, today, the ECOWAS is in comatose, whereas it was designed to strengthen cooperation and unity among the West African sub-region.\nIt was formed on May 28th, 1975.\nGeneral Gowon was one of the founders of that body. The President of Republic of Dahomey, Lt-Colonel Mathieu Kerekou, the President of the Republic of Gambia, Sir, Dawuda Jawara, the President of the newly independent Republic of Guinea- Bissau, Mr. Luiz Cabral, the President of Ivory Coast, Mr. Felix Houphouet Boigny, the President of Liberia, Dr. William R. Tolbert Jr. and the President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, Mr. Moktar Ould Daddah personally led their countries\u2019 delegations to the historic summit and signed the treaty.\nOther personal signatories were the Head of State of the Republic of Niger, Lt-Colonel Seyin Kountche, the President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Dr. Siaka Stevens, the President of the Republic of Upper Volta, General Elhaj-Abubachar Sangoule Lamizana, the President of Togo, General Gnassingbe Eyadema and the Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, General Yakubu Gowon- the last two pioneers of the final successful effort at forming ECOWAS.\nPlenipotentiaries at the summit were Major Amadou Bala Diarra, Vice-President, representing President Moussa Traore of the Republic of Mali, Dr. Lansana Beavogui, Prime Minister, representing President Ahmed Sekou Toure of the Republic of Guinea, Mr. Abdou Diof, Prime Minister, representing President Leopold Sedar Senghor of the Republic of Senegal and Lt-Colonel R.J.A. Felli, Commissioner for Economic Planning, representing the Head of State of the Republic of Ghana, Colonel Ignatius Kutu Acheampong.\nIt is no exaggeration that General Yakubu Gowon was the brain behind the establishment of the following companies.\nThese companies with their locations and the percentage of Federal Government shareholding are as follows: Anambra Motor MFG. Co. Ltd.-Anambra-35 per cent; Nkalagu Cement Co. Ltd. (Expansion)-Anambra-10 per cent; Steyr Nigeria Ltd.- Bauchi-35 per cent, Ashaka Cement Company Ltd.-Bauchi-30 per cent; New Nigeria Salt Company Ltd-Bendel-100 per cent; Delta Steel Company Ltd.-Bendel-100 per cent; Nigerian National Shrimp Co Ltd.-Bendel-51 per cent; Nigeria National Fish Co Ltd-Bendel-66 per cent; Benue Cement Company Ltd.- Benue-39 per cent; Calabar Cement Company Ltd.- Cross River-40 per cent; Nigeria Newsprint Mfg. Co. Ltd.-Cross River-80 per cent; Serwood Industries Ltd.- Cross River-20 per cent; Opobo Boa Yards Ltd.-Cross River-43.75 per cent; Savana Sugar Company Ltd.-Gongola-72 per cent; Aba Textile Mills Ltd- Imo-70 per cent and Electricity Meters Company Ltd.-Kaduna-80 per cent.\nOthers were Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Ltd.-Kaduna-35 per cent; Batagarawa Steel Rolling Mill-Kaduna-100 per cent; Super Phosphate Fertilser Co.-Kaduna-100 per cent; North Brewery Ltd.-Kano-50 per cent; National Truces Manufacturing Co. Ltd.-Kano-35 per cent; Nigeria Sugar Company Ltd.-Kwara-19.7 per cent; Ajaokuta Steel. Ltd.-Kwara-100 per cent; Nigeria Paper Mills Ltd-Kwara-100 per cent: Lafiagi Sugar Company Ltd.-Kwara-90 per cent: Nigeria Yeast and Alcohol Manufacturing Co. Ltd.-Kwara-51 per cent; Flour Mills of Nigeria-Lagos-12 per cent; West Africa Distillers Ltd.-Lagos-100 per cent; Volkswagen of Nigeria Ltd-Lagos-35 per cent; NICHEMTEX Industries Ltd.-Lagos-9.23 per cent, Sunti Sugar Company Ltd.-Niger-90 per cent; West African Portland Cement Co. Ltd.-Ogun-20 per cent; National Salt Company Ltd.-Ogun-100 per cent; Nigeria National Paper Manufacturing Co. Ltd.-Ogun-70 per cent; Nigeria Transformers Ltd.-Ogun-65 per cent; Nigeria-Romania Wood Industries Ltd.-Ondo-25 per cent; Leyland Nigeria Ltd.-Oyo-35 per cent; Oshogbo Steel Rolling Mill-Oyo-100 per cent; Jos Steel Rolling Mill-Plateau-100 per cent and Sokoto Cement Company Ltd-Sokoto-31 per cent.\nIf I may ask, how many of these companies or industries are still operating today?\nIn the domestic front, bodies like the National Bank for Commerce and Industry established on April 2, 1973, the National Insurance Cooperation of Nigeria established on July 1, 1969, the National Oil Corporation, now NNPC established on April 1 1971, the Nigerian Standard Organisation established on December 1, 1971, the Industrial Research Council of Nigeria established in June 1971, the Nigerians Enterprises Promotion Board established February 22, 1972 and the Nigerian National Supply Limited established in January 1972. These are some of the initiatives established by General Yakubu Gowon.\nMention must be made of the indigenisation decree promulgated in December 1972 by General Yakubu Gowon. By December 1974, the Capital issues Commission had fixed prices for the ordinary shares of 24 companies. Ordinary shares totaling 54,051, 000 were transferred to Nigerians\u201413 companies in the manufacturing sector transferred 18,8331,000 ordinary shares: eight commercial companies transferred 31,987,000 while three services companies transferred 3,233,000 ordinary shares.\nHowever, the National Youth Service Corps Scheme (NYSC) was established by General Gowon on May 22, 1973 under Decree Number 24. The concept of the National Youth Service Corps was first broached in the Second 4-Year Development Plan, in which it was announced that the Federal Military Government planned to establish a Youth corps organization during the period covered by the Plan.\nGeneral Yakubu Gowon, subsequently announced in the course of his broadcast to the nation on the occasion of the 12th Independence Anniversary Celebration on October 1, 1972, that the proposed NYSC was meant \u201cto transcend political, social, state and ethnic loyalties and to form the basis of fostering loyalty to the nation.\u201d At the various University convocations, he disclosed that a lot of work had already been done on the project and invited the public, the students and university lecturers for discussions and suggestions on the scheme.\nThe facts having being collected, the FMG subsequently announced that the scheme would begin at the end of the 1972/1973 academic session. The NYSC was thus created by Decree No. 24 of 22nd May, 1973 and launched by General Yakubu Gowon, on June 4, 1973, at the first meeting of the Directorate of the NYSC.\nThe objectives of the NYSC include: to inculcate discipline in Nigerian youths by instilling in them a tradition of industry at work and of patriotic and loyal service to the nation in any situation they may find themselves; to raise their moral tone by giving them the opportunity to learn about higher ideals of national achievement and social and cultural improvement; to develop in them attitudes of mind acquired through shared experience and suitable training, which will make them more amenable to mobilization in the national interest and to develop common ties among them and promote national unity.\nOthers are to encourage members of the services corps to seek, at the end of their corps service, career employment all over the country thus promoting the free movement of labour, to induce employers partly through their experience with members of the Service Corps, to employ more readily qualified Nigerians irrespective of their States of Origin: and to enable Nigerian youths to acquire the spirit of self-reliance.\nUnder the decree, any Nigerian who is up to the age of 30years, and who, at the end of the academic year, unless exempted under section 15 of the decree, has successfully completed his or her first degree at any university in Nigeria, shall be liable to be called upon to serve in the Service Corps. But graduates who have exceed the prescribed age may volunteer for service. The duration of service is one year.\nGeneral Yakubu Gowon established the Federal Housing Authority which built many housing schemes across the country including FESTAC in Lagos. With no debt to pay and with full implementation of the first and second development plan piloted by Professor Adebayo Adedeji (21 December 1930 \u2013 25 April 2018) from Ijebu-Ode and Professor Ojetunji Aboyade (September 9, 1931 -December 31 1994) from Awe, at full speed, the country was moving forward. Suddenly, the movement stopped. And here we are, fifty years after. This great country deserves the best. No doubt Nigeria was designed for greatness.\nThree Newspapers namely Nigeria Tribune, The New Nigeria and The Daily Times wrote different editorials after the fall of General Yakubu Gowon\u2019s government.\nThe Nigerian Tribune in its editorial on August 1, 1975, \u201cthe tenth reason for the fall of Gowon\u2019s Federal Military Government is that it had over-stayed its welcome. A miliary regime should be a transitional Government and its tenure of office should be short and effective. For, by their very training and temperament, soldiers do not possess qualities of politicians. What Gowon has demonstrated is that it takes much more than money, civil servants and economic plans to govern a country.\nThe art of government is purely practical politics. And it is best left for those who have the necessary training, public confidence, temperament, experience, ability and the stomach for it.\nFinally, let it be said to his credit, that General Gowon was not a ruthless dictator. He tried occasionally to respond to public opinion and resisted the temptation to use his authoritarian powers as brutally as some of his sub-ordinate extremists would have wished. There were times when his inaction saved him and the nation from disasters that could have arisen from rash and precipitate action. But the greatest achievement for which he will be remembered is the creation of twelve state in the Federation.\nIt was a courageous Act and it has removed for all time the main obstacle to lasting unity\u201d.\nThe Daily Times wrote on August 2, 1975, \u201cLet it be said in fairness to him that General Gowon is a sincere and well-meaning man; the creation of 12 states; the indigenization of foreign businesses; and the formation of Economic Community of West African States are all credits to his administration. But power is delightful and absolute power is absolutely delightful.\u201d\nIn its own Editorial, The New Nigeria wrote, \u201cForeign commentators who thought that Nigeria was doomed to face a fresh round of violence, and even another civil war, have been proved woefully wrong. The acknowledgement of the change, and the pledge of loyalty to the new government, made in Kampala by the former Head of the Federal Military Government, General Yakubu Gowon, must have sealed their expectations.\u201d\nNo doubt, that was Nigeria\u2019s golden period but General Gowon\u2019s inability to hand over power was his greatest undoing. The road he took that led to the civil war during which millions died was another stain on his tenure for many still bear today the scars of that civil war especially in the South East. General Gowon had survived till today, it is left for history to judge him accordingly.\nAt the beginning of the Civil war the popular slogan WAS TO KEEP NIGERIA ONE IS A TASK THAT MUST BE DONE. AT THE END OF THE WAR IT BECAME GO ON WITH ONE NIGERIA (GOWON). I think General Gowon\u2019s lasting legacy is that he kept this great country one for nine years.\nOn December 16 last year, President Bola Tinubu GCFR, renamed University of Abuja after General Yakubu Gowon. That is a fitting tribute."

            "Trump\u2019s Threats Against Mamdani Put a Target on the Back of All Immigrants. Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.\nI used to take my United States citizenship for granted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was always aware of the benefits conferred on me by a U.S. passport, but I didn\u2019t give it much more thought than that. My great-grandparents immigrated through Ellis Island, and eventually I happened to be born on a certain tract of land, within certain lines drawn up by men many years ago.\nIt\u2019s hard to know how many U.S. citizens are children of other U.S. citizens. That granular data isn\u2019t tracked. For more than 150 years, the Fourteenth Amendment has guaranteed birthright citizenship to every child born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents\u2019 immigration status. About 85 percent of U.S. residents have citizenship through birthright. Another seven percent of the country \u2014 or 24.5 million people \u2014 are naturalized U.S. citizens.\nBut over the past several months, Donald Trump has given lie to the idea that citizenship was ever objective or resolute. When Trump\u2019s presidency goes down in the bowels of history, he will be remembered for his fervid and unlawful crusade to remold the fabric of the U.S. population in his image \u2014 with immigration agents as his key executors. A mass deportation agenda once pitched as targeting the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d has quickly expanded into an all-out assault on immigrant populations, sweeping up citizens and non-citizens alike.\nDon\u2019t miss a beat\nGet the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.\nMeanwhile, Trump has repeatedly weaponized immigration status to silence his critics, targeting and deporting what he\u2019s called \u201cthe enemy from within.\u201d First, he went after the visas of international college students, especially those students who protested to demand an end to Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza. Then, when the Trump administration learned that Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was in fact a lawful permanent resident, officials attempted to revoke his green card and deport him too. Now, we\u2019re seeing the goal posts shift yet again: In a June 11 memo, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is prioritizing efforts to strip naturalized Americans of their citizenship.\nOne man in particular has been at the center of the right\u2019s latest denaturalization campaign. Last week, Trump amplified baseless claims \u2014 circulated online by racist extremists \u2014 that Zohran Mamdani, the New York City Democratic mayoral candidate, could be living in the U.S. without authorization. He also said he would have Mamdani arrested if he interferes with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the city.\nMamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, to one Indian parent and one Ugandan parent of Indian descent, and moved to New York City at age seven. He became naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2018 and was elected to the New York state assembly two years later. Still, Trump told reporters on July 1 that \u201ca lot of people are saying he\u2019s here illegally\u201d and vowed that his administration would \u201clook at everything.\u201d\nWhether or not the administration moves forward on its threat to revoke Mamdani\u2019s citizenship, Trump\u2019s comments clearly aim to intimidate opponents and curb Mamdani\u2019s enforcement of New York City\u2019s sanctuary city policies, should he be elected mayor. Republicans have already threatened to arrest and criminally prosecute several Democratic mayors of sanctuary cities \u2014 even as courts have long upheld the legality of policies that restrict local law enforcement from collaborating with ICE. Brandishing Mamdani\u2019s status as an international-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, and painting it as something subject to the Oval Office\u2019s whims, is just another ugly iteration of Trump\u2019s crackdown on dissent.\nThe ominous rhetoric puts a target on the back of all naturalized politicians who might seek to push back against the current administration, but immigrant mayors are particularly vulnerable, given their unique role in having to organize and implement the sanctuary policies that Trump is directly threatening. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, though, if Trump broadens the scope of his attacks to target progressive members of Congress who are naturalized citizens, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), who was born in Somalia, or Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington), who was born in India.\nThe Trump administration claims it\u2019s only going to target the citizenship of people who have committed crimes, but that provides no comfort. We\u2019ve seen how quickly this administration has weaponized allegations of \u201ccriminality\u201d to further political goals \u2014 sanctuary cities, for instance, are not illegal, but the administration has repeatedly claimed that they are. And in his push to revoke international student visas, Trump has falsely claimed that protesting against Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza amounts to illegal support for terrorist organizations.\nHistory has also shown us that authoritarian regimes readily exploit legal frameworks, eroding the already-porous bounds of legality to further repression. In 1940s Germany, for instance, the Nazis engaged in a perfectly legal mass denaturalization campaign that rendered thousands of Jewish people and political adversaries stateless.\nTrump has made it clear that his issues with Mamdani are ideological. On July 8, Trump ramped up his diatribe against Mamdani by suggesting to reporters during a Cabinet meeting that the White House would somehow take control of New York City if the Democratic socialist is elected mayor in November. \u201cIf a communist gets elected to run New York, it can never be the same. But we have tremendous power at the White House to run places when we have to,\u201d Trump said.\nStill, while Trump\u2019s authoritarian second term has brought the U.S. to a point of Constitutional crisis, denaturalization itself isn\u2019t new. It was heavily used as a political tool during Sen. Joseph McCarthy\u2019s anti-communist crusade of the late 1940s and 1950s \u2014 a political movement known as McCarthyism. Back then, fears about the spread of communism led to more than 20,000 denaturalization cases per year. It\u2019s deeply troubling that we\u2019re now in a period of intense political repression that meets and exceeds the McCarthyist blueprint. But let us not forget that the Red Scare eventually fell out of favor. McCarthy was censured by the Senate and exposed for his baseless accusations.\nWe must not let Trump\u2019s threats dissuade us from speaking out for what is right, pushing back against political persecution and standing up for our neighbors regardless of immigration status. After all, at the end of the day, your citizenship won\u2019t protect you from an authoritarian regime \u2014 but your community might.\nMedia that fights fascism\nTruthout is funded almost entirely by readers \u2014 that\u2019s why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative. But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political repression under Trump.\nWe rely on your support to survive McCarthyist censorship.

            "Trump seizes on \u2018moral character\u2019 loophole as way to revoke citizenship. A justice department memo directing the department\u2019s civil division to target the denaturalization of US citizens around the country has opened up an new avenue for Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda, experts say.\nIn the US, when a person is denaturalized, they return to the status they held before becoming a citizen. If someone was previously a permanent resident, for example, they will be classified as such again, which can open the door to deportation efforts.\nThe memo, published on 11 June, instructed the justice department\u2019s civil division to \u201cprioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence\u201d. Immigration matters are civil matters, meaning that immigrants \u2013 whether they are naturalized citizens or not \u2013 do not have the right to an attorney in such cases.\nMuzaffar Chishti from the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan thinktank, explained that much of immigration law was based on discretion by government officials. To revoke a person\u2019s citizenship, US officials must demonstrate that they are not of \u201cgood moral character\u201d \u2013 a subjective and broad term with little defined parameters.\nNow, the recent memo lists a broad range of categories of people who should be stripped of their naturalized citizenship status, providing further guidance as to who is not of good \u201cmoral character\u201d. This included \u201cthose with a nexus to terrorism\u201d and espionage, war criminals and those who were found to have lied in their naturalization process. Officials still need to prove their case, Chisthi explained.\n\u201c[The administration] can\u2019t, on their own, denaturalize people, they still have to go to a federal district court,\u201d said Chisthi. \u201cDenaturalization finally does belong to federal district courts \u2013 but they are obviously keen on finding every way they can to denaturalize people they think did not deserve to be naturalized.\u201d\nHowever, the justice department\u2019s memo is not solely confined to those expanded categories. It gives more discretion to officials to pursue these cases, prompting a fear for analysts and attorneys that the directive by the Trump administration is overly broad.\nFor Jorge Loweree, director of policy for the American Immigration Council, a new category in the memo stood out to him: individuals accused of being gang and cartel members.\nLoweree is concerned \u201cbecause of the way that the administration has treated people that it deems to be gang members\u201d, he said. \u201c It wasn\u2019t that long ago that the administration flew hundreds of people from the US to a prison in El Salvador on, in most instances, flimsy evidence.\u201d\nAlthough the memo marks an escalation by the Trump administration it is not entirely news, and in recent decades, other nations have also engaged in seeking to strip citizenship from certain people.\nDenaturalization in the US has a long history. Throughout the 20th century, those seen by the US government as potential enemies to US interests were stripped of their citizenship. Journalists, activists and labor leaders, accused of being anarchists and communists, were frequently targeted.\nPolitically driven denaturalization fell off in the late 1960s, when the US supreme court ruled that denaturalization could only take place if someone was found to have committed fraud or \u201cwillful misrepresentation\u201d, as USA Today explained earlier this year, leading to a lull in denaturalization cases. Denaturalization categories were narrowed, with cases focusing mostly on former war criminals, such as Nazis, who had lied in their documents to gain status in the US.\nIn recent decades, starting under the Obama administration, the US government escalated its denaturalization efforts. Matthew Hoppock, an immigration attorney based in Kansas who follows and analyzes immigration policies closely, said that the Obama-era enforcement efforts were limited to specific cases. The operation, called Operation Janus, began reviewing fingerprint cards to determine whether naturalized citizens had lied during their citizenship process.\nThrough 2017, Hoppock, who accessed denaturalization data, found \u201cit\u2019s about 10 to 15 cases a year that they bring nationwide,\u201d adding that \u201cthose were typically human rights abusers, Nazi guards, and cases like that.\u201d\nThe first Trump administration marked a significant uptick in denaturalization efforts. The Department of Homeland Security at the time stood on the shoulders of the Obama-era operation, supercharging it to strip citizenship from people accused of cheating in the process of applying for citizenship as a foreign-born individual. The administration\u2019s goal at the time was to examine 700,000 files but, as Hoppock states, due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of the cases, the administration barely made a dent.\nBut as Chisthi further explains, much about the first Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigration agenda was only a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for policies being pursued this year. Now, under the second Trump administration, denaturalizing people has risen up the priority list.\nMeanwhile, the terrorist attacks on the US on September 11, 2001 radically changed how many countries dealt with national security efforts and other countries also began to explore the denaturalization of certain people.\nAccording to research from the analysis organization Global Citizenship Observatory, or Globalcit, based in Italy, and the Institute of Statelessness and Inclusion (ISI), based in the Netherlands, between 2000 and 2020, citizenship revocation expanded dramatically in some countries, especially in Europe, and especially for minority groups. During this period, 18 countries in Europe, researchers found, expanded their denaturalization powers in the name of national security and counter-terrorism.\nA report from the European University Institute\u2019s Global Citizenship Observatory, published this year, highlighted certain countries with broad and ambiguous denaturalization laws. In Bulgaria, for example, a person\u2019s citizenship could be stripped for \u201cserious crimes against the country.\u201d And in Vietnam, acts that \u201charm the country\u2019s prestige\u201d are also grounds for revocation.\nThere have been recent shifts in certain countries, related to denaturalization cases. In Latvia, citizenship can be revoked if the person serves in the security or armed forces of another country. However, in 2022, amid the war caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, an exception was introduced to allow Latvians to fight for Ukraine.\nJust this year, the report says, the Swedish government recommended a constitutional shift that could revoke a person\u2019s citizenship due to \u201cthreatening national security\u201d. In Germany, some political parties discussed the push to revoke citizenship for \u201csupporters of terrorism, antisemites, and extremists\u201d. And Hungary introduced a constitutional amendment to allow the temporary suspension of citizenship on \u201csecurity grounds\u201d.\nAs the European University Institute\u2019s report highlighted, last year, Kuwait introduced amendments that would revoke citizenship of people who were involved in fraudulent conduct, crimes involving \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d or where the state\u2019s interests are deemed at risk. more than 42,000 people reportedly lost their citizenship, the report says.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen dictators use the taking-away-of-citizenship as a way to control a population or bend people to their will,\u201d Hoppock said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the Trump administration is going to use it this way. This memo is pretty milquetoast \u2013 it just says we don\u2019t really have any priorities any more.\u201d\nBut, Hoppock added, the new memo is a huge departure from past efforts. \u201cUnfortunately it could be abused by a system that likes to go after its adversaries,\u201d he said.\nAll experts told the Guardian that resources will be a major factor in the Trump administration\u2019s push to revoke some people\u2019s citizenship. Already, the federal government\u2019s resources are stretched thin, for a variety of reasons.\n\u201cThe most important thing is: how much resources is the administration going to put into it, to target prosecutions?\u201d Chisthi asks. \u201cAnd that will determine whether this will mostly be an exercise in getting a lot of people anxious or actually producing outcomes of denaturalizations.\u201d\nLoweree is wary.\n\u201cResource constraints would be a significant limiting factor in this type of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have seen the administration do anything and everything it can to pursue its immigration agenda, in all instances,\u201d he said.",
            "Can the US government just take away your citizenship? - The Economic Times. Synopsis\nThe Justice Department under President Trump prioritized stripping citizenship from naturalized individuals deemed threats, raising concerns about free speech. Despite this, legal precedents, particularly Afroyim v. Rusk, safeguard citizenship, allowing revocation only if illegally obtained or through material misrepresentation during naturalization. Trump's previous attempts saw limited success due to significant legal hurdles.\nIn a memo last month listing its law enforcement priorities, President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Justice prioritized stripping citizenship from naturalized citizens who pose threats to the US, including national security dangers, terrorism, gang affiliations and fraud. Given the administration\u2019s aggressive \u2014 and sometimes lawless \u2014 efforts to deport noncitizens, including those exercising their First Amendment rights, it\u2019s not surprising that the document has drawn both concern and criticism.\nHowever, the legal reality is that once you\u2019ve obtained citizenship, you have a constitutional right to keep it \u2014 a principle affirmed by a Supreme Court decision nearly 60 years ago. Citizenship can only be revoked if it was obtained illegally in the first place or if the individual lied about or concealed a material fact during the naturalization process. Even then, revocation can only happen after a proceeding before a federal district court judge.\nWhat\u2019s more, this isn\u2019t the first time Trump has expressed plans to denaturalize citizens. During his first term, he went so far as to announce a new Justice Department office focused on the task. Yet only 102 such cases were brought, according to a current administration official with every reason to maximize the numbers. And although no publicly available source indicates the number of denaturalizations that actually occurred, the answer seems likely to be very few, as the administration has been unwilling to disclose the number of cases it won.\nThe upshot is that like many Trump initiatives, this one should be understood more as a publicity stunt than a genuine policy undertaking. The goal is certainly to frighten naturalized citizens into refraining from criticizing the administration \u2014 in other words, to chill their free speech rights. Pointing out the legal limitations of this threat is therefore an important part of standing up for the First Amendment.\nThe legal background here starts with Afroyim v. Rusk, a 1967 decision written by Justice Hugo Black. Black, one of the great liberal justices of all time, was appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937 and served until 1971 \u2014 the fifth-longest tenure in the history of the Supreme Court. Until the Afroyim case, Congress had used legal means to revoke citizenship, including a law that barred voting in other countries\u2019 elections. Afroyim, a naturalized American born in Poland, moved to Israel in 1949 and voted in the 1951 Israeli Knesset election. When he tried to return to the US in 1960, he was denied a passport and told he was no longer a citizen. (Afroyim had strongly leftist views and may have been a Communist, which might be why the government enforced the law against him.)\nThe Supreme Court struck down the law. Black wrote in resounding terms that:\nEven with that decision, federal law still allows an individual\u2019s citizenship to be stripped if it was \u201cillegally procured\u201d or procured \u201cby concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.\u201d However, the government must go to court and convince a federal district judge to strip the citizenship under the terms of the law before that can occur.\nThe \u201cillegally procured\u201d provision of the law is the worrisome part. It does not technically require lying. Rather, the inquiry is whether the individual fulfilled all the requirements of citizenship in the first place. These include lawful permanent residency for the relevant period, \u201cgood moral character,\u201d attachment to \u201cthe principles of the Constitution of the United States,\u201d and being \u201cwell-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.\u201d\nThe \u201cgood moral character\u201d criterion is partly explained by statute. Among other things, the law says an individual lacks good moral character if they\u2019ve committed certain crimes. Yet as part of the initial application process, the immigration officer in charge of a case ordinarily has considerable discretion to determine whether the person indeed does have good moral character. That makes the revocation of citizenship on that ground legally tricky.\nThe Trump administration might conceivably try to use this provision to claim there were facts not known at the time of naturalization that suggest a given person lacked good moral character and therefore procured citizenship illegally. But that would require the courts to answer the subtle legal question of what conduct, unknown at the time of naturalization, would have counted as evidence the individual lacked good moral character to the extent they would originally have been denied citizenship.\n\u201cAttachment to the principles of the Constitution\u201d and \u201cbeing well-disposed to the good order of the United States\u201d are also very broad terms. Again, if the Trump administration sought to strip someone\u2019s citizenship on these bases, it would have to show that there were facts unknown at the time of naturalization that would have answered these questions in the negative.\nThe federal courts are likely to be skeptical of efforts to use these provisions to strip citizenship from people Trump simply dislikes. The administration would have to convince a judge that citizenship had been illegally obtained. And by its terms, the law doesn\u2019t apply to any political beliefs or values or affiliations held by naturalized citizens after they become citizens. Those are fully protected by the First Amendment.\nThe bottom line is that the significant legal barriers to stripping citizenship are likely to restrict the administration\u2019s ability to make use of the existing provisions of the law. That\u2019s almost certainly why the president\u2019s objective seems to have had little meaningful success during his first term.\nAs written, the law is not as precise as it should be regarding which subsequently discovered facts might count as evidence of a lack of good moral character. If Trump actually tries to exploit this provision, the law should be changed to make it more precise. For now, the law appears adequate to fulfill its purpose, which, as Justice Black put it, is to protect citizens against \u201cforcible destruction of citizenship\u201d regardless of identity or the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nHowever, the legal reality is that once you\u2019ve obtained citizenship, you have a constitutional right to keep it \u2014 a principle affirmed by a Supreme Court decision nearly 60 years ago. Citizenship can only be revoked if it was obtained illegally in the first place or if the individual lied about or concealed a material fact during the naturalization process. Even then, revocation can only happen after a proceeding before a federal district court judge.\nWhat\u2019s more, this isn\u2019t the first time Trump has expressed plans to denaturalize citizens. During his first term, he went so far as to announce a new Justice Department office focused on the task. Yet only 102 such cases were brought, according to a current administration official with every reason to maximize the numbers. And although no publicly available source indicates the number of denaturalizations that actually occurred, the answer seems likely to be very few, as the administration has been unwilling to disclose the number of cases it won.\nThe upshot is that like many Trump initiatives, this one should be understood more as a publicity stunt than a genuine policy undertaking. The goal is certainly to frighten naturalized citizens into refraining from criticizing the administration \u2014 in other words, to chill their free speech rights. Pointing out the legal limitations of this threat is therefore an important part of standing up for the First Amendment.\nThe legal background here starts with Afroyim v. Rusk, a 1967 decision written by Justice Hugo Black. Black, one of the great liberal justices of all time, was appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937 and served until 1971 \u2014 the fifth-longest tenure in the history of the Supreme Court. Until the Afroyim case, Congress had used legal means to revoke citizenship, including a law that barred voting in other countries\u2019 elections. Afroyim, a naturalized American born in Poland, moved to Israel in 1949 and voted in the 1951 Israeli Knesset election. When he tried to return to the US in 1960, he was denied a passport and told he was no longer a citizen. (Afroyim had strongly leftist views and may have been a Communist, which might be why the government enforced the law against him.)\nYou Might Also Like:\nThe Supreme Court struck down the law. Black wrote in resounding terms that:\nThe very nature of our free government makes it completely incongruous to have a rule of law under which a group of citizens temporarily in office can deprive another group of citizens of their citizenship. We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment [protects] every citizen of this Nation against a congressional forcible destruction of his citizenship, whatever his creed, color, or race.The decision recognized a naturalized citizen\u2019s \u201cconstitutional right to remain a citizen in a free country unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship.\u201d\nEven with that decision, federal law still allows an individual\u2019s citizenship to be stripped if it was \u201cillegally procured\u201d or procured \u201cby concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.\u201d However, the government must go to court and convince a federal district judge to strip the citizenship under the terms of the law before that can occur.\nThe \u201cillegally procured\u201d provision of the law is the worrisome part. It does not technically require lying. Rather, the inquiry is whether the individual fulfilled all the requirements of citizenship in the first place. These include lawful permanent residency for the relevant period, \u201cgood moral character,\u201d attachment to \u201cthe principles of the Constitution of the United States,\u201d and being \u201cwell-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.\u201d\nThe \u201cgood moral character\u201d criterion is partly explained by statute. Among other things, the law says an individual lacks good moral character if they\u2019ve committed certain crimes. Yet as part of the initial application process, the immigration officer in charge of a case ordinarily has considerable discretion to determine whether the person indeed does have good moral character. That makes the revocation of citizenship on that ground legally tricky.\nThe Trump administration might conceivably try to use this provision to claim there were facts not known at the time of naturalization that suggest a given person lacked good moral character and therefore procured citizenship illegally. But that would require the courts to answer the subtle legal question of what conduct, unknown at the time of naturalization, would have counted as evidence the individual lacked good moral character to the extent they would originally have been denied citizenship.\n\u201cAttachment to the principles of the Constitution\u201d and \u201cbeing well-disposed to the good order of the United States\u201d are also very broad terms. Again, if the Trump administration sought to strip someone\u2019s citizenship on these bases, it would have to show that there were facts unknown at the time of naturalization that would have answered these questions in the negative.\nThe federal courts are likely to be skeptical of efforts to use these provisions to strip citizenship from people Trump simply dislikes. The administration would have to convince a judge that citizenship had been illegally obtained. And by its terms, the law doesn\u2019t apply to any political beliefs or values or affiliations held by naturalized citizens after they become citizens. Those are fully protected by the First Amendment.\nYou Might Also Like:\nThe bottom line is that the significant legal barriers to stripping citizenship are likely to restrict the administration\u2019s ability to make use of the existing provisions of the law.

            "NIST Releases Extensive Video Update on Champlain Towers South Investigation. The National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST\u2019s) National Construction Safety Team (NCST) has released an extensive video update on its investigation into the June 2021 partial collapse of the Champlain Towers South building in Surfside, Florida. The update reviews the investigation\u2019s history and progress, shares preliminary findings, and highlights potential impacts that this complex investigation could have on building codes and standards.\nIn the video, investigative lead Judith Mitrani-Reiser and co-lead Glenn Bell explain how the team has determined that some of the hypotheses they are considering for how the failure occurred have a higher likelihood than others. The team has reviewed two dozen hypotheses, relying on extensive physical evidence, imagery, historical records, witness interviews, remote sensing data, laboratory testing, computer modeling and more.\n\u201cAs we have shared in previous updates, there were many design and construction problems that weakened the building from the start,\u201d said Mitrani-Reiser. \u201cThese deficiencies posed many potential failure initiation possibilities both in the pool deck and the tower, and each is being carefully considered so that we can narrow our focus to the most likely ones and seek to rule out others.\u201d\nThe two experts describe the extensive planning and coordination that helped the team systematically work through analyses, testing and modeling to arrive at its preliminary findings. They note that from NIST\u2019s initial deployment of a preliminary reconnaissance team in the first 48 hours after the collapse, this investigation has relied on collaboration with local authorities and expertise from across the federal government, private industry and academia.\nBell walks viewers through three hypotheses with higher likelihood, beginning with the failure of one of the typical slab-column connections in the pool deck. He describes factors that contributed to low margins of safety in the pool deck, including understrength of the building\u2019s original structural design relative to the requirements of the building code. Additionally, he notes that steel reinforcement was not placed where it should have been, leading to significantly diminished strength of the pool deck slab and slab-column connections. He also points to heavy planters that were not in the original design, as well as a rehabilitation of the pool deck decades earlier that added sand and pavers, increasing the load on a system that was already functionally and structurally inadequate. The team also found corrosion of the steel reinforcement in the pool deck concrete, which can weaken the slabs and slab-column connections.\n\u201cWhile there is strong evidence that the collapse initiated in the pool deck, we have not ruled out a failure initiation in the tower,\u201d said Bell. \u201cThe fact that the pool deck collapsed before the tower does not preclude the possibility that there was some initiating event in the tower that set off the collapse of the very vulnerable pool deck.\u201d\nSome of the design, construction and degradation issues found in the pool deck are also evident in the building tower and present other plausible hypotheses that the team continues to pursue. In addition to the misplacement of steel reinforcement within slabs and columns, some basement columns had prolonged exposure to water due to ponding and flooding in the garage. This can cause corrosion of the steel reinforcement and deteriorate the concrete. The team therefore also considers it a higher likelihood that the collapse was initiated by either the diminished strength of the columns in the tower or the failure of a slab-beam-column joint in the southernmost column line of the east part of the tower, close to where the tower joined the pool deck.\nThe investigation team determined that there is a lower likelihood that the partial collapse was initiated by two potential problems beneath the building: voids known as \u201ckarst\u201d or pile failure. Mitrani-Reiser explains how satellite data was used to look for gradual settling or sinking of the ground in the general area of Champlain Towers South. None was seen in the area in the five years before the partial collapse, nor was localized sinking observed near the building in the days leading up to the tragedy.\nThe team found no evidence of karst in the limestone on which the foundation sits, and careful studies of the limestone showed it has features that actually inhibit the formation of karst. Team members calculated that the foundation pile capacity shown on the design drawings was sufficient to carry the building loads and laboratory and nondestructive testing of pile concrete showed adequate material strength. Finally, the basement slab did not show any distress or trauma that would indicate karst formation or pile failure, such as cracking or sinking.\nBell also notes as a lower likelihood scenario the separation of the pool deck/street-level slab from the south basement wall.\nIn the past few months, the team has updated the collapse timeline based on interviews and records, modeling results, and new analyses of audio and digital evidence.\nAlthough there is very little video from the night of the collapse, every image was meticulously analyzed to determine its precise perspective and identify clues that could inform the timeline, such as changes to reflections of light on building surfaces, such as a wall.\nMitrani-Reiser describes how team members made a breakthrough by using a novel approach to analyzing videos. They compared the soundwaves of the audio recorded by two videos from different parts of the building to find and correlate patterns of sounds in each video. This helped pinpoint when the videos overlapped in time and provided insight into what was happening in the building by comparing the building\u2019s movement at the same time on two different floors. All audiovisual evidence in NIST\u2019s possession has now been timestamped.\nMitrani-Reiser also notes the importance of social science research to develop carefully crafted interviews that have helped to elicit important memories not reported elsewhere. Information gained in these interviews has helped confirm the collapse timeline, in tandem with the video evidence.\n\u201cTwo clear questions coming out of this investigation are why the design and construction problems were not discovered when Champlain Towers South was built, and how do we evaluate the structural safety of existing buildings?\u201d said Bell.\nWhile the video presentation does not offer recommendations for changes to codes or practice, it does highlight some areas that industry experts could consider. These include how special inspections that are mandated for safety might impact construction quality control by giving builders a false sense of security that someone else will catch their errors later.\nMitrani-Reiser also shares that the investigation found no records from the original construction of the building, and few from its early life, and notes the importance of records retention going beyond initial drawings to include \u201cquality assurance records and, particularly, peer review reports where they exist.\u201d\nFinally, Mitrani-Reiser calls on the engineering and construction professions to take seriously the apparent lack of quality control and quality assurance found in the case of Champlain Towers South. She noted that, \u201cthis tragic event has revealed flaws in our systems, and quality is at the heart of it.\u201d\nThe team is finalizing its analysis and has begun drafting its investigation report, which is expected to be completed in 2026.",
            "Oceangate's Titan whistleblower: 'People were sold a lie'. Oceangate's Titan whistleblower: 'People were sold a lie'\nWhen the Titan submersible went missing during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic in 2023, David Lochridge hoped the five people on board \u2013 including his former boss - could be rescued.\n\"I always hoped that what happened wouldn't happen. But I just knew if they kept carrying on the way they were going and with that deficient equipment, then there would be an incident,\" he told the BBC.\nThe whistleblower had been sacked by the firm behind the sub, Oceangate, after warning about safety issues in 2018.\nIn June 2023 the sub imploded killing all five people on board \u2013 including Oceangate CEO Stockton Rush.\nA report from the US Coast Guard (USCG) published on Tuesday found that Oceangate's failures over safety, testing and maintenance were the main cause of the disaster.\n\"There is so much that could have been done differently. From the initial design, to the build, to the operations - people were sold a lie,\" Lochridge told the BBC.\nBut he firmly believes the US authorities could - and should - have done more to stop Oceangate.\nLochridge had joined Oceangate seven years earlier as the company's Director of Marine Operations. He moved his family from Scotland to the US, and was full of excitement about the company's ambitions.\nOceangate was building a new submersible to take paying passengers down to the most famous wreck in the world - the Titanic.\nAnd he was going to be involved in the project from the very start, working alongside the team designing the sub.\nThe straight-talking Glaswegian has worked at sea for more than 25 years, first with the Royal Navy and later as a submersible pilot. He also led submarine rescue operations, responding to distress calls from people trapped underwater. He knows about the risks involved in deep dives.\nHis responsibilities included planning dives and, as chief pilot, he would be the one taking the sub and its passengers 3,800m beneath the waves to see the Titanic. Safety was at the heart of his role.\n\"As the director of marine operations, I'm the one responsible for everybody,\" he told BBC News. \"I was responsible for the safety of all Oceangate personnel and all of the passengers that were going to be coming in the sub.\"\nA prototype for the new submersible, which would eventually be called Titan, was being developed with the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). The plan was to build its hull - the part where the passengers would sit - out of carbon fibre.\nNo deep diving sub had been made out of this material before - most have hulls constructed from titanium or steel. But Lochridge had confidence in the APL team.\nHe said he was told by Oceangate's CEO Stockton Rush that the craft would undergo a safety assessment by an independent marine organisation, known as certification.\nLochridge was adamant that this third-party oversight was essential - especially because Titan was to be made of experimental materials.\nBut by the summer of 2016 he was starting to have doubts about the project.\nOceangate stopped working with APL and decided to bring the design and construction of Titan in-house.\nLochridge was worried. He didn't have the same confidence in Oceangate's engineers. He told the BBC he didn't think they had experience of building subs able to withstand the immense pressures found at the depth of the Titanic.\n\"At that point, I started asking questions\u2026 and I felt I had a duty of care to keep asking them,\" he said.\nAs the parts for Titan began to arrive, and the craft started to take shape, Lochridge said he was spotting problem after problem.\n\"When the carbon hull came in, it was an absolute mess,\" he said.\nHe saw visible gaps in the material, areas where the layers of carbon fibre were coming apart - known as delamination.\nAnd he identified issues with other key components.\nThe carbon fibre hull had titanium domes fitted on each end, but he said the metal had been machined incorrectly. He was also worried that the sub's view port had not been designed to work at extreme depths.\nMost concerning, he learnt that Titan was not going to be independently certified for safety.\nHe told the BBC that he had always been outspoken on safety issues - so he wasn't going to stay silent.\n\"I brought up all the issues that I was seeing\u2026 but I was just met with resistance all the way,\" he said.\nIn January 2018, he outlined his concerns again to Stockton Rush. This time Rush asked him to complete an inspection of the vessel.\nTitan was at a crucial point of its development. Passengers had already paid deposits for dives to the Titanic planned for later that year. Test dives were about to start in the Bahamas before those expeditions got underway.\nLochridge wanted Oceangate to delay these plans.\n\"I formulated a report and I sent it out to all the directors in the company.\"\nThe following day he was summoned to a meeting with Rush and several other Oceangate employees.\nA transcript from the two-hour-long meeting, where the itemised report was picked over, reveals a heated exchange between Lochridge and Rush.\nTowards the end of the meeting, in response to Lochridge's safety concerns, Rush says: \"I have no desire to die. I've got a nice granddaughter. I'm going to be around. I understand this kind of risk, and I'm going into it with eyes open, and I think this is one of the safest things I will ever do.\"\nTo Lochridge's surprise, immediately after this meeting he was fired.\nBut he was so concerned about Titan that he got in touch with the US government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration - OSHA.\nOSHA told him his case was urgent because it involved public safety and that he would be placed under the whistleblower protection scheme, designed to protect employees from retaliation by employers if they've reported concerns about workplace safety.\nAs part of this process, OSHA passed Lochridge's concerns about Titan to the US Coast Guard (USCG) in February 2018.\nBut Lochridge says after OSHA wrote to Oceangate to tell them it was starting an investigation, everything changed.\nIn March, Oceangate asked Lochridge to drop the OSHA complaint - and demanded he pay $10,000 for legal costs. Lochridge declined.\nThen in July 2018, Oceangate sued Lochridge - and his wife Carole - for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, fraud and theft, amongst other allegations. The following month, Lochridge countersued for unfair dismissal.\nLochridge maintains that throughout the process OSHA was slow and failed to protect him from the ongoing retaliation he was receiving from Oceangate.\n\"I provided all the documentation to OSHA, I was on the phone to OSHA every few weeks.\" he said. \"OSHA did nothing.\"\n'They beat us down'\nIn December 2018, under increasing pressure from Oceangate's lawyers, Lochridge and his wife took the decision to drop the case.\nThis meant the legal proceedings were settled, and as part of this agreement Lochridge withdrew his complaint at OSHA. OSHA stopped its investigation and also notified the US Coast guard that the complaint had been suspended. Lochridge also signed a non-disclosure agreement.\n\"Carole and I did everything we physically could, we just got to the point that we were completely burned\u2026 We had nothing left to give to it. They beat us down.\"\nOceangate continued at pace with its plans to reach the Titanic.\nIn 2018 and 2019, the prototype sub made its first test dives in the Bahamas - including one, piloted by Stockton Rush, that reached a depth of 3,939m.\nA crack was later found in the sub's carbon fibre hull, and in 2020 that damaged hull was swapped out for a new one, in what became the second version of Titan.\nIn 2021, the company started taking passengers to the Titanic, and over the next two summers made 13 dives to the famous wreck.\nBut in June 2023, the sub went missing with five people on board - including Stockton Rush. After days of anxious waiting, the sub's wreckage was found littered across the ocean floor.\nAt the US Coast Guard's public hearings held last year, Lochridge criticised OSHA for its lack of action. \"I believe that if OSHA had attempted to investigate the seriousness of the concerns I raised on multiple occasions, this tragedy may have been prevented.\"\n\"It didn't need to happen. It didn't - and it should have been stopped.\"\nIn response to Mr Lochridge, a spokesperson for OSHA said its whistleblower protection programme was limited to protecting individuals against employer retaliation. They said their investigation had \"followed the normal process and timeline for a retaliation case\".\nOSHA said it does not investigate whistleblowers' underlying allegations about public safety\u2026 but instead refers those to the appropriate agency - in this case, the US Coast Guard.\nThe spokesperson said: \"The Coast Guard, not OSHA, had jurisdiction to investigate Mr. Lochridge's allegations regarding the safe design and construction of marine vessels.\"\nBut the US Coast Guard's report into the disaster agrees with Lochridge and says that OSHA's slow handling of the investigation was a missed opportunity for early government intervention.\nThe report also criticises a lack of effective communication and coordination between OSHA and the USCG.\nThe investigation found that the email from OSHA to the coast guard about Mr Lochridge's complaint was not received. It had been sent to a staff member who had responsibility for monitoring OSHA cases \u2013 but the employee had moved on to a new job within the agency.\nJason Neubauer, the chair of the USCG's Marine Board of Investigation, told the BBC that the coast guard could have done more.\n\"The system did not work for the whistleblower in this case, and that's why we just need to get better - and we have.\"\nOceangate said that in the wake of the accident, it had permanently wound down operations and directed its resources towards cooperating with the inquiry.",
            "NIST Transfers Evidence From Champlain Towers South to Miami-Dade Police Department. The National Construction Safety Team has reached an important milestone in its investigation into the 2021 partial collapse of the Champlain Towers South condominium in Surfside, Florida, with the transfer of evidence custody to the Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD). The transfer became possible once the team from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) completed its extensive review, measurement and testing of critical building evidence extracted from the collapse site.\n\u201cOur team members were in Surfside within 48 hours of the partial collapse of Champlain Towers South, working in collaboration with the Miami-Dade Police Department and others to help ensure the identification and preservation of potential evidence that could explain the collapse,\u201d said investigative lead Judith Mitrani-Reiser. \u201cSince then, we have conducted extensive testing of concrete slabs, columns and reinforcing steel so that we could understand the condition of the building and the forces acting on it at the time of the tragedy.\u201d\nNIST staff members arrived in Surfside on June 25, 2021, and five days later NIST announced it would conduct an investigation under the National Construction Safety Team (NCST) Act, which gives NIST the authority to investigate building failures. The goals of these investigations are to establish the likely technical cause or causes of a building failure; recommend, as necessary, specific improvements to building standards, codes and practices; and recommend any research and other appropriate actions needed to improve the structural safety of buildings.\nNIST\u2019s investigations under the NCST Act are fact-finding efforts. NIST is not authorized to find fault, responsibility or negligence when investigating a building failure.\nTaking care not to interfere with the search and rescue operations, NIST\u2019s experts collaborated with the MDPD to develop guidance for first responders on which building elements would be important to set aside for a potential investigation into the technical cause of the collapse. Procedures for preserving this potential evidence were developed in cooperation with the Miami-Dade Homicide Bureau, the Miami-Dade Fire Department, structures specialists with the urban search and rescue task forces, and the many contractors working on the site. At the same time, remote sensing of the site helped local and federal experts determine where potential evidence was located.\n\u201cThe collaboration, coordination and cooperation with everyone on site was key to ensuring we would have the evidence needed to understand what caused this tragedy,\u201d said investigation associate lead Glenn Bell. \u201cWe were able to obtain over 600 pieces from the site that have provided valuable insight into Champlain Towers South.\u201d\nImmediately following the collapse, the Miami-Dade Homicide Bureau began conducting a death investigation and maintained custody of all evidence. NIST was provided access to the evidence while it was in MDPD custody, and when the evidence custody and control transferred to NIST on Jan. 28, 2022, the MDPD maintained access to it.\nBy the end of July 2021, all of the evidence was moved to secure locations, where it was carefully cataloged so that it could be tracked throughout the investigation. In March 2023, a portion of the evidence was moved to a second warehouse so that NIST, MDPD and their contractors could efficiently work with all the pieces as needed to support their investigations.\nFinding additional space to securely and safely store the evidence took several months, as the facilities had to meet certain criteria for security, scale and accessibility. The process of preparing the materials for the move and then securing them in their new location took several weeks. This included having a board-certified industrial hygienist conduct air sampling for asbestos fibers to ensure the safety of those accessing the materials.\nThe additional space gave team members room to extract concrete cores and reinforcing steel from the evidence and allowed them to begin the next phase of evidence analysis. After completing this phase, the physical evidence was condensed, and organized by type, into a single warehouse. MDPD contractors managed the move, which was overseen by NIST staff.\nIn addition to the NIST and MDPD investigations, the civil litigants involved in a lawsuit related to the collapse hired their own experts to make observations, take measurements and conduct nondestructive testing. NIST provided them with access to the evidence in February and March 2022, before the civil litigation settlement was finalized in June 2022.\nThe investigation team scanned the contents of each warehouse with an imaging technology called lidar after every milestone related to transporting or moving the evidence. Maps developed from these scans were shared with MDPD and its contractors so they could easily identify and track pieces, and NIST also used the scans to remotely inspect the evidence, and to plan its work. NIST also scanned many of the individual specimens using handheld 3D imaging technology to create more accurate 3D representations that could be analyzed further on a computer.\nWith the evidence secure, cataloged and accessible, NIST\u2019s team members began extracting samples of concrete and steel reinforcing bars for testing to learn everything they could about how the building was built, how its materials and construction may have deviated from its original design, how its components had aged, and if any changes had been made to the structure over its 40-year life.\nThe concrete testing included compression and tension tests that revealed how well the samples would hold up to pushing and pulling forces. Researchers carefully studied the cement and aggregate making up the concrete, and how it had aged. They also measured how water moves through the concrete. This movement depends on how the cement was formulated and impacts the potential corrosion of the reinforcing steel within it. Tension tests of the steel reinforcing bars helped determine the strength and deformability properties of the bars, and the impacts of corrosion. Learn more about NIST\u2019s testing.\nDespite extensive searching and inquiries, NIST has not been able to locate as-built drawings for Champlain Towers South. The team has therefore relied on the physical evidence to provide insight into how the building was constructed.\nAn added challenge that has made the physical evidence so important is the lack of video showing exactly what happened. Champlain Towers South had approximately 24 functional security cameras at the time of the collapse that were recording to a digital video recorder (DVR) within the building.\nNCST members hoped to find the security camera DVR hard drive among the evidence collected, which had been sorted by the MDPD into \u201cbulky\u201d and \u201cfine\u201d materials. They conducted multiple searches of the bulky material from the collapse site using drones, personnel on the ground, aerial lifts, and powerful cameras. Unfortunately, no DVR devices were found in the bulky materials. The MDPD and NIST did identify a total of 25 hard drives among the fine materials. The NIST team analyzed these drives to determine whether any of them could have come from a DVR. Experts ultimately determined that the damage to the magnetic media was too extensive and that none of the drives were recoverable.\nCorrosion in reinforcing steel is expected, but it can become an issue if it is too extensive. By carefully examining reinforcing steel in the Champlain Towers South evidence, NIST\u2019s experts were able to document the type, degree and variability of its corrosion. This has provided critical information about potential degradation and strength of the overall structure at the time of collapse.\nThe team was able to \u201creverse engineer\u201d the materials and concrete mixture used in the original construction by conducting microscopic and chemical analyses of concrete samples extracted from the evidence. This allowed team members to quantify the degree of aging and deterioration in the concrete samples. These analyses also made it possible for them to closely recreate the concrete from Champlain Towers South and use it to build large-scale replicas that are representative of critical structural members and connections from different parts of the building that were likely involved with the collapse initiation or its progression. These replicas are being tested to failure in structures laboratories at the University of Washington and the University of Minnesota. Data from these tests will be used to inform computer simulations that will play a key role in determining the probable initiation and progression of the partial collapse and its technical causes.\nThe recovered evidence also revealed various ways in which the building\u2019s materials had changed or been changed over time. This included cracking and spalling (cracking or chipping) of concrete, corrosion of steel reinforcement, prior attempts to repair cracks and spalls in the concrete, the addition of new materials and finishes to the building (including concrete planters and landscaping vegetation on the pool deck), and mineral deposits indicative of water leakage through the structural elements.\nVideos of NCST presentations to the NCST Advisory Committee provide overviews of the investigation\u2019s progress and preliminary findings.\nThe investigation team began its work with about two dozen hypotheses of how the collapse may have initiated. Team members systematically considered all the hypotheses so that they could eventually rule out the most unlikely causes and fully understand the most probable.\n\u201cTo be confident we have determined the most likely cause or causes of this terrible tragedy amongst the many possibilities, we are collecting and analyzing all the evidence we can for and against each hypothesis,\u201d said Glenn Bell. \u201cWe are leaving no stone unturned.\u201d\nThe investigation\u2019s six project teams continue their efforts (see details below), with the goal of completing technical work in 2025. The entire investigative team has already begun drafting the investigation\u2019s findings and recommendations. The draft report must pass through several stages of review, starting with technical review within NIST and then a review by external subject matter experts. Following these technical reviews, the report will undergo several types of policy review before a draft report is released for public review, which is planned for the spring of 2026.\nThe Building and Code History project members are conducting a final review of an extensive document data set and analyzing how well the building\u2019s construction matched the requirements of the original design drawings and specifications.\nThe Evidence Collection and Preservation project team is finalizing the processing of data and images from the physical specimens retrieved from the collapse site. Team members also continue to interview people with knowledge of the building, eyewitnesses of conditions just prior to and during the collapse, individuals involved in the post-collapse activities, and others who might have information helpful to the investigation.\nThe Remote Sensing and Data Visualization project team continues to work on visualization of data and other imagery, including visualizations that support the failure hypotheses assessment and will help to communicate the investigation\u2019s findings.\nThe Materials Science project team is analyzing the distribution of material properties throughout the structure, mechanisms of concrete aging, and the degree and causes of corrosion of steel reinforcement.\nThe Geotechnical Engineering project team is performing testing and analysis to assess whether any soil or foundation issues contributed to the failure. This includes performing soil-structure interaction analyses in collaboration with the Structural Engineering project.\nThe Structural Engineering project team is building and testing large-scale replicas of columns, slab-to-column connections, and slab-beam-column connections at two university laboratories. Team members are also incorporating structural as-built and pre-collapse building condition data into their computer models."

            "VNPAY clinches two titles at the 2025 ABF FinTech Awards. VNPAY was honoured with two gongs at the 2025 Asia Banking & Finance (ABF) FinTech Awards, underscoring the company's efforts to drive technological innovation and refine its comprehensive digital ecosystem strategy.\nVNPAY received the Blockchain Innovation Award and the Ecosystem Collaboration Award at the event in Singapore on July 8.\n|\nVNPAY representative receives the award at the Asia Banking & Finance Fintech Awards 2025. |\nThe Blockchain Innovation Award was in recognition of VNPAY\u2019s successful implementation of innovative technology in its VNPAY app. By integrating blockchain technology, the app significantly improves security and transparency in financial transactions, thereby delivering a safe, and reliable payment experience to millions of users.\nEach transaction on the VNPAY app is encrypted and recorded immutably thanks to blockchain, minimising the risks of fraud or third-party intervention. User data, transaction information, and spending history are stored in a decentralised manner, ensuring top-level security while maintaining transparency and traceability when needed.\nAlongside the payment applications for end users, VNPAY also applies blockchain technology to integrated solutions with banks, payment acceptance units, and associated parties in the ecosystem. This is a rare step in Vietnam, demonstrating innovative thinking in applying core technology into practice.\nThe Ecosystem Collaboration Award reflects VNPAY's broad vision when fintech is no longer just a payment tool, but a gateway connecting digital users to all aspects of everyday life.\nVNPAY has built an open platform, connecting hundreds of partners across sectors such as transportation, travel, entertainment, e-commerce, healthcare, insurance, education, and public services. This enables the app to deliver a wide range of services while fostering an interactive ecosystem where users, businesses, and financial institutions can engage and co-create values.\nIn particular, by diversifying payment methods from e-wallets to bank accounts, domestic/international cards, Apple Pay, and short-term financing, VNPAY can expand its user base and build a flexible and comprehensive payment space beyond traditional customer segments.\nThe ABF FinTech Awards, organised by Singapore\u2019s Charlton Media Group, are among Asia\u2019s most prestigious recognitions in the fintech sector. The six-month evaluation process is led by a panel of banking and finance experts from across the region, including Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong.\nWinning two major awards at this year\u2019s event highlights the growing competitiveness of Vietnamese businesses in core technologies \u2013 traditionally seen as the domain of regional powerhouses like Singapore and South Korea.\nNguyen Thi Thu Huong, a representative of VNPAY said, \"We haven't just built an app \u2013 we have created a platform that lives alongside users, understands their needs, and evolves with the pace of modern life. These two awards are a powerful motivation for us to keep investing, innovating, and delivering real value to our users. It\u2019s also a solid step forward in our journey to expand regionally and contribute to the rise of Vietnam\u2019s fintech sector.\"\n| Digital banks navigate evolving landscape Vietnam's digital banking sector continues to gain momentum in 2025, driven by rapid adoption of AI, the race to profitability, and fierce competition.\n|\n| VNPAY achieves international-standard security certification VNPAY has become the first company in Vietnam, and the 26th globally, to achieve MPoC (Mobile Payments on Commercial Off-The-Shelf) security certification, the latest international standard for mobile payments, for its PhonePOS payment solution.\n|\nBy Thanh Van",
            "Cyprus Business Now: real estate, taxes, BoC, ESG, construction costs, CSE. The Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) Council on Monday expressed \u201cdeep concern and disappointment\u201d over what it deems to be \u201cthe exclusion of meaningful incentives for the capital market\u201d in the government\u2019s proposed tax reform.\n\u201cDespite submitting well-documented recommendations to both the government and the technical team at the University of Cyprus\u2019s Economic Research Centre, the final provisions in the draft bills currently under public consultation fail to include any substantial measures supporting the capital market,\u201d the exchange said.\n\u201cOn the contrary, the proposed regulations contain clauses that even weaken existing tax incentives, and and especially negatively impacting the emerging companies market,\u201d it added.\nOne year has passed since the launch of the interbank ESG assessment project for Cypriot businesses, implemented by Artemis Credit Bureau through the Synesgy platform.\nAccording to a statement by the Association of Banks of Cyprus, this project represents a significant step towards integrating the principles of environmental, social, and corporate governance, known as ESG, into Cyprus\u2019s business sector and financial system.\nThe association explained that \u201cCyprus, through this initiative, now aligns itself with international and European developments, establishing solid foundations for sustainable financing and transparent reporting of related risks and business performance\u201d.\nIt added that the response from the business community has been \u201cparticularly encouraging\u201c, confirming the gradual adaptation of the market to ESG issues.\nRental prices in Cyprus have not increased significantly, as the market has successfully managed to balance rising demand, particularly from students, with the addition of new housing units, according to the president of the Cyprus Real Estate Agents Registration Council, Marinos Kineyirou.\n\u201cThis stability is a positive development that benefits both tenants and landlords by offering security and predictability,\u201d he told the Cyprus News Agency (CNA).\nBased on figures shared by Kineyirou, the lowest monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment is recorded in Paphos and Larnaca at \u20ac500, while the highest is found in Limassol at \u20ac1,100.\nCyprus is losing millions in unpaid taxes after thousands of cases fell outside the legal deadline for assessment, the audit service has warned.\nIn its latest report on the tax department, the service said 139,078 individual taxes relating to 2014 \u2013 2017 can no longer be imposed or amended, as the superintendent\u2019s authority has expired.\nFor companies, a further 6,070 outstanding taxes from the same period are also now beyond the legal timeframe.\nThe Bank of Cyprus is doubling down on its innovation drive this October, launching its sixth fintech hackathon while also joining TechIsland\u2019s donor network to help strengthen the island\u2019s tech ecosystem.\nSpecifically, the bank announced that it will host its sixth Application Development Innovation Marathon \u2018BoC Fintech Hackathon 6.0\u2019 on October 10\u201312, with physical presence at the IDEA Innovation Centre in Nicosia.\nAccording to the organisers, the hackathon focuses on the implementation of proposals and digital applications related to fintech, also combining themes such as social innovation, smart cities and sustainability, with the main goal of promoting entrepreneurship.\nThe Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Keve), in its role as coordinator of the Enterprise Europe Network Cyprus, will host a women\u2019s business delegation from Lithuania on September 24, 2025.\nThe event, which will take place at the Keve building in Nicosia on the first floor, is organised in collaboration with the Klaipeda Chamber of Commerce and Industry and aims to strengthen cross-border cooperation and promote women\u2019s entrepreneurship between Cyprus and Lithuania.\nThe networking initiative will provide an opportunity for entrepreneurs, senior executives, representatives of professional and business associations, and companies interested in expanding or cooperating with Baltic markets to engage directly with Lithuanian business leaders.\nCybersecurity concerns are intensifying in Cyprus as global Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks rise sharply, placing pressure on national infrastructure and prompting renewed investment in digital defences.\nA new report from Qrator Labs revealed that application-layer DDoS attacks surged by 74 per cent globally in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.\nThese types of attacks target web applications, sending malicious traffic that mimics legitimate user requests, making them particularly difficult to detect and mitigate.\nVAT revenues from the EU\u2019s e-commerce systems brought \u20ac257.9 million into Cyprus\u2019 coffers in 2024, according to tax commissioner Sotiris Markides.\nThrough the One Stop Shop (OSS) and Import One Stop Shop (IOSS), businesses can declare and pay VAT on cross-border sales within the EU, as well as on low-value imports from outside the bloc, with just one registration in a single member country.\nSpeaking to local newspaper Politis, Markides said that a Cyprus-registered business selling goods or services to consumers in other EU countries can simply register on the local OSS platform, charge the VAT rate of the consumer\u2019s country, declare the total owed on a quarterly or monthly basis, and make a single payment. Cyprus then forwards each country its share.\nThe highest construction costs in Cyprus\u2019 private sector last year were recorded in hotels, followed by clinics and medical offices, with tourist apartments in third place, according to the Cyprus Statistical Service (Cystat).\nIts report on the cost per square metre of buildings completed in 2023, as well as in previous years, mentions that the figures are not fully representative for all categories, since materials, degree of luxury and functional purpose vary from project to project.\nThe data are drawn from the annual building permit survey, conducted on a sample basis, with average costs calculated by dividing the total project cost by total area.\nThe International Maritime Organisation\u2019s (IMO) Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) has called for a comprehensive overhaul of the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, warning that the rules no longer reflect the realities of life at sea.\nAccording to Columbia Group, the call follows an independent IMO study that exposed inconsistent enforcement of the Code, weak oversight, poor accountability and a disconnect between documented procedures and what crews actually experience, particularly when it comes to fatigue, harassment and excessive workloads.\nCaptain Saurabh Mahesh, group director crewing (Operations) at Columbia Group, said this revision is long overdue.\nCyprus\u2019 trade deficit widened to \u20ac3.87 billion in the first half of 2025, compared to \u20ac3.65 billion in the same period last year, according to a report released on Monday by the state statistical service.\nTotal imports of goods in June 2025 reached \u20ac1.11 bn, up 21.1 per cent from \u20ac920.3m in June 2024.\nImports from other European Union member states amounted to \u20ac588.0m in June 2025, compared to \u20ac554.3m a year earlier.\nThe Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) has announced a series of recent decisions involving investment firms, administrative fines, revocations of earlier rulings and the granting of an exemption under takeover law.\nCySEC said that at its meeting on March 17, 2025, it decided to suspend in whole the Cyprus Investment Firm authorisation of Triangleview Investments Ltd, with number 384/20, citing violations of anti-money laundering rules, deficiencies in board and management requirements, and failures to meet organisational obligations.\nThe regulator explained that the company must, within two months, take the necessary actions to comply with the relevant provisions.\nThe Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) on Monday announced the suspension of trading for several listed companies on the regulated market due to their failure to submit and publish their annual financial report for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn its announcement, the CSE said that the decision follows a previous announcement dated May 8, 2025, and is made under article 183 of the Cyprus Securities and Stock Exchange Laws.\nIt stated that the companies affected are Cyprus Trading Corporation Plc, Ermes Department Stores Plc, Woolworth (Cyprus) Properties Plc, and Karyes Investment Public Ltd.\nClick here to change your cookie preferences",

The cost does include one-on-one onboarding for all team members.\nBrokermint stands out with its ability to handle large-scale operations without sacrificing ease of use. From managing compliance to automating commission disbursements, it\u2019s built to grow with your brokerage. Its reporting tools and automation features help you stay on top of every aspect of running a brokerage, while the mobile app and programming interface make it easy to integrate with many popular CRMs and lead generation tools.

Best for audit and compliance: Skyslope\nSkyslope is a powerful tool for both agents and brokerages looking to simplify their transaction processes while staying compliant. With features like document storage, audit trails, and customizable checklists, it\u2019s built to handle transactions efficiently without overwhelming users.\nWhile Skyslope isn\u2019t the cheapest real estate transaction software option on the market, its extensive features and focus on audit and compliance make it worth the investment for brokerages that need a reliable system. Skyslope\u2019s starting price can vary depending on the size of your brokerage and the number of users, so be sure to contact them for more details. If you\u2019re managing multiple transactions and want a platform that keeps everything organized and compliant, Skyslope is a fantastic choice.\n5. Best for top producers: Lone Wolf TransactionDesk\nWelcome to Transact, formerly TransactionDesk, a module offered within Lone Wolf Foundation \u2013 a new generation of technology to support agent transactions.

Some LoneWolf features may even be included in your MLS membership, so check with your local association for details. Transact gives agents all the necessities along with additional features that are easy to use. It\u2019s fully cloud-based, allowing you to access your transactions anytime, anywhere. Automate repetitive tasks, and integrate with MLS platforms and other tools that you use every day.

For instance, as a broker, I love how Skyslope\u2019s audit features allowed me to easily review files, but the MLS forms integrations for agents were lacking. Dotloop, on the other hand, did a great job of integrating fillable forms into its platform. An agent could write up an offer in no time and immediately send it out for signature. However, brokers tend to find auditing functions messy and harder to track requested changes from their agents.\nChoosing the right transaction management software for your business can make a world of difference in how your business runs. Individuals and small teams may look for affordable easy-to-use systems while larger brokerages are looking for tools that can help them juggle all their moving parts. These transaction management software platforms are more than just document storage \u2014 they take the stress out of managing transactions by saving you time and keeping you organized.\nWhen choosing a real estate transaction management software, you\u2019ll want to decide what\u2019s most important for you and your business. Is it ease of use, affordability, tech features or client support? No two businesses will have the same needs. So, take your time researching the features that matter most to your business. You\u2019ll be sure to find the right transaction management platform that supports your needs."

In typical Sardaar style, Jassi returns with more swagger, more confusion, and more riotous one-liners \u2014 instantly reminding audiences why they fell in love with him the first time.\nA Wedding, Wild Characters, and Whacky Humor\nThe trailer unfolds around a vibrant wedding celebration, bringing together a diverse ensemble of eccentric characters. From awkward romance to slapstick moments, every frame is designed for laughter.

While the romance simmers amidst the absurdity, Mrunal\u2019s presence brings elegance and balance to the otherwise high-octane comedy chaos. Her chemistry with Ajay looks promising, and her character adds emotional weight to the otherwise lighthearted storyline.\nA Star-Studded Ensemble for Unlimited Fun\nDirected by Vijay Kumar Arora, Son of Sardaar 2 brings together an impressive supporting cast that includes:\nRavi Kishan\nSanjay Mishra\nChunky Panday\nNeeru Bajwa\nDolly Ahluwalia\nKubbra Sait\nDeepak Dobriyal\nSharat Saxena\nVindu Dara Singh\nRoshni Walia\nSahil Mehta\nThe film also features the final screen appearance of Mukul Dev, who sadly passed away on May 23, 2025, making the film a bittersweet tribute to his legacy in Indian cinema.\nProduction Powerhouses and Punjabi Punchlines\nBacked by Jio Studios and Devgn Films, Son of Sardaar 2 is produced by Ajay Devgn and Jyoti Deshpande under the banners of Devgn Films and SOS 2 Limited. With this strong production team, the film guarantees blockbuster-level entertainment with a generous dose of Punjabi flair.\nFrom the first look itself, it's evident that the film retains the core identity of its predecessor\u2014 action, family drama, and quirky Sardaar humour \u2014 while upgrading the scale and energy for a 2025 audience.\nA Nostalgic Sequel That Stands on Its Own\nSon of Sardaar 2 may be a sequel, but it\u2019s not stuck in the past. While it pays homage to the 2012 hit that starred Ajay Devgn and Sonakshi Sinha, this film brings in new characters, fresh comedic angles, and a bold new location to elevate the franchise.\nThe trailer reflects a film that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously \u2014 and that\u2019s its biggest strength. It knows its audience and delivers exactly what fans crave: unapologetic entertainment, laugh-out-loud moments, and a whole lot of Punjabi swag.\nRelease Date and Final Verdict\nMark your calendars \u2014 Son of Sardaar 2 hits cinemas on 25th July 2025.\nWith Ajay Devgn at his comical best, a lively supporting cast, and a story packed with family chaos, misunderstandings, and emotional warmth, this film promises to be a laugh-packed ride for the entire family.\nWhether you're a fan of high-energy Punjabi humour or just in the mood for a wild cinematic ride \u2014 Son of Sardaar 2 looks like the perfect mid-year blockbuster.\nJassi is back, and he\u2019s louder, funnier, and more fearless than ever!",

He invests deep empathy into his portrayal, working closely with visually impaired individuals and experiencing significantly reduced vision during his workshop preparation. His performance is heartfelt and is often cited as the film\u2019s emotional backbone\u2014his chemistry with Shanaya remains grounded and sincere.\nStorytelling and Screenplay: A Mixed Bag\nWhile the film is entertaining, some critics observe that it lacks the emotional depth essential to make a lasting impact. The title track and songs such as \"Nazara\" and the single release \u201cAankhon Ki Gustaakhiyan\u201d conveyed emotional resonance, yet the screenplay fails to fully exploit its premise. The chemistry is sweet, but the narrative occasionally feels implausible. One early review notes: \"Shanaya impresses, Vikrant does well, but the film misses an emotional hook.\"\nMusic and Cinematography\nComposer Vishal Mishra delivers a delicate score, including Jubin Nautiyal's vocals, which enhance the film\u2019s mood without overpowering it. Cinematographer Tanveer Mir uses close-up visuals and soft hues to evoke intimacy, reflecting the characters\u2019 tactile and auditory experiences. These creative choices successfully transport audiences into the world of heightened senses.\nThemes and Symbolism\nThe film stays true to Bond\u2019s original themes\u2014focusing on sensory perception, emotional connectivity, and love that transcends physical limitations. The underlying message\u2014seeing with the heart rather than the eyes\u2014is consistently reinforced through dialogue and character arcs. The poster imagery of the leads with closed eyes and visually symbolic use of glasses subtly echoes this focus on emotional perception.\nWeaknesses in Pacing and Emotional Depth\nDespite strong performances and meaningful themes, Aankhon Ki Gustaakhiyan falters in pacing. The narrative lacks the nuanced emotional build-up needed to fully engage viewers. Some subplots feel underexplored, which can make pivotal moments underwhelming. For a slow-burn romance, greater payoff in emotional depth would have strengthened the story\u2019s emotional weight.\nIs Aankhon Ki Gustaakhiyan Worth Watching?\nIn favor of watching:\nShanaya Kapoor\u2019s confident debut brings grace and finesse.\nVikrant Massey offers a tender, soulful performance.\nGentle and effective use of music and cinematography.\nEvocative central message: love beyond sight.\nPotential reservations:\nStory structure doesn\u2019t fully deliver emotionally.\nSubplots feel loosely handled, diminishing narrative cohesion.\nMay resonate more with viewers looking for a mellow, reflective experience rather than a dramatic one.\nFinal Verdict\nAankhon Ki Gustaakhiyan emerges as a thoughtfully crafted, sensorial romance with genuinely heartfelt performances from Shanaya Kapoor and Vikrant Massey. Visually poetic and emotionally poetic, the film is a refreshing monsoon release, ideal for a calm cinematic experience. However, viewers seeking a well-rounded emotional journey might feel underwhelmed by its narrative restraint.",

            "Business spat between Daryl Hall and John Oates has been resolved in arbitration, attorneys say. By JONATHAN MATTISE, Associated Press\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Daryl Hall and John Oates have resolved their dispute over a Hall & Oates business partnership through arbitration, reaching a private ending after details of their rift went public in court documents filed in a 2023 lawsuit by Hall against Oates, according to a court filing Monday.\nIn Monday\u2019s status report, attorneys for Hall noted the case received a final judgment in arbitration and they filed a proposed order for the judge, Nashville Chancellor Russell Perkins, to dismiss the case. In mid-July, Perkins ordered Hall\u2019s attorneys to offer an update in the case, which had last seen a public filing in December 2023.\nIt\u2019s unclear when the arbitration process was finalized. And details were not revealed about the arbitration outcome between the duo who made music together for more than a half century, including hits in the 1970s and \u201980s such as \u201cManeater,\u201d \u201cRich Girl\u201d \u201cKiss on My List\u201d and \u201cI Can\u2019t Go for That (No Can Do).\u201d\nRobb Harvey, an attorney for Hall, declined to comment. Representatives for Oates did not immediately respond to The Associated Press\u2019 request for comment.\nIn 2023 filings in the case, Hall accused Oates of blindsiding and betraying him, saying their relationship and his trust in Oates have deteriorated. Oates replied that he was \u201cdeeply hurt\u201d that Hall was making \u201cinflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate statements\u201d about him.\nThe judge had paused the sale of Oates\u2019 stake in Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to Primary Wave IP Investment Management LLC. Whole Oats includes valuable Hall & Oates materials such as trademarks, personal name and likeness rights, record royalty income and website and social media assets, a court declaration says.\nThe dispute went public in November 2023, when Hall filed the lawsuit asking the judge to stop the sale by Oates so private arbitration could begin.\nHall gave a scathing account of their relationship in early November 2023 during arbitration, and it was made public later in the month in the lawsuit. It alleges that Oates and his team engaged in the \u201cultimate partnership betrayal\u201d by pushing to sell his share while telling Hall\u2019s associates that he wanted to maintain his ownership.\nIn his own declaration, Oates expressed disappointment with his longtime partner\u2019s words, saying Hall\u2019s accusations that Oates went behind his back and breached their agreement aren\u2019t true. Oates declined to go into specifics, saying he\u2019s obligated to keep details private, even if Hall didn\u2019t.\nLast year, Oates told The Associated Press that he\u2019s had \u201cno communication\u201d with Hall and declined to discuss the legal proceedings.

            "Obama to Democrats: 'Just toughen up'. Former President Obama\u2019s message to Democrats is to \u201cjust toughen up\u201d amid frustration with the political landscape under President Trump. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to require a little bit less navel-gazing and a little less whining and being in fetal positions. And it\u2019s going to require Democrats to just toughen up,\u201d Obama said in remarks...",
            "Obama tells Democrat big wigs to 'toughen up,' start backing candidates that can actually win. Former President Barack Obama had blunt words for Democratic Party donors, telling them at a Friday fundraiser to \"toughen up\" and \"stop looking for a quick fix\" after the Democratic Party became locked out of power following the 2024 election cycle.\n\"I think it\u2019s going to require a little bit less navel-gazing and a little less whining and being in fetal positions. And it\u2019s going to require Democrats to just toughen up,\" Obama said at the fundraiser, according to excerpts obtained by CNN. \"Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re a Democrat, but you\u2019re kind of disappointed right now, so you\u2019re not doing anything. No, now is exactly the time that you get in there and do something.\"\nObama is not alone in urging his fellow Democratic colleagues to take a more aggressive approach following the GOP's momentum in 2024. The former president articulated that his view of becoming more aggressive and toughening up means standing up for policies and candidates that are unpopular, or that may make lawmakers feel uncomfortable, but in the end have the best chance to deliver.\nFORMER OBAMA SPEECHWRITER ADMITS SHUNNING CONSERVATIVE IN HIS FAMILY WAS A MISTAKE\n\"Don\u2019t say that you care deeply about free speech, and then you\u2019re quiet. No, you stand up for free speech when it\u2019s hard. When somebody says something that you don\u2019t like, but you still say, \u2018You know what? That person has the right to speak.\u2019 \u2026 What\u2019s needed now is courage,\" Obama added in his remarks at the fundraiser, which drew in $2.5 million and was hosted by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and his wife, Tammy Murphy, at their home.\n\"Stop looking for the quick fix,\" he added. \"Stop looking for the messiah. You have great candidates running races right now. Support those candidates.\"\nThe former president pointed particularly at the upcoming elections in New Jersey and Virginia. Later this year, Virginia will face a major gubernatorial battle between incumbent GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin's Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former long-time Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va.\nIn New Jersey, Democrat Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who was reportedly in attendance at the Friday fundraiser, is running for her state's open gubernatorial seat against GOP candidate Jack Ciattarelli.\nRAHM EMANUEL WARNS DEMS HAVE BECOME PARTY OF 'PUNKS' WHO 'TALK DOWN TO PEOPLE' AND FRET OVER IDENTITY POLITICS\nBoth states will also hold new state House elections and a slate of other local elections. In Virginia, there will also be a special election this year to replace the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va.\nAmid his remarks, Obama described Spanberger and Sherrill as \"powerful spokespersons for a pragmatic, commonsense desire to help people and who both have remarkable track records of service.\"\n\"Stop looking for the quick fix. Stop looking for the messiah. You have great candidates running races right now. Support those candidates.\" - former President Barack Obama\n\"The most important thing you can do right now is to help the team, our candidate to win,\" he said. \"And we\u2019ve got to start building up our coffers in the DNC.\"\nObama acknowledged the party's increasing propensity to nominate progressive, far-left candidates, such as the recent choice of Zohran Mamdani over former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race, but argued that what they are promoting and what centrist Democrats are pushing are not mutually exclusive.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"There\u2019s been, I gather, some argument between the left of the party and people who are promoting the quote-unquote abundance agenda. Listen, those things are not contradictory. You want to deliver for people and make their lives better? You got to figure out how to do it,\" Obama said Friday.\n\"I don\u2019t care how much you love working people. They can\u2019t afford a house because all the rules in your state make it prohibitive to build. And zoning prevents multifamily structures because of NIMBY,\" he added, referring to \"not in my backyard\" views by residents who oppose development in their neighborhoods. \"I don\u2019t want to know your ideology, because you can\u2019t build anything. It does not matter.\"\nObama said that what was being asked of his fellow Democratic Party leaders was to \"make some effort to stand up\" for what they believe is right, even if it makes them a \"little bit uncomfortable.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Obama's office for comment but did not receive an immediate response."

More than $113,000 worth of rare Pok\u00e9mon cards have been stolen from a Massachusetts shop, according to the store\u2019s owners.\nOfficers responded to a reported break-in at 1st Edition Collectibles, a trading card shop in New Bedford, Massachusetts, on Tuesday. The break-in reportedly happened around 2.30am and the thief stole a handful of Pok\u00e9mon cards including five to seven rare cards and a few vintage boxes.\nSome of the cards stolen included the BGS 8.5 Skyridge Crystal Charizard and BGS 7.5 1st Edition Shadowless Blastoise, the owners of the store said in a Facebook post.\nA screengrab of store surveillance footage posted online showed an individual hooded and masked, crouched over a large glass display case. In total, the thief stole $113,650 worth of trading cards, NBC Boston reports.\nAs of Friday morning, no arrests have been made.\nFollowing the robbery, the store owners closed up shop for the week in an effort to take time to \u201creflect, regroup, revamp and come back even better\u201d. They wrote on Facebook that they \u201cappreciate the community support we\u2019ve received, it truly means so much to us to see you all come together to spread awareness and keep an eye out for the stolen items\u201d.\nOne of the store owners, Felipe Andre, told NBC Boston: \u201cWe\u2019re literally just three guys \u2026 This is our passion. This is what we love, since we were children.\u201d\n\u201cHe actually broke into the back courtyard of our building, smashed the window in the back door of the lobby, and then smashed the back window of our door,\u201d Andre added to NBC 10.\n\u201cCame in, he knew exactly the items he was taking. We don\u2019t display pricing in the store at all. So, the value of cards, it\u2019s a market like anything else worth what people are willing to pay for them.

            "Jane Birkin\u2019s original Herm\u00e8s bag sells at auction for 7 million euros. Jane Birkin\u2019s original Herm\u00e8s bag sells at auction for 7 million euros\nThe unique and original Birkin bag that fashion house Herm\u00e8s made for actor and singer Jane Birkin sold for 7 million euros or $8.2 million at auction in Paris\nPARIS -- Sketched out on an air sickness bag, the first Birkin bag that gave birth to fashion's must-have accessory sold for a record 7 million euros (about $8.2 million) at auction in Paris on Thursday.\nThe huge amount \u2014 which drew gasps and applause from the audience \u2014 crushed what auctioneer Sotheby\u2019s had said was the previous record for a handbag. That was $513,040, for a White Himalaya Niloticus Crocodile Diamond Retourne Kelly 28.\nNow, the original Birkin bag, named after the actor, singer and fashion icon that Herm\u00e8s created it for \u2014 the late Jane Birkin \u2014 is in a new league of its own.\nThe bidding started at 1 million euros ($1.17 million) and quickly became stratospheric.\nThe Paris fashion house exclusively commissioned the bag for the London-born star in 1984 \u2014 branding it with her initials J.B. on the front flap, below the lock \u2014 and delivered the finished one-of-a-kind bag to her the following year, the auction house said. The subsequent commercialized version of Birkin's bag went on to become one of the world\u2019s most exclusive luxury items, extravagantly priced and with a yearslong waiting list.\nThe bag was born of a fortuitous encounter on a London-bound flight in the 1980s with the then head of Herm\u00e8s, Jean-Louis Dumas. Birkin recounted in subsequent interviews that the pair got talking after she spilled some of her things on the cabin floor.\nBirkin asked Dumas why Herm\u00e8s didn\u2019t make a bigger handbag and sketched out on an airplane vomit bag the sort of hold-all that she would like. He then had an example made for her and, flattered, she agreed when Herm\u00e8s asked whether it could commercialize the bag in her name.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the Original Birkin bag is a true one-of-a-kind \u2014 a singular piece of fashion history that has grown into a pop culture phenomenon that signals luxury in the most refined way possible. It is incredible to think that a bag initially designed by Herm\u00e8s as a practical accessory for Jane Birkin has become the most desirable bag in history,\" said Morgane Halimi, Sotheby\u2019s head of handbags and fashion.\nThe bag became so famous that Birkin once mused before her death in 2023 at age 76 that her obituaries would likely \u201csay, \u2018Like the bag\u2019 or something.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it could be worse,\" she added.\nSotheby\u2019s said that seven design elements on the handcrafted all-black leather prototype set it apart from Birkins that followed.\nIt's the only Birkin with a nonremovable shoulder strap \u2014 fitting for the busy life and practicality of the singer, actor, social activist and mother who was also known for her romantic relationship with French singer Serge Gainsbourg and their duets that included the steamy 1969 song \u201cJe t\u2019aime moi non plus\u201d (\u201cI Love You, Me Neither\u201d).\nHer bag also had a nail clipper attached, because Birkin \u201cwas never one for long painted nails,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said.\nThe bag that Herm\u00e8s handmade for her, developed off its existing Haut A Courroies model, also has gilded brass hardware, bottom studs and other features that differ from commercial Birkins.\nBirkin's casual, breezy style in the 1960s and early 1970s \u2014 long hair with bangs, jeans paired with white tops, knit minidresses and basket bags \u2014 still epitomizes the height of French chic for many women around the world.\nWhen Birkin chatted to Herm\u00e8s' Dumas on the Paris-to-London flight about what her ideal handbag would be, she'd been in the habit of carrying her things around in a wicker basket, because she felt handbags in the 1980s were too small, Sotheby\u2019s said. She was traveling with her young daughter, Charlotte, and complained that she couldn\u2019t find a bag suitable for her needs as a mother, Herm\u00e8s says.\nHerm\u00e8s later gifted her four other Birkin bags. She kept the prototype for nearly a decade, before auctioning it for an AIDS charity in 1994. It was auctioned again in 2000 and has since been in private hands, Sotheby\u2019s said.\n\u201cMore than just a bag, the Birkin has evolved from a practical accessory to become a timeless cultural icon,\" the auction house said.\n\u201cIts presence spans the worlds of music, film, television and the arts,\" it added. \"It is a red-carpet staple, a fashion magazine mainstay, and a coveted piece in the wardrobes of celebrities, artists and stylists.\u201d\n___\nJohn Leicester reported from Le Pecq.\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

            "\u2018Gas belongs to the people\u2019: WA premier Roger Cook urges federal Labor to adopt reserve policy. The West Australian Labor premier, Roger Cook, has encouraged his federal counterparts to consider a gas reserve on the east coast as it mulls a regulatory overhaul to shore up supply and contain prices.\nCook said WA\u2019s gas reservation policy, which requires offshore producers set aside 15% of supplies for local users, has resulted in cheaper gas for households and business since it was introduced in 2006.\nAfter criticising Peter Dutton\u2019s gas reserve plan during the election campaign, the Albanese government is preparing to consider its own version as part of a six-month review of domestic gas market regulations.\nThe climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has signalled any mechanism would only apply to new projects, a key difference from Dutton\u2019s proposal.\nCook said the principle underpinning his state\u2019s policy was that \u201cgas belongs to the people of Western Australia\u201d and therefore households and industries should be the \u201cprincipal beneficiaries of those reserves\u201d.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s clear that domestic gas reservation policies do have a positive impact in terms of making gas more affordable for households and industry. That\u2019s our experience in WA, so obviously I\u2019d encourage other jurisdictions to consider the same,\u201d he said.\nCook cautioned any policy needed to be designed and explained \u201cin a way that industry understands\u201d.\nThe WA premier made the comments to Guardian Australia while in Japan, where he held talks with government officials and industry leaders about gas and energy transition.\nJapan is one of the biggest customers of Australia\u2019s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, importing the fossil fuel to help power its cities.\nJapanese companies are investors in projects such as Woodside\u2019s North West Shelf gas plant in WA and Santos\u2019 Barossa venture off the Northern Territory coastline, meaning the country has a direct interest in the expansion of Australia\u2019s gas industry.\nPolitical and industry figures in Japan have repeatedly sounded the alarm about Australian government policies which they warn threaten new supplies, including the safeguard mechanism and gas price cap, underlining how sensitive the Asian nation is to potential disruptions.\nIn the interview, Cook repeated his claim that exporting gas to countries such as Japan was vital to global decarbonisation because it would help displace coal, a supposedly dirtier fossil fuel.\nCook said stakeholders in Japan told him the country needed LNG to achieve its target of reducing coal to 19% of its energy mix by 2030, down from 32% in 2019.\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying to us is that they\u2019re committed to the energy transition towards renewables, getting out of fossil fuels, but they can only do that via LNG as part of the overall energy mix,\u201d he said.\nBill Hare, a WA-based physicist and climate scientist, said there was \u201cno scientific basis\u201d to support claims that maintaining gas exports was critical to the clean energy transition.\n\u201cPeople need to be really skeptical about in whose interest these arguments are made, given that the scientific community is saying we need to be phasing out of gas quickly,\u201d said Hare, who is the chief executive of Climate Analytics.\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially a Woodside argument that he\u2019s pushing.\u201d\nReferencing the ongoing toxic algal bloom in South Australia, floods emergencies in NSW and coral bleaching in WA, Hare said Cook\u2019s position on exports was \u201cnot a responsible position\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the interest of Australia,\u201d he said.\nHare also noted reports Japan was on-selling Australian LNG gas to other countries in Asia, which he argued was delaying the region\u2019s energy transition.",
            "Trump\u2019s Attack on CA Environmental Law Brings Us Closer to Climate Catastrophe. Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.\nEarlier this month, Donald Trump took his war against California and its web of environmental policies to a new extreme.\nAround the same time as he was federalizing the California National Guard and preparing to deploy hundreds of marines into Los Angeles, at Trump\u2019s behest, Congress was voting to overturn California\u2019s state laws phasing out the sale of new gas-based passenger vehicles by 2035, mandating an increase in the percentage of nonfossil fuel-based trucks sold, and limiting nitrogen oxide emissions for heavy duty and off-road vehicles.\nOn June 12, Trump signed the resolutions into law, overturning the California mandates. This is despite the fact that the Senate parliamentarian \u2014 who is in charge of interpreting Senate rules \u2014 and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) had concluded that this was an illegitimate use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) because California\u2019s waiver was an order subject to the Administrative Procedure Act rather than simply an agency rule that the CRA could overturn. It\u2019s technical stuff, but, basically, they were arguing that the CRA can only be applied to a very limited set of rules, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waiver fell outside of. In signing Congress\u2019s resolutions despite the GAO and Senate parliamentarian\u2019s concerns, Trump said he was rescuing the U.S. auto industry from destruction. In reality, by giving his stamp of approval to the political priorities of big oil, Trump was doing yet more damage to the global climate.\nUncompromised, uncompromising news\nGet reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.\nTrump, far and away the most anti-environment modern president, has long had California\u2019s state-level environmental standards in his sights. That includes targeting the half-century-old EPA waivers which allow the Golden State to establish pollution and emissions standards for vehicles that go above and beyond the federal minimums. In the last years of the MAGA leader\u2019s first administration, he pushed to roll back the waivers, resulting in a lengthy legal battle that was still unresolved when Joe Biden entered office, and his administration declined to defend the position of its predecessor.\nNow, in version 2.0 of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 with the entire federal government weaponized against climate research, mitigation efforts, and any policies that could move us away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable fuel alternatives \u2014 that campaign against California has accelerated. The gutting of the 2035 internal combustion engine phaseout effort is one part of this. The ongoing effort to eliminate the right of the state\u2019s Air Resources Board to set its own tailpipe emissions standards is another. Meanwhile, on the federal level, these efforts include the attacks on universities and on climate science and the gutting of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other federal agencies responsible for generating climate data. And this past week, the Supreme Court also put its thumb on the scales, ruling that a group of fuel producers could sue California over its vehicle emissions standards.\nThe implications of the move against California are stark: Because about a dozen other Democratic-led states follow California\u2019s lead on emissions standards and electric vehicle (EV) mandates, it has a huge role in shaping U.S. markets. California\u2019s bloc of states represents roughly 40 percent of the U.S. population \u2014 and since automakers are reluctant to have to hew to two separate markets within the country, they generally adhere to the highest common denominator when it comes to pollution standards. In other words, if California\u2019s pollution and EV mandates stand, the country\u2019s air gets cleaner and the shift away from fossil fuel reliance picks up steam, regardless of the priorities of the Trump administration. Moreover, this has an international magnifier effect, since many other countries also look to California when working out best practices for the shift away from fossil fuels. California helps make any kind of U.S. de facto adherence to Paris climate accord emissions reduction goals possible, even though Trump has, for the second time, withdrawn the country from the accord and prioritized the acceleration of fossil fuel production.\nIt\u2019s that realization that is driving Trump\u2019s animus here. He doesn\u2019t just want to end federal climate change efforts; he wants to destroy the ability of states to chart their own course on the issue. After all, this is the man who, during the election campaign, promised to enact Big Oil\u2019s every whim should the industry cough up $1 billion to pad his political war chest. Since that patently corrupt offer of a quid pro quo, he has repeatedly feted oil executives at Mar-a-Lago and in the White House, has ordered shuttered coal-based power plants to reopen, and has dismantled Biden-era tax subsidies for, and investments in, the development of an array of clean energy sources, from wind and solar farms to EV infrastructure.\nIf California\u2019s EV mandate is shredded, the country will use billions more gallons of gas over the coming years than it would have otherwise. In 2022, the California Air Resources Board estimated that the shift away from oil-based fuels for California\u2019s huge vehicle fleet would, by 2040, reduce CO2 emissions by 395 million tons, would result in 915 million fewer barrels of oil being used, and would result in thousands fewer deaths related to environmental pollution. Now, all that progress is being deliberately rolled back by the federal government, and for no good reason. It will, in consequence, be that much more difficult for the world to avoid passing critical tipping points in global warming. Yet in Trump\u2019s calculus, that calamity is more than outweighed by the short-term financial benefits for the fossil fuel industry that will accrue as the pump is primed to increase demand for their products.\nCalifornia is well aware of the stakes. Consider it a modern-day version of the automobile and gas industries\u2019 purchase and destruction of public transit tram lines in Los Angeles generations ago \u2014 a wanton act of industrial vandalism that turned Los Angeles from a city with a viable and expanding public transport system into the private car capital of the universe. That helped set the U.S. on a century-long trajectory that, with the exception of a few cities, prioritized private vehicle usage over public transit.\nIn the aftermath of the congressional voiding of the state\u2019s 2035 electric vehicle mandate, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order asking state legislators and the Air Resources Board to come up with alternative ways to stimulate the growth of the EV market and to protect its emissions standards, and to prioritize state contracts with companies meeting EV targets.\nAt the same time, the state\u2019s attorney general filed suit against Trump for an illegal use of the Congressional Review Act. The suit is being joined by 10 other states: Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.\nBecause the mandate was overturned through the Congressional Review Act, however, it typically wouldn\u2019t be subject to judicial review. This means that California\u2019s lawsuit, which is largely based around the parliamentarian\u2019s conclusions, is still something of a long shot.\nTrump\u2019s wrecking ball approach to environmental policy is continuing apace. Over the coming months, California and its blue state allies will need to work out a new strategy \u2014 one that moves beyond simply filing lawsuits \u2014 to get around the federal vise. If it can, then the blue parts of the United States might be able to maintain their environmental policies in the face of the MAGA onslaught and help reduce emissions for all of us; if it can\u2019t, the climate crisis will pick up evermore steam.\nKeep the press free.

            "Louisiana is latest state to redefine natural gas -- a planet-warming fossil fuel -- as green energy. Louisiana is latest state to redefine natural gas -- a planet-warming fossil fuel -- as green energy\nLouisiana is the latest state to redefine natural gas as green energy, even though it\u2019s a fossil fuel that emits planet-warming greenhouse gases\nLouisiana is the latest state to redefine natural gas as green energy under a new law the Republican governor signed this week, even though it's a fossil fuel that emits planet-warming greenhouse gases.\nThree other states led by Republicans\u2014 Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee\u2014 have passed similar legislation. In some Democratic-led states, there have been efforts to phase out natural gas. New York and California cities like San Francisco and Berkeley have moved to ban natural gas hookups in new buildings, though some of these policies have been successfully challenged in court.\nPresident Donald Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal, which all warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. The European Union previously designated natural gas and nuclear as sustainable, a move that Greenpeace and the Austrian government are suing over.\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a major booster of the state's petrochemical industry, says the new law \u201csets the tone for the future\u201d and will help the state \u201cpursue energy independence and dominance.\u201d\nEnvironmental groups say these new laws are part of a broader push by petrochemical industry-backed groups to rebrand fossil fuel as climate friendly and head off efforts to shift electric grids to renewables, such as solar and wind. It's \"pure Orwellian greenwashing,\u201d said Tim Donaghy, research director of Greenpeace USA.\nGlobally, the term green energy is used to refer to energy derived from natural sources that do not pollute \u2014 solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy. Louisiana's law could enable funds slated for state clean energy initiatives to be used to support natural gas.\nNatural gas has been the top source of electricity generation in the United States for about a decade, since surpassing coal. Coal and natural gas both produce carbon dioxide that warms the planet when burned, but coal produces over twice as much.\nSwitching from coal to natural gas lowers carbon dioxide emissions, but it can increase emissions of methane. The primary component of natural gas, methane is an extraordinarily powerful greenhouse gas, more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide and responsible for about 30% of today\u2019s global warming.\nBesides coal, everything else is better than gas for the planet, said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Building new gas plants locks in fossil fuel emissions for decades, he added.\nLouisiana\u2019s law orders state agencies and utilities regulators to \u201cprioritize\u201d natural gas, along with nuclear power, on the grounds that it will improve the affordability and reliability of the state's electricity.\nThe law\u2019s author, Republican Rep. Jacob Landry, runs an oil and gas industry consulting firm.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything crippling to wind or solar, but you got to realize the wind don\u2019t blow all the time and the sun don\u2019t shine every day,\u201d Landry said. The legislation \u201cis saying we need to prioritize what keeps the grid energized,\u201d he added.\nLandry told The Associated Press that he used a model bill by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a template. ALEC is a conservative think tank with ties to the oil and gas industry\u2019s billionaire Koch family.\nALEC helped shape Ohio\u2019s 2023 law to legally redefine natural gas as a source of green energy, according to documents obtained by the watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and first reported by the Washington Post.\nALEC spokesperson Lars Dalseide said that just because an Ohio lawmaker left the 2022 ALEC convention with what he described as a model for legislation to define natural gas as clean energy does not mean the group shaped Ohio law. Dalseide said the convention is \u201ca place where legislators from across the country gather to exchange ideas.\u201d\nOhio's legislation was also heavily influenced by an advocacy group led by Republican megadonor Tom Rastin, a now retired gas industry executive.\nAccording to Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, these laws are part of a long-running disinformation campaign by the gas industry to cast their product as clean to protect their businesses and prevent a shift to renewable energy sources that will address the climate crisis.\n\u201cThe goal is to elbow out competition from renewables from wind and solar, and in some cases preempt localities' ability to choose to pursue 100% truly clean energy,\u201d Anderson said, adding that ALEC's legislation makes natural gas \u201celigible for state and local clean energy standards and funding.\u201d\nGov. Landry and other proponents of the new law said they want to make sure that residents and businesses have a reliable electric grid. Nearly 80% of Louisiana\u2019s grid is already powered by natural gas.\nLandry said that businesses will come to Louisiana if they know they can count on the state's electric grid. He highlighted Meta's plan to build a massive AI data center powered by three natural gas plants.\nLouisiana\u2019s law orders utilities providers to prioritize nuclear energy as well. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases while producing electricity. However, critics say it is more expensive than solar and wind and the U.S. does not have a sufficient long-term solution for storing the waste.\nConsumer advocates say states do not need to embrace natural gas at the expense of wind, solar and other technologies to have a reliable grid.\nLegally mandating that utilities prioritize natural gas is \u201cblind to innovation, market evolution, and the practical demands of modern electric systems,\u201d Jeffrey Clark, president of the Advanced Power Alliance, a renewable energy advocacy group, wrote in a statement opposing Louisiana's law.\nIt's unclear to what extent Louisiana's utilities regulators will act on the order to prioritize natural gas over renewable energy. While Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, called the law \u201cunenforceable\u201d and pledged to ignore it, his Republican counterpart Jean-Paul Coussan said promoting natural gas \u201caligns well\u201d with the state's economic growth.\n___\nMcDermott reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n___\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Cairo telecom building fire kills 4 and injures 26\nA fire at a Telecom Egypt building in downtown Cairo has left four employees dead and 26 people injured\nCAIRO -- Egyptian officials said Tuesday a fire that engulfed a main telecom company building in downtown Cairo the day before left four people dead and over two dozen injured.\nThe blaze, which broke out at the landmark 10-story Telecom Egypt building and lasted for hours, began in one of the halls on the floor housing telecom operators and spread to other floors due to its intensity, authorities said.\nThe four dead were company employees who had been inside the burning building, according to their workers\u2019 union.\nHossam Abdel Ghaffar, the health ministry spokesperson, told The Associated Press over the phone the number of the injured increased from 14 to 26, including those who suffered from smoke suffocation. All were hospitalized and some have been discharged, he said.\nBy Tuesday morning, the upper part of the building was charred, and firefighters were still spraying water as smoke billowed from the top floors, though the massive flames had been contained, according to an AP photographer on site.\nThe blaze prompted a temporary outage of internet and mobile phone services. NetBlocks, a global internet monitor, wrote Monday on X that network data show national connectivity was at 62% of ordinary levels.\nThe outage also disrupted air traffic, but the civil aviation ministry said early Tuesday all halted flights have taken off.\nThe Egyptian Stock Exchange halted trading on Tuesday due to widespread disruption impacting the efficiency of the trading system.\nThe minister of communications, Amr Talaat, said in a statement that all communications services will gradually be fully restored within 24 hours and that they were transferred to more than one switchboard to operate as an alternative network\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",
            "News Wrap: Fire at assisted-living facility in Massachusetts kills at least 9. Leave your feedback\nIn our news wrap Monday, a fire at an assisted-living facility in Massachusetts killed at least nine people, Arizona's governor is calling for a federal investigation into why a wildfire along the Grand Canyon was not immediately put out and the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with dismantling the Education Department.\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nWilliam Brangham:\nWe start the day's other headlines in Massachusetts.\nAuthorities say a fire at an assisted living facility killed at least nine people. Dozens more were injured. The blaze broke out last night at the Gabriel House in Fall River about 50 miles south of Boston, leaving the front entrance heavily damaged. Firefighters say residents were hanging out of their windows, calling for help.\nThe facility is home to some 70 people. One man said he didn't realize what was happening until he opened his door.\nAlbert Almanza, Gabriel House Assisted Living Resident:\nAll the smoke from the hall went right in my face. And all that I could do was just stand there and choke. And I thought it was going to be the end of everything.\nAuthorities rescued him and dozens of others from the burning building.\nMeantime, a Massachusetts firefighters union say a lack of staffing hindered the response to the blaze. The cause of the fire is under investigation.\nArizona's governor is calling for a federal investigation into why a wildfire along the Grand Canyon was initially treated as a controlled burn and not immediately put out.\nAs of this afternoon, the Dragon Bravo Fire had burned around 6,000 acres and was zero percent contained. So far, it's burned some 80 structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge. The blaze was ignited by lightning strikes on the Fourth of July and quickly grew amid hot and dry conditions, prompting officials to close the area to visitors for the rest of the year.\nThe Supreme Court today cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with the dismantling of the Department of Education. The justices paused in order from a judge in Boston who had blocked the firing of nearly 1,400 workers. As is typical with such cases, the order was unsigned and gave no reasoning.\nBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent, joined by the court's other two liberal members. The order is technically temporary, as appeals make their way through the courts, but it is a major victory for President Trump, who had made the dismantling of that agency one of his signature campaign promises.\nTurning to the Middle East, authorities in Gaza say that Israeli strikes killed at least 31 Palestinians across the territory overnight. Hospital officials in the southern city of Khan Yunis said that at least 12 people were killed there, including three who were waiting at an aid distribution center. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas.\nAlso today, U.N. agencies are warning that fuel shortages are threatening their humanitarian operations. They say some hospitals have already gone dark.\nSeparately, Israel says it struck military tanks in Syria today amid new clashes between bedouin groups and local militias. Syrian officials say more than 30 people were killed, though the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the figure much higher. That U.K.-based war monitoring group says the violence erupted after a man from the Druze minority group was kidnapped by members of a bedouin tribe.\nSyria then deployed government forces to try and restore order. The clashes underscore the challenges facing Syria's new government after more than a decade of civil war. Israel has periodically involved itself in support of the Druze in Syria.\nStocks on Wall Street held near record levels today as investors shook off the latest tariff concerns. The Dow Jones industrial average added 88 points on the day. The Nasdaq climbed more than 50 points, or about a quarter of 1 percent. The S&P 500 also ended in positive territory.\nAnd France celebrated Bastille Day today. Air Force jets streamed past the iconic Arc de Triomphe, releasing the colors of the French flag as some 7,000 people marched up the Champs Elysees. The nation's biggest holiday marks the storming of the Bastille Fortress in 1789, a pivotal moment in the lead-up to the French Revolution.\nIt also comes amid an increased focus on national defense. A day earlier, President Emmanuel Macron pledged to double France's military budget by 2027. That's three years earlier than planned.\nWatch the Full Episode\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

Michael Casey, Associated Press\nMichael Casey, Associated Press\nKimberlee Kruesi, Associated Press\nKimberlee Kruesi, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nFALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) \u2014 A fire tore through an assisted living facility in Massachusetts, trapping residents inside, including some who were hanging out of windows screaming for help, authorities said Monday. Nine people died and at least 30 were injured in the blaze, which has been put out.\nFirefighters responded to the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River at about 9:50 p.m. Sunday and were met with heavy smoke and flames at the front of the building, the state Department of Fire Services said in a news release. About 70 people live in the house.\nThe fire was out by Monday morning and firefighters were able to get inside and rescue numerous occupants. About 50 firefighters responded, including 30 who were off-duty.\nMany of those rescued were taken to local and regional hospitals in varying conditions.\nJarren Oldrid described the scene as \u201cpretty terrifying\u201d as he tried to figure out if his 67-year-old father, Steven Oldrid, was safe. He found him recovering from smoke inhalation at a hospital.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of just a whirlwind of trying to figure out what\u2019s happening, how this could happen in such a major way,\u201d he said.\nFive firefighters suffered injuries that were not life-threatening, the statement said.\n\u201cThis is an unfathomable tragedy for the families involved and the Fall River community,\u201d said Chief Jeffrey Bacon.\nHe told reporters \u201cmultiple people were hanging out the windows looking to be rescued.\u201d Family members who showed up said police were trying to break windows.\nJoe Alves, who lives several houses down from the facility, said he was watching TV when he heard the wave of sirens and fire crews responding to the fire.\nHe said he saw officials pulling bodies and injured pets out of the building, with some pouring water bottles on burns as they desperately tried to help those in need.\n\u201cThere were people in wheelchairs, a lot of people missing limbs, it was terrible,\u201d he said, choking up slightly.\nThe Fall River Police Department in a statement said that \u201cwithout hesitation, officers entered the smoke-filled facility, breaking down doors and escorting residents to safety.\n\u201cApproximately a dozen non-ambulatory residents were physically carried out by our officers. Their bravery and quick action undoubtedly saved many lives.\u201d\nThe origin and cause of the fire are under investigation, state and local authorities said.\nGabriel House opened in 1999 and has 100 units, according to Massachusetts Executive Office of Aging & Independence. An email was sent to an office spokesperson Monday seeking comment on the home\u2019s inspection records.\nEmail and phone messages also were left at Gabriel House. A worker at the scene declined to comment to an Associated Press reporter.\nFall River, which has about 94,000 people, is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of Providence, Rhode Island.\n\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press reporter Kathy McCormack in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed to this story.\nYour donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

            "Diddy prosecutors are tallying his past sins ahead of an October 3 sentencing &mdash; including some a jury cleared him of. Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is hoping for zero jail time when he is sentenced on October 3.\n-\nBut prosecutors want the judge to weigh violence and drug evidence for which he was acquitted.\n-\nThey say they'll submit a list of \"offense conduct\" to federal probation officials by Friday.\n-\nFederal prosecutors say they are spending this week making a list of all the ways Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is a criminal \u2014 including some offenses he has been acquitted of \u2014 to use against him at his October 3 sentencing.\nProsecutors are drafting a confidential, so-called \"summary of offense conduct\" they say they'll submit to federal probation officials by Friday, according to a pre-sentencing schedule approved by the judge on Tuesday.\nIt's promising to be a long list, full of drug use and domestic violence that Combs has been acquitted of as elements of the unsuccessful sex trafficking and racketeering charges, but which he has also admitted to repeatedly since the start of the trial.\nMore than a dozen prosecution witnesses described violence and drug use during the two-month trial.\n\"Sean Combs has a temper, and when he drank, or when he did the wrong drugs, he would get violent \u2014 my client is not proud of that,\" defense lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in May 12 opening statements.\nBut \"domestic violence is not sex trafficking,\" Geragos told the jury repeatedly.\nThe defense \"mea culpa\" appears to have worked. Jurors apparently did make the distinction, convicting him only on two transporting for prostitution counts.\nCombs was acquitted of top counts that alleged he essentially ran his businesses as a mob boss, and that he used drugs and violence to coerce two girlfriends into years of \"freak offs,\" sexual performances with male escorts.\nBut these defense drug and violence admissions, strategic during trial, may come back to haunt Combs at sentencing, according to defense attorneys and former prosecutors.\nThese experts told Business Insider that judges can consider prior bad acts \u2014 even acts that resulted in acquittal \u2014 in sentencing, especially when the defendant has admitted to them.\nCombs faces anywhere from zero jail time up to 20 years in prison on the two prostitution charges. Prosecutors said last week that they may seek somewhere in the four-to-five-year range, but warned that those numbers will very likely be revised upward.\n\"They're going to go full blast,\" defense attorney and former prosecutor Michael Bachner predicted of prosecutors on Tuesday.\n\"They can say the defendant is somebody who was admittedly a violent individual,\" he said.\n\"And they can also bring up his prior arrest record,\" said Bachner, who was part of the defense team that won gun possession and bribery acquittals for Combs and a former bodyguard in a 2001 trial in state court in Manhattan. Probation officials will use the defense list in drafting a pre-sentencing report that will recommend an amount of jail time, the former prosecutor said.\nProsecutors will have to ask the judge to consider acquitted conduct if they hope to win anywhere near a 20-year, maximum sentence, former federal prosecutor Nadia Shihata, who prosecuted the R. Kelly sex trafficking case, told BI after the verdict.\nThe judge can decide if there was a preponderance of evidence proving those acquitted crimes, she told BI.\n\"If so, 20 years is more likely,\" she said, adding that she believes the ultimate sentence will be far less.\nCombs has remained behind bars since his arrest in mid-September.\nAfter Wednesday's verdict, US District Judge Arun Subramanian denied Combs' fourth request for bail, a decision that left the rap mogul in a federal jail in Brooklyn.\nCombs will remain jailed at least until October 3, the current date for his sentencing.\nThe jury found that Combs knowingly arranged for R&B singer Cassie Ventura and a later girlfriend, who testified pseudonymously as \"Jane,\" to crisscross the country for drug-fueled hotel sex sessions.\nAgnifilo had asked after the verdict that Combs be released on $1 million bail and allowed to live at his homes in Miami and Las Vegas while awaiting sentencing. He argued the conviction on the more minor charges didn't warrant being held without bail.\nBut the judge agreed with lead prosecutor Maurene Comey, who argued that Combs faces significant jail time and remains a threat, as a trio of federal judges has found in denying bail in the weeks after his arrest.\nCombs continued to break the law last year after his homes were searched when he knew he was under investigation, the judge said.\nCombs has admitted, through his lawyers, to domestic violence and drug use, the judge said.\n\"You, full-throatedly in your closing argument, told the jury that there was violence here,\" the judge told lead attorney Marc Agnifilo in denying bail on Wednesday.\n\"And domestic violence is violence.\"",
            "Sean 'Diddy' Combs' Sentencing Set For Oct. 3 After Split Verdict In Federal Sex Crimes Case. NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs will be sentenced in his federal criminal case on Oct. 3, a judge said Tuesday after probation officials rejected the defense and prosecution\u2019s plan to move the date up by about two weeks.\nCombs, who remains jailed after a split verdict last week, spoke briefly to his lawyer Marc Agnifilo during a virtual hearing on the scheduling issue that lasted all of two minutes. At one point he asked the lawyer to turn on his camera so they could see each other\u2019s faces.\nThe hip-hop mogul\u2019s lawyers had been urging Judge Arun Subramanian to sentence him as soon as possible after jurors acquitted him last week on racketeering and sex trafficking but convicted him on two prostitution-related charges.\nCombs, 55, faces up to a decade in prison for each of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for flying people around the country, including his girlfriends and male sex workers, for sexual encounters. A conviction on racketeering conspiracy or sex trafficking could have put him in prison for life.\nPrior to Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Combs\u2019 lawyers and prosecutors filed a joint letter proposing a Sept. 22 sentencing date, subject to the consent of the U.S. Probation Office. A short time later, they filed a second letter stating that all parties \u2014 including the probation office \u2014 were on board with the Oct. 3 date Subramanian originally proposed.\nCombs got a standing ovation from fellow inmates when he returned to jail after the verdict last week, Agnifilo said. The Bad Boy Records founder will remain at the federal lockup in Brooklyn where he\u2019s been held since his arrest last September after Subramanian last week rejected his request for bail.\nThe judge, citing a now-infamous video of Combs beating a former girlfriend and photographs showing injuries to another ex-girlfriend, made clear that he plans to hold Combs accountable for the years of violence and bullying behavior that were exposed at his eight-week trial.\nCombs\u2019 lawyers want less than the 21 to 27 months in prison that they believe the sentencing guidelines recommend. Prosecutors contend that the guidelines, when properly calculated to include Combs\u2019 crimes and violent history, call for at least four to five years in prison.\nCombs\u2019 punishment is Subramanian\u2019s decision alone, and the judge will have wide latitude in determining a sentence. While judges often adhere to the federal judiciary\u2019s formulaic guidelines meant to prevent disparity in sentences for the same crimes, they are not mandatory.\nAs part of the sentencing process, Combs must give an interview to probation officers for a pre-sentence investigation report that will aid the judge in determining the proper punishment.",

            "State Department to begin mass layoffs of about 1,800 employees in coming days. The State Department informed U.S.-based employees on Thursday that it would soon begin laying off nearly 2,000 workers after the recent Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to move forward with mass job cuts as part of its efforts to downsize the federal workforce.\nThe agency's reorganization plan was first unveiled in April by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to eliminate functions and offices the department considered to be redundant. In February, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing Rubio to revamp the foreign service to ensure that the president's foreign policy is \"faithfully\" implemented.\nEmployees affected by the agency's \"reduction in force\" would be notified soon, Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources Michael Rigas told employees in an email on Thursday.\n\u2018IT WILL HAPPEN QUICKLY\u2019: STATE DEPT POISED TO ACT AFTER SUPREME COURT GREEN-LIGHTS AGENCY LAYOFFS\n\"First and foremost, we want to thank them for their dedication and service to the United States,\" Rigas said in the email.\n\"Every effort has been made to support our colleagues who are departing, including those who opted into the Deferred Resignation Programs \u2026 On behalf of Department leadership, we extend our gratitude for your hard work and commitment to executing this reorganization and for your ongoing dedication to advancing U.S. national interests across the world,\" he added.\nThe department did not specify on Thursday how many people would be fired, but in its plans to Congress sent in May, it had proposed laying off about 1,800 employees of the 18,000 estimated domestic workforce. Another 1,575 were estimated to have taken deferred resignations.\nSOTOMAYOR BREAKS WITH JACKSON IN SUPREME COURT DECISION OVER TRUMP CUTS TO FEDERAL WORKFORCE\nThe plans to Congress did not state how many of these workers would be from the civil service and how many from the foreign service, but it did say that more than 300 of the department's 734 bureaus and offices would be streamlined, merged or eliminated.\nOnce affected staff have been notified, the department \"will enter the final stage of its reorganization and focus its attention on delivering results-driven diplomacy,\" Rigas said in the email to colleagues.\nThe expectation is for the terminations to start as soon as Friday.\nState Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters earlier on Thursday that the only reason there had been a delay in implementing force reductions is because the courts have stepped in, as she said the mass layoffs would be happening quickly.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"There has been a delay \u2013 not to our interests, but because of the courts,\" Bruce noted. \"It's been difficult when you know you need to get something done for the benefit of everyone.\"\n\"When something is too large to operate, too bureaucratic, to actually function, and to deliver projects, or action, it has to change,\" she said.\nReuters contributed to this report.",
            "Trump news at a glance: state department plans mass layoffs in line with president\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policy. The state department has announced that it plans to move forward with mass layoffs as part of the most significant restructuring of America\u2019s diplomatic corps in decades. Officials say the cuts will align their mission with Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision.\nThe layoffs, which are commonly called reductions in force (or RIFs), along with voluntary redundancies, will affect nearly 15% of the state department\u2019s domestic staff. A senior department official said that was close to 1,800 people. The restructuring will also see several hundred bureaus merged or eliminated entirely.\nMeanwhile, in the courts, a judge has blocked Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship order and certified a class-action lawsuit, one of many challenging the order.\nHere are the key US politics stories at a glance:\nState department to push ahead with mass layoffs The state department has gone forward with the layoffs, which were long expected, after the US supreme court sided this week with the Trump administration against a federal judge\u2019s hold on plans for mass government firings that could affect hundreds of thousands of federal employees.\n\u201cIn the coming days, the department will be communicating to individuals affected by the reduction in force,\u201d read a memo attributed to Michael Rigas, the deputy secretary for management and resources, announcing the layoffs. \u201cFirst and foremost, we want to thank them for their dedication and service to the United States.\u201d\nRead the full story\nJudge blocks Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship order Donald Trump \u2019s attempt to end birthright citizenship suffered a courtroom defeat on Thursday as a federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the controversial executive order nationwide and certified a sweeping class-action lawsuit that could protect tens of thousands of children.\nRead the full story\nBrazil to retaliate against Trump\u2019s 50% tariff threat Brazil is drawing up plans to hit back against 50% US tariffs on the country\u2019s exports, setting the stage for further escalation in Trump\u2019s trade war with Latin America\u2019s largest economy.\nThe US president vowed to impose steep duties on Brazilian goods on Wednesday, accusing the country of conducting a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against its previous president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing a trial over his attempt to overturn his 2022 election defeat.\nRead the full story\nUS will impose 35% blanket tariffs on Canadian imports, Trump says in letter Donald Trump said on Thursday the US would impose a 35% tariff on imports from Canada next month and planned to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most other trade partners.\nIn a letter released on his social media platform, Trump told Mark Carney , the Canadian prime minister, the new rate would go into effect on 1 August and would go up if Canada retaliated.\nMahmoud Khalil files $20m claim against Trump officials Lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil , the Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist who was detained by the Trump administration for months, have filed a claim for $20m in damages, alleging Khalil was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite as the government sought to deport him over his prominent role in campus protests.\nThe filing \u2013 a precursor to a lawsuit \u2013 names the Department of Homeland Security, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the state department. \u201cThey are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable,\u201d Khalil said. \u201cUnless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.\u201d\nRead the full story\nTrump\u2019s inaugural fund received $19m from fossil fuel industry The fossil fuel sector poured more than $19m into the president\u2019s inaugural fund, accounting for nearly 8% of all donations it raised, a new analysis shows, raising concerns about the White House\u2019s relationship with big oil.\nRead the full story\nPlanned Parenthood offices begin rejecting Medicaid At least two regional Planned Parenthood affiliates have notices on their websites telling patients that, due to a provision in Republicans\u2019 new tax-and-spending bill that \u201cdefunds\u201d the reproductive healthcare giant, they can no longer accept Medicaid.\nRead the full story\nWhat else happened today:\nSix Secret Service agents have been suspended without pay after the assassination attempt against Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally last July.\nFederal immigration officials carrying out raids on two southern California cannabis farms clashed with protesters , firing chemical munitions to disperse the crowd.\nTrump appointed his transportation secretary , Sean Duffy, as interim administrator of Nasa, six weeks after withdrawing the nomination of an Elon Musk ally for the role.\nExplained: why is Trump going after Brazil?

Here\u2019s what happened on 9 July 2025 .",
            "US state department issues first of 1,350 termination orders after court lifted ban. The US state department has begun issuing the first of more than 1,350 termination notices as part of a huge reorganisation of America\u2019s diplomatic corps under the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, according to internal documents and US diplomats at the state department on Friday.\nCareer diplomats and other staff began to receive the notices on Friday morning, days after the supreme court lifted a ban on the Trump administration moving forward with mass firings of government employees that will affect hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\n\u201cHearing \u2018I got mine!\u2019 around the floor,\u201d one current state department employee told the Guardian.\nIn an internal email obtained by the Guardian on Friday, state department workers were told that nearly 3,000 employees would leave as part of a vast reorganisation meant to align the department\u2019s goals with Donald Trump\u2019s stated goal of putting America first.\n\u201cThis [Reduction in Force] comprises 1,107 civil service and 246 Foreign Service employees with domestic assignments,\u201d read the email. Another 1,600 employees are believed to have left the service via a voluntary redundancy scheme in recent months.\nThe state department had confirmed on Thursday that it planned to move forward with the layoffs.\nThe cull of approximately 15% of the state department workforce is unprecedented for the diplomatic corps, and confusion over the process as well as the temporary court injunction against mass firings of government employees have made the rollout even more chaotic.\n\u201cAt a moment of great global instability \u2013 with war raging in Ukraine, conflict between Israel and Iran, and authoritarian regimes testing the boundaries of international order \u2013 the United States has chosen to gut its frontline diplomatic workforce,\u201d said a statement from the American Foreign Service Association, a professional group that represents US diplomats. \u201cWe oppose this decision in the strongest terms.\u201d\n\u201cMorale has been rock-bottom since they announced [the reorganisation],\u201d one US diplomat told the Guardian. \u201cI think for some people the fact it is finally happening is a relief but it\u2019s awful,\u201d the person added.\nSome advocacy groups reported that the state department was unable to process the hundreds of RIFs simultaneously due to the limitations of internal systems.\n\u201cThe state department has apparently encountered a problem with the RIF software that caps the number of emails that can be sent out at a time, so rather than one big RIF at 10.30am tomorrow, we may see \u2018Rolling RIFs\u2019 throughout the day,\u201d wrote Karl Stoltz, co-president of the Public Diplomacy Council of America, in an email to members.\nA senior state department official said: \u201cThis is simply not true. Email systems always take time to roll these out, and the timeline has been consistent with expectations. We did not have plans for one big email blast at a specific time, and did not indicate any such time to the workforce.\u201d\nMembers of the PDCA and other groups that support federal employees were expected to meet at the state department at 4pm on Friday in order to \u201cclap out\u201d employees who had received RIFs and to \u201cprotest the department\u2019s actions\u201d.\nA senior state department official on Thursday told journalists that the department was \u201cgoing to work to handle this in a manner that preserves, to the maximum extent possible, the dignity of federal employees and foreign service officers and civil servants who are affected by this.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for anyone,\u201d the official said.\nThe layoffs were also criticised by Democratic senators, who said that the administration\u2019s decision \u201cundermines our national security\u201d.\n\u201cWhile there are targeted reforms that our government can pursue to maximize the impact of every tax dollar, that\u2019s not what this is,\u201d read the statement, which was co-signed by 10 Democratic senators, including Senator Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the US Senate foreign relations committee.\n\u201cThere are active conflicts and humanitarian crises in Ukraine, Sudan, Gaza, Haiti and Myanmar \u2013 to name a few. Now is the time to strengthen our diplomatic hand, not weaken it. From pursuing peaceful resolutions to out-competing China diplomatically and economically, we can\u2019t afford to not have experienced diplomats at the table.\u201d"

DWP State Pension alert over extra \u00a3694 for people born after 1951\nYou could receive hundreds more if you defer your pension\nPeople of State Pension age born after 1951 could be in line for a bonus \u00a3694.\nMen born on or after April 6, 1951, and women born on or after April 6, 1953, can claim the new State Pension once they reach State Pension age.\nAnyone born before these dates will receive the basic State Pension.\nOnce you reach State Pension age, which is currently 66, your pension is not automatically given to you.\nYou have to inform the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that you want to claim it.\nBut if you choose not to, you could add some extra cash to your pension pot.\nREAD MORE: Prince William and Kate Middleton delete social media post after awkward blunder\nThe DWP will send you a letter asking if you want to either claim your State Pension or defer it, Express reports.\nYou should receive the letter no later than two months before you reach State Pension age.\nIf you want to defer your State Pension, you do not have to do anything.\nIt will bee automatically delayed until you decide to claim it.\nDeferring it could pocket you up to \u00a3694.20 - if you delay for a whole year.\nIf you reach State Pension age on or after April 6, 2016, then your pension pot will increase every week you defer, providing you defer for at least nine weeks.\nCurrently, for each nine weeks you defer, your State Pension will increase by 1 per cent.\nThis works out as just under 5.8 per cent for a whole year, or \u00a3694.20.\nThe new State Pension is currently worth \u00a3230.25 a week if you get the full rate.\nBy opting to defer for 52 weeks, you can get up to \u00a313.35 extra per week - amounting to \u00a3694.20 over a year.\nNot everyone is eligible to get the full new State Pension rate of \u00a3230.25, so if you get less than this then you might need more National Insurance qualifying years to boost your weekly payments.\nIf you receive the new State Pension, you need at least 10 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get any new State Pension.\nAnyone entitled to the full amount will get a \u00a3470 boost per year after the new State Pension was uprated by 4.1 per cent in April at the start of the new tax year.\nThe DWP said: \"With uprating in effect, pensioners receiving the full basic State Pension will see their weekly payments rise from \u00a3169.50 to \u00a3176.45 per week, worth an additional \u00a3360 a year.\n\"In addition, the full rate of the new State Pension will increase from \u00a3221.20 to \u00a3230.25 per week, an increase of \u00a3470 a year.\"\nMinister for Pensions Torsten Bell added: \"Raising the State Pension and rescuing the NHS \u2013 these are this government\u2019s priorities to give all pensioners the dignity they deserve in their retirement.\n\"Those who have worked hard throughout their lives, paying into the system, are owed nothing less.\n\"We\u2019re improving the lives of millions of pensioners through our \u00a37.84 billion additional funding for the State Pension this year.\n\"That means up to \u00a3470 extra in pensioners\u2019 pockets from this week and comes alongside our work to boost Pension Credit uptake, and the \u00a326 billion we\u2019ve invested in the NHS that has seen waiting lists in England fall for 5 months in a row.\"\nDon't miss the biggest and breaking stories by signing up to the BirminghamLive newsletter here.",
            "DWP explains why some state pensioners get 'reduced' payments. DWP explains why some state pensioners get 'reduced' payments\nThe DWP was asked in Parliament to clarify the rules around the state pension\nA DWP minister has explained why some pensioners may see a cut in their payments when they start to claim the state pension. An MP raised the issue in Parliament, with Liberal Democrat MP Victoria Collins asking the Government a question about \"state pension integrated practices\".\nSpecifically, she wanted to know whether the DWP had examined the impact on particular groups, including those with lower earnings while working and on women state pensioners. She also asked if there were any plans to review relevant guidance or legislation.\nPensions minister Torsten Bell provided a response from the Government. He first explained the concept of integrated pensions: \"The aim of 'integrated' pension schemes is to provide a more predictable and stable pension income over time where a person's occupational pension comes into payment before their state pension.\n\"This is achieved by paying a higher pension before the person reaches state pension age, which is subsequently reduced when their state pension comes into payment.\" Integrated pension plans are arranged by employers, with the plans factoring in your social security benefits as part of the total payout.\nAs part of your pension payouts are accounted for by your social security payment such as the state pension, you don't have to pay in so much into the scheme. But this does mean you will get a lower private pension payout when you start to get your state pension.\nA larger pay reduction\nThe current state pension age for both men and women is 66, with a gradual increase to 67 scheduled between April 2026 and April 2028. Mr Bell conceded that lower-paid and female pensioners may experience a larger reduction in their private pension, as a proportion of their entitlement, when their state pension begins.\nHe clarified: \"This is due to societal and labour market issues during their working lives, which has resulted in these groups having, on average, lower earnings and therefore receiving a lower pension from the scheme.\" He emphasised the importance of people having clear information about how their occupational pension scheme operates so they can make \"informed decisions\" about their retirement.\nMr Bell also said that trustees are obliged to share relevant information with members of their pension scheme, including how integration would impact their payouts. The minister also offered some advice for pensioners: \"If someone does not think that their scheme has been sufficiently clear about the way integration will affect their pension, they should use the scheme's internal dispute resolution service, which every scheme is required to have.\n\"If they are not satisfied with the outcome, they can take the matter to the Pensions Ombudsman.\" However, the minister also explained that the exact design of a person's pension benefits is between them and the trustees, and is not within the DWP's jurisdiction.\nHe said: \"Pension scheme rules on the calculation of benefits are many and varied and are a matter for employers and scheme trustees to decide.\"",

            "Can AI help solve India&rsquo;s food and water insecurity?. Fred de Sam Lazaro\nFred de Sam Lazaro\nLeave your feedback\nOne of the largest challenges facing India: how to sustain food production for 1.4 billion people amid deteriorating soil quality, diminishing water supplies and climate change. For some, including hundreds of artificial intelligence startup companies, the challenge represents a business opportunity. From India, Fred de Sam Lazaro reports.\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nAmna Nawaz:\nOne of the largest challenges facing the world's most populous nation is food security, how to sustain food production for 1.4 billion people in India amid deteriorating soil conditions, diminishing water supplies and climate change. For some, including hundreds of artificial intelligence start-ups, the challenge represents a business opportunity.\nFrom India, Fred de Sam Lazaro reports.\nFred de Sam Lazaro:\nFrom all appearances, this vineyard looks very healthy, but its owner must stay constantly on guard for pests or disease that can wipe out a crop, another challenge, persistent water shortages.\nNarayanappa Murthy, Farmer:\nWater, full scarcity.\nWater is very scarce.\nNarayanappa Murthy:\nEspecially water management is very difficult.\nJust over a year ago, Narayanappa Murthy signed on to a service that, for between $30 and $70 a year, offers a bounty of useful data. A sensor constantly monitors soil and leaves for moisture, which, along with weather data, is analyzed with artificial intelligence to provide guidance precisely tailored to this farm. It's led to big savings.\nFifty to 60 percent cutback.\nSo you have saved 60 percent?\nSixty percent.\nIn your water bill?\nWater bill and power bill.\nMurthy has branched out to grow pomegranates and added a newer model of the sensor made by an agriculture tech start-up called Fyllo.\nMan:\nIrrigation, all the way, it will be the same.\nFyllo has seen robust growth since its founding five years ago.\nShriyog Norlawar, Institutional Sales Lead, Fyllo:\nWe are working with almost 10,000-plus farmers.\nShriyog Norlawar, Fyllo's sales chief, says, in many cases, the company's product has made the difference in keeping farmers in business.\nShriyog Norlawar:\nThe usage of water is four to five times excessive than it should be. We have saved around 90 billion liters of water.\nThe smartphone app tied to their devices is accessible in multiple languages, he says.\nWe have developed modules for all kinds of crop for its irrigation management and for its nutrition management also in addition.\nA.I. has enabled the ability to interpret massive amounts of raw data collected in the field or via satellites.\nKrishna Kumar, Co-Founder, Cropin:\nToday, we have like 0.5 billion records of farm data from 103 countries on 500 crops and 10,000 varieties of those crops.\nIn 2010, Krishna Kumar founded Cropin, another among scores of agriculture tech start-ups.\nKrishna Kumar:\nNow this model predicts the future.\nMost of his clients are large multinationals like Walmart and Pepsico, who are provided real-time intelligence about supplier farms across their far-flung supply chains.\nWhat is the risk approaching? What disease can hit your farm in like seven to 15 days? What yield you can expect? We layer thousands of variables on every unit of the farm, and then we scale that to a country in the supply chain.\nSo you can factor the data for various use cases, whether it's a sourcing decision, policymaking decision, you want to go to a newer country to grow a newer variety, how that variety will perform in that country.\nBased in India's tech capital, Bangalore, Cropin, Fyllo and others have generated lots of interest in financial markets. The question is, are they really improving this country's food security?\nFor the majority of India's farmers, who own only small plots of land, artificial intelligence might hold some promise, but their problems go well beyond the scope of A.I. It's no use knowing when to irrigate, for example, when you don't irrigate your farm and depend on rainfall. It's no use knowing what market prices are when your produce can't get to the market on time.\nAmit Prakash, International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore: Almost 80 to 90 percent of our farmers are smallholders.\nAmit Prakash teaches technology and ethics at the Indian Institute of Information Technology in Bangalore.\nAmit Prakash:\nWhen we start looking at them as problems who need a solution that comes to them from either Bangalore or California or anywhere else or New Delhi, then I think we have started with a bias.\nAnd that bias against small rural farmers has been the pattern for some decades when it comes to bringing technology to agriculture, he says. Data cannot capture the whole picture, for example, sending a farmer advisories that they can get a better price for their produce in market two instead of market one.\nThey would still take it to market one because they have been transacting with a person, a commission agent in market one, since their grandfathers' time. Those kinds of relationships matter quite a lot.\nSmallholder farmers, many living in poverty with little formal education, can ill afford risk, he says, and so they rely heavily on such relationships, the familiar. That applies to getting advice as well.\nKnowledge absorption is better if I hear it from someone who I have seen or who I am able to relate to better.\nAnd trust, basically.\nTrust, yes, and proximity. The person who is talking about whatever they have done on their farm is also a farmer like me.\nWoman:\nWe saw how farmers learn from one another through informal social networks.\nThat peer-to-peer approach is used by a group called Digital Green.\nNidhi Bhasin, CEO, Digital Green Trust:\nWe are very clear. We are addressing the smallholder farmer.\nNidhi Bhasin leads the nonprofit group started in 2008 and now serving farmers in India and parts of Africa. It began with YouTube videos, with farmers sharing insights with each other, but has now evolved to a chatbot called Farmer.chat\u2026\nWe have built a multilingual A.I. chatbot system.\n\u2026 offering vetted expertise, weather and market information in the farmers' native languages.\nNidhi Bhasin:\nLocalize cost-effective information advisory, which will help them to increase their incomes. We're also sending them certain information which is very contextual. It's something\u2026\nIt's less foreign to the farmers.\nYes, it's less foreign.\nChandrakala and husband Keshava Murthy have used it to help plan a climate-smart, sustainable farm with livestock, timber, fruits and vegetables.\nKeshava Murthy, Farmer (through interpreter):\nPeople think agriculture means losses, and I want to prove that it's sustainable with short-, middle- and long-term strategies.\nThey showed me how Farmer.chat guided them to find a natural cure, neem oil, for a disease threatening their lemon trees.\nChandrakala Murthy, Farmer (through interpreter):\nI can use the phone to ask any number of questions.\nDigital Green has tried in particular to reach women farmers and to work in more impoverished regions like India's Bihar state. In all, it serves 160,000 farmers in India and East Africa, meeting a tiny fraction of the need, Nidhi says.\nThe group is trying to look to partner with private for-profit players.\nWe also want a good balance between the two approaches.\nDo you need to make those partnerships in order to scale further, you think?\nYes, from a scale point of view.\nProfessor Prakash agrees all A.I. players should have a role in sustaining small farmers, and it will take government too, he says, to update farm policies and infrastructure. Most of all, it will take farmers, he says.\nWe have to bring in the small farmers. We have to hear what they have to say, not from the perspective of providing them with a solution, but designing a solution along with them.\nAlong with them, at 150 million smallholder farmers, most of them marginal and struggling, but still a critical pillar of India's economy.\nFor the \"PBS NewsHour,\" this is Fred de Sam Lazaro in Bangalore.\nAnd Fred's reporting is a partnership with the Under-Told Stories Project at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota.\nWatch the Full Episode\nFred de Sam Lazaro is director of the Under-Told Stories Project at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, a program that combines international journalism and teaching.

            "Dairy farmers say worker shortage is threatening UK food security. Dairy farmers have warned that a long-running shortage of workers, exacerbated by Brexit and the pandemic, has put the UK\u2019s food security under pressure.\nFive in six farmers who have looked for workers said they have received very few or zero applications from qualified people for their job vacancies, according to a survey of dairy producers by Arla, the UK\u2019s largest dairy cooperative and the owner of the Lurpak and Cravendale brands.\nThe fifth annual poll of Arla\u2019s 1,900 British dairy farmers has highlighted the worsening struggle to find workers with the right skills and experience, with 79% of farmers highlighting this problem in 2021, rising to 84% this year.\nThe difficulties in hiring staff had grown worse since Brexit and the pandemic, milk producers reported, as the combination of the end of free movement for EU workers and other economic factors since Covid have made it harder to find suitable staff, while there has been a similar story across the whole of the agricultural sector.\nNearly half (48.6%) of those surveyed said it was now harder to retain staff than it was before Brexit and the pandemic, while only 5% said the situation had improved.\nMore than one in 10 (13%) respondents said they would leave farming altogether in the next 12 months if there was no improvement in labour shortages, and 6% said they had been forced to cut the amount of milk they produced.\nArla itself has seen a reduction in milk producers over the past few years, although production volumes have remained constant. Its membership has fallen by about 300, from 2,100 three years ago, as farmers have retired or through consolidation of farms, amid a trend for keeping larger herds. Arla members represent almost a third of all UK dairy farmers.\nNearly 200 British dairy farmers quit the industry over the 12 months to April 2025, according to the most recent figures from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), taking the total number of producers to 7,040.\nThe industry has been warning for some time that a continued exodus of dairy farmers could jeopardise the UK\u2019s current self-sufficiency in liquid milk.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the real impact of these workforce shortages on our farming industry, whether that\u2019s in higher costs or lower milk production,\u201d said Bas Padberg, managing director of Arla Foods UK.\n\u201cThe effect of this is ultimately going to be seen in the price and availability of products on the supermarket shelves, affecting the millions of people that rely on dairy as a source of nutrition in their diet.\u201d\nArla \u2013 which, like other companies, runs its own apprenticeship schemes as well as industrial placements \u2013 said the government had acknowledged the ongoing difficulties with recruiting staff, and welcomed the focus on talent and development as part of the upcoming food strategy.\nHowever, Padberg called for \u201cpractical steps that the industry, the education sector and government can take together\u201d to attract more people, especially younger workers, to the dairy sector.\nDairy, like much of the rest of agriculture, has an ageing workforce and nearly half (47%) of farmers are aged 55 and over. Younger workers are most likely to enter the industry if it is in the family: two-thirds (66%) of farmers said their farms had been passed down at least four generations, while only 3% of respondents said they were first-generation.",
            "Wisconsin Dairy Processors: Hold ground in state budget, securing continued support. MADISON, Wis. (July 3, 2025) \u2014 The Wisconsin Dairy Products Association (WDPA) highlighted dairy industry and rural Wisconsin investments included in the newly signed 2025-27 Wisconsin State Budget that will benefit the state\u2019s dairy processors, farmers, and rural communities. The budget reflects bipartisan recognition of dairy\u2019s critical role in Wisconsin\u2019s economy, while also identifying areas where continued advocacy and innovation will be necessary.\n\u201cWe are grateful to the Wisconsin Legislature and Governor Evers for recognizing the importance of dairy to Wisconsin\u2019s economy and the need to support our rural communities,\u201d said Amy Winters, Executive Director of WDPA. \u201cWhile this budget takes meaningful steps, there is still work to do to ensure that dairy processors and the rural communities that support them can thrive.\u201d\nContinuation of Essential Investments \u2014 Funding Maintained or Reduced:\nDairy Innovation Hub: Continued funding at approximately $7.8 million annually to sustain dairy research and workforce development.\n-\nExport Competitiveness: The Wisconsin Initiative for Agricultural Exports (WIAE) was not expanded or made permanent despite its success. The Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association, WDPA and other partners, had requested an increase to $2 million annually, with permanent program authorization, to build on export growth and create sustained market opportunities for Wisconsin dairy. While we are disappointed that the program was continued as a one time appropriation at previous funding levels, we are thankful that the program is able to continue.\n-\nAgricultural Road Improvement Program (ARIP): Reauthorized at $150 million for the biennium, including $30 million dedicated to rural bridges and culverts\u2014reflecting steady but not expanded investment.\n-\nCDL Driver Training Grants: Reauthorized Funding of $500,000 through the Department of Workforce Development, continuing support for driver training to strengthen supply chain resilience for dairy transport.\n-\nWorld Dairy Expo: Continued modest support of $40,000 over the biennium without an increase; WDPA will continue advocating for sustained and enhanced funding for this globally recognized event and WDPA partner.\n-\nMeat Processor Grants: Reduced to $1.6 million over the biennium ($800,000 annually), down from approximately $2 million total in the previous biennium. The program continues to provide essential support for small and mid-sized meat processors who are critical to Wisconsin\u2019s agricultural infrastructure.\n-\nMeat Talent Development Program (MTDP): Continued with $810,800 in base funding for FY 2026\u201327. While the Governor proposed expanding the program following its initial $5 million ARPA investment, the final budget maintains only base-level support. This program helps address shared workforce challenges in both the meat and dairy processing sectors\u2014particularly as more dairy farms adopt beef-on-dairy genetics to meet market demand and ensure processing capacity for cull cows and dairy-beef crosses.\n-\nModest but Meaningful Increases:\nDairy Processor Grant Program: Increased to $600,000 annually, a $100,000 annual increase over the previous budget. This will help fund an estimated two to three additional grants each year. WDPA, along with the Wisconsin Cheesemakers Association, Dairy Business Association, and other partners, had requested an increase to $1.2 million annually to meet growing demand for plant modernization and safety improvements.\n-\nCounty Conservation Staffing: Nearly $30 million to sustain and strengthen county-level conservation efforts. This supports soil and water management that directly benefits dairy farmers and processors by preserving land and water quality essential to agriculture.\n-\nGeneral Transportation Aids: A 3% annual increase, adding approximately $43 million statewide to help maintain local roads critical to the transport of dairy products.\n-\nBadgerCare and Rural Health Investments: Over $1.1 billion in funding to bolster healthcare services in rural areas. This amount includes a Medicaid Hospital Assessment Increase, which adjusts the hospital assessment rate to 6%, securing more than $1.5 billion in federal matching funds to help keep rural hospitals viable and accessible.\n-\nNew Investments:\n-\nDairy Cattle Innovation Grant: $20 million in new funding to advance dairy research, herd management, and production innovation\u2014helping ensure Wisconsin\u2019s dairy sector remains competitive.\n-\nLocal Roads Improvement Program (LRIP): $100 million dedicated to enhancing transportation infrastructure, consistent with the supplemental investments made in the previous biennium.\n-\nHarbor Assistance Program: $50 million to improve port infrastructure\n-\nFood Security Grants: $10 million dedicated to expanding access to local foods, including dairy products, for food-insecure populations. WDPA and coalition partners had advocated for $30 million over the biennium to better meet increasing food bank needs and support the inclusion of locally produced dairy.\n-\nDATCP Animal Health Staffing: New funding to increase veterinary and animal health preparedness, vital in light of disease threats like H5N1.\n-\nEmployerSponsored Child Care Grant Program: $162,400 in FY 2026 and $5.35 million in FY 2027 for grants for businesses establishing or supporting child care services for employees. The program\u2019s structure, eligibility criteria, and award sizes will be developed by the Department of Administration. This funding may help address accessibility challenges in rural areas and support dairy processors that rely on shift work and 24/7 operations\n-\nItems Advocated for but not included\nVeterinarian Loan Repayment Program: WDPA along with the rest of the ag coalition advocated for a pilot program to provide $5 million over the biennium to help qualified large animal veterinarians offset a portion of the debt incurred in pursuit of their veterinary medicine degrees in return for their full-time employment as a veterinarian for at least four (4) years in a rural area in Wisconsin. We will continue to advocate for this program and funding to address ongoing shortages of rural large animal veterinarians\u2014shortages that directly impact dairy farms and processors.\n-\n\u201cWe are proud to work alongside state leaders, farmers, and processors to advance Wisconsin\u2019s dairy industry,\u201d Winters added. \u201cWDPA will continue to advocate for solutions that strengthen our rural communities, support innovation, and ensure Wisconsin remains America\u2019s Dairyland for generations to come.\u201d"

An Elegant Answer to the Wrong Question (or an Incomplete One)\nRodney Garrett and Peter Zimmerman of the NY Fed have produced a paper studying the effect of clearing on derivatives counterparty risk exposures. It is basically an extension of the Duffle-Zhu paper from a few years ago. It studies more realistic networks and a more diverse set of scenarios than D-Z. It demonstrates that with a variety of network structures, clearing actually reduces netting efficiency and increases counterpart risk exposures. This is especially true with \u201cscale free\u201d or \u201ccore-periphery\u201d networks, which are more realistic representations of actual derivatives markets than the all-to-all structure in D-Z. They show that when the system relies on relatively few crucial nodes, as is the case in most dealer structures, clearing reduces netting efficiency. This, as Garrett and Zimmerman note, could explain why clearing has not been adopted voluntarily. It also raises doubts about the advisability of clearing mandates, inasmuch as the alleged benefit of clearing is a reduction in counterparty credit exposures.\nA few comments. The results, taken on their own terms, make sense. In particular, networks connecting dealers and customers via derivatives transactions, are endogenous. And although network structures are not necessarily efficient due to network externalities and path dependence, there are forces that lead to minimizing credit exposures. thus, although it would be Panglossian to assert that existing structures minimize these exposures, it should not be surprising that interventions that lead to dramatic alterations to networks increase counterparty risk exposures as existing networks are configured at least in part to reduce these exposures.\nMore importantly, though, there is the issue of whether counterparty risk exposure in derivatives transactions is the proper metric to evaluate the effect of clearing mandates. As I have noted for years (as has Mark Roe), when participants in derivatives transactions have other liabilities, changes in netting efficiency in derivatives primarily redistribute wealth to or from one group of creditors (derivatives counteparties) from or to other creditors (e.g., unsecured lenders, commercial paper purchasers, deposit insurers). Netting and offset essentially privilege the creditors that can use them, at the expense of others who cannot. So telling me policy A reduces counterparty risk exposures by netting provides me very little information about the systemic effects of the policy. To understand the systemic effects, you need to understand the distributive effects across the full set of creditors impacted by the change in derivatives netting efficiency induced by the policy\u2013and that would be every creditor of derivatives market participants. This paper, like all others in the area, does not do that.\nPut another way. Papers in this literature say little about systemic risk because they only analyze a piece of the system. The derivatives-centric approach is of little value in assessing systemic risk. To analyze systemic risk, you need to analyze the system, not a piece of it.\nWhat\u2019s more, shuffling around credit risk is probably not the most important effect of clearing mandates, even though it receives the vast bulk of the attention. As I\u2019ve written repeatedly in the past, including here, clearing reduces credit risk by increasing liquidity risk, most notably, through variation margining which results in the need to obtain cash in a hurry to meet margin calls, which can be large when there are large market shocks. The expansion of clearing to OTC markets which dwarf listed derivatives potentially leads to orders-of-magnitude increases in liquidity needs.\nIt is these liquidity demands which create huge potential systemic risks. Financial crises are usually liquidity crises: mechanisms such as clearing increase demands for liquidity in stressed market conditions, and do so in a way that increases the rigidity and tightness of the coupling in the financial system. This is extremely dangerous. Tight coupling in particular is associated with system failure in a variety of real world systems including both financial and non-financial systems.\nIndeed, all of the attempts to make CCPs invulnerable all tend to exacerbate these problems. This raises the possibility that CCPs could be bastions surviving in the midst of a completely rubbled financial system.\nIn sum, papers like the Garrett-Zimmerman work are very elegant and technically sophisticated, and help answer a question: Does clearing reduce derivatives counterparty risk exposures? But all the elegance and technical sophistication is likely for naught given that the question is the wrong question, or a very incomplete one.",
            "Streetwise Professor \u00bb 2010 \u00bb April. In some respects, the debate over clearing has been at cross purposes. Those who advocate clearing, including many in the banking community, often focus on the chaotic events that accompany the default of a large OTC counterparty, such as Lehman or LTCM; advocates of clearing argue that a central counterparty can mitigate the disruptions associated with a large failure. Those, like me, who are skeptical of mandates (but who are not averse to clearing if freely chosen by market participants, as has occurred in energy, freight forwards, and many interest rate swaps) focus on the incentive and information effects that affect behavior prior to a default.\nI confess to being less than clear about the distinction, and therefore think it\u2019s worthwhile to address these issues in more detail.\nIn essence, the distinction is between ex ante and ex post. I have focused on the ex ante incentives, whereas others have focused on ex post issues. Both are important. (This parallels distinctions that transactions cost economists sometimes draw between agency theory and property rights models, which focus, on ex ante incentives, and Williamsonian governance theories, which focus on the ex post management of contractual relationships.)\nOf course, the ex ante and ex post issues are not unrelated. Ex ante incentives affect the positions and risks that are undertaken, and hence affect the likelihood of a major default. Resolution mechanisms affect the cost of dealing with default. The expected cost of clearing vs. bilateral mechanisms for allocating counterparty risk is, roughly, given by the probability of a major default (which depends on the ex ante incentives) times the cost of such a default (which depends on the ex post resolution mechanism). It is not evident a priori whether this product is larger under a cleared or uncleared system, hence the grounds for legitimate debate over the merits of clearing.\nThere is a colorable case that the combination of multilateral netting and the existence of a central counterparty that can coordinate the transfer and replacement of defaulted positions can reduce the cost conditional on a default occurring. Multilateral netting reduces the magnitude of the positions that need replacing. This reduces the stress on market liquidity resulting from a default. Moreover, clearing facilitates the transfer of customer positions to solvent clearing members, thereby avoiding the necessity of replacing these positions via market transactions, further reducing said stress. Moreover, the information that a CCP possesses about total positions, and its ability to coordinate the hedging/replacement of the defaulted risks can reduce uncertainty and mitigate price impact. (Although it should be noted that the experience of the CME with the Lehman problem, as documented by the Valukas report, and as suggested by what I have learned from informed sources that the LCH unwind of the Lehman positions was not as breezy as LCH has suggested demonstrate that this is at best a relative statement.)\nSome research that grew out of the \u201987 Crash sheds light on this last issue. An interesting paper by Greenwald and Stein (JOB, 1988) shows that normal, continuous trading mechanisms can exhibit poor performance during periods of market stress caused by a large shock to the volume of transactions (especially when this shock is accompanied by an increase in fundamental uncertainty). In essence, there are execution price risks under these circumstances that create negative externalities. Potential replacement counterparties are reluctant to trade in these circumstances because of the extreme uncertainty about execution prices during periods of large volume shocks. This tends to reduce liquidity, which tends to exacerbate the execution price risk.\nThis means that the uncoordinated replacement of large numbers of defaulted positions by a large number of firms through the use of ordinary, continuous market mechanisms (whether OTC or exchange) can lead to substantial price changes that are not fundamentally driven, but are microstructural in origin. This can have further knock-on effects, as these (distorted) market prices affect collateral/margin calls, can induce asset fire sales, etc.\nThus, a plausible characterization of a key trade-off between bilateral and cleared structures is: (a) counterparty risks are more efficiently priced and shared in a bilateral setting, and hence moral hazards and adverse selection problems are less acute in that setting; (b) further, hub-and-spoke clearing networks create concentrated points of failure that are more problematic than more distributed (but still concentrated) bilateral networks; but (c) a cleared system reduces replacement cost risks/price impacts conditional on default.\nWhich raises the question: is it possible to obtain the information benefits associated with bilateral arrangements for some transactions, while mitigating the price impact of an uncoordinated replacement of defaulted positions? Can we have our cake and eat it too?\nPut differently, clearing is a bundle of functions including inter alia: (1) the pricing of counterparty risks; (2) the mutualization of losses not covered by collateral; and (3) the management of risk associated with defaulted positions, and the replacement of these positions. I argue that for many transactions and transactors, bilateral mechanisms are superior for (1) and (2); I recognize that CCPs may do (3) better. Is there any way to get the benefits of (3), without incurring the disadvantages that CCPs arguably face with (1) and (2)?\nI think that this could be possible. In essence, it would involve pre-commitment to a suspension of normal, continuous trading activities in the event of a default by a large market participant (a dealer, such as Lehman, or a big hedge fund, such as LTCM), and its replacement with an auction-type mechanism. (This is the essence of the Greenwald-Stein recommendation for \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d that replace continuous trading with a call auction. The key difference is that the Greenwald-Stein circuit breakers are price-contingent, which has some problematic features, whereas what I am proposing is default-contingent.)\nISDA implemented a \u201cBig Bang\u201d auction protocol to facilitate the settlement of CDS positions in the event of the default in a named credit. Although as I predicted in my post on this subject some years back, this protocol has not eliminated all problems with pricing the debt of defaulted credits (as shown in a recent Markit Magazine article), it has greatly smoothed the process of handling CDS-triggering credit events. Perhaps something similar could be designed and implemented to deal with a big derivatives default.\nISDA could of course play a central role in shepherding the creation of such a mechanism. Similarly, regulators, notably the NY Fed, could also play a constructive role, perhaps in both the design and implementation. I am pretty sure that ISDA would be quite willing to engage in such a cooperative endeavor.\nThe process would of course be facilitated by the development of robust trade repositories that permit rapid determination of the positions that are defaulted against. I have supported the creation of such repositories (see my Regulation magazine piece) from the outset.\nJust thinking out loud, here are some ideas of a potential structure.\nFirst, a compression round whereby multilateral exposures are netted. (This would have implications for bankruptcy priorities and bankruptcy law; these implications would have to be weighed carefully and addressed).\nSecond, an auction round for replacement of positions. This auction round would follow a disclosure, based on the information in the trade repository, of all the positions, to the potential bidders.\nThe auction round raises several issues that need to be considered. Who would be allowed to participate? Permitting anyone to participate could just be a jump from the frying pan into the fire if some of the winning participants are themselves in dodgy financial condition. (This is a dilemma that CME faced in its Lehman auction, and likely explains why it limited participation in the auction of Lehman positions).\nAnother issue is that the number of positions to replaced can be immense, and highly heterogeneous, with many non-standardized contracts. Perhaps one way to deal with the latter would be to auction off shares of portfolios, e.g., USD interest rate (swap, swaption, etc.) positions; FX positions; equity derivatives; and so on. This would mitigate cherry picking/adverse selection problems and simplify the bidding. It would, however, mean the splitting of some individual contracts among multiple counterparties. (It should be noted, though, that many of the positions would not be cleared or even clearable in any event, so this issue is not eliminated by a clearing mandate.)\nYet another issue is that those assuming positions would be taking on counterparty risk. Thus, the repository would have to disclose the counterparties to the defaulted contracts to the potential bidders.\nSo, I realize that there are many thorny operational issues that must be addressed to implement this proposal. But some would exist under a clearing mandate because not everything would be cleared in any event. I further realize that FRBNY and the dealer community tried to do some of this on the fly in the \u201cLehman weekend,\u201d and in LTCM years before. The Lehman attempt foundered (as Theo Lubke of FRBNY, and several bankers I spoke to, indicated at the ISDA AGM). But perhaps this is not surprising as extemporizing on the fly in those conditions faces faint chances of success, particularly given the lack of information available to the participants; a pre-planned mechanism that can rely on more complete information is almost certain to work better. I would also note that in a cleared market something like this will have to be in place in any event.\nThe logic behind my approach is pretty straightforward. Whenever things are bundled, the immediate question should be: can efficiency be enhanced by unbundling them? (A lot of what goes on in finance involves unbundling things and allocating the pieces in a value-enhancing way.) Sometimes you can\u2019t: so be it. But sometimes you can.\nClearinghouses bundle counterparty risk pricing, counterparty risk management (including the collateralization mechanism), mutualization, position information collection, and default resolution. There is no logic that says that those functions have to be bundled. Repositories can collect and aggregate information, perhaps more effectively than CCPs (because they can incorporate information on non-cleared positions, and information on positions held across CCPs). CCPs are not always the best at counterparty risk pricing and collateralization mechanics. Mutualization can have some extremely problematic features. So why not an approach that unbundles, and allows specialization in these various functions?\nOnce repositories are created, the development of a robust, coordinated defaulted contract resolution/replacement mechanism would go a long way to improving the efficiency of the OTC derivatives market while permitting it to continue to do what it does best. This would be an easier process (though not a simple one) than what will be set in motion by the vast expansion of CCPs as contemplated in the pending legislation. CCPs will have to develop resolution procedures in any event. Moreover, it is desirable to develop procedures to deal with contracts that are not cleared (which will be the most challenging ones in any event). But force-fed CCPs will also have to grapple with challenging pricing, risk management, risk sharing, and governance issues as well. And if there are multiple CCPs, there will have to be some coordination of the resolution procedures. (If there isn\u2019t there will be trouble.) So, a mandated and extensive expansion of CCPs will have to solve many more problems than just the resolution mechanism. So why not just focus on that?",
            "Streetwise Professor \u00bb 2012 \u00bb January. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed that I haven\u2019t written much about clearing lately. (And yes, I can hear the Hallelujah Chorus.) Simple reason, really. Most of the clearing related news warrants schadenfreud, and an \u201cI told you so\u201d response. I enjoy a good Lulz as much as the next guy, but I know it gets old.\nBut this article hits on so many things at once I have to impose on you all. It basically gives the lie to all the justifications for the clearing mandates in Frankendodd.\n1. The advocates of mandates, notably GiGi and Timmy! asserted repeatedly that clearing would reduce the connectedness of the financial system, and in particular, would reduce the importance of big banks in those connections. I argued in response that clearing mandates would just change the topology of the network; that it would remain densely connected; big banks would still be tightly connected; and that the new topology was not obviously less systemically risky than the old one.\nFrom the article:\nWhere do you find the spare $2 trillion needed as collateral for cleared swap trades?\nWith new regulation in the US and Europe set to move the bulk of the over-the-counter derivatives market towards central clearing from next year, swap buyers and dealers will soon be faced with that very question. Many custody banks believe they could provide the answer.\nAlready heavily involved in the plumbing of the clearing market, custodians act for almost every major financial services firm without a custody arm \u2013 including most dealers and every clearing house.\nMost also offer collateral management services, including securities lending and collateral improvement \u2013 the process of turning less-liquid securities into eligible collateral to post as surety in transactions.\nThis experience could prove invaluable with the advent of new swap clearing rules, which come in with the expected implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act in the US from early next year, increasing the demand for collateral transformation services.\nDavid Field, managing director with banking consultancy Rule Financial, said: \u201cThe buyside simply doesn\u2019t have enough quality collateral available to lodge for clearing.\nExecuting brokers are expecting to generate strong post-trade revenues from collateral transformation \u2013 but the custody banks are the ones holding the collateral.\nThis is a huge opportunity for custodians, and several are already investing anywhere between $50m and $100m to position themselves.\u201d\nIn other words, big custodial banks will be even more tightly connected with all major participants in the derivatives trade because of their comparative advantage in providing collateral transformation, and the strong economies of scope between providing this service and providing other custodial services.\n2. The advocates of mandates argued that it would reduce leverage in the system. I responded repeatedly that this was not at all obvious, and that the most likely effect would be to transform the nature of leverage. The big move to collateral transformation makes it abundantly clear that this is in fact happening. I go into this in much more detail in my forthcoming Journal of Applied Corporate Finance article titled \u201cClearing and Collateral Mandates: The New Liquidity Trap?\u201d\nCredit means credit risk. So the clearing mandate has not eliminated credit risk from the derivatives market, or even reduced it sharply. It has just transformed it, relocated it. And it has definitely not eliminated derivatives-related credit risk from big banks. Indeed, it is moving more risk to some big banks. BNY-Mellon and JP Morgan are also the most important settlement banks, and play a vital role in the repo market. This is already a source of systemic risk. These banks are arguably the most important pieces of the financial infrastructure, and these developments will make them even more important, and also concentrate more risks from disparate markets (e.g., repo and derivatives) in them.\n3. The advocates of mandates asserted that it would make the derivatives market less concentrated and more competitive (although nb these are NOT equivalent). From the article:\nTech-heavy effort\nAmong the most ambitious to gain business in the swaps market is BNY Mellon, the world\u2019s largest custodian with $25.8 trillion of assets under custody. The bank sees its existing footprint as a springboard towards dominance in the collateral services market for OTC derivatives.\n[A director] for collateral management and clearing at BNY Mellon in London, believes it will be a tech-heavy effort. He said: \u201cAccording to recent Isda Margin Survey figures, roughly 80% of collateral used in the OTC swaps market is cash, with about 15%-20% being fixed-income securities.\nIf even 20% of the estimated extra $2 trillion of collateral required to clear OTC swaps via central counterparties is in the form of securities, that puts a big onus on the collateral managers to offer smart, quick systems capable of handling huge draws on client collateral daily.\u201d\nRival US custodian State Street has also been boosting its presence in the cleared derivatives markets, launching a swaps clearing operation in September. In a signal of intent, the bank has quietly begun hiring senior futures brokers from established rivals.\nCharley Cooper, senior managing director at State Street Global Markets, said: \u201cState Street\u2019s unconflicted approach combined with the operational efficiencies gained from clearing with a custodian, gives us a significant edge in the emerging clearing marketplace.\u201d\nA senior derivatives banker said that clients are already looking at custodians as a viable counterparty.\nHe said: \u201cIn the past six months, we\u2019ve seen growing migrations to the custodial clearing business.\nSome have a better credit rating than almost every investment bank, and it\u2019s unlikely they will be subject to capital ring-fencing regulations.\u201d\nHe said that if a major custodian is able to convert even half of its existing custody clients into clearing clients, it could be looking at a share of anywhere between 10% and 20% of the OTC clearing market.\u201d\nThe incumbents\nBut existing derivatives flow dealers \u2013 especially ones with large custody and treasury businesses \u2013 are unlikely to shy away from a revenue-generating opportunity.\nCitibank, in particular, is hoping to combine a swaps clearing operation with its custody and treasury services in the US.\nJerome Kemp, global head of exchange-traded derivatives and OTC clearing at Citi, is in no doubt which direction the market is heading.\nHe said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a re-dealing of the cards in the derivatives clearing space. Post-Dodd-Frank implementation, clearing will be led by the larger, well-capitalised banks.\u201d\nCiti hired aggressively to expand its futures commission merchant business last year, including the hire of Kemp, previously co-head of listed derivatives and clearing at JP Morgan, who arrived with a raft of colleagues.\nKemp thinks the next battleground for the bigger futures commission merchants, which will act as clearers for many firms on the buyside, could hinge on the bundling of services across clearing and asset servicing.\nJP Morgan, meanwhile, is also looking to leverage its existing prime services footprint for its hedge fund clients for whom swaps clearing will be a new experience.\nThe bank has merged its listed and OTC clearing teams, and invested heavily in client roadshows and clearing masterclasses since the Dodd-Frank Act was passed in 2010.\nDale Braithwait, a member of JP Morgan\u2019s OTC clearing team, said: \u201cIt\u2019s to our advantage that we\u2019re a big collateral manager too.\nFor a lot of asset managers, who do not feel they are able to use prime brokerage services, it\u2019s a big benefit to have someone who can act as a custodian and a clearer.\u201d\nSo there is a big fixed cost to play in this game. The resulting scale economies tend to increase concentration. Moreover, there is a strong scope economy across collateral management and transformation services, and other custodial services. Meaning that the big custodian banks have a strong competitive advantage in providing the new collateral management and transformation services that will become a crucial component of the OTC derivatives markets.\nIt is particularly ironic that BNY-Mellon will be a major beneficiary of this. You might recall the execrable NYT piece (written by Louise Story) about the evil derivatives dealer cabal. One of the most memorable parts of the article was BNY\u2019s whinging about its inability to break into the dealer space. Read this new piece and you can just imagine BNY execs rubbing their hands together in glee, throwing their heads back, and laughing an evil laugh. All your cabal belong to us.\nSo let\u2019s summarize, shall we? Clearing mandates (and requirements to collateralize uncleared swaps) will result in the formation of new links between buyers and sellers of swaps (including dealer banks who do not offer custodial services) and a handful of major custodian banks. These links will involve the extension of credit, and hence the existence of derivatives-related counterparty risk in which big banks still have substantial exposure. If anything, the mandates will increase concentration in an important part of the derivatives market. Moreover, it will arguably increase the concentration of credit risk exposure in a handful of systemically important banks.\nWell played! The actual results of Frankendodd will be the exact opposite of what was claimed by its tireless advocates (And yeah, I\u2019m looking at you, Timmy! and GiGi. I\u2019m trying not to look at Barney, but that\u2019s a whole other story.)\nUnintended consequences, indeed. Unintended, but predictable\u2013and predicted."

Senior arts correspondent Jeffrey Brown has answers to that question from two of our regulars, Ann Patchett and Maureen Corrigan. It's for our arts and culture series, CANVAS.\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nGeoff Bennett:\nWith summer in full swing, you might be wondering what books to take along on vacation or enjoy right at home.\nAmna Nawaz:\nSenior arts correspondent Jeffrey Brown talks with two \"News Hour\" regulars who have answers to that question.\nIt's part of our arts and culture series, Canvas.\nJeffrey Brown:\nAnd for ideas for your summer reading, we have two of our favorite readers and recommenders, Maureen Corrigan, a professor at Georgia University and book critic for NPR's \"Fresh Air,\" and Ann Patchett, acclaimed author, most recently of the novel \"Tom Lake,\" and owner of Parnassus Books in Nashville, where she joins us.\nMaureen and Ann, it's really nice to talk to you both again.\nAnn, you want to start with maybe two or three novels, fiction?\nAnn Patchett, Owner, Parnassus Books:\nYes, absolutely.\nAll right, I'm starting off with a book called \"The Correspondent\" by Virginia Evans. This is an epistolary novel. Epistolary novels usually don't work, but this one does. It's about a grouchy, older woman who lives alone, who in the course of the book makes more and more connections to neighbors, to friends. It's a really beautiful, beautiful book, a debut.\nWay to go, Virginia. And then..\nAnd it says a cause for celebration by Ann Patchett on the cover.\nAnn Patchett:\nYes, right? Exactly. Everything \u2014 that's the thing about owning a bookstore and being an author. My name winds up on a lot of books.\nKathy Wang's \"The Satisfaction Cafe\" just came out. And, again, it's a very quiet, funny, smart book in which you don't think a whole lot is going on. And then more and more and more happens. It follows one woman over the course of her life in the Bay Area. Think Anne Tyler, just beautifully written, quiet, simple, and very, very smart, very entertaining.\nMaureen, what do you have?\nMaureen Corrigan, NPR Book Critic:\nOh, gosh.\nSummer to me is mystery and suspense fiction. So, S.A. Cosby, who is one of the greatest crime writers alive today, his latest book is called \"King of Ashes.\" And it's about a young man, a successful financier who returns to his hometown in Virginia, where his father has been the victim of a mysterious hit-and-run.\nThis young man has to figure out how to save the family business, which is a crematory. His father is the king of ashes. He's the owner of the crematory. How to save it from the clutches of a mob that now controls the town. Cosby is tough, he's rough, and that crematory gets a lot of action. So I warn readers who don't like the grisly stuff, that's there, but he is fantastic.\nThey do go for it, right?\nMaureen Corrigan:\nHe goes for it, and it feels very authentic.\nAnother book that I would recommend is \"El Dorado Drive\" by Megan Abbott. Megan Abbott is an amazing suspense writer who seems to specialize in closed communities of women that turn very weird very quickly. And this book is set in Detroit, which is Abbott's hometown, early 2000s. Detroit is down on its luck. A bunch of women get together and join a finance club and they spout all these slogans about female empowerment.\nAnd yet this club also turns out to be a Ponzi scheme. So there's that.\nOK, how about nonfiction, Ann? Give us two, OK?\nAll right, two.\n\"Who Is Government?\" Michael Lewis, I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. One, it is a pure pleasure to read. He has a great group of authors that he's working with, Geraldine Brooks, Casey Cep, Dave Eggers, whole group, each one writing about a specific person in a particular branch of government, the Food and Drug Administration, the IRS, the Department of Justice, and talks about the work that they are doing and the enormous impact it makes on all of our lives.\nAnd we never knew that these people were doing these amazing things. This is absolutely the book for right now. And it pairs beautifully with another book I love, John Green's \"Everything is Tuberculosis.\" John Green, our most famous young adult author, is obsessed with tuberculosis, tuberculosis in history, but also tuberculosis here and now.\nWhy is it that this completely curable disease is still killing so many people, and what will happen when we no longer are giving money to the World Health Organization to save those people's lives?\nOK, Maureen?\nOK, summer sea stories. So one of my recommendations is \"A Marriage at Sea\" by Sophie Elmhirst, which is a fantastic true story about a young couple in the 1970s in England who decide that they want to build a boat.\nThey're not wealthy, lower middle class. They want to build a boat, chuck everything, and live at sea. Everything is wonderful.\nNot at the beach, but really at sea, right?\nNo, out there. Out there. Everything is terrific until about a year into the voyage. They're in the middle of the Pacific, and they encounter a whale who breaches the boat. The boat sinks within minutes, and they are left for four months out on a rubber raft in the middle of the Pacific. So it tests the marriage. It also tests endurance, right?\nSo that's one. And then a land story\u2026\nIt's like, you think you got troubles in your marriage, right?\n(Laughter)\nWell, it does make you wonder, would I really eat raw birds to survive?\nThe other story is definitely on firm ground, \"The Salt Stones\" by Helen Whybrow.\nAnd Whybrow was an editor earlier in her life, worked in publishing. And then \u2014 but for the last 20 years, she and her husband have been on a farm in Vermont, and she has been raising Icelandic sheep. This is not my fantasy. This is not my world. But, boy, does she take me as a reader out there into the meadow with her and make me feel how everything is interconnected in that meadow.\nSo I strongly recommend that one.\nOK, now I asked you both for either a children's book or something that you go back to reread, an old classic. And I understand you have been talking on the side here and come up with a surprise.\nI know we both love it.\n\"Mister Dog\" lives by my desk at home. It's by Helen (sic) Wise Brown, who gave us \"Goodnight Moon,\" which is a weird story.\nSure.\nThis is an even weirder story, I think. It's the last book she wrote before her untimely death. And it's about a dog named Crispin's Crispian. And he's named that because he owns himself, he belongs to himself.\nAnd it does what great children's books, what great books, period, do. It takes you into a world you would never have imagined. And you just want to stay there.\nAll right, I wasn't expecting that.\nWell, Ann, give us one last children's book or young adult. What have you think you got?\nYes, OK.\n\"In the Wild\" by Zadie Smith and Nick Laird, right? Zadie Smith, our greatest writer, has written about a weird little guinea pig in a judo suit. This is the sequel to her book \"The Surprise.\" And in this one, the guinea pig's owner, Maud, is going camping. Guinea pig gets into the backpack, the way they do, and goes off into the wilderness.\nIt is such a strange, terrific book. Love it. Love it.\nAll right, I know this could go on a long time, but we have to stop somewhere.\nAnn Patchett and Maureen Corrigan, thank you both very much.\nWatch the Full Episode\nIn his more than 30-year career with the News Hour, Brown has served as co-anchor, studio moderator, and field reporter on a wide range of national and international issues, with work taking him around the country and to many parts of the globe.

            "Samsung flags big miss in second-quarter profit, citing U.S. AI chip curbs on China. Samsung Electronics on Tuesday projected a 56% drop in second-quarter operating profit from a year earlier, far worse than analysts expected as its sales of artificial intelligence chips slowed in the United States and China.\nThe world's largest memory chipmaker blamed the profit miss on U.S. restrictions on advanced AI chips for China, but analysts said the earnings slump was also due to delays in supplying chips to key U.S. customer Nvidia.\nSamsung said in a statement on Tuesday that its improved high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products were undergoing customer evaluation and proceeding with shipments, without elaborating further.\n\"The DS Division recorded a quarter-on-quarter decline in profit due to inventory value adjustments and the impact of U.S. restrictions on advanced AI chips for China,\" Samsung said in a statement.\nSamsung estimated an operating profit of 4.6 trillion won for the April-June period, versus a 6.2 trillion won LSEG SmartEstimate.\nThat would be its weakest in six quarters, down from 10.4 trillion won in the same period a year earlier and 6.7 trillion won in the preceding quarter.\nRevenue would likely fall 0.1% to 74 trillion won from a year earlier, the filing showed.\nThe earnings miss will fuel investor doubts about Samsung's fundamentals, although its earnings are expected to recover gradually in the third quarter helped by rising sales of HBM chips to non-Nvidia customers and new phone launches, said Greg Roh, head of research at Hyundai Motor Securities.\n\"The worse-than-expected profit will be negative for investor sentiment,\" he said.\nSamsung said earnings in its foundry business also fell, driven by sales restrictions and related inventory value adjustments stemming from U.S. export controls on advanced AI chips for China, as well as continued low utilisation rates.\nLast year, the U.S. ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers that are often used in AI applications, Reuters reported.\nSamsung said it expects the operating loss in its foundry business to narrow in the second half of the year as utilisation improves in line with a gradual recovery in demand.\nThe company is expected to release detailed results including a breakdown of earnings for each of its businesses in late July.",
            "Verizon's plan: Consumers win, investors lose. Verizon has brought back its unlimited data plan. That's great if you're a Verizon customer. But it is terrible news for its investors.\nVerizon (VZ) stock fell nearly 1.5% in early trading Monday. It's now down about 10% so far this year, making it the Dow's worst performer of 2017.\nVerizon's move is a clear sign the company has to pull out all the stops to remain competitive with wireless rivals AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS).\n\"In recent months, both T-Mobile and Sprint had some success taking additional share from Verizon by virtue of their unlimited offerings,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report Monday morning.\nThat may explain why shares of T-Mobile and Sprint, which is now controlled by Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, are both up this year while Verizon is down. T-Mobile and Sprint have also been perennially linked as possible merger partners.\nBut the new telecom price war isn't the only problem for Verizon.\nAT&T recently acquired satellite broadcast provider DirecTV, a move that makes Ma Bell more competitive against Verizon in the battle to control people's living rooms. Verizon offers its own FiOS broadband TV service.\nRelated: Verizon brings back unlimited data plans\nAnd AT&T is also making a much bigger bet on content, with plans to purchase CNN's parent company Time Warner (TWX). Verizon already owns AOL and is looking to buy the core assets of Yahoo to bolster its own digital content offerings.\nBut the Yahoo (YHOO) deal could fall apart in the wake of revelations of massive data breaches at Yahoo over the past few years.\nYahoo recently said it hopes that the deal with Verizon will close in the second quarter of this year. It was originally supposed to be finalized by the first quarter.\nHowever, in its latest earnings release, Verizon simply said that it \"continues to work with Yahoo to assess the impact of data breaches\" -- not that it expected the deal to close anytime soon.\nVerizon has a lot on its plate, which could be making investors nervous. In addition to the Yahoo deal, the company is also in the process of buying the fiber optic network of XO Communications. And it's selling its data center business to Equinix (EQIX).\nThere also have been rumors in the past few weeks that Verizon might even consider buying cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR).\nThat may be more than Verizon can realistically handle right now. But nothing may be off the table for Verizon given how competitive the wireless world is these days.\nAnything that could give Verizon a leg up on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile might be possible.\nRelated: Charter shares popped on report of possible Verizon takeover\nStill, it's worth noting that shares of AT&T are lower this year too, down about 5%. And Verizon and A&T have something in common that Sprint and T-Mobile lack -- Verizon and AT&T pay gigantic dividends.\nCompanies that have big dividend yields haven't fared as well since Donald Trump was elected. Investors are betting on a sizable stimulus package from him and the Republican Congress, which may be fueled in part by debt.\nThat's caused bond yields to rise -- and that makes shares of big dividend payers like Verizon a lot less attractive.\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates a few times this year too. That could push bond yields even higher.\nSo Verizon faces many big challenges that could hurt its stock this year.\nThat's why Verizon, nicknamed Big Red because of its logo's crimson hue, may see its stock in the red for the foreseeable future.",
            "TextMagic AS 2025 6 months consolidated unaudited interim report. In the first half of 2025, revenue amounted to \u20ac7,115 thousand (H1 2024: \u20ac7,809 thousand). The decline was mainly due to a more competitive pricing strategy that was implemented on the Textmagic platform. EBITDA was \u20ac2,581 thousand (H1 2024: \u20ac3,149 thousand), and the operating loss totaled to \u20ac123 thousand (H1 2024: operating profit of \u20ac1,097 thousand). Profitability was negatively affected by an increase in amortization expenses of \u20ac652 thousand, resulting from the higher volume of development activities in previous periods with the goal of improving the value proposition.\nAlthough sales revenue has declined, we have seen growth in usage volumes since March on the Textmagic platform - in the second quarter of 2025, 7% more SMS messages were sent than in the same period last year. Acquiring new customers in the US market has become more difficult due to regulations, while in the UK and Australia we are seeing a growth trend in new users.\nSince 2024, Textmagic platform's development has focused on expanding the product\u2019s value proposition by adding features and communicaton channels that support business interactions. In the first quarter of 2025, the rapid development pace slowed down, because the team was downsized to optimize development activities and improve cost efficiency.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, new communication channels were added to the Textmagic platform, including Business Instagram and Facebook Messenger, allowing users to manage a wide range of customer inquiries and information exchanges in a single environment. In June, we launched an email campaign feature to offer our clients a more comprehensive solution for marketing and customer communication in addition to SMS. Email functionality opens up new opportunities to expand the customer base.\nGroup unaudited key figures\n2025 H1 | 2024 H1 |\nRevenue | \u20ac7.12 M | \u20ac7.81 M |\nEBITDA | \u20ac2.58 M | \u20ac3.15 M |\nOperating profit (loss) | -\u20ac0.12 M | \u20ac1.10 M |\nOperating profit decreased due to a decline in sales revenue and an increase in the amortization of intangible assets. The increase in depreciation was due to higher capitalized development costs in recent years. Labor and operating expenses decreased in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The EBITDA margin was 36% (H1 2024: 40%), confirming that the company's cash flow from operating activities remains strong.\nTextmagic SMS platform\u2019s sales results\n2025 H1 | 2024 H1 | Change |\nUnaudited revenue (thousand) | \u20ac6,804 | \u20ac7,490 | -9 % |\nVolume of SMS messages (thousand pcs) | 125,913 | 127,046 | -1 % |\nActive users* | 21,307 | 23,499 | -9 % |\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU, 6 months)** | \u20ac319 | \u20ac319 | 0 % |\n* An active user is any unique paying customer who has used Textmagic SMS platform services during the reporting period.\n**ARPU is calculated by dividing unaudited revenue by the number of active users.\nDespite the recovery in usage volumes, revenue has still decreased due to various factors. The main impact comes from offering less expensive plans and free usage options. U.S. regulations remain a significant reason for the decline, as they restrict mass messaging for unregistered marketing campaigns. Additionally, revenue has been affected by currency exchange rates, as well as customers\u2019 financial situations and price sensitivity.\nTextMagic AS\u2019s consolidated unaudited interim report for the 6 months of 2025 is attached to the release in PDF format.\nAdditional information:\nGetter Gr\u00fcnmann\nTextMagic AS, CFO\ninvestor@textmagic.biz\nhttps://investor.textmagic.com/\nCONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 6 MONTHS OF 2025\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(in thousands of euros) | 30.06.2025\n| 31.12.2024\n| 30.06.2024\n| 31.12.2023\n|\nNon-current assets |\nProperty, plant and equipment | 483 | 581 | 102 | 105 |\nIntangible assets and goodwill | 31,941 | 32,972 | 32,921 | 32,854 |\nTotal non-current assets | 32,424 | 33,553 | 33 023 | 32 959 |\nCurrent assets |\nTrade and other receivables | 20 | 22 | 90 | 24 |\nPrepayments | 184 | 165 | 200 | 231 |\nFinancial Investments | 0 | 0 | 3,500 | 2,500 |\nCash and cash equivalents | 4,060 | 3,432 | 4,229 | 3,900 |\nTotal current assets | 4,264 | 3,619 | 8,019 | 6,655 |\nTOTAL ASSETS | 36,688 | 37,172 | 41,042 | 39,614 |\nCurrent Liabilities |\nCurrent tax liabilities | 215 | 270 | 411 | 232 |\nTrade and other payables | 734 | 913 | 882 | 791 |\nLease liabilities | 115 | 107 | 0 | 0 |\nContract liabilities | 1,506 | 1,669 | 1,668 | 1,659 |\nOther provisions | 338 | 384 | 679 | 1,117 |\nTotal current liabilities | 2,908 | 3,343 | 3,640 | 3,799 |\nLong-Term Liabilities |\nLease liabilities | 250 | 309 | 0 | 0 |\nTotal long-term liabilities | 250 | 309 | 0 | 0 |\nTotal liabilities | 3,158 | 3,652 | 3,640 | 3,799 |\nEquity |\nShare capital | 861 | 850 | 33,575 | 850 |\nShare premium | 141 | 141 | 141 | 51,242 |\nReserve capital | 85 | 85 | 85 | 85 |\nVoluntary reserve | 27,710 | 27,710 | 0 | 0 |\nOther reserve | 376 | 1,235 | 2,360 | 2,035 |\nForeign currency reserve | (27) | (35) | (13) | (21) |\nRetained earnings | 4,384 | 3,534 | 1,254 | (18,376) |\nEquity attributable to owners of the parent | 33,530 | 33,520 | 37,402 | 35,815 |\nTotal equity | 33,530 | 33,520 | 37,402 | 35,815 |\nTOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES | 36,688 | 37,172 | 41,042 | 39,614 |\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in thousands of euros) | 01.01.2025-30.06.2025\n| 01.01.2024-30.06.2024\n|\nRevenue | 7,115 | 7,809 |\nOther income | 63 | 59 |\nGoods, raw materials and services | (2,544) | (2,396) |\nOther operating expenses | (715) | (1,050) |\nWork performed by the entity and capitalized | 1,311 | 2,083 |\nEmployee expenses | (2,649) | (3,346) |\nDepreciation, amortization and impairment of non-current assets | (2,704) | (2,052) |\nOther expenses | 0 | (10) |\nOperating profit (loss) | (123) | 1,097 |\nFinancial Income | 38 | 152 |\nProfit (loss) before tax | (85) | 1,249 |\nIncome tax | (8) | (4) |\nProfit (loss) for the period | (93) | 1,245 |\nOther comprehensive income\n| |\nItems that are or may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss |\nForeign currency translation differences | 8 | 8 |\nOther comprehensive income for the period, net of tax | (85) | 1,253 |\nTotal comprehensive income for the period | (85) | 1,253 |\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousand euros) | 01.01.2025 -

            "Michel Martin. Michel Martin\nMichel Martin is the weekend host of All Things Considered, where she draws on her deep reporting and interviewing experience to dig in to the week's news. Outside the studio, she has also hosted \"Michel Martin: Going There,\" an ambitious live event series in collaboration with Member Stations.\nMartin came to NPR in 2006 and launched Tell Me More, a one-hour daily NPR news and talk show that aired on NPR stations nationwide from 2007-2014 and dipped into thousands of important conversations taking place in the corridors of power, but also in houses of worship, and barber shops and beauty shops, at PTA meetings, town halls, and at the kitchen table.\nShe has spent more than 25 years as a journalist \u2014 first in print with major newspapers and then in television. Tell Me More marked her debut as a full-time public radio show host. Martin says, \"What makes public radio special is that it's got both intimacy and reach all at once. For the cost of a phone call, I can take you around the world. But I'm right there with you in your car, in your living room or kitchen or office, in your iPod. Radio itself is an incredible tool and when you combine that with the global resources of NPR plus the commitment to quality, responsibility and civility, it's an unbeatable combination.\"\nMartin has also served as contributor and substitute host for NPR newsmagazines and talk shows, including Talk of the Nation and News & Notes.\nMartin joined NPR from ABC News, where she worked since 1992. She served as correspondent for Nightline from 1996 to 2006, reporting on such subjects as the congressional budget battles, the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa, racial profiling and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. At ABC, she also contributed to numerous programs and specials, including the network's award-winning coverage of Sept. 11, a documentary on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, a critically acclaimed AIDS special and reports for the ongoing series \"America in Black and White.\" Martin reported for the ABC newsmagazine Day One, winning an Emmy for her coverage of the international campaign to ban the use of landmines, and was a regular panelist on This Week with George Stephanopoulos. She also hosted the 13-episode series Life 360, an innovative program partnership between Oregon Public Broadcasting and Nightline incorporating documentary film, performance and personal narrative; it aired on public television stations across the country.\nBefore joining ABC, Martin covered state and local politics for the Washington Post and national politics and policy at the Wall Street Journal, where she was White House correspondent. She has also been a regular panelist on the PBS series Washington Week and a contributor to NOW with Bill Moyers.\nMartin has been honored by numerous organizations, including the Candace Award for Communications from The National Coalition of 100 Black Women, the Joan Barone Award for Excellence in Washington-based National Affairs/Public Policy Broadcasting from the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association and a 2002 Silver Gavel Award, given by the American Bar Association.

India PR Distribution\nDubai [UAE], July 8: On July 4th, held at the elegant Marriott Al Jaddaf, Dubai. With its international debut, MOVe made one thing clear -- this is not just another fashion show,it is a movement. Curated by Emirates Holding Group in collaboration with MOVe Events and supported by Rose Merc Ltd, the three-part celebration brought together global fashion powerhouses, visionary entrepreneurs, and the most dynamic names in real estate under one 100f.\nIn a world where most fashion events chase glamour, Eternal Runway stood out by championing inclusivity, age diversity, and sustainability -- all without compromising on style or substance. One of the most talked-about segments of the evening featured senior models (aged 50 and above) owning the runway with grace and confidence. This conscious decision was aimed at redefining beauty standards and proving that fashion is truly ageless. In another standout moment, a designer presented collections made from pre-loved denims and upcycled fabrics, making a strong case for sustainable fashion without losing aesthetic appeal.\nThe invite-only audience; an elite mix of fashion buyers, bloggers, influencers, and press, was deeply moved by the message and the medium alike.

Whether you\u2019re spinning for fun or chasing massive jackpots, the slot machine variety is endless.\nIf you prefer strategy and skill over pure luck, table games offer a more traditional casino experience.

These games often come with multiple variants, such as European vs. American roulette or multi-hand blackjack, giving you more ways to play.\nTable games typically use RNG (Random Number Generator) software to ensure fairness and simulate realistic gameplay.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of the best casino bonuses available to Florida players in 2025.\nWelcome bonuses are the first rewards you\u2019ll see when joining a Florida online casino. These typically come in the form of deposit match offers, free spins, or both. For example, an offer like \u201c200% up to $5,000 + 100 free spins\u201d means the casino triples your deposit, giving you extra funds to start with. Free spins are often tied to popular slots, such as Big Bass Bonanza or Gates of Olympus.\nSome FL casinos split welcome packages across your first few deposits to keep you engaged. Be sure to check wagering requirements, as these determine how many times you must bet your bonus before withdrawing winnings.\nCashback bonuses serve as a safety net for players, refunding a percentage of their losses over a specified period, typically on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

These often include higher match percentages, faster payouts, and lower wagering requirements.

Some sites also waive deposit fees for crypto payments.\nReload bonuses target existing players, offering perks like \u201c50% Reload Wednesdays\u201d to encourage repeat deposits. They\u2019re a handy way to boost your bankroll midweek or before a gaming session.\nTogether, crypto and reload bonuses keep the rewards coming even after your welcome offer has expired.\nFrequent players can unlock big rewards through loyalty or VIP programs.

High rollers and frequent players in Florida benefit the most, with perks such as custom crypto bonuses and luxury giveaways at top casinos like Lucky Block and Instant Casino.\nGetting the most out of your casino bonuses isn\u2019t just about grabbing the biggest offer; it\u2019s about imaginative play. Here are some expert tips for Florida players looking to stretch every bonus dollar with the correct promo code :\nBy combining bonuses wisely with disciplined bankroll management, you can turn promotional perks into lasting gains.\nGetting started at a Florida-friendly online casino is a simple process that takes just a few minutes. Whether you\u2019re playing from your smartphone or desktop, follow these five steps to create your account and begin playing real money games safely and securely.\nStart by choosing a reputable online casino that accepts players from Florida. Look for platforms that hold international licenses (such as those from Cura\u00e7ao or Malta), offer a wide range of real-money games, and support secure payment options like cryptocurrencies and e-wallets. Top choices, such as Instant Casino, Lucky Block, and Golden Panda, offer substantial welcome bonuses and fast payouts, making them ideal starting points.\nOnce you\u2019ve selected a casino, click the \u201cSign Up\u201d, \u201cJoin Now\u201d, or \u201cRegister\u201d button, usually found at the top of the homepage. Fill in the registration form with your:\nBe sure to provide accurate information, as you\u2019ll need to verify your identity later for withdrawals.\nNext, choose a unique username and a strong password that includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Some casinos may also ask you to set a PIN or select a security question. Using a password manager can help keep your login credentials safe and secure.\nAfter submitting your registration, you\u2019ll receive a confirmation email. Click the link to activate your account. Then, go to the Cashier or Deposit section to fund your account. Choose a payment method, such as Bitcoin, Visa, or Skrill, enter your deposit amount, and complete the transaction. Don\u2019t forget to claim your welcome bonus during this step by entering any promo code or opting in.\nWith your account active and balance loaded, you can now explore thousands of games, including slots, table games, and live dealer options from your home in Florida. Most platforms also offer demo versions, so if you\u2019re new to online casinos, test out a few games for free before playing with real cash.\nOne of the most important aspects of any online casino is how easily you can deposit and withdraw your money. Florida-friendly online casinos offer a variety of secure, fast, and flexible payment methods to suit every player\u2019s preferences. Whether you prefer traditional banking or cutting-edge crypto, there\u2019s a method that fits your needs. Below, we break down the most common and reliable options available to Florida casino players in 2025.\nCredit and debit cards, such as Visa and Mastercard, remain among the most widely accepted and user-friendly payment methods at online casinos. They\u2019re ideal for players who prefer familiar and straightforward banking options. To deposit, enter your card details, select the amount, and confirm the transaction. Most deposits are instant, and many casinos also accept cards for withdrawals. However, the processing times for cashouts can take 2\u20135 business days.\nOne downside is that some U.S. banks may block gambling-related transactions, even with offshore casinos. Still, many Florida players find card payments to be a convenient and secure choice for funding their accounts.\nE-wallets like Skrill and Neteller are popular for their speed, ease of use, and extra layer of privacy. When you use an e-wallet, your banking details stay hidden from the casino, making it a safer option for players who prioritise security. Deposits are instant, and withdrawals are typically completed within 24 hours or less, depending on the platform.\nSome casinos also offer exclusive e-wallet promotions, and VIP players may enjoy faster withdrawal limits. The only potential drawback is that some casinos exclude e-wallet deposits from welcome bonuses, so it\u2019s essential to double-check the terms before choosing this method.\nCryptocurrencies have become the preferred choice for many Florida online casino players, thanks to their lightning-fast transaction speeds, minimal fees, and anonymous nature of play. Top platforms like Lucky Block and Fast Slots are crypto-first casinos, supporting a wide range of coins, including:\nCrypto deposits are typically processed within minutes, and payouts are often even faster, frequently occurring instantly. You\u2019ll also find higher deposit limits, lower fees, and in some cases, special crypto-only bonuses. If you already use a crypto wallet or exchange, this is hands-down one of the best payment methods for Florida casino players in 2025.\nPrepaid methods, such as Paysafecard, Neosurf, and even Visa gift cards, offer a convenient and budget-friendly way to fund your casino account without requiring a bank connection. These are especially useful if you want to control spending or avoid linking your personal bank account to a gambling site.\nTo deposit with a prepaid card or voucher, enter the code during checkout. However, it\u2019s important to note that withdrawals are not possible via this method; you\u2019ll need to choose another option, such as bank transfer or crypto, to cash out your winnings.\nBank transfers are a traditional but reliable option, especially for larger withdrawals or high-stakes players. While not as fast as crypto or e-wallets, bank transfers are widely available and trusted for their security.\nMost casinos require ID verification before processing a bank withdrawal, and it can take 3\u20137 business days for funds to reach your account. Fees may apply depending on the bank or intermediary used. Despite the slower speed, many Florida players still prefer bank wires for their straightforward, no-limit nature.\nWhile online gambling can be an exciting and enjoyable form of entertainment, it\u2019s essential to stay in control. Florida online casinos and offshore casino sites, along with several nonprofit organisations and state agencies, offer a range of tools and support services to promote responsible gambling. Whether you\u2019re just starting or you\u2019ve noticed changes in your gambling habits, the resources below are designed to help you maintain a healthy relationship with gaming.\nFlorida residents have access to several helplines and counselling services that specialise in gambling addiction and support. The most prominent resource is the:\nThis confidential, 24/7 helpline connects individuals with licensed therapists, local support groups, financial counselling, and crisis intervention. Services are available in English, Spanish, and Creole. You can also chat live or text for immediate help.\nNational support is also available through:\nThese services are free, confidential, and open to all Florida residents.\nFlorida online casinos offer several tools to help you stay in control of your gambling. In your account or responsible gaming settings, you can set deposit, loss, wagering, and session time limits. These limits are usually locked for a set period, and increasing them may trigger a cool-down window.\nIf you need a longer break, self-exclusion programs let you block yourself from the site for anywhere from 24 hours to permanently. Third-party apps like Gamban and BetBlocker can also block access to gambling sites across all your devices.\nIt\u2019s also important to watch for signs of gambling addiction, such as chasing losses, lying about gambling, neglecting responsibilities, or borrowing money to keep playing. If you notice these behaviors in yourself or someone else, contact 1-888-ADMIT-IT or a licensed professional for help.\nFlorida\u2019s online casino scene in 2025 is thriving, offering players a wealth of real-money gaming options, generous bonuses, and secure platforms to enjoy from anywhere in the state. Top-rated sites like Instant Casino and Lucky Block lead the pack with lightning-fast payouts, extensive game libraries, and crypto-friendly payment systems that set them apart. Whether you\u2019re a casual spinner or a seasoned high roller, these platforms deliver exceptional value, entertainment, and reliability.\nJust remember, gambling should always be fun and controlled. Use deposit limits, explore bonuses wisely, and take advantage of the responsible gaming tools available if needed. With the right approach, you can enjoy the excitement of Florida\u2019s online casinos while staying safe and in control.\nCurrently, real money online casinos are not legal or regulated within Florida. However, many players in Florida choose to play at reputable offshore online casinos, which are licensed in other jurisdictions and accept U.S. players. These offshore sites provide a safe and accessible way to enjoy real money casino games while the state continues to debate local legalization.\nSince real money online casinos are not regulated in Florida, many residents turn to social and sweepstakes casinos, which use virtual currencies and offer the chance to win cash prizes under U.S. sweepstakes laws. However, another popular option for Florida players is using reputable offshore online casinos. These sites are licensed in other jurisdictions, accept U.S. players, and offer a full real money casino experience, providing more variety and higher stakes than sweepstakes platforms.\nYes, it is legal to play free casino games in Florida through social casinos, which use virtual credits for slots, blackjack, and more. However, players who want a full real-money experience often choose reputable offshore online casinos instead, as these sites offer real stakes, bigger rewards, and a wider variety of games while remaining accessible to Florida residents.\nOffshore online casinos that accept Florida players support a wide range of secure payment methods. Most offer options like credit and debit cards, e-wallets, bank transfers, and increasingly, cryptocurrencies for fast and private transactions. These sites typically provide transparent terms and reliable withdrawals.\nYes, gambling winnings are subject to federal taxes, even if they come from social casinos or sweepstakes sites. If your winnings exceed reporting thresholds, you may receive IRS tax forms. Florida does not impose a state income tax, but all gambling income must still be reported on federal tax returns. This includes money won from free casino games that result in cash prizes.\nTo maintain balance while engaging with FL online casinos or social casino sites, players should utilize tools such as deposit limits, session reminders, and self-exclusion. Understanding the difference between legal online casino options and unregulated platforms helps reduce risk. Responsible play also means setting time and budget boundaries, especially important in states like Florida, where full online gambling regulation is still evolving."
